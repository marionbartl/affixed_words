Our beloved pets ... they provide us with warmth , companionship and unconditional love every day of their lives .
When they inevitably pass on to their final reward , the hurt can be inconsolable .
Would n't it be nice if you could keep your dearly departed dog or cat with you ... close to your heart and not just IN it ?
Now , it can be done .
Lidy of Japan makes " memoria " for deceased pets that take various forms including memorial keepsake boxes , miniature pendant urns for their ashes , and the ultimate tribute to lost love , golden - toned diamond jewelry created from their carbonized remains .
The canine , feline , porcine or piscine ( hey , a pet 's a pet ) gem is then mounted in an attractive precious metal ring or pendant setting , placed in a lovely gift box and presented to you with a certificate of authenticity .
Diamonds , as we all know , are simply one form of the element Carbon .
When treated with a tremendous amount of heat and pressure , the carbon in The Loved One 's remains is transformed into a diamond with a warm , golden glow .
How many joules does it take to make these jewels ?
Well , that seems to be a trade secret but Lidy has refined the process to the point where they can offer gem-cut " doggy diamonds " for rings and pendants in sizes ranging from 1/10 carat to a full 1 carat .
Plus , Lidy 's in - house creative team provides a stunning selection of attractive and appealing settings to showcase your petrified pal in all their glory .
The Many Facets of Spot ... yours for between 298,000 yen and 1,994,000 yen , or around $ 2,850 to $ 19,000 in US greenbacks .
That 's a lotta Fi-dough !
For some pet owners , however , the expense is well worth it .
Although the time they spend with us is all too short , in their crystalline afterlives our pets will last as long as the Earth itself .

Instead of a silver bullet to kill cancer cells , USC biologists discover a way to protect all other cells against chemotherapy ; experts call the animal study a major advance in cancer research
Fasting for two days protects healthy cells against chemotherapy , according to a study appearing online the week of Mar. 31 in PNAS Early Edition .
Mice given a high dose of chemotherapy after fasting continued to thrive .
The same dose killed half the normally fed mice and caused lasting weight and energy loss in the survivors .
The chemotherapy worked as intended on cancer , extending the lifespan of mice injected with aggressive human tumors , reported a group led by Valter Longo of the University of Southern California .
Test tube experiments with human cells confirmed the differential resistance of normal and cancer cells to chemotherapy after a short period of starvation .
Making chemotherapy more selective has been a top cancer research goal for decades .
Oncologists could control cancers much better , and even cure some , if chemotherapy were not so toxic to the rest of the body .
Experts described the study as one of a kind .
" This is a very important paper .
It defines a novel concept in cancer biology , " said cancer researcher Pinchas Cohen , professor and chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of California , Los Angeles .
" In theory , it opens up new treatment approaches that will allow higher doses of chemotherapy .
It 's a direction that 's worth pursuing in clinical trials in humans . "
Felipe Sierra , director of the Biology of Aging Program at the National Institute on Aging , said : " This is not just one more anti-cancer treatment that attacks the cancer cells .
To me , that 's an important conceptual difference . "
Sierra was referring to decades of efforts by thousands of researchers working on " targeted delivery " of drugs to cancer cells .
Study leader Longo focused instead on protecting all the other cells .
Sierra added that progress in cancer care has made patients more resilient and able to tolerate fasting , should clinical trials confirm its usefulness .
" We have passed the stage where patients arrive at the clinic in an emaciated state .
Not eating for two days is not the end of the world , " Sierra said .
" This could have applicability in maybe a majority of patients , " said David Quinn , a practicing oncologist and medical director of USC Norris Hospital and Clinics .
He predicted that many oncology groups would be eager to test the Longo group 's findings , and advised patients to look for a clinical trial near home .
Longo , an anti-aging researcher who holds joint appointments in gerontology and biological sciences at USC , said that the idea of protecting healthy cells from chemotherapy may have seemed impractical to cancer researchers , because the body has many different cells that respond differently to many drugs .
" It was almost like an idea that was not even worth pursuing .
In fact it had to come from the anti-aging field , because that 's what we focus on : protecting all cells at once , " Longo said .
" What really was missing was a perspective of someone from the aging field to give this field a boost , " UCLA 's Cohen said .
The idea for the study came from the Longo group 's previous research on aging in cellular systems , primarily lowly baker 's yeast .
About five years ago , Longo was thinking about the genetic pathways involved both in the starvation response and in mammalian tumors .
When the pathways are silenced , starved cells go into what Longo calls a maintenance mode characterized by extreme resistance to stresses .
In essence the cells are waiting out the lean period , much like hibernating animals .
But tumors by definition disobey orders to stop growing because the same genetic pathways are stuck in an " on " mode .
That could mean , Longo realized , that the starvation response might differentiate normal and cancer cells by their stress resistance , and that healthy cells might withstand much more chemotherapy than cancer cells .
The shield for healthy cells does not need to be perfect , Longo said .
What matters is the difference in stress resistance between healthy and cancerous cells .
During the study , conducted both at USC and in the laboratory of Lizzia Raffaghello at Gaslini Children 's Hospital in Genoa , Italy , the researchers found that current chemotherapy drugs kill as many healthy mammalian cells as cancer cells .
" ( But ) we reached a two to five - fold difference between normal and cancer cells , including human cells in culture .
More importantly , we consistently showed that mice were highly protected while cancer cells remained sensitive , " Longo said .
If healthy human cells were just twice as resistant as cancer cells , oncologists could increase the dose or frequency of chemotherapy .
" We were able to reach a 1,000 - fold differential resistance using a tumor model in baker 's yeast .
If we get to just a 10 - 20 fold differential toxicity with human metastatic cancers , all of a sudden it's a completely different game against cancer , " Longo said .
" Now we need to spend a lot of time talking to clinical oncologists to decide how to best proceed in the human studies . "
Edith Gralla , a research professor of chemistry at UCLA , said : " It is the sort of opposite of the magic bullet .
It 's the magic shield . "
###
Funding from the study came from NIA ( part of the National Institutes on Health ) , the USC Norris Cancer Center and the Associazione Italiana per la Lotta al Neuroblastoma .
USC graduate student Changhan Lee and Gaslini's Raffaghello performed key experiments .
The other authors were Fernando Safdie , Min Wei and Federica Madia of USC , and Giovanna Bianchi of Gaslini .
Longo has been studying aging at the cellular level for 15 years , and has published in the nation 's leading scientific journals .
He is the Albert L. and Madelyne G. Hanson Family Trust Associate Professor in the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology with joint appointments as associate professor of biological sciences in the USC College of Letters , Arts and Sciences , and in the Norris Cancer Center .
FOR CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS
Fasting before chemotherapy has unknown risks and benefits for humans , Longo cautioned .
Only clinical trials can establish the effectiveness and safety of fasting before chemotherapy .
" Do n't try and do this at home .
We need to do the studies , " said Quinn , the USC Norris oncologist .

Two years ago Winter was the dolphin that could not swim .
Instead of powering through the water with a flick of her tail , the bottlenose
could barely waggle from side to side .
She had lost her tail in a crab trap at just two months old and was found floating in distress off the coast of Florida .
Scroll down for more ...
The world 's first bionic sea creature :
Winter now swims and splashes around like any normal dolphin
Rescuers got her to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida where staff fought to save her life .
Winter survived but there was a problem … where her tail should have been there was only a stump .
Scroll down for more ...
Winter lost her own tail in a crab trap
Aquarium director David Yates said : " She had to learn how to swim without a tail , which no dolphin has ever done in captivity .
" We did n't know if she could do that .
But vets feared her waggling might damage her spine .
Scroll down for more ...
The prosthetic tail , which moves along with the dolphin's full spine
Their solution was an artificial tail and Kevin Carroll , who has designed prosthetics for dogs , an ostrich , and even a duck , offered his services .
" I came straight down , saw Winter and felt really sorry for her , " he said .
" I said , ' OK , we 'll fit her little tail .
Not a big deal ' .
" Little did I know it was going to take a year and a half .
He added : " With a person , when we fit a socket we have one long , solid bone .
We do n't have to have the socket moving in every direction .

Winter had to learn to swim without a tail
With a dolphin , it needs to move along with her full spine .
But the months of work were worth it .
When Winter was finally fitted with a 30in silicone and plastic tail she was a
dolphin transformed .
She may never be the most elegant dolphin who ever swam but , as she splashes about in the aquarium , it is safe to say that she probably does n't care .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If filling your tank with $ 3.60 a gallon gas is a serious economic hardship , ask yourself this :
What if you did n't have a tank to fill up ?
Wendy Mitchell of Middlebury , Vt. is a single mom who moved there from Florida in 2006 looking for better schools .
Within months , she said , her Chevrolet Blazer blew a rod and , without a job or much savings , she was left without a car at the beginning of a rural New England winter .
" I was totally devastated , " she said .
Despite car - ownership costs , including insurance , repairs and fuel , the majority of even the poorest Americans own cars , according to U.S. Census data - and for good reason .
In this country , life without one can be difficult at best and unmanageable at worst .
Even cities with solid public transportation networks are set up to do one thing well : move people in and out of central business districts .
" It takes a long time if you are n't doing exactly that , " said Margy Waller , executive director of the policy research group Mobility Agenda .
And these days , she pointed out , the best jobs usually are n't in the center of the city .
Cars and kids
Employers cite transportation problems as the second - most common reason for losing entry - level workers , said Waller .
The number one problem is child care .
" By giving them a car , we take care of both , " said Martin Schwartz who runs Vehicles for Change , a non-profit group that provides donated used cars to carefully screened applicants in Maryland and Virginia .
The cars are n't free .
They cost recipients about $ 900 to $ 1,200 , but that 's still much less than retail value , and they come with a six - month warranty .
Vehicles for Change is one of about 150 non-profits around the country that provide low - cost used cars to the needy , according to Opportunity Cars , a national network of such groups .
Good News Garage is another group .
Operating in four New England states , it found and fixed up a 1996 Honda Accord for Mitchell .
" I cried that day , " Mitchell said of getting her car .
It now takes her about 30 minutes instead of more than an hour , she said , to get to her $ 8 an hour part - time job at the Boys and Girls Club of America .
And now she can do something with her kids , she said , other than leave them at home once she manages to get them there , which she used to do on foot or by hitching rides .
A measurable impact
The groups say their work really makes people 's lives better , and does n't just give them an easier way around .
Good News
Garage cites data from an informal survey of its clients conducted by a local graduate student .
According to the survey , 61 % of Vermonters who had received cars from Good News Garage said they reduced their dependence on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families , a federal aid program , as a direct result of having a car .
More than half said they had stopped using TANF altogether .
And 60 percent of Good News Garage customers said they had gotten a job because they had a car , while 83 % said they were able to keep a job because of it .
Lifting a burden - or adding a new one ?
Some urban experts say these programs seem like they 're helping needy individuals , but really they 're just saddling them with the added costs of car ownership .
" The cost of urban sprawl has come to roost on working households and low - income households , " said Scott Bernstein of the Center for Neighborhood Technology in Chicago .
A better solution , he suggested , would be improving mass transit and giving businesses more incentives to move nearer to transit lines - or to provide their own commuting services .
" I 'm not saying anybody should denied something , " said Bernstein , " but lets face it , there 's nothing fictitious about the gas price crisis . "
Another short - term solution , he said , is to provide shared cars rather than helping individuals to own cars .
The CNT operates one such service in Chicago - i Go car sharing - that allows members to use a car for $ 6 to $ 8 an hour .
There are similar not - for - profit services in Philadelphia , San Francisco and a few other U.S. and Canadian cities .
But , for many individuals , there is n't much alternative to simply owning a car , even in big cities , car - ownership advocates say .
Philip Schools , a recovering drug addict , lives near Baltimore and works at a Home Depot .
He said used to spend up to six hours a day simply getting to work and back on mass transit .
Getting a used Buick from Vehicles for Change cut his commute to a half hour each way and has allowed him time , he said , to work on starting his own lawn maintenance business to earn more money .
Almost as important , said Schools , it has given him a sense of personal responsibility while giving him an opportunity to build a credit history .
" It 's not just about the vehicle , " he said , " It has other component parts .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A top official in the U.S. private security firm Blackwater said on Thursday it was too soon to pass judgment on the killing of 17 Iraqi civilians by its employees last September and urged critics to await an FBI report .
A man who was wounded in a shooting attack by the security guards of Blackwater firm on Sunday , is helped by his relatives in a hospital in Baghdad , September 20 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Ceerwan Aziz
The company , which has 800 to 900 private security guards operating in Iraq , came under fire over the incident at a New York University School of Law conference called “ Privatizing Defense : Blackwater , Contractors and American Security . ”
The September 16 killings by Blackwater security guards escorting a convoy in a central Baghdad square enraged Iraqis who complained private security firms had operated with impunity since the 2003 U.S. - led invasion .
An FBI investigation is under way but The New York Times has reported the bureau ’s agents found at least 14 of the shootings were unjustified .
It said the findings indicated the company ’s employees violated deadly force rules in effect for security contractors in Iraq .
Jeremy Scahill , author of “ Blackwater : The Rise of the World ’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army , ” told the conference a separate military investigation concluded all the deaths were the result of “ unjustified and unprovoked fire . ”
Asked about the incident , Blackwater Vice President Marty Strong said , “ I spent nine months in Iraq , it ’s a very difficult place . ”
“ Irrespective of The New York Times or any other newspaper saying they think they know what ’s going on , the FBI is going to complete an official investigation , not one done by the seat of the pants , ” said Strong , a panelist at the conference .
“ At that time we ’re going to find out exactly what they found out , ” he said , adding Blackwater had not conducted its own investigation so he could not comment further .
“ We ’re awaiting the government ’s investigation . ”
ACCOUNTABILITY
Several panelists at the conference said that despite efforts by the Defense and State Departments to improve oversight of private security contractors since the Blackwater incident , the industry was still lacking accountability .
Laura Dickinson , a professor at the University of Connecticut Law School whose forthcoming book “ Outsourcing War and Peace ” examines the privatization of military functions , said the Blackwater incident was a warning of the dangers in the growing use of private companies in conflict situations .
“ We need accountability if we ’re going to continue with privatization , ” Dickinson said .
Scott Horton , a lecturer at Colombia Law School , faulted the Justice Department for going “ AWOL ” and not taking any interest in enforcing the law .
He said in five years of war with an estimated 180,000 contractors working in Iraq , there had been only two or three prosecutions for any offenses .
“ What we ’re seeing now is an astonishing failure to enforce criminal law , ” Horton said .
He said the Defense Department had started to do more recently to hold its civilian contractors accountable , due partly to concerns expressed by soldiers in the field that impunity was undermining the U.S mission in Iraq .
Horton said Harper ’s magazine , to which he is a contributor , would be reporting this week on the case of a Canadian contractor in Iraq who was charged in March after a brawl involving a knife in what could be a test case for holding contractors accountable through military justice .

This tutorial focuses on CGI and FastCGI programming .
For more introductory information , see tutorials , blogs and research and discussion .
Introduction
This tutorial aims to get you started with writing web applications in Haskell .
We describe a relatively light - weight approach to Haskell web programming which uses a CGI library and an XHTML combinator library .
We think that while the approach we describe here is not as sophisticated or innovative as some other approaches , it is simple , portable and easy to understand if you are already familiar with web programming in other languages .
The tutorial starts with preliminaries such as how to install the necessary software and how to compile and run your web applications .
We then show a number of working small example programs which introduce the basic features of the CGI and XHtml libraries .
We then move on to how to use monad transformers to add application specific functionality such as sessions to the CGI monad , and how to create database - driven web applications .
We also present FastCGI , and an approach to using dynamically loaded Haskell code .
Assumed knowledge
This tutorial is not meant as an introduction to Haskell or web programming .
We will assume that you have some familiarity with the following concepts :
We assume knowledge of the following :
Haskell :
This tutorial is not meant as a first introduction to Haskell .
If you want to learn about Haskell in general , have a look at the lists of books and tutorials .
You may want to start with Haskell in 5 steps .
( X) HTML : HTML ( HyperText Markup Language ) is the " the lingua franca for publishing hypertext on the World Wide Web .
The XHtml library which we use in this tutorial produces XHTML 1.0 , which is HTML 4.0 formulated as XML .
The combinators in the XHtml library do not make much sense unless you understand at least some parts of HTML .
CGI : CGI ( Common Gateway Interface ) programs are programs which run on the web server .
They are given input which comes from the user 's browser , and their output is given to the browser .
To really understand how the CGI library works , you probably need to know a thing or two about CGI .
( Tutorial . )
Required software
GHC , the Glasgow Haskell Compiler , is the Haskell implementation that we will use in this tutorial .
However , any Haskell implementation that supports Haskell98 and multi- parameter type classes should work .
xhtml :
This package provides combinators for producing XHTML 1.0 , including the Strict , Transitional and Frameset variants .
Download here .
cgi :
This is a Haskell library for writing CGI programs .

A web server :
You need to have access to a web server on which you can run CGI programs .
The most convenient way to do this when learning and developing is to run a web server on your development machine .
If you run the programs on some other machine you need to make sure that you compile your programs so that they can run on that machine .
This normally means that the machines must to have the same architecture and run the same operating system .
Compiling and running web applications
Use GHC to produce a binary executable called prog.cgi from the Haskell source code file prog.hs :
ghc -- make -o prog.cgi prog.hs
Put the compiled program in the cgi-bin directory , or give it the extension .cgi , depending on the configuration of the web server .
Linking your applications statically will avoid problems with missing libraries on the web server .
To run the compiled program , visit the URL of the CGI program with your web browser .
Hello World !
Here is a very simple example which just outputs some static HTML .
The type signatures in this code are optional .
We show them here for clarity , but omit them in some later examples .
import Network .CGI import Text .XHtml page :: Html page = body << h1 << " Hello World ! " cgiMain :: CGI CGIResult cgiMain = output $ renderHtml page main :: IO ( ) main = runCGI $ handleErrors cgiMain
The page function constructs an HTML document which consists of a body containing a single header element which contains the text " Hello World " .
The CGI - action cgiMain renders the HTML document as a string , and produces that string as output .
The main function runs cgiMain , using the normal CGI protocol for input and output .
It also uses handleErrors to output an error page in case cgiMain throws an exception .
Fans of one - liners may like this version better ( handleErrors has been omitted since this simple program will not throw any exceptions ) :
import Text .XHtml import Network .CGI main = runCGI . output .
renderHtml $ body << h1 << " Hello World ! "
These are some of the important functions used in this example :
-- creates a string containing the HTML document .
renderHtml :: Html ->
String -- outputs a string as the body of the HTTP response .
output :: String -> CGI CGIResult --
Catches any exception thrown by the given CGI action , returns an -- error page with a 500 Internal Server Error , showing the exception -- information , and logs the error .
handleErrors :: CGI CGIResult -> CGI CGIResult --
Runs a CGI action which produces a CGIResult , using the CGI protocol -- to get the inputs and send the outputs .
runCGI :: CGI CGIResult -> IO ()
HTML combinators
See also [ 1 ] .
Html is the type of HTML fragments .
It comes from the Text .
XHtml module .
There are functions for all XHTML 1.0 elements .
Some examples :
header , body
h1 , h2 , ...
thediv
p
image
The << operator is used for nesting HTML .
+++ concatenates HTML .
Attributes are added to tags using the ! operator .
The function renderHtml ( FIXME : explain variants ) produces a string containing the document .
Getting user input
This program shows a form which asks the user for her name .
When the form is submitted , the program greets the user by name .
import Network.CGI import Text.XHtml inputForm = form << [ paragraph << ( " My name is " +++ textfield " name " ) , submit " " " Submit " ] greet n = paragraph << ( " Hello " ++ n ++ " ! " ) page t b = header << thetitle << t +++ body << b cgiMain = do mn <- getInput " name " let x = maybe inputForm greet mn output .
renderHtml $ page " Input example " x main = runCGI $ handleErrors cgiMain
This code makes use of the getInput function from the CGI library :
--
Get the value of an input variable , for example from a form . --
If the variable has multiple values , the first one is returned .
getInput :: String -> CGI ( Maybe String )
Cookies
import Network .CGI import Text .XHtml import Control .
Monad ( liftM ) import Data .
Maybe ( fromMaybe ) hello :: Int ->
Html hello 0 = h1 << " Welcome ! " +++ p << " This is the first time I see you . " hello c = h1 << " Welcome back ! " +++ p << ( " I have seen you " ++ show c ++ " times before . " ) page :: String -> Html ->
Html page t b = header << thetitle << t +++ body << b cgiMain :: CGI CGIResult cgiMain = do c <- liftM ( fromMaybe 0 ) $ readCookie " mycookie " setCookie ( newCookie " mycookie " ( show ( c + 1 ) ) ) output .
renderHtml . page " Cookie example " $ hello c main :: IO ( ) main = runCGI $ handleErrors cgiMain
Here we use newCookie , setCookie and readCookie to store and retrieve a counter cookie in the browser .
If you want to get the string value of a cookie , use getCookie instead of readCookie .
File uploads
FIXME : use a safer example
-- Accepts file uploads and saves the files in the given directory .
-- WARNING : this script is a SECURITY RISK and only for -- demo purposes .
Do not put it on a public web server .
import Network .CGI import Text .XHtml import qualified Data.
ByteString .
Lazy as BS import Control .
Monad ( liftM ) import Data .
Maybe ( fromJust ) uploadDir = " ../ upload " fileForm = form ! [ method " post " , enctype " multipart/form - data " ] << [ afile " file " , submit " " " Upload " ] save File n = do cont <- liftM fromJust $ getInputFPS " file " let f = uploadDir ++ " / " ++ basename n liftIO $ BS .
write
File f cont return $ paragraph << ( " Saved as " +++ anchor ! [ href f ] << f +++ " . " ) page t b = header << thetitle << t +++ body << b basename = reverse .
takeWhile ( ` notElem ` " / \\ " ) .
reverse cgiMain = do mn <- getInputFilename " file " h <- maybe ( return fileForm ) save
File mn output .
renderHtml $ page " Upload example " h main = runCGI $ handleErrors cgiMain
We first output a file upload form , which should use the HTTP POST method , and the multipart / form - data content type .
Here we seen an example of the use of HTML attributes , added with the ! operator .
For efficiency reasons , we use Data .
ByteString .
Lazy to represent the file contents .
getInputFPS gets the value of an input variable as a lazy ByteString .
Error handling
handleErrors catches all exceptions and outputs a default error page with some information about the exception .
You can write you own exception handler if you want to do something else when an exception is thrown .
It can be useful to set the response code , e.g. 404 .
Returning non-HTML
Of course we do not have to output HTML .
Use setHeader to set the value of the Content - type header , and you can output whatever string you like .
In this example we return an image :
import Network .CGI import System .IO import qualified Data .
ByteString .
Lazy as B main = do b <- B . readFile " ./img/test.jpg " -- read the image runCGI .
handleErrors .
cgiMain $ b cgiMain :: B . ByteString ->
CGI CGIResult cgiMain p = do -- we need to set the appropriate content - type setHeader " Content - type " " image / jpg " outputFPS p
Examples : RSS
Response headers
You can use the setHeader function to set arbitrary HTTP response headers .
You can also set the response code , as seen above .
Example : output raw file data ( with last - modified )
The CGI Monad
At this point , you should be able to create many useful CGI scripts .
As your scripts get more ambitious , however , you may find yourself needing to pass " global " parameters to your CGI actions ( e.g. database connections , session information . )
Rather than explicitly passing these values around , you can extend the CGI monad to do this work for you .
The Network .CGI .
Monad module defines a CGI monad transformer , allowing us to build a new monad that does everything the CGI monad does -- and more !
For example , let 's define a new CGI monad that provides a database connection ( in this example , we use the Database .
HSQL .
PostgreSQL module for our database . )
Since it will be used by the CGI application , I 'll call the new monad " App " .
Should this not compile for you , you need to enable some extensions :
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}
After importing the appropriate modules , we define a new type , AppT that is made up of two monad transformers , CGIT and ReaderT .
The CGIT monad " wraps " the base monad " m " .
The CGIT monad , in turn , is wrapped by the ReaderT monad , which contains , in its environment , the database Connection .
AppT takes two type parameters .
The first is the base monad that the monad transformers are modifying .
Usually this will be the IO monad .
The second type is the data type that an action in the monad will return .
import Control .
Monad .
Reader import Network.CGI import Network .CGI .
Monad import Database .HSQL.PostgreSQL newtype AppT m a = App ( ReaderT Connection ( CGIT m ) a ) deriving ( Monad , MonadIO , MonadReader Connection )
Like CGI , we make a type synonym that defines the most common use of this new monad .
type App a = AppT IO a
We 're not quite finished defining App yet .
In order to be used like the CGI monad , App needs to be an instance of the MonadCGI class .
This class defines two functions that we must support .
instance MonadCGI ( AppT IO ) where cgiAddHeader n v = App .
lift $ cgiAddHeader n v cgiGet x = App . lift $ cgiGet x
So now we have an App monad that gives us all the functionality of CGI , but also carries around a database connection .
The last step is to define the function that creates the monad so we can run actions inside it .
import Control .
Exception ( bracket ) import System .IO ( stdin , stdout ) runApp :: App CGIResult -> IO ( ) runApp ( App a ) = bracket ( connect " host " " db " " user " " password " ) disconnect ( \ c -> do { env <- getCGIVars ; hRunCGI env stdin stdout ( runCGIT ( runReaderT a c ) ) ; return ( ) } )
( either fill in your account / password information , or change runApp to accept the parameters as function arguments . )
The function uses bracket so that the database connection gets released properly when the monad ends or if an exception is thrown .
Templating
There are times when you absolutely do not want to embed ( X ) HTML in Haskell .
You can separate the code and the presentation ( the Holy Grail of erm , web development ) .
The code will be , well , Haskell , and the presentation will be buried inside templates .
This might not be the case : fortunately , there is a very nice templating engine available : HStringTemplate ; also very useful is hakyll , a simple static site generator library , mainly aimed at creating blogs and brochure sites .
FastCGI
FastCGI is a standard for CGI - like programs that are not restarted for every request .
This reduces the overhead involved in handling each request , and reduces the servers response time for each request .
The overhead involved in starting a new process for each request can also include the need to set up new DB connections every time .
With FastCGI , DB connections can be reused .
Install FastCGI .
Get a web server which can run FastCGI programs .
Import Network .FastCGI .
Use runFastCGI .
See also a tutorial by Paul R Brown : Wiring Haskell Into a FastCGI Web Server
Take a look at lightweight , minimalistic FastCGI - based web frameworks : HVAC ( Haskell view and controller ) and Kibro .
Database - driven web - applications
See Takusen and HDBC .
If you would like to write queries in Haskell ( and not SQL ) , see also HaskellDB , which integrates with HDBC .
FastCGI are n't restarted for each request , only the runFastCGI part is re-run .
Everything ( handles , datastructures etc. ) you do outside of that loop will be persistent .
However you need to handle errors yourself , because you 're operating outside of handleErrors .

Britain 's first human - animal hybrid embryos have been created , forming a crucial first step , scientists believe , towards a supply of stem cells that could be used to investigate debilitating and so far untreatable conditions such as Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's and motor neurone disease .
Lyle Armstrong , who led the work , gained permission in January from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) to create the embryos , known as " cytoplasmic hybrids " .
His team at Newcastle University produced the embryos by inserting human DNA from a skin cell into a hollowed - out cow egg .
An electric shock then induced the hybrid embryo to grow .
The embryo , 99.9 % human and 0.1 % other animal , grew for three days , until it had 32 cells .
Eventually , scientists hope to grow such embryos for six days , and then extract stem cells from them .
The researchers insisted the embryos would never be implanted into a woman and that the only reason they used cow eggs was due to the scarcity of human eggs .
The team 's success comes days after Gordon Brown was forced to give MPs a free vote on the human fertilisation and embryology bill , which has faced condemnation from Catholic bishops .
Cardinal Keith O'Brien used his Easter sermon to denounce what he called experiments of " Frankenstein proportion " and called the bill a " monstrous attack on human rights , human dignity and human life " .
Catholics object to the idea of putting human and animal DNA in the same entity and to the notion of creating what they regard as a life for the purposes of research , a life that will then be destroyed .
John Burn , head of the Institute of Human Genetics at Newcastle University , said the embryos had been created purely for research .
He told the BBC's Six O'Clock News last night : " If you look down the microscope it looks like semolina and it stays like that .
It 's never going to be anything other than a pile of cells .
What it does is give us the tools to find out the simple questions : how can we better understand the disease processes by working with those cells in the body ? "
The research has not yet been published , but the team plans to submit the work for peer review in the coming months .
Other scientists welcomed the work but also urged caution in interpreting the results .
Colin Blakemore , a former head of the Medical Research Council , said : " The creation of hybrid embryos is not illegal and researchers in Newcastle and London were granted provisional licences for such research in January , after extensive consultation by the HFEA ...
This research is at a very early stage and no results have been peer - reviewed or published .
" However , these preliminary reports give hope that this approach is likely to provide stem cells for research without the use of human eggs or normal human embryos .
The new bill is intended to confirm the arrangements for regulation of this important area of research . "
Mark Walport , director of the Wellcome Trust , agreed that it was too early to assess the significance of the results .
" The aim of the research is to advance human health , " he said .
" This work emphasises the importance of the parliamentary scrutiny of this area of research over the coming weeks . "
Peter Andrews , professor of biomedical science at the University of Sheffield 's Centre for Stem Cell Biology , said : " The production of embryos by transferring the nucleus of an adult human cell to a human egg ... has already proved very difficult , let alone combining a human nucleus with an animal egg .
Apparently these researchers have achieved some success - but by using the nucleus from a very early embryonic cell , which might be easier to reprogramme than an adult cell .
At the moment it is impossible to assess the significance of this report until we know more details of what has been achieved ... the results have been repeated and , importantly , they have been reviewed by independent researchers in the usual way . "
Josephine Quintavalle , of the pressure group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , said the research should not worry those opposed to hybrid embryos because the Newcastle work did not seem convincing .
" The embryos did n't survive , they were created from embryonic stem cells rather than adult tissue , and there 's a lot of question marks over the research . "
But she added : " What it has done is wake up the public to this reality , that while parliament is getting in a tizz about this , while the whole country is up in arms discussing it , the HFEA is already issuing licences . "
Evan Harris , the Liberal Democrat MP who led a campaign to ensure that research on human - animal hybrids was not banned by parliament said : " Creating these sort of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos was deemed legal and legitimate under the 1990 HFEA Act and the 2001 Therapeutic Cloning Regulations by both the HFEA and by the science select committee , and was approved on that basis by the HFEA after a public consultation and after approval by a further unanimous select committee report .
Therefore it is wrong to say that this is pre-empting parliamentary debate or votes on the new legislation in this area - the statutory framework is being updated . "

Statement on Committee Review of Speculative " Disaster Scenarios " at Brookhaven Lab's RHIC October 6 , 1999 Brookhaven National Laboratory has posted on its Web site a report by expert physicists who recently reviewed speculative disaster scenarios at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider .
The report summarizes technical discussions that conclude there is no danger of a " disaster " at RHIC .
In July 1999 , Brookhaven Lab Director John Marburger convened a committee of distinguished physicists to write a comprehensive report on the arguments that address the safety of each of the speculative disaster scenarios at RHIC .
The scenarios are : - Creation of a black hole that would " eat " ordinary matter .
- Initiation of a transition to a new , more stable universe .
- Formation of a " strangelet " that would convert ordinary matter to a new form .
" We conclude that there are no credible mechanisms for catastrophic scenarios at RHIC , " said committee chair Robert Jaffe , Professor of Physics and Director , Center for Theoretical Physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" Accordingly , we see no reason to delay RHIC operation . "
Added Brookhaven Director Marburger , " Nature has been creating collisions of energies comparable to those at RHIC for billions of years , and there is no evidence of any kind of disaster related to those collisions .
RHIC does not take us beyond the limits of natural phenomena .
It brings a rare phenomenon into the view of our instruments so we can puzzle out its inner workings . "
On October 4 , Brookhaven Lab celebrated the commissioning of RHIC , the world 's newest and biggest particle accelerator for nuclear physics research .
All together , close to 1,000 scientists from 90 research institutions representing 19 countries will be working on RHIC experiments .

On Thursday , President Bush decided to offer some encouragement to the troops in the war Afghanistan ( a war he has often neglected in favor of his disastrous vanity project in Iraq ) by offering this bon mot on his personal feelings about the mission and the service rendered by our armed forces :
I must say , I ’m a little envious .
If I were slightly younger and not employed here , I think it would be a fantastic experience to be on the front lines of helping this young democracy succeed .
It must be exciting for you … in some ways romantic , in some ways , you know , confronting danger .
You ’re really making history , and thanks .
Often this is the sort of wistful atta-boy mentality one will find stated in any number of mediums …old war movies , recruiting posters , articles by crappy journalists , pro-war speeches by notable personalities , etc .
I ’ve heard it myself a few times , usually whenever somebody I ’ve recently met who ’s never served in the military finds out that I ’m a veteran and they ’re trying to stretch a polite compliment into personal bonding .
Usually it ’s not so much offensive as it is thoughtless , but it never ceases to grate on me nonetheless … partly because it smacks of sucking up ( a character trait I ca n’t abide ) ; partly because if you ask the follow - up question of why they did n’t follow through on their desire to serve their response is either an awkward silence or a string of transparent rationalizations that boil down to “ I was n’t actually considering it . ” ( exposing them as rather crappy and dishonest suck - ups ) ; but mainly because I tend to have little patience with or respect for people who wholeheartedly rah- rah the idea of jumping quickly into any war so long as people other than themselves are the ones getting shot at .
While part of that attitude is obviously due to my belief in the benefits of individual choice and my libertarian distrusts of the idealism of politicians and the wisdom of government planning , part of that dislike is very much a factor of realizing , from a personal perspective , just how destructive and long - lasting the damage of wars are …particularly wars that have little or no coherent purpose any more .
When Bush talks about the “ fantastic experience on the frontlines ” I do n’t envision WWII Rangers scaling the cliffs of Normandy on D - Day or John Wayne gunning down swarms of Japanese troops on Iwo Jima , I think about what happens to those men and women Bush “ envies ” after the “ glory ” of combat is a distant memory to the uninvolved bystanders .
I think about one of my former soldiers whose marriage was falling apart after he re-deployed because his post - traumatic stress disorder made it almost impossible for him to relate to his wife and his nightmares of having to shoot a 12 - year old kid in the face in Afghanistan would n’t let him sleep more than an hour or two a night , but who was scared of seeking psychiatric help because his previous unit punished people for doing so .
I think about my best friend
Tom who ’s racked with guilt because he , while trying to do a counter - fire mission in reaction to an insurgent attack , ended up dropping artillery rounds on an Iraqi family thanks to receiving a bad set of coordinates and a freakish wind change .
I think about the time that an officer who did n’t know anything about intel , and was n’t in the mood to hear one of her NCOs point out that she was factually mistaken , cherry - picked one of my reports to authorize an A - 10 strike that killed nine little kids and zero insurgents because she thought taking decisive action would look good on her rating .
And I look at the fact that , almost seven years down the road , we ’ve still yet to accomplish the one primary goal we went to Afghanistan to accomplish , or to put forth any realistic strategy for “ victory ” Iraq ( besides stalling tactics ) and I wonder , “ What was the point ? ”
I also think about the injured or disabled vets who come back from this war who will end up needing the assistance of the often substandard military medical system , sometimes for the rest of their lives .
Or the vets who will go undiagnosed for psychiatric problems and end up on the streets once they ’re out of the service and are n’t the government ’s “ problem ” anymore .
Or my cousin Mike , an infantryman in Vietnam , who , 40 years after serving , still struggles with a case of PTSD so severe that he can’t discuss what happened to him back then without having nightmares for a week now and which has made him the proud recipient of a couple of heart attacks .
And I wonder if that ’s what the current generation has to look forward to in 40 years and whether it will all have been worth it for what we ’ll have actually accomplished .
Somehow , I doubt it .
War is hell , and not just for the people who “ deserve ” it .
People like Bush , who has some rather odd impressions of combat and actually ducked the chance to serve in his generation ’s “ romantic ” war ( which would make his comment slightly less than honest ) never seem to figure that out .
But then , why should they ?
They ’re rarely the ones with something to lose .
The same principle that Milton Friedman once applied to other peoples ’ money also applies to other peoples ’ lives … nobody will spend what ’s yours as carefully as you do .
And nobody is as willing to avoid an unnecessary war as much as someone who understands what it actually costs .
Sadly , that ’s wisdom rarely found among the ranks of the chickenhawks .
At one point , Alexis Hall had more than 50 pairs of designer shoes and handbags .
It never occurred to the 39 - year - old media relations executive from Glasgow that her £ 31,500 in debt ( $ 63,000 ) would be a problem .
“ It was so easy to get the loans and the credit that you almost think the goods are a gift from the shop , ” she said .
“ You do n’t fully realize that it ’s real money you are spending until you actually sit down and consolidate your bills and then it ’s a shock . ”
As the United States economy weakens , many Americans are being overwhelmed by personal debt , but Britons are even more profligate .
For most of the last decade , consumers here went on a debt - financed spending spree that made them the most indebted rich nation in the world , racking up a record £ 1.4 trillion in debt ( $ 2.8 trillion ) — more than the country ’s gross domestic product .
By comparison , personal debt in the United States is $ 13.8 trillion , including mortgage debt , slightly less than the country ’s $ 14 trillion G.D.P .
And while the Federal Reserve in Washington has cut interest rates , in an effort to loosen lenders ’ grip on credit , the Bank of England ’s interest rate increases last year are trickling through to mortgages at the very time home values are dropping and banks are becoming more reluctant to lend .
Until now , debt has mostly been a good thing for Britain .
In the hands of free - spending consumers , it fueled economic growth .
The government borrowed heavily in recent years to invest in infrastructure , health and education , creating a virtuous cycle : government spending led to job creation , which led to greater consumer confidence and more spending , which , in turn , stimulated growth .
Economists say Britain ’s relationship to debt is complex , but at its core is a phenomenon more akin to recent American history than European trends .
As in the United States , a decade - long housing boom and strong economic growth bolstered consumer confidence , creating a perception of wealth almost unknown in countries like Germany and Italy .
“ Culturally , maybe also because of the defeat in the war , Germans remain reluctant to borrow and banks are often state - owned , pushing less for profits from lending , ” said Alistair Milne , a professor at Cass Business School in London .
Since many younger Britons have never lived through a period of slow growth , few now see the need to hold back on borrowing , not to mention saving .
“ The general mantra is spend now , think later , ” said Jason Butler , an adviser at Bloomsbury Financial Planning .
“ It ’s easier to get a loan or a credit card these days than to get a savings product . ”
The average British adult has 2.8 credit or debit cards , more than any other country in Europe .
A growing number are borrowing to pay for vacations , furniture , even plastic surgery .
As a result , Britons are spending more than they earn , racking up a household debt - to - income ratio of 1.62 compared with 1.42 in the United States and 1.09 in Germany .
To her parent ’s generation , Ms. Hall said , owing money beyond a mortgage was “ shameful , ” an admission of living beyond one ’s means .
Debt was also more difficult to get .
That changed in the late 1990s when American lenders , including Citigroup and CapitalOne , pushed into the British market with a panoply of new lending products .
Fierce competition among banks meant potential borrowers were suddenly bombarded with advertising and offers for low - or no-interest loans and credit cards .
While Britain ’s financial regulators watched the explosion of retail lending from the sidelines , their counterparts in Germany and France were more restrictive .
As a result , the British market became the largest and most sophisticated in Europe .
The growth was also fueled by soaring demand for debt on the back of rising real estate prices and relatively low interest rates in the late 1990s and early 2000s .
Those who did not own a house rushed to join the homeowners watching their property triple in value .
The trend on the Continent was the opposite .
Home prices in most European countries barely moved , mainly because markets were more regulated , there was more housing stock and renting was more popular .
Liz Bingham , head of restructuring at Ernst & Young in London , blames the obsession with homeownership on Britain ’s “ island mentality ” : land is seen as a finite good and a valuable asset .
“ The housing boom automatically made people feel richer than they actually were and people went on to use the equity locked up in their property almost as a bank account they can dip into every time they want to buy a new car , ” Ms. Bingham said .
As the perception of wealth grew , the social stigma around debt disappeared .
Borrowing became such an accepted part of life that today one in five teenagers does not consider being in debt to be a bad thing , a survey by Nationwide Building Society showed .
Debt levels increased further as it became easier to get loans , and retailers , like computer chain PC World , offered both goods and the loans to buy them .
Consumers happily accepted , thinking that as long as they were deemed creditworthy , they were not in danger of defaulting .
Andy Davie is a case in point .
Even after he had racked up £ 70,000 in personal debt trying to keep his fruit and vegetable business afloat , credit card issuers kept increasing his credit limits .
“ You tend to use credit to pay for credit and as far as the banks are concerned you are fine , ” said Mr. Davie , 41 .
He was finally forced to declare bankruptcy .
Though still painful , the process made the prospect of defaulting slightly less daunting .
“ Rather than showing up at court you just fill in an online form and speak to someone on the phone , ” said Mark Sands , director of personal insolvency at KPMG in London .
The ease of the bankruptcy process , the availability of debt , the property boom and strong economic growth , lulled consumers into a “ false sense of security that is now coming to haunt us , ” said James Falla , a debt adviser at London - based Thomas Charles .
“ It ’s all good as long as the economy is doing well , but if that changes people will really get caught short , ” he added .
And things are changing .
Growth has already started to slow this year , and the government lowered its 2008 forecast to 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent , after 3.1 percent growth last year .
Home prices are falling , despite a dearth of housing and an influx of wealthy Middle Easteners and Russians , especially in London .
Last year , housing foreclosures reached the highest level since 1999 and are expected to rise still further this year .
And more than one million homeowners have adjustable - rate mortgages that are expected to reset in the next 12 months — to significantly higher rates .
The prospect of rising costs has already prompted some consumers to change their spending habits .
The camera retailer Jessops and the fashion store French Connection are among retailers feeling the squeeze and reporting lower sales since the end of 2007 .
But changing spending habits will not be enough to solve the problem of rising debt levels , said Mr. Butler , the debt adviser .
Consumers will also have to learn to save .
According to a survey for the Office of National Statistics , less than half the population saves regularly , and more than 39 percent said they would rather enjoy a good standard of living today than save for retirement .
Ms. Hall said she was among that 39 percent .
She recently took out new loans , planning to repay her existing debt .
But she ended up spending the money on more luxury goods instead .
This year , she published a book about her experiences .
She said she did not expect the book ’s proceeds to repay her debts , but it may help the growing number of people in similar positions cope with theirs .

All over the world people are traveling over deserts , mountains , and by sea in a vain attempt to find this year 's hot Christmas toy , the Nintendo Wii .
I tried to play it cool and pretend I did n't want one , telling myself that the Wii is for babies .
I could only hold out for so long before the hype consumed my soul and soon I too was out looking for a Wii .
My journey was one fraught with challenges and hardships , all for an opportunity to purchase an overpriced piece of electronics that plays games very similar to those that can be operated on consoles I already own sold by a multinational corporation that sits back and laughs at my futile attempt to purchase their overhyped game system .
This is my story .
Day 1
I arrived at Best Buy fully aware that I was an asshole for even thinking about waiting in the freezing cold to purchase a game system .
Already having an expansive library of video games that spans every single genre imaginable that you 've only played once or twice and never thought about again is n't enough I suppose .
You 're always left wanting more .
Unable to wait a couple months for demand to die down and spare myself the embarrassment of this story , I found myself a spot in line .
From my estimate there were about 40 or 50 people in line .
A third of the waiters appeared to be creepy looking Fatwallet loners .
You know , the kind that will start a war with K - Mart because they did n't honor a typo in a Sunday ad .
Yes , they honestly meant to discount that $ 2,000 television to 60 cents and they are just trying to defraud you out of a good deal .
Another third looked to be parents who just wanted to get their kids this year 's ( and last 's ) hot new Christmas toy .
You know , good honest people taken in by all the marketing hype .
They stood around and passed the time by striking up conversations with each other .
I felt good that the line was n't entirely populated by fat greasy video game nerds or Fatwallet losers and I tried to assimilate with them , but I was eventually found out and told to stand somewhere else , away from the normals .
Meet new and interesting people while waiting in line for your baby console .
Because I was part of that last third of humanity waiting for a Wii , you know , the guys who actually want to play with the thing , video game nerds .
I kept telling myself that I was n't one of them , that I was here for another reason .
Uh , I 'm not standing in line for a Wii !
Lord no !
I 'm , uhm , here to buy , uh , Rush Hour 3 on Blu - Ray DVD !
Yes , that 's it !
Oh man , I can't get enough of ethnically mismatched comedy action !
" Be honest ... "
Okay look , I 'll level with you .
There 's this really obscure Japanese anime that is coming out today and I want to be the first to post screengrabs of the scene where Oashi fondles his little sister to this message board I post on .
" Good God , that 's even worse . "
At least they left me alone at that point .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Retail gas prices slipped for the fifth day in a row , offering some much - needed relief to pinched consumers .
Auto group AAA reported the national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline retreated to $ 3.610 , down one - tenth of a cent from the previous day .
Before the recent retreat , pump prices had hit a record high for 17 days in a row , according to AAA .
A year ago , a gallon of gas cost on average $ 3.035 , which is 19 % lower than the price of a gallon of gas today .
While gas prices are on the decline , crude oil prices neared $ 121 in electronic trading on Tuesday , setting a new record high price for crude futures .
When sonar surveys spotted a vast pile of rubble in the Columbia River below Bonneville Dam late last winter , officials suddenly worried part of the dam structure was eroding into the river .
" Everybody said , ' Oh my gosh , we need to get divers out there right away , ' " recalled Dennis Schwartz , a fisheries biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which oversees the dam .
What they found below the spillways in February was not a giant pile of rock at all , but a humongous pile of thousands upon thousands of sturgeon - some of them 14 feet long or longer - lounging together in frigid water at the bottom of the river .
" We call it the big sturgeon ball , " Schwartz said .
The mountain of white sturgeon contained around 60,000 fish , according to a crude estimate by Michael Parsley , a research fisheries biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey 's Columbia River Research Laboratory in Cook , Wash .
He described that estimate as " probably conservative . "
It was an aquatic phenomenon nobody had ever seen at such a monstrous scale , offering a startling glimpse into the life of the Columbia 's largest and most ancient fish .
If the estimates are anywhere near correct , the congregation of sturgeon may represent 5 to 10 percent of all the white sturgeon in the lower Columbia River , Parsley said .
The conclave apparently broke up in March as the Corps increased water releases through the dam to help salmon , Schwartz said .
An Army dive team called out to inspect the dam discovered the sturgeon when it sent down a remotely operated submersible to take a look at what everyone thought was debris .
The lingering question :
What were all the fish doing there ?
" Normally they 're pretty spread out , " Schwartz said .
" You do n't see this balling behavior . "
On videos recorded by the underwater camera , the fish appear to be lounging , many on top of each other , some even upside down , at depths of 40 to 50 feet .
Biologists considered whether the fish may be putting up an organized defense against sea lions showing up increased numbers to gobble salmon and sturgeon below the dam .
They discovered the sturgeon ball just as sea lions started to show up , but they also point out that sturgeon have been known to gather -- though in lower numbers -- in other places where there are no sea lions .
" The correlation ( with sea lions ) would probably be pretty weak , " Schwartz said .
" They all seemed to be just hanging out together . "
Similar winter gatherings of sturgeon have been documented far up the Columbia in Canada , but not at the tremendous numbers seen below Bonneville , Parsley said .
Biologists are not sure why the fish collect that way .
" We do n't know whether that one aggregation is in response to sea lions being there , or if they do this every year , " he said .
The fish may bunch up for safety as they conserve energy during the cool months of winter , he said .
The water was about 34 to 35 degrees .
" They were just lollygagging -- definitely not expending energy , " he said .
" There must be some social or survival advantage to it , but I 'm not sure what it is . "
Sturgeon are ancient survivors that have changed little since the time of the dinosaurs .
They can weigh more than 1,500 pounds and live to be well over 100 years old .
Biologists have heard reports of congregations of sturgeon at the surface of reservoirs and rivers , including shallow parts of the Columbia .
But there are n't very good estimates on how many sturgeon may be involved in those gatherings , Parsley said .
" Sturgeons in general seem to be relatively social . "
He heard an account from a woman who said the river came alive with fish .
She told him she could n't help but think of sharks when she saw the giant fish slice across the water surface .
Teams working at the dam have reported some unusual sturgeon activity since sea lions began appearing in larger numbers at the dam each spring in recent years , eating both salmon and sturgeon .
Last year , for instance , crews saw large numbers of sturgeon along the bank of Cascades Island , one of the islands just below the dam .
Biologists speculated that the fish might have been trying to avoid sea lions , said Robert Stansell , a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers biologist at the dam .
Sea lions -- mainly protected Steller sea lions -- were spotted gobbling more than 600 sturgeon this year , although the number dropped off later in the spring , he said .
Hundreds of sturgeon also were found in the dam's fish ladder last winter , which was unusual , he said .
Parsley said sturgeon are so poorly studied that biologists do n't know much about their behavior .
Big gatherings of the fish in the depths of the river may be more common than anyone realizes .
" I firmly believe they do this elsewhere in the river , " he said .
While salmon are well known , biologists have spent far less time mapping the populations and habits of sturgeon .
But the fish are by far the largest and longest lived fish in the river system -- and one of the most mysterious .
" They 're the woolly mammoth , the saber - tooth tiger or the lion of the Columbia River , " Parsley said .
" There 's just still a lot to be learned about them . "

REMEMBER the days when , if something went wrong with a product you ordered , you picked up the phone and there was a live person on the other end ?
Wait , there is more .
You asked for customer service and were transferred  to another human !
And that person perhaps even solved your problem .
I get a warm feeling when I think about that , like fondly remembering an old teacher .
We have become so used to the impersonal and baffling labyrinth of automated voice systems at just about every company  and then poor customer service when we do reach an actual person  that we just grudgingly accept it .
We all have bad service stories and love telling them and they do not always involve giant corporations .
One of my favorites is about the dry cleaner who returned two of my husband ’s shirts with neatly torn holes in each right sleeve .
Clearly , they had gotten caught on a machine .
He showed the clerk the holes and asked for replacement shirts .
But she insisted that he must be rubbing his elbows so hard on his desk that the shirts wore through .
Never mind that we had been going there for years with no such problem .
Never mind that they were symmetrical tears .
Researchers have identified 25 genes regulating lifespan in two organisms separated by about 1.5 billion years in evolutionary change .
At least 15 of those genes have very similar versions in humans , suggesting that scientists may be able to target those genes to help slow down the aging process and treat age - related conditions .
The two organisms used in this study , the single - celled budding yeast and the roundworm C. elegans , are commonly used models for aging research .
Finding genes that are conserved between the two organisms is significant , researchers say , because the two species are so far apart on the evolutionary scale -- even farther apart than the tiny worms and humans .
That , combined with the presence of similar human genes , is an indication that these genes could regulate human longevity as well .
" Now that we know what many of these genes actually are , we have potential targets to go after in humans , " said Brian Kennedy , University of Washington associate professor of biochemistry and one of the senior authors of the study .
" We hope that in the future we could affect those targets and improve not just lifespan , but also the ' health span ' or the period of a person 's life when they can be healthy and not suffer from age - related illnesses . "
Several of the genes that the scientists identified as being involved in aging are also connected to a key nutrient response pathway known as known as the Target of Rapamycin , or TOR .
That finding gives more evidence to the theory that calorie intake and nutrient response affect lifespan by altering TOR activity .
Previous studies have found that drastically restricting the caloric intake of organisms , an approach known as dietary restriction , can prolong their lifespan and reduce the incidence of age - related diseases .
TOR inhibitors are being tested clinically in people for anti-cancer properties , and this work suggests they may also be useful against a variety of age - associated diseases .
" What we 'd like to eventually do is be able to mimic the effects of dietary restriction with a drug , " explained Matt Kaeberlein , another senior author on the paper and a University of Washington assistant professor of pathology .
" Most people do n't want to cut their diet that drastically , just so they may live a little longer .
But someday in the future , we may be able to accomplish the same thing with a pill . "
These findings also give new insight into the genetic basis of aging , the scientists said , and provide some of the first quantitative evidence that genes regulating aging have been conserved during the process of evolution .
Earlier evolutionary theories suggested that aging was not genetically controlled , since an organism does not get any advantage in natural selection by having a very long lifespan that goes far past their reproductive age .
To find these lifespan - controlling genes , the scientists took a genomic approach to comprehensively examine genes that affect aging in yeast and worms .
Based on published reports , they first identified 276 genes in C. elegans that affected aging , and then searched for similar genetic sequences in the yeast genome .
Of the 25 aging - related genes they found in both worms and yeast , only three had been previously thought to be conserved across many organisms .
The lead author on the paper is Erica Smith , a senior fellow in pathology and biochemistry at the University of Washington , and Jim Thomas , University of Washington professor of genome sciences , contributed to the project .
The project also included scientists at the University of Georgia in Athens , and was supported by the Ellison Medical Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .

A pilot whale was seen to surface with squid in its mouth
Enlarge Image
Super - fast pilot whales have been observed sprinting after prey , likely to include giant squid .
The rapid pursuit has brought comparisons with the fleet - footed land predator , the cheetah .
The cetaceans even use the same , highly specialised hunting strategy that cheetahs use , scientists report in the Journal of Animal Ecology .
They say it gives the lie to our perception that deep sea whales are slow , energy - saving creatures .
Short - finned pilot whales seem to be the greatest burst - speed athletes of the deep - diving mammals
Aguilar Soto , La Laguna University
It is the first time such remarkable behaviour - occurring hundreds of metres underwater , in complete darkness - has been recorded .
" As far as we know , no other whale has been recorded to swim nearly as fast at depth , " says marine biologist Natacha Aguilar Soto , of La Laguna University in Tenerife , Spain .
" Short - finned pilot whales seem to be the greatest burst - speed athletes of the deep - diving mammals . "
Energetic sprint Aguilar Soto is a member of an international team of researchers drawn from La Laguna University , Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts , US , and Aarhus University , Denmark .
Land speed king : Cheetahs can move at over 100 km / h
The team tagged and studied 23 short - finned pilot whales ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ) living off the coast of the Canary Islands , one of only three places in the world that these whales permanently reside .
The tags , designed by co-author Mark Johnson of Woods Hole , recorded the speed , depth and direction of the whales ' dives , and also the sounds made and heard by the whales .
During the day , the whales are frequently seen lazing on the surface , often in social groups ( see video ) .
That led scientists to previously think the whales only hunt at night .
But the tags demonstrate the whales also hunt during the day .
And when they do , they dive deep , and they dive fast .
Tags showed the whales take just 15 minutes to dive to depths of 800 m to 1,000 m ( 0.6 mile ) , and more .
And when they pinpoint their prey , the whales surge after it , reaching speeds of nine metres per second , or 32 kilometres per hour ( 20 m ph ) .
What 's more , they may keep up the sprint for 200 m ( 650 ft ) , before either catching the prey or giving up the chase .
The discovery fundamentally challenges our perceptions of how deep - sea creatures behave , says Aguilar Soto .

Advertisement Until now , researchers assumed that deep - diving whales moved relatively slowly , due to the need to conserve oxygen whilst holding their breath .
" It was completely unexpected that short - finned pilot whales sprint at depth with limited oxygen reserves .
Cheetahs , for example , more than double their breathing rate during chases , " says Aguilar Soto .
So like cheetahs , pilot whales must therefore follow a high - risk , high - gain hunting strategy based on high - speed , energetically expensive sprints .
But somehow , the whales do it while still holding their breath .
And that may explain why they are spotted lazing on the surface - the whales may be actually recovering from the exertion of the hunt .
Deep battle
There is also tantalising , indirect evidence that the whales may sometimes chase down giant squid .
During the dives , the acoustic tags revealed that the whales switched from slower echolocation clicks to a fast series of clicks , or buzz .
That allows them to " see with sound " with greater resolution in the darkness , says co-author Peter Madsen of Aarhus University .
" The analogy is like going from snap - shots to video , " he says , indicating the whales are trying to capture prey after the sprints .
But " the prey must be large or calorific to reward the deep dives , and they must be able to move rapidly given the top speeds we clocked for the whales , " says Aguilar Soto .
One animal fits the bill , the giant squid Architeuthis .
" We found a piece of fresh Architeuthis arm floating in the vicinity of diving pilot whales and findings of bitten Architeuthis are common in the area where the whales live , " Aguilar Soto explains .
Also , colleague Pablo Aspas recently took a photo of a pilot whale half - breaching with a piece of large squid in its mouth ( pictured above ) .
" Its colour and the shape of the cups indicate it may well belong to Architeuthis and the size of the piece indicates that the full length of the tentacle would be more than two metres , corresponding to a squid 4 - 5 metres long and some 180kg in weight , " says cephalopod expert Angel Guerra of the Institute for Marine Investigations in Vigo , Spain .
" We have imagined battles between sperm whale and giant squid .
But it may turn out that it is pilot whales , one - third the size of sperm whales , which are sprinting for the giant squid ! " says Aguilar Soto .

What are these ?
We 'll get to what you can do in a second .
Ten days ago the Electronic Frontier Foundation warned that patent " reform " legislation pending before the United States Senate would have the perverse effect of killing the EFF 's highly successful Patent Busting Project .
In fact , it could render all third - party patent watchdogs essentially toothless .
... Some reform .
Ten days later the EFF has heard exactly nothing in response to letters of concern it sent to Sen.
Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , and Sen. Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , the chairman and ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
This despite significant attention from the press and high - profile technology forums such as Slashdot and the geek page at Fark .
Ten days later and I 've gotten nothing but lame excuses for my multiple attempts to get a sense from Leahy 's office as to whether the watchdog - killing language in this " reform " legislation is set in stone , or if the senator is committed to seeing it removed .
Here 's yesterday 's brush - off from a Leahy staffer : " Paul , I can't stress to you enough how much work is going into the patent reform legislation .
We hear from literally dozens of groups on this important legislation and we read all of those letters and consider the concerns of these organizations as we work through this process . "
Oftentimes journalists and public - interest groups are able to pry answers out of politicians more readily than can the general public .
But not always , as is evidenced by this case .
Sometimes the people who run the offices of these pols will respond better to inquiries from honest - to - goodness constituents - knowing that constituents vote , contribute and campaign .
So , if you 're fed up with baseless patents and patent trolls ; and , if you believe that public - interest groups such as the EFF should not be " reformed " out of the patent - review process , take a moment to see where your member of the Senate Judiciary Committee stands .
If you 're able to get a reply from any of these senators , in particular , Leahy or Specter , please pass it along to me and I 'll share it with the group .
( This is called crowdsourcing in today 's vernacular . )
As the Leahy staffer notes above , patent reform is important legislation that you can bet is drawing behind - the - scenes attention from all manner of special interests .
Whipping up public attention and support now as opposed to later may spell the difference in the outcome for the public 's best interests .
It could also keep the Patent Busting Project busting patents .
Vermont and Pennsylvania readers would be particularly helpful in pinning down Leahy and Specter , respectively , but the powerful Judiciary Committee boasts a who's who of Senate heavyweights , including : Kennedy , Biden , Hatch , Kohl , Grassley , Feinstein , Feingold , Kyl , Sessions , Schumer , Graham , Durbin , Cornyn , Cardin , Brownback , Whitehouse and Coburn .
All the contact information you could need is right here .
The bill is S. 1145 , the Patent Reform Act of 2007 .
Put the question any way you choose , but here 's a suggestion : " Does the senator support or oppose language in the Patent Reform Act of 2007 that the Electronic Frontier Foundation says would kill its Patent Busting Project and similar watchdog efforts ? "
Pin them down now before the ink dries on this thing .
Applino A new way to deploy Java Desktop Applications
An applino is to the desktop what a servlet is to the server .
Applino provides and environment for running multiple Java desktop applications within a single JVM .
The Applino environment runs as a taskbar icon and starts when the user logs into their computer .
Applini ( Applino applications ) are similar to servlets in that they contain runtime descriptors and have their life cycles dictated by the Applino container .
Most Java developers realise that it is inefficient to instantiate a separate JVM for each Java application running on a user 's computer .
This involves a significant extra start - up time and is wasteful of memory .
Unfortunately , due to the need to segregate the effects of one application from another there has n't been any choice .
On the server side however , much progress has been made in the area of Java Application Servers which are able to run multiple web applications within the same JVM .
The level of intra application protection is so good that several hosting companies provide shared hosting where users host their web applications in the same JVM as other users .
The idea behind this project is simple : take the compartmentalisation technology which has been developed for servlets and reapply it to the desktop space .
This has proven to be exceedingly simple as concepts such as context life cycles and hierarchical class loaders map perfectly to the requirements of a mono JVM desktop environment .
Typically porting an existing application to the Applino environment is trivial .
It is simply a matter of ensuring that it is properly started when instructed and properly terminated .
The initial window for the hosted application will also be provided by the Applino container ( so that it can control events such as window closing ) .
As a demonstration of how easy it is to port existing applications , we have already provided Applino versions of all the JFC example applications from the JDK .

WASHINGTON --
The Federal Reserve is considering contingency plans for expanding its lending power in the event its recent steps to unfreeze credit markets fail .
Among the options : Having the Treasury borrow more money than it needs to fund the government and leave the proceeds on deposit at the Fed ; issuing debt under the Fed 's name rather than the Treasury 's ; and asking Congress for immediate authority for the Fed to pay interest on commercial - bank reserves instead of waiting until a previously enacted law permits it in ...

By taking advantage of a smart podcast concept being used by French and German broadcasters .
Radio France Internationale ( RFI ) issues a daily podcast called Le Journal en français facile ( iTunes - feed - web site ) , which delivers the nightly international news in slow and easy - to - understand French .
Along the same lines , the German media company Deutsche Welle ( which puts out many great language and music podcasts ) also has its own nightly news program — Langsam gesprochene Nachrichten ( iTunes - feed - web site ) .
It 's essentially the same concept : informative news presented in very simple German , and , in this case , it 's spoken very slowly .
Now , what 's very nice about these programs is that they also provide a written transcript of the spoken word .
So you can read along as you listen and make sure that you 're really comprehending .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama decisively defeated Sen. Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday , but Clinton 's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries .
Sen . Barack Obama and his wife , Michelle , greet supporters in Raleigh , North Carolina .
As polls closed in Indiana , Clinton had a double - digit lead over Obama , but by the end of the evening , Clinton 's lead had shrunk , dragging the race out until early Wednesday .
A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County , a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama .
By Wednesday morning , all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points .
There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana .
Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally , Obama added four delegates to his lead , according to CNN estimates .
Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina .
With 99 percent of precincts reporting , Obama held a 14 - point lead over Clinton .
Watch analysis of NC , IN primaries »
" Some were saying that North Carolina would be a game - changer in this election .
But today , what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington , " Obama told supporters in Raleigh , North Carolina .
Watch Obama thank his supporters »
Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina , according to exit polls , while Clinton claimed only 6 percent .
Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama , according to the polls .
Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis , " it 's full - speed on to the White House . "
Watch Clinton greet her supporters »
Clinton made a strong pitch to blue - collar workers in Indiana .
She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday 's primary .
In CNN exit polling , Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas , compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois .
She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama 's 32 percent .
In all , 1,738 voters were polled .
Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best - suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working - class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline .
" I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners , " she said at a rally in Indianapolis .
" For too long we 've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well - connected , but I do n't think that 's what Americans need .
" Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party ; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together . "
Eighty - nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession .
Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama 's 47 percent .
The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia , Kentucky and Oregon .
According to early exit polls , half of Clinton 's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen.
John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee .
Watch what the exit polls show »
A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama , while 17 percent said they would not vote at all .
Forty - eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November .
Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina , where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain .
Thirty - eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote .
Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November .
In Indiana , 59 percent of Obama backers said they 'd vote for Clinton , and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain .
Obama on Tuesday said he did n't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite .
" Tonight , many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen .
Clinton 's supporters will not support me , and that my supporters will not support her , " he said .
" I'm here tonight to tell you that I do n't believe it .
Yes , there have been bruised feelings on both sides .
Yes , each side desperately wants their candidate to win .
But ultimately , this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain .
" This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future . "
Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won , and he is ahead in the popular vote , if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation .
Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules .
With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3 , the end of the primary season , the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates : Democratic governors , members of Congress and party officials .
Watch how superdelegates could come into play »
Both candidates have spent the past two weeks shuttling between Indiana and North Carolina , each arguing to crucial working - class voters that their rival is out of touch when it comes to the pocketbook issues that are dominating the campaign .
CNN 's Susan Candiotti , Dan Lothian and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Presidential Election
The UN secretary general issued a gloomy warning yesterday that the deepening global food crisis , in which rapidly rising prices have triggered riots and threatened hunger in dozens of countries , could have grave implications for international security , economic growth and social progress .
Ban Ki-moon told a trade and development conference in Accra , Ghana , that the surge in prices of basic foodstuffs like cereals since last year could cancel out progress made towards meeting the UN's Millennium Development Goal of halving world poverty by 2015 .
" If not handled properly , this crisis could result in a cascade of others ... and become a multidimensional problem affecting economic growth , social progress and even political security around the world , " Ban told the conference .
The World Bank estimates food prices have risen by an average of 83 % in the past three years , and warns that at least 100 million people could be tipped into poverty as a result .
A range of factors has been blamed , including poor harvests , partly due to climate change , rising oil prices , steep growth in demand from China and India , and the dash to produce biofuels for motoring at the expense of food crops .
" One thing is certain , " Ban said .
" The world has consumed more than it has produced " over the last three years .
Last week Gordon Brown called for coordinated action by the US and Europe on rising food prices , after discussing the problem with Ban .
In his speech yesterday , the UN chief said the ripple effect from food shortages and price hikes risked setting the UN 's anti-poverty agenda back at square one .
" The global food prices could mean seven lost years ... for the Millennium Development Goals , " he said .
The threat of hunger and poverty in developing countries has also sharply increased , and has already resulted in food riots in parts of Asia and Africa .
Ban said several states had attempted to stave off food shortages by barring exports of rice and wheat , or introducing incentives for easier imports of foodstuffs .
" This threatens to distort international trade and exacerbate shortages , " he said .
The UN 's special rapporteur on the right to food , Jean Ziegler , earlier blamed the crisis on biofuels , speculation on commodities markets , and EU export subsidies .
" Hunger has not been down to fate for a long time - just as Marx thought , " he told the Austrian newspaper Kurier am Sonntag .
" This is silent mass murder . "
Food riots have broken out in at least a dozen countries , most notably in Egypt , Ivory Coast , Senegal , Yemen and Mexico .
Pakistan has reintroduced rationing , while Russia has frozen the price of milk , bread , eggs and cooking oil .
Indonesia has increased public food subsidies , while India has banned the export of rice , except the high - quality basmati variety .
Earlier this month , Haiti 's parliament dismissed the prime minister , and cut the price of rice , in an attempt to defuse widespread anger at food price hikes that led to days of protests and looting in the capital , Port - au - Prince .
Thousands of garment workers in the Bangladeshi capital , Dhaka , also went on strike this month over spiralling prices .
The price of rice , the staple Bangladeshi food , has increased by a third since a devastating cyclone last year .
Experts say 30 million of the country 's 150 million people could go without daily meals .
The UN food agency has warned that it will need to make " heartbreaking " choices about which countries should receive its emergency aid , unless governments donate more money to buy increasingly expensive food .
In the 30 years to 2005 , world food prices fell by around three - quarters in inflation - adjusted terms , according to the Economist food prices index .
Since then they have risen by 75 % , with much of the increase in the past year .
Wheat prices have doubled , while maize , soya and oilseeds are at record highs .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
Netscape Navigator , now owned by AOL , will no longer be supported after 1 March 2008 , the company has said .
In the mid-1990s , as the commercial web began to take off , the browser was used by more than 90 % of people online .
Its market share has since slipped to just 0.6 % as other browsers such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) and Firefox have eroded its user base .
The company recommends that users upgrade their browser to either Firefox or Flock , which are both built on the same underlying technologies as Navigator .
" I think we represent the hope that was of Netscape , " Mitchell Baker , chair of the Mozilla Foundation which coordinates development of Firefox , told BBC News .
" We have picked up many of the things that Netscape launched but we 've taken them further in terms of openness and public participation . "
Ms Baker was one of the first employees at Netscape in 1994 .
Web window
Netscape was created by Marc Andreessen who as a student had co-authored Mosaic , the first popular web browser .
Firefox uses the same technology as Navigator developers
His company Netscape Communications Corporation released the first version in 1994 .
According to Shawn Hardin , President and CEO of Flock , Netscape played an important role in making the internet " a relevant mass market phenomenon " .
" Netscape had a critical role in taking all of these zeros and ones - this very academic and technical environment - and giving it a graphical user interface where an average person could come online and consume information , " he told BBC News .
" During its halcyon days it really felt like the internet and Netscape were really the same thing , " he said .
Other companies capitalised on Netscape 's success , notably Microsoft , which began to bundle IE with its Windows operating systems .
Netscape is a wonderful browser , and it will be so in the future
Comment on Netscape blog
Although this led to legal wrangles over anti-competitive behaviour , IE now dominates the browser landscape with an 80 % market share .
As a result , Netscape became unviable .
" While internal groups within AOL have invested a great deal of time and energy in attempting to revive Netscape Navigator , these efforts have not been successful in gaining market share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer , " said Tom Drapeau on the Netscape blog last year , when the demise of the browser was first announced .
Future return ?
For the past week Netscape users have been shown a message alerting them to the end of support for the browser .
" Given AOL 's current business focus , support for Netscape browsers will be discontinued as of March 1st , 2008 , " the message reads .
Flock is designed to take advantage of web 2.0 sites
It then suggests users upgrade to either Flock or Firefox .
Firefox is the main competitor to IE , particularly in Europe where it has a 28 % market share , according to some statistics .
The open source browser 's development is coordinated by the Mozilla foundation , set up by Netscape staff made redundant in 2003 .
It has had more than 500 million downloads worldwide and in countries such as Finland it is the most popular browser .
" Competition is what brings quality , " said Ms Baker .
Flock describes itself as " the social web browser " and allows people to see feeds from community websites , such as Flickr and Facebook , and post to blogs without having to navigate to the page .
" There are lots of ways that people are engaging in having a conversation and Flock is very focused on making that as effortless and convenient as possible , " said Mr Hardin .
However , not all Netscape users are happy about having to change browser .
" I 'm sad .
Flock still needs improvement and I am not happy with Firefox 's interface .
I 'm [ an ] orphan ! " read one post on the Netscape blog .
Others who posted comments on the blog predicted the browser will make a return .
" Netscape is a wonderful browser , and it will be so in the future , " read one .

WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD ?
BARACK OBAMA :
The chicken crossed the road because it was time for a CHANGE !
The chicken wanted CHANGE !
JOHN MC CAIN :
My friends that chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and
dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road .
HILLARY CLINTON :
When I was First Lady , I personally helped that little chicken to cross the road .
This experience makes me
uniquely qualified to ensure right from Day One ! — that every chicken in this country gets the chance it
deserves to cross the road .
But then , this really is n’t about me …….
GEORGE W. BUSH :
We do n’t really care why the chicken crossed the road .
We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of
the road , or not .
The chicken is either against us , or for us .
There is no middle ground here .
COLIN POWELL :
Now to the left of the screen , you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road …
ANDERSON COOPER – CNN :
We have reason to believe there is a chicken , but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other
side of the road .
JOHN KERRY :
Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road , I am now against it !
It was the wrong road to cross , and
I was misled about the chicken ’s intentions .
I am not for it now , and will remain against it .
NANCY GRACE :
That chicken crossed the road because he ’s GUILTY !
You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks .
PAT BUCHANAN :
To steal the job of a decent , hardworking American .
MARTHA STEWART :
No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going .
I had a standing order at the Farmer ’s Market
to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level .
No little bird gave me any insider information .
JERRY FALWELL :
Because the chicken was gay !
Ca n’t you people see the plain truth ? ’
That ’s why they call it the ‘ other side . ’
Yes ,
my friends , that chicken is gay .
And if you eat that chicken , you will become gay too .
I say we boycott all chickens
until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media white washes with seemingly harmless phrases like ‘ the other
side .
That chicken should not be crossing the road .
It ’s as plain and as simple as that .
GRANDPA :
In my day we did n’t ask why the chicken crossed the road .
Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road ,
and that was good enough .
BARBARA WALTERS : Is n’t that interesting ?
In a few moments , we will be listening to the chicken tell ,
for the first time , the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting , and went on to accomplish
its life long dream of crossing the road .
ARISTOTLE :
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road .
ALBERT EINSTEIN :
Did the chicken really cross the road , or did the road move beneath the chicken ?
BILL CLINTON :
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken .
What is your definition of chicken ?
DICK CHENEY :
Where ’s my gun ?
AL SHARPTON :
Why are all the chickens white ?
We need some black chickens .

I 'm both a consumer and a publisher of Google Adsense advertising on the Web and even though Web advertising makes me some money by publishing ads on this blog and in a few other places around this site , both publishing and providing ads feels like a bit of black magic over which I have only a tiny bit of control .
Buying Advertising
But let 's start with the part that really gets my goat , which is the buying of advertising .
As a small software vendor with a number of products I 've some time ago turned to Web advertising with Google because the magazine market at which I had frequently advertised in the past has simply disappeared .
When I first started advertising on Google I noticed by tracking requests and tracking sales that it was bringing a fair bit of traffic my way , but the longer it has gone on the less value I see from this advertising to the point today that I seriously question the value of it at all .
In fact the count of incoming links are getting less and the quality of them is drastically degrading while the cost seems to be rising .
A couple of months ago I started in earnest tracking the advertising hits that Google generates for me .
And what I found is not a happy picture .
About 30 - 40 % of the traffic generated - ie .
the traffic that I pay for - comes from link farms , that is Web pages that have nothing more than a bunch of links that redirect to Google Adsense links .
Another 10 % or so does n't have referring links at all so I can't track the source which is also pretty suspicious .
This means that almost half of the traffic that Google generates is either worthless or not tractable .
As to link farms :
It 's places like this ( I did n't link them here explictly to not encourage any more traffic their way < g > )
http://www.sedoparking.com/netputergameresource.net
http://www.htmlcrazy.com/
http://www.1net1dream.org/
http://seg.com/
http://www.windgouru.com/home.php?pid=&rr=&ref=&ff=ffyy
http://www.maviportal.com/sinema.asp
http://www.sladecentral.com/
These come straight out of my link capture log and you can probably see a common theme in a few of these links .
In fact , it looks like a few of these are probably hosted by the same companies .
There hundreds of links like this in my log and the domain names and links often vary slightly covering all sorts of weird words and domain mistypes .
Windgouru.com for example is a mistype of windguru.com which is a Windsurf wind forecast site ( that I happen to visit frequently < g > ) .
But as you might suspect - other than the Wind part in my company name and my hobby - windsurfing has little to do with goes on on this site .
Even the photoalbum which does contain some windsurf related pictures and jabber is only a tiny little part of my site .
So - that windgouru.com link is really going to help my bottom line , right ?
Granted Web advertising is a bit like aiming buckshot at 100 feet out , but the fact that there 's a link farm and it's not even hitting a primary target that I 'm paying for - well it pisses me off .
Somebody ( mostly Google ) is making 80 cents to a dollar a click of that shit that I 'm paying for .
It 's the same with most of the link parking sites .
They have zero value to advertisers even if they do send you traffic because it 's very likely that the traffic they do send is either completely mistargeted or - in my opinion just as like - illegally clicked .
Let 's look at this from the Link Park operator - their only profit motive is to get as many people as possible to come to their site and click on links .
There 's no content creation , there 's not even an attempt at capturing customers , it 's just thousands of pages of links generated by computer on thousands of different IP addresses that essentially prey on web browsers who mistype a link .
The only reason these sites exist is to make Adsense revenue .
Nothing else .
How far removed is the idea to use those same thousands of IP addresses and computers to randomly ( in relatively low volume ) have these links clicked ?
It 'd be pretty damn tough for Google or any other advertisers to track low frequency links that are spread out amongst a few hundred thousand Web page .
Add to that IP spoofing and you have a potentially profitable business on your hands .
I sent an email to Google Adsense support and asked about Link Parking sites and what their policy is in regards to counting these hits towards paying clicks .
The response was essentially a shrug of the shoulder : Yeah , we know about it and they are legal , and sure you have to pay for these links .
In fact the support tech was trying to convince me that these Link Parking site links do better conversions than ' regular ' links .
Better for whom ?
For Google ?
Sure , people will click on links to get out of the fucked up link park , but it 's doubtful they do so because they actually want to go to my site or become a potential customer .
So Google 's answer to get around this problem : Block the sites in the AdSense manager .
IOW , let me figure it out .
Since there are literally hundreds of sites and that the sites keep changing that 's hardly practical .
Most advertisers probably have no idea where their ad dollars are actually going and Google is n't providing much of anything in terms of information how the advertising dollar was actually applied .
I know looking at my link logs , I can tell that Google is clearly metering my clicks exactly to pay out the maximum amount of my highest bid I specify for an ad campaign in the Adsense Manager .
Day after day I see EXACTLY 14 clicks of this product and 22 of another which means , that even though bidding is supposed to be competitive , it almost always ends up at the highest bidding rate .
Looking at the click through hit chart from Google hits on my site is like looking at the consistency of clockwork that matches the very top end of my ad bids .
This also means Google - for all its supposed ' security ' and watch dog operations - is rarely if ever deducting clicks from my account .
After I pushed the tech I was talking to I got a spreadsheet with adjusted clicks from the rep .
A whopping 100 adjustments out of 120,000 clicks .
Yet on the other end - when serving ads here - there seem to be regular adjustments and it ain't me clicking my own Adsense links .
The fact that I see the above domains repeatedly and consistently , and that the pages have very little content and certainly no content that has anything related to the products I 'm supposedly advertising there , is a pretty good indication that this is bogus and clearly Google is not keeping up its end of the bargain to ensure click fraud checking .
Yet the domains persist and Google does n't care - and why should they , really ?
Google has no financial interest in shutting down link farms like this .
They make Google a shitload of money even while it practically invites link fraud .
The other End of it : Publishing Ads
I also use Google to make a little money from ads I run on this site .
While I also use a couple of .NET specific advertisers - mainly Steven Smith 's Lake Quincy .NET Network and The Lounge - I also use Google here on the WebLog and in various other places on this site where .NET only content is not appropriate .
Mainly I use all of these to provide a little variety .
The .NET content is not various enough and the Google ads provide a little additional content that makes the ad content maybe a little more varied .
All of the combined advertising pays the hosting bill and a little more actually .
I have to admit I fretted putting advertising on this site at all , because - well , I hate advertising .
But given that I put out a large amount effort into publishing content I thought I 'd see how advertising would work out and given that it brings in enough to pay the operational bills plus a bit extra it 's hard to throw that away .
It 's by no means a major part of my income but it 's also enough to be too tempting to ignore .
So at least some of this advertising income comes from Google .
Google tracks ad display and clicks and at times I take a look and see how things are going and try to make adjustments .
Over the last few days you might have seen a few adjustments here with ads running a little more prominently due to some experimentation with ad formats ( which surprisingly has resulted in some fairly big increases in rotations and clicks ) .
So I went to the site yesterday during the day to find that there was a good number of clicks and a fairly high dollar amount of commissions for the day .
Then the next day I happened back to the site and checked the totals which were significantly less .
And I have to wonder how the fuck that can be since it sure is n't me clicking on my own ads ?
Google supposedly monitors traffic and clicks and makes ' adjustments ' to clicks and rotations that it deems fraudulent .
Now I know I 'm not clicking on my own ads , so I it 's not me , but who IS doing the fraudulent clicking then ?
I can't think of anybody else who could possibly benefit from clicking on the ads or causing ads to be displayed in a way that might be construed as fraudulent .
A while back I thought maybe it's robots that somehow manage to get to pages and click links but due to the way Google and most other ad services serve ads , but that 's highly unlikely because ads are served through JavaScript script links that robots ignore .
So if it 's not me , and not robots what could possibly account for these adjustments of more than 30 % at times .
Checking back a few days now I see adjustments frequently days although the adjustments are not quite as drastic .
On my ads that I pay on I had a 100 ads adjusted against well over well over 100,000 ads served , yet on my ad publishing the ratio is measure by well over 10 % ?
What gives ?
The real frustrating part though is that you really can't get any decent information out of Google unless you contact them and discuss with a tech .
If I screw around with Google Analytics I can see how ads are served when and where etc . but it does n't really tell me if clicks are removed or why or even how the rates are applied .
A lot of times the relation of traffic to hits or clicks is so completely out of whack ( one day I have 10 clicks and $ 15 another day I have a 100 clicks and it 's only $ 5 ) .
Getting information on why adjustments have been made have never been made clear as where links where served from and if there are adjustments what they are made for .
If you just check your stats after the fact you may never actually know that adjustments were actually made .
In the end it feels like black magic .
Google ( and other advertisers as well to be fair ) control the process so completely that if there 's any foul play either on Google 's part or for cheating publishers that contest clicks on the other end there 's almost no real way to tell that it 's happening and unless you have the time to keep very close tabs on it there 's no way to follow the money all the way through - on both ends .
And who has that kind of time ?
Advertising : The Evil Cousin Nobody Wants but Everybody Uses
Web Advertising is a necessary evil for the availability of free content .
To be honest I do n't really understand how we got to the point that Google is as big of a company as it is because of advertising .
Seriously , how many of you actually pay attention to ads - any savvy Web browser these days has some mechanism to block out ads both physically at the computer , not to mention the mental blocking we all apply to ads to ignore the irrelevant content on page ?
All this effort to provide ads that most people ignore .
I really wonder how many clicks on ads are really of a potential customer vs. fraudulent , frivolous or accidential click .
I suspect the number is really , really low .
And at 80 cents to a dollar that 's an expensive wasted click !
Ultimately I really question how much value Google advertising provides these days to advertisers ?
I 'd be curious to hear from others how well ADVERTISING with Google or other similar service ( Yahoo , Micorosoft ) is working for them using what amounts to small budget advertising .
Yet we still continue to publish ads because there 's obviously a small profit motive for ad publishers .
More for some than others .
I imagine in some third world countries even a small profit from AdSense amounts to a huge amount of income .
And it 's not surprising to see that many of the link farms originate in low income areas of Southeast Asia and other low income areas of the world .
A whole industry exists around advertising on the web and exploiting Google ( but actually exploiting advertisers - Google actually benefits ) any way they possibly can .
It seems just too easy to spoof the system with the current technology .
Web Advertising is at the root of a lot of the things that are wrong with the Web today .
It 's a scammers game especially when you look at AdSense .
On the one hand it 's enabled everyone to advertise in ways that was n't previously possible .
But on the other you have this wild west mentality where the distributed publishing puts advertising in unexpected places where the value might be quite debatable .
It 's a long way from targeted advertising if you compare it to more traditional means like magazine advertising .
The fact that it 's so easy to be a publisher and that the electronic medium is so easy to spoof makes it a big fat target for scammers trying to make a buck off - well nothing in many cases .
Case in point are link farms .
As an advertiser I have a hard time seeing the value anymore , at least recently .
Some time ago the targeting worked pretty well and I ended up with a good number of leads .
These days the ' hit ' ratio of bad links that are actually hitting what I would consider the right target audience is getting much worse , while the prices for advertising have shot up through bidding wars .
It 's a pretty sucky proposition and I 've cut way back on my Web advertising recently because of it .
But truth be told I do n't really know of many alternatives other than using a different advertising service .
I suppose Google is the biggest target for scamming the system since it has the biggest network and most variety .
So maybe a smaller network might provide better results .
It 's too damn easy to cheat
It seems to me that the way Web advertising works is so fickle that it simply invites publishers and the big advertising companies to cheat .
It 's way too easy to cheat and the sad part is that it can be pretty profitable .
All the advertising for the most trivial content is everywhere .
If a little rinky dink site like mine can do $ 300 + a month in advertising revenue ( combined for all providers ) for very little targeted effort , imagine what an organized effort could do .
I could probably do better if I 'd do a little research but frankly it 's not financially worth the extra effort .
Certainly having lots of content helps , but having lots of bogus content in link farms is all too easy to create and scam off of .
I see nothing wrong with sites that have actual useful content and display advertising off of that - that 's plenty fair even if it's a bit out of control on many sites .
But unless my tracking data is just unusual there 's getting to be less and less quality content to go around with more and more crap springing up just to invite ad content linking .
And even the quality of good content is going down - in order to drive advertising .
For example , you 've been to one of these sites I 'm sure :
There are two paragraphs of an article on a page one and 10 more ' pages ' to wade through all of which are loaded to the max with advertising on all sides so that you actually have to search for the actual content .
Most of the time the content on these sites is barely valuable - like somebody copied the content from a book and reworded it just so there could be some content out there to drive the ads .
All this crap is targeted at advertising is making it harder and harder to find the good content when searching .
And just this last week Google announced that they are actually going to punish publishers who publish large pages ( ie. likely REAL content that is useful and not cut up to maximize ad revenue ) by weighting down pages that are long ( in terms of content size ) and reduce them in search priority .
So much for ' only do good ' .
Corporate crap like anybody else .
How did we get here ?
The advertising means have become an end in itself that now outweighs the original premise for many operations .
I 'd be interested to hear other 's experiences are with Google or other ad providers .

DENVER ( Reuters ) - A man whose murder conviction was based on gruesome sketches he made as a 15 - year - old boy was freed from prison on Tuesday after DNA evidence from the body was found to match the victim ’s ex-boyfriend and not the convicted man .
Timothy Masters , 36 , had served nine and a half years of a life sentence for the 1987 murder of Peggy Hettrick in Fort Collins , Colorado , about 45 miles north of Denver .
Masters was convicted and sentenced to life in 1999 for the crime .
The mutilated body of Hettrick , 37 , was found in a field near where Masters lived .
He was 15 at the time .
Although police focused on the boy at the time of the killing , he was n’t arrested until 1998 , when a forensic psychologist reviewed sketches Masters had made .
He was tried and convicted based on the circumstantial evidence , and an appellate court upheld his conviction and sentence .
The case was reopened last year , amid allegations that evidence was withheld from his defense team .
The case took a dramatic turn late last week , when a special prosecutor announced that traces of DNA from Hettrick ’s body did not match Masters .
There was , however , a match to Hettrick ’s ex-boyfriend , who was dismissed as a suspect early in the case .
Master ’s attorney , David Wymore , said he would ask that prosecutors dismiss the charges against his client .
“ I ’m pretty overwhelmed and just want to see my family , ” a smiling Masters told reporters after his release .
He was the first inmate in Colorado to be released from prison after DNA testing pointed to his innocence .
Docstoc , a service for embedding documents in web pages , has raised $ 3.25 million in fresh capital from Rustic Canyon Partners , following an angel round of $ 750,000 that we reported on late last year .
While Docstoc and rival Scribd tout their respective services as ways to share documents and engage your community – especially with us social media types – I see the value much more as their ability to eventually kill the notion of attaching files to emails , or linking people to downloads .
Email attachments are annoying – they slow down your computer , often do n’t work ( especially between Office ’08 users and non-users ) , and , if you do n’t have proper virus protection , can be instant system death .
Embeddable docs , on the other hand , allow you to embed everything from PowerPoints to PDF files onto a web page ( example below ) , which eliminate all of the above problems and pet peeves .
For me , and a lot of folks who frequently deal with attachments , I think this is the big value proposition of Docstoc and Scribd , however , it ’s not presently the primary way they pitch the service or plan to make money .
One way Docstoc does plan to make money is with a new Content Partnership Program that they announced along with their funding news .
This program allows content uploaders to include advertising , or sell premium content ( Scribd offers something similar with their recent iPaper launch ) .
For Docstoc , this makes a lot of sense , since they focus on “ professional ” documents – saving people time on finding templates for contracts and other types of business docs is something that has already been proven by others as a viable business model .
In a sense , this is a replacement for online white papers , research reports , and eBooks , which are typically marketed and sold as PDFs – a step in the right direction for eliminating unnecessary downloads , but not “ the death of attachments ” that I dream about .
However , my dreams may soon come true as Docstoc moves towards opening up an API for developers .
For example , imagine an application or plugin that automatically converted email attachments into embedded docs instead .
That ’s the type of service people would pay for , and one that could make both the developer and Docstoc a lot of money .
An API and partnerships with the types of software companies that could make such convenience possible are both on tap for DocStoc this year , according to CEO Jason Nazar .
While there is plenty of value in what Docstoc and Scribd currently do – which is connect people to information previously trapped in downloads – the value of what they could do in the future is enormous – and something that potentially could be used by every Web user .
Which of these two companies is best positioned to execute on this vision ?
While presently the underdog ( at least in terms of traffic ) , with its focus on professional documents and users , Docstoc might have the edge .
Meanwhile , here ’s Docstoc ’s presentation outlining their new Content Partnership Program , in convenient embedded format :
1 . We are here at RubyConf 2007 , we are here with Jim Weirich .
Jim why do n't we start out with maybe can you introduce yourself , of course you are very popular but still for some watchers who do n't know you .
That will be fine .
My name is Jim Weirich I am from Cincinnati Ohio and I am the Chief Scientist for EdgeCase LLC a Columbus based Rails Development Company .
My background , oh , I have been programming for more years than I am willing to admit .
Lots of languages in my background including things like Fortrean and Lisp of course Java and C++ and those , and I discovered Ruby about eight years ago .
I remember it was the year 2000 and Dave Thomas made an off hand comment about this little language that he had discovered , and I just got on reading the " Pragmatic Programmer " book and so Dave Thomas likes this Ruby thing , sounds interesting , so let 's go and see what it is like .
So I downloaded it and loved it immediately .
It was exactly what I was looking for , to kind of replace all the tool building stuff I was doing in Perl , I wanted something that would grow a little more naturally , had a little better data structure support and abstraction capability .
And Ruby was just exactly what I wanted at the time .
So I fell in love with it and have been doing Ruby programming since then for fun and for tool support just recently now for a profit .
2 . That 's good .
And you have added a lot to the Ruby community with your Rake tool .
Could you thoroughly explain what Rake does ?
Rake is a version of Make in Ruby .
If you are familiar with the Unix Make tools you tell it to build things and it goes out and figures out what it needs and puts them together and builds up exactly what needs to be done to build a program or to do a project , or to do anything actually .
And I was really frustrated with Make one day because I needed to do something just a little more dynamic than it was really needed , or that it really support it and I turned to the guy that was working with it and said : " Would n't it be great if Make were written in Ruby " and my friend says " I guess , but I have no idea what you are talking about " .
So I turned around to the white board and I quickly sketched out what a task would look like in Ruby , you would say " task " and then you would give it a name , and then you give it the dependencies then you have a lambda , a block body where you specify what the actions were .
He said " That 's brilliant , we agree that it would be wonderful to have but that no one would really take the time to build something like that , because we have to re-implement Make and there is lots of stuff in Make , and just to have it in Ruby would n't be worth doing it at all " .
So he went back to his desk and I sat there for a few minutes and started thinking what would it really take to implement something like Make in Ruby .
And I sketched something out and in about half an hour or so I came back to my friend 's desk and said " Pull up your terminal I sent you an email , you got to see this " and he pulled out the first beginnings of Rake right there , in just one page of code was the whole Rake engine right there and that 's what started it , just a very simple beginning and it grew very naturally from that .
4 . Was it the first big use ?
Well Rake was out there probably a year before Rails was around but David Heinemeier Hansson decided to use Rake as the builder for Rails itself .
So I always thank David that every time someone downloads Rails they also have to get a copy of Rake to go along with it .
So that 's kept my download counts really high on RubyForge .
And it also really exposed Rake to a lot of people who would n't have seen it otherwise .
5 . So it has become quite important , so important that it is actually considered for inclusion in Ruby 1.9 .
Can you describe what kind of process you are going through with that , if you have to do any changes for it ?
There has been a lot of discussion on exactly how we are going to include Rake into 1.9 .
We have not really decided on a concrete thing yet , but the general feeling is that however it gets in and it is going to be bundled with 1.9 so when you get 1.9 and all its goodies Rake will just come with it automatically .
But we wanted to make sure that however it is bundled in , when new versions of Rake become available it will be easy to upgrade them , you wo n't be stuck with the , we wo n't tie the version of Rake to a version of Ruby , you will be able to update Rake independently .
Whatever the mechanisms are , we are going to make sure that happens .
6 . Which version is Rake now at ?
Oh , your question is funny because I do n't remember version numbers very well .
It 's last than one 1.0 , I think it 's 0.7 maybe , seven something , I always just go and look because I never remember version numbers .
7. So is Rake 1.0 going to coincide with the inclusion in Ruby 1.9 ?
No , there 's a couple of features I want to get into Rake before I am ready to call it 1.0 , and we are not going to get them in before 1.9 is ready .
Whatever goes within 1.9 is essentially where Rake stands right now .
We have to do a little bit of work in Rake .
My understanding is that it does n't work in 1.9 right now , and some of my homework I have to do after the conference here is go back and figure out exactly what those incompatibilities are and see if we can get those ironed out .
8 . What can we look forward in Rake 1.0 , what new features ?
Near term , very near term before 1.0 , you will get command line arguments in Rake and that 's something people have been asking for a long time I kind of resisted mainly because the typical way of doing command line arguments is just to list parameters out on the command line and want those arguments to be passed in , but there 's a question since you can have multiple tasks in the command line as well , how would the arguments match up with the tasks ?
And I did n't see a really easy way of specifying that .
And then there 's an additional question : how do you pass arguments around from one task to another ?
How do you do that ?
So there are two issues that were really needed to be resolved .
Someone suggested to me a couple of months ago which kind of led to this whole , actually putting in argument passing , maybe you could just pass them like functional parameters , put a parenthesis or a comma to the arguments and tie them to the task and then you could say say Rake , the name of your task , for example " test " , you have a test target , and then you in parenthesis paste the name of the test you want to run .
Or for db : migrate in Rails , instead of saying version equals what version you want to migrate to , you put that in some kind of parenthesis , on that argument and then you know which parameters go with which task name , I thought that was a great idea and we are doing that with the only difference that instead parenthesis , since parenthesis start sub shells on a uni shell , that was n't a real good idea , but square brackets worked great .
It is kind of Ruby - ish too because that 's how you call lambdas with square brackets .
The new version of Rake will allow you to put a square bracket on your task names and pass on parameters to specific tasks just like that .
9 . Any other big features in 1.0 ?
The next big feature is that after that is done I really want to work on a plug - in system for Rake .
What I really want to enable is for folks to share their Rake tasks very easily and I am not quite sure how exactly that is going to be working .
I have been thinking about this for actually a number of years , and have n't really come down with strong decisions but we are going to hammer the details here .
There are some things I want to see here : number one I think that plug-ins need to be distributed as gems .
So we solved all the distribution problems , we just tie on to the gem mechanism , if you want a plug in it 's a simple gem installing , then you 're done , you 've got it , and then we 'll make that plug - in available to all your Rake tasks anywhere in your system .
That being said , there needs to be some kind of protocol that exists between Rake and the plug - in so that we can get it initialized properly and we get it parameterized properly .
And I am thinking something very simple here , I know Rails plug-ins , all you have to do is create a init.rb in the top level directory and then it gets run .
Something similar to that , but there might me a little more involved , because we want to make sure that the plug - in itself is initialized and then the plug-ins are generally used , for example in Rake right now , we have a test task module that we use to easily create a set of test driven targets for Rake .
Other than that the name test task is a really bad choice for a name , and I take full blame for that , what that does it 's actually not a task but it 's a builder of tasks .
And it will build up the Rake tasks there and with whatever names you give them wire up all the dependencies between those tasks , plug-ins are going to want to do that kind of thing as well .
So we are going to have a way of having those builders run from your plug-ins , so you need to initialize your plug - in , you have to be able to run the builders from the plug - in in some ways , so we are going to come up with some syntax to cover that up as well .
Those are the two big things that we want to get together for the plug-ins , but the key is to make it easy for people to share Rake tasks .
10 .
Rake is one of the big examples for one of the strengths for Ruby , building Domain Specific Languages .
It has been quoted and used by Martin Fowler as a big example for embedded Domain Specific Languages .
Domain Specific Languages hype has been going on for some years .
What 's your point , what 's your view on that ?
It 's really funny because I argued with a friend just last night on exactly what is a Domain Specific Language and I feel the term has probably been overused .
I like to consider a Domain Specific Language to be something that talks about a domain , a problem domain , such as configuring workflow to solve some business problems or talking about , now I am dry for examples , but something that is business related in the problem space .
And I see a lot of us using Domain Specific Languages to solve programmer problems , which are really problems in the solution space .
And Rake is kind of in that solution space problem , I guess you could say it 's solving the domain of " how to run tasks " but that 's so wrapped up in programmers speak , I 'm not really sure Rake is a strong example of a domain specific language .
And to me it 's a whole continuum that you are dealing with , you have got everything from nice well designed libraries to something that is a DSL , a Domain Specific Language and Rake falls somewhere in the middle of that , somewhere .
It 's more than just a library , because it provides a little bit of framework , and it makes it a little declarative , but then it 's really addressing a domain that only programmers care about , not a domain that you want to solve business problems in , so that 's kind of where I fall on that whole situation .
11 . So basically you are thinking that the domain is something that a user or business user should see ?
Yes , because what I want to use a DSL for is I want to be able to take a problem that a user comes to me and he says : " Look , I am a lawyer and I have all these legal constructs that I need to deal with .
Can we come up with a way of constructing contracts for me that we use terminology , in creating a DSL that might do that ? "
Or I might be talking to an insurance firm that has " We have this kind of policy and that kind of policy and we need to be able to put a policy together quickly and come up with a price structure for it " .
And create a DSL that describes it .
I do n't think that the business person needs to be able to write the DSL , but I should be able to write it in the DSL , show it to a business person and they can say : ‘" Yes , that 's what I want " and it is something that is immediately obvious to them that it solves their problem domain .
It 's Domain Specific Language and if it is not addressing a domain , the term DSL seams kind of loose for me .
12 . It 's just a specific language .
Yes , a specific language , exactly .
Maybe we got Domain Specific Languages and maybe a Problem Specific Languages , maybe Rake is a PSL , forget I said that .
14 .
So what would be a cut of point where , you said you had to have a range ?
A range , yes .
So if you have a DSL at one end it 's something that you can show a business person and someone who is knowledgeable about the domain we are talking about , they can read it and understand it , I think a DSL falls at that end of the spectrum .
I think you have nice libraries down here at this other hand of the spectrum and a lot of things fall into that .
I think Flexmockock , for example , is a great fluid language for specifying how to mock out things , but that 's very programmer specific , it 's a library , it 's not a DSL in my terms , but it 's a really nice interface for doing that kinds of things .
So I think you can have libraries with good interfaces but that does n't necessarily make them DSLs , certainly dropping parenthesis off a library call does n't make it a DSL .
15 .
You also provided the Builder library , first of all would you consider the Builder library to be a DSL or ?
I could see that coming .
So what domain are we talking about ?
Writing XML .
Is XML a problem domain , a business domain ?
I do n't think so .
So I would say that Builder is an excellent library with a really cool interface , a really good interface , but I do n't think it 's a DSL in that sense so my use of DSL I like to be a little more strict with it .
But let me emphasize that doing stuff like Builder and Rake and Flexmock that 's good Ruby programming , and whether they are DSLs or not , or whether you call them DSLs or not , is not really that important .
Being able to write that kind of code where the interface is clean , and obvious to the person who is using it , I mean that 's a really great feature of Ruby .
16 . Would it be better to call it meta - programming , use the term meta - programming for that ?
Or is that specific in another way ?
Meta - programming is another specific term that I think sometimes gets misused or overused .
Meta - programming is programming about programming , or writing programs that manipulate or write other programs , and that 's certainly something you do in Ruby all the time .
But I would n't think that those things we just listed are instances of meta- programming .
17 . Talking about Builder , for Builder you faced some problems with using method , method missing .
What was the solution to that ?
The basic problem in Builder is that the vocabulary that Builder deals with is wide open .
Builder basically allows you to generate XML , and you have a Builder object and you call a method to it .
Whatever method you call the name of the method becomes a tag in your output XML .
Since the vocabulary of XML is wide open , and tags can be any valid string , any XML ID , the number of methods that you call , you can't pre-calculate what those are .
So Builder has to allow you to send in any method and respond to it .
And that works great using the method missing technique in Ruby .
Except where the method is n't actually missing .
If you want to create an XML tag that has the same name as a built - in method in Ruby that 's on Object , than the Builder object will call in the build in method rather than generating the tag that you want .
And that 's the problem that I was running into , I wanted to have Builder be an object but without all the garbage in the Object name space .
So blank slate was a technique we came up with , that essentially blank slate goes and removes all the methods from itself , it iterates through its instance methods , and here we are talking about meta - programming , this is meta - programming ; walking through the list of methods and removing them so that by time it 's loaded blank slate has no methods on it at all , except a handful of very system specific messages which you really should n't redefine anyways .
So , if I inherit from blank slate , which Builder does , then I got an object that has only the very minimal number of system specific messages supported on it , and everything else is undefined .
Which makes it , I do n't know if you have ever worked with Builder , in IRB but it makes it really strange to work with it like that , because you create a Builder object and if you let it be the last thing in the command line of IRB , IRB takes it and wants to print it out .
So sends it inspect so all of a sudden you are out there inspect tags appearing in XML because I abused interacting with your object as well .
Makes Builder kind of a hard object to manipulate , because it does n't act like a regular Ruby object .
But for the purpose that it was designed that 's exactly what you want , you do n't want it to be a regular Ruby object .
18 . So which objects , which methods still remain in the blank slate objects ?
Well there are two for sure : there is under __id__ , which is the build in method that returns the object id for an object , and then there is __send__ , which sends a message , those are build in for every object really should n't be messed with , the system level methods .
And I think there 's a third one , I think we leave instance_eval in there , because having that available turns out to be very handy in blank slate , and it 's probably unlikely that you are going to have an XML tag called instance_eval so I figured that one was safe as well .
We also have some mechanisms in there that you can dynamically reinstate methods , so if you really want to have to_s available on a blank state there 's ways of going in and reinstating those kind of things .
19 .
Talking about your projects , you mentioned Flexmock .
What 's Flexmock ?
Flexmock is a mocking framework that we use for testing , and this is actually a very old library , it 's been around a long time and like I say I learnt test driven design and Ruby about the same time , so the whole test driven approach and Ruby went very well together for me .
When I was doing this a lot of my testing I was looking around for a mocking framework and I remember it was just after OOPSLA 2001 I saw a Java marking framework called EasyMock .
It was really the first time I have seen a mock framework and was really impressed with how easy at least in Java it was to create these mock , I thought there should be something in Ruby .
And I looked around and I found a mocking framework for Ruby , and I started using it , and I was a little disappointed with it , it was called rmock and I do n't think it 's around anymore , but it was very specific in how it accepted methods being called on it .
If you defined a method , mocked method A and then mocked method B , when you used that you had to call method A and method B in exactly that order , and it was very strict about how the methods were resolved and I found it really inflexible .
So I wanted a marking framework that was more flexible than that , so hence Flexmock and the interface from Flexmock is really evolved over time , the original interface was n't very good , but as we used it and learnt by it we stole ideas from JMock and the Java framework , when the Mocha and Stubba came along we stole some ideas from that and crossed pollinated at each other .
The interface changed over time and we constantly finds ways of improving that and putting little things into it , what I really want Flexmock to be is a mocking framework that solves your problems , I do n't want to restrict you into a particular kind of mold , or doing it exactly my way or exactly that way .
So I wanted it to be flexible so a lot of different people can use it to meet their needs .
20 .
What would be a quick explanation of the mocking concept ?
What does Flexmock provide ?
When you test an object , a good object oriented program has objects that collaborate with each other so one object will talk to that object will talk to this object over here .
But when you test an object , you do n't want to have to create the entire infrastructure of a program to deal with that .
So , you want to just test this object without everything else involved , so you use a mock to stand in for the object set , objects and the testers communicated with , and that allows you to cut it of at one level of interaction .
And that is essentially the whole point of that .
So you create an object create a couple of mock and then you can test the code in this very thoroughly .
The mocks allow you things that would n't be available otherwise if you are actually using real life code .
For example , if I am testing a web framework that goes across the web and grabs something , brings something back , first of all it will be slow , using a mock would be much faster than that , your tests would run much faster , second of all I can control what errors are returned by your mock , so if I have exception handling in my object under test , I can return bad data from my web service and make sure that my exception here and my code is tested , and is much easier to get good code coverage using mocked frameworks .
22 . Can you say anything about BDD , Behavior Driven Development , another acronym ?
What 's the crucial difference ?
The crucial difference is that there really is n't a difference .
I see it 's a change in terminology that changes your focus .
Behavior Driven Design concentrates on writing specifications and avoids the words : test or assert .
So it 's really used and it changes it to words like context and specification , and should , and those kinds of things .
But essentially , there are very similar , and if you are doing good Test Driven Design it 's almost identical to doing Behavior Driven Design , at least in my point of view .
The difference is in the tools really ; because the approach is the same the tools are what 's different and how they focus the efforts .
A BDD type framework like RSpec which is really great and I really love it , and actually I love it for different reasons that other people , that 's interesting , it lets you focus on behavior and specifying without using the word test .
I think if you are using Test Unit right now in Ruby and you have not looked at RSpec you should look at RSpec and use it for a while , get used to it and understand it and then if you do n't like it , go back to Test Unitthat 's fine but what I have found is that when I looked at RSpec it really changed the way I approached my Test Unitwork as well .
My test methods became shorter and more focused on exactly on what they were testing or specifying and my method names became longer .
So my Test Unit stuff started to look a lot like my BDD stuff as well .
23 . Did you use TDD and BDD simultaneously ?
Do you use Test Unit and RSpec or you just use Rspec ?
I would say the tool is not the important thing is how you use the tool , and I tend to use both tools in the same way .
But using both of them helps shape the better way to deal with .
Does that make sense ?
24 .
You used both of them at the same project ?
No , I mean being able to switch and getting experience in both of them , are really shaped the proper way to do it .
And it helped me become more focused when I was using test unit .
25 . So BDD removes the word test so people do n't confuse it with functional testing ?
Right and people who are first coming into the test driven thing , by using RSpec you lose the focus of writing the testing portion of it and you get down to writing specifications , which is what we do in Test Unit anyway .
A good test driven design is actually writing specifications and then writing code , it 's an important piece of that is the tight red green refractor loop .
You write a test , you write a little bit of code , you write a test that fails , you write a little bit of code that makes it pass , you clean up your code then you write another test or specification , depends what the tool calls it , but the cycle is the same whether you are using Test Unit or RSpec so to me it's not the tool that is important is that red green refactoring cycle .
And that 's critical , if you get that then you are getting it whatever tool you are using .
27 .
What is X10 just to explain ?
X10 is a protocol for home automation , essentially you plug X10 units into the wall sockets of your house , all over your house , and they communicate with each other over your electrical wire , it 's like network in your power system .
And it 's used for really exciting things like turning lamps on and of , or running security cameras , or sending various simple commands over the wire like that , it 's very slow , it 's not a high speed network by any means , but you do simple things , like controlling house hold appliances and lamps and things like that .
28 . And your library did what exactly ?
There is a small X10 interface called the CM17A firecracker module that plugs in the serial port of a computer , and allows the computer to talk to the little module , it 's really about that big , and that contains a radio transmitter in it that transmits to a receiver unit that plugs into the wall , so your computer is not plugged into any electrical outlet through your serial port which I think is a good thing , but just uses a radio transmitter to transmit to that which then rebroadcasts the X10 protocol information over your house wire to communicate with everything else , so from your computer you can the turn on the lamp over there , turn your TV off when you go to sleep or use it to control anything you want to .
All my library did was take the C code that would drive the firecrack unit , which had a bizarre protocol , it 's a serial device but you do n't talk to it using the serial in and out lines , you actually toggle the two hand shake flow control signals and you toggle them in such a way that the baud rate is real slow , it 's bizarre .
And so it 's very timing oriented , so that code is actually written in C and all my library did was wrap that C code in some Ruby wrappers so that you could call that and send on and off commands from your Ruby code .
29 .
And I understand that , as a good TDD person , you used that for automation ?
Continuous integration and notification .
So we could set up a continuous integration process that when it failed it would turn on a red lamp or turn an alarm or a ringing signal or embed a compile in test passed they will turn up a green lamp .
This is a brief collection of quotes from significant historical individuals .
Some are contemporary and some are hundreds of years old .
Of course there 's always the context and this is certainly a very small sample , but what they all have in common is the claim ( typically based on a lifetime of experience & research ) is that democracy is social trash for the elites .
Call it the Council for Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , call it " what 's really going on behind the scenes " , or call it what you wish , but the deadly truth of all these quotes ( to use contemporary words ) is that the vampire elites are in absolute control of EVERYTHING .
Relative to their limitless power , all politics and elections are like smashed bugs on a windshield .
Does this mean everything is hopeless ?
Well . . . it probably meant that before our " electronic saint " the internet .
But the internet has given the human race power beyond imagining , since the vampire elites need the darkness of secrecy to do their filth , but the internet is like a KNOWLEDGE SUN that just keeps getting the human race more and more connected , and when we get connected ENOUGH ( which is inevitable ) , then our colossally focused and financed efforts to claim our God given and Constitutionally give birthrights will lead to the most radical paradigm shift in the human condition for the last 6,000 years .
Here 's the quotes :
( 1. ) " If the American people knew what we have done , they would string us up from the lamp posts . "
George H. W. Bush ( Daddy Bush )
2/07/06
( 2. ) " The prime purpose of the Vietnam War was for depopulation through the use of defoliants such as Agent Orange to cause crop failure and starvation in the population . "
Loran Moret , president of Scientists for Indigenous People .
( 3. ) " My book instead proved that HIV -- wherever it came from -- was a harmless retrovirus that was being used as a cover story to explain / conceal an emerging depopulation operation in the Third World .
HIV was also a cover for other agendas outside the Third World .
As long as AIDS is the target of WHO / UN ' humanitarian ' efforts , the actual causes -- which are easily reversible -- of death in Africa , Asia , and Latin America are allowed to remain and fester and expand . "
Jon Rappoport , internationally known investigative reporter of science and author of ' AIDS Inc , Scandal of the Century ' , 1988 .
Lately John and I have been gnashing our collective teeth every time we see one of the Republican shills on TV repeating , mantra - like , the # 1 GOP Big Lie of the campaign : " Barack Obama is the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate . "
If only !
Actually there are 39 Democrats with more liberal voting records , although Obama does at least beat perennial Bush rubber stamps Holy Joe Lieberman ( CT ) , Ben Nelson ( NE ) and Mary Landrieu ( LA ) .
His voting record -- however you slice it , however you dice it -- points to a solidly mainstream centrist -- and , to be honest , considerably less liberal than ... sssshhhhhhh ...
Hillary .
So how do CNN , CBS , ABC and NBC all allow the paid GOP shills to get away with their Big Lie ?
Good question .
There 's one cooked up National Journal " study " that these clowns keep referring to -- yes the same cloddish National Journal that criticized its own ranking of John Kerry as " the most liberal senator " in 2004 .
This year , their utterly meaningless ranking system , ready - made for Republican smear attacks , defined " liberal " as members who voted , on January 18 , to establish a Senate Office of Public Integrity to handle ethics complaints against senators .
Given the Republican Culture of Corruption that still rules the Beltway , that may be anti-Republican , but what makes it " liberal ? "
Similarly anyone who agreed in mid-March to the final passage of a bill implementing the 9/11 Commission 's Homeland Security recommendations , is suddenly " liberal ? "
And on May 9 , Obama joined many other senators in voting to block individuals from serving on Food and Drug Administration drug advisory panels if they have conflicts of interest .
Let 's hope more Americans start defining liberal this way .
Because to me this all sounds very mainstream , even if John " W " McCain was on the wrong side of each vote .
Heads to Scene of ' Siegelman Crime ' and ' DoJ / Republican Election Takeover ' to Instruct AL Law Institue How to ' Get DoJ Approval for Election - Law Changes '
All on DoJ's Dime ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/8/2008 , 12:48 pm PT
Paging Dan Abrams !
Working on several detailed stories for the moment , so not much time for background on this , but we 'll try to quickly connect a few dots for you .
Much of it the first part here is so amusing and / or ironical on its own , that I suspect it speaks for itself .
At least for anybody who is cursorily familiar with the John " Minorities Die First "
Tanner story , as originally broken by The BRAD BLOG's Alan Breslauer , who video - taped the remarks which led , fairly directly , to Tanner 's embarassing downfall , sad Congressional testimony and eventual resignation as the head of the DoJ 's Civil Rights voting unit .
( Our extensive coverage of the entire mess can be perused here . )
This now from AP [ emphasis ours ] ...
The former chief of the Justice Department 's Voting Rights Section , who stepped aside in December after apologizing for remarks about minority voters , is now working on election - related issues for the Alabama Law Institute .
John Tanner , who is being paid by the Justice Department under a federal program , also will teach at two Alabama law schools .
The law institutes 's president , Alabama House Speaker Pro Tem Demetrius Newton , said he personally contacted Tanner when he heard the long - time voting rights specialist wanted some time away from Washington .
At the institute , a part of the University of Alabama , Tanner 's work includes developing handbooks for public officials on getting Justice Department approval of election - law changes .
" He 's the expert on that , " Newton , D - Birmingham , said Monday .
Expert on that , indeed .
The article goes on to note that the DoJ is " paying Tanner 's salary and benefits to work in Alabama through next spring . "
About which Bob McCurley , director of the Alabama Law Institute , said , " It 's not costing me anything . "
And well worth the price at that !
But that 's not all that should be taken note of here .
There are at least two very important dots that need connecting here between Tanner , Alabama , the Siegelman case and an unprecedented order by the DoJ in 2006 taking away control of elections from the AL Secretary of State and handing it to the Republican Governor who ousted him under , um , less than crystal - clean circumstances ...
Alabama , Tanner 's new home , is also home to both the scandal wherein former Gov. Don Siegelman was apparently railroaded by Republican operatives who allegedly flipped his election on electronic voting systems and then trumped up a case to help send him to prison , and a highly unusual order from the DoJ in 2006 .
In the following rare video , Siegelman alleges --- after going to bed the winner of his ' 02 election to wake the next day to find he had " lost " after a county Republican election director " found , " by himself , thousands of votes on electronic machines in the middle of the night --- that " This election was stolen ... There is no other kind , or sugar - coated way to say it . "
Alabama is also the only place in the United States that we 're aware of where the DoJ ( while Tanner was running the voting section ) , ordered control of elections to move from the Democratic SoS to the Republican Governor .
That point has been largely overlooked throughout the entire Siegelman brouhaha .
From a New York Times editorial on this point , as we originally quoted it in August of 2006 :
President Bush ’s Justice Department has been criticized for letting partisanship guide its work on voting and elections .
And party politics certainly appears to have been a driving force in a legal maneuver it just pulled off in Alabama , where it persuaded a federal judge to take important election powers away from the Democratic secretary of state and give them to a Republican governor .
...
The Justice Department ’s request to shift [ Sec. of State ] Worley ’s powers to Governor Riley is extraordinary .
Normally , the government would seek an order telling a state official what to do , or it would ask to have a nonpartisan person appointed as a special master .
And the Justice Department ’s aggressive stance stands in stark contrast to the forgiving approach it has taken to Republican secretaries of state .
After Katherine Harris removed eligible voters from the rolls in Florida in 2000 , and Kenneth Blackwell tried to block eligible people from registering in Ohio in 2004 , the Justice Department made no effort to limit their powers .
...
The Justice Department has enormous power over state elections .
It is important that this power be used in a way that appears — and is — nonpartisan .
Undercutting a Democratic secretary of state , and taking the extraordinary step of handing her powers to a Republican governor , meets neither test .
The Justice Department is giving the impression that it is less concerned that elections be lawful and fair than that they come out a particular way .
So has anyone ever connected the dots between the unprecedented 2006 DoJ-ordered Republican Gubernatorial takeover of the election system from the Democratic Sec. of State in Alabama and the Siegelman case ?

Court Deems Homeschooling a Criminal Offense
by Steven Greenhut by Steven Greenhut
DIGG THIS
The Pacific Justice Institute in Sacramento sent along a statement about a disturbing California Court of Appeal decision finding that parents have no right to homeschool their children .
Parents who do not send their kids to the school deemed appropriate by the state may face criminal charges and fines .
Remember when former Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin tried to criminalize homeschooling ?
Here we go again .
It ’s ironic , given how badly the government miseducates students , that officials are so determined to criminalize this basic freedom .
This really should n’t shock anyone who realizes the degree to which government at all levels runs our lives .
Here ’s the PJI statement :
Home Schooling Found Unlawful by California Court of Appeal
Los Angeles —
In a stunning decision affecting thousands of families in California , the California Court of Appeal has issued an opinion finding no legal right to home school .
 Parents who fail to [ comply with school enrollment laws ] may be subject to a criminal complaint against them , found guilty of an infraction , and subject to imposition of fines or an order to complete a parent education and counseling program ,  wrote Justice H. Walter Croskey whose opinion was joined by the other two members of the appellate panel .
The opinion was issued February 28 , 2008 , in a case titled In re Rachel L , which reversed a Superior Court Judge , Stephen Marpet , who found that parents have a constitutional right to school their children in their own home .
The parents of Rachel L. enrolled her in Sunland Christian School , a private home schooling program .
In his opinion , Croskey , 75 , described what he called the ruse of enrolling [ children ] in a private school and then letting them stay home and be taught by a non-credentialed parent . 
Despite this statement by the Court , it should be noted that Sunland Christian School has been in full compliance with the requirements of the law for more than twenty years .
 We ’ve never been given an opportunity to represent our case in the Court of Appeal ,  said Terry Neven , the president of the school .
 Consequently , we are excited that PJI will represent us before the California Supreme Court so that the rights of home schooling families are preserved ,  he stated further .
In a section titled  Consequences of Parental Denial of a Legal Education ,  the Court said that parents are subject to being ordered to enroll their children in an appropriate school or education program and provide proof of enrollment to the court , and willful failure to comply with such an order may be punished by a fine for civil contempt . 
 The scope of this decision by the appellate court is breathtaking .
It not only attacks traditional home schooling , but also calls into question home schooling through charter schools and teaching children at home via independent study through public and private schools ,  stated Brad Dacus , president of the Pacific Justice Institute  If not reversed , the parents of the more than 166,000 students currently receiving an education at home will be subject to criminal sanctions ,  he continued .

Meanwhile , back in the day ...
Back in 1998 , when I first began covering hardware at the newly launched Ars Technica , much of my writing focused on issues raised by the raging Mac vs. PC flame wars that took place in computing forums across the Internet .
These flame wars were often centered around the esoteric issue of instruction set architecture ( ISA ) , as partisans on each side argued over which type of ISA was superior — those ISAs based on the RISC philosophy expressed in the PowerPC processors that powered the Mac , or the CISC camp that most think is exemplified by Intel 's x86 processors .
Incidentally , in those last years of the 20th century , dial - up was officially on its way out , and broadband Internet was completing its transformation from The Next Big Thing into a fact of urban life .
The rise of broadband Internet brought about a shift in the way that people used and related to their computers .
The " home PC " moved from being a monolithic , self - contained work and entertainment device with its own piece of furniture , to being a vehicle for social and intellectual discovery .
Fast - forward to today , and the future of the pocket looks eerily similar to what the future of the desktop looked like from the standpoint of a decade ago .
WiMAX and 3G networks are poised to make mobile broadband ubiquitous in large urban centers , and two ISAs , one RISC and one CISC , are poised to do battle yet again on a new terrain that 's defined by a shift in how people use their computers .
Unlike 1998 , though , RISC vs. CISC actually matters , now .
A close look at the design of Intel 's newest mobile architecture , officially named Atom , will show why the decades - old " RISC vs. CISC " debate is suddenly interesting again , and in some entirely new ways .
In this article , I 'll talk about the penalty that Intel 's new Atom ultramobile processor pays for its CISC legacy , and how Intel plans to reduce the impact of that penalty with simultaneous multithreading .
Hostile territory
Before I get directly into the topic of Atom 's microarchitecture , I want to take a moment to talk about the market at which future derivatives of Atom will eventually be aimed .
Right now , with its 2W TDP , Atom is n't much of an embedded processor in the classical sense , but some future version of it will be .
Atom is more like the point of a wedge that Intel intends to drive down into the embedded market , with the x86 legacy code base acting as the mass behind that point and the company 's relentless march of process shrinks acting as the applied force .
" Embedded " processors are commonly so called because they seamlessly integrated into a range of different appliance - like devices , from microwaves to cars to routers .
Because they 're often crammed into all sorts of odd places where computers do n't normally go , such processors are typically very low - power and rugged .
They also do n't need a lot of horsepower to carry out the kinds of tasks that they 're normally assigned , so they eschew the complexity and bulk of desktop processors in favor of simplicity , leanness , and the ability to use very little energy .
More recently , " embedded " has also come to refer to processors that are in mobile phones and handheld computers , and in that respect it now refers generically to processors that operate in the milliwatt range .
RISC architectures currently have the embedded space just as tightly sewed up as RISC architectures had the workstation space in the years before the Pentium Pro .
The big three for embedded are ARM , PowerPC , and MIPS .
Of these three , ARM is far and away the most popular for gadgets and consumer electronics .
Empty your pockets and purse or briefcase of mobile gadgetry , and chances are there 's at least one ARM - based chip under the skin of each device with a battery and a screen .
Whether you 're packing a Blackberry or a Nintendo DS Lite , you 're toting ARM hardware .
To ARM and its vast army of licensees , Intel 's mockup - heavy bluster about x86 - powered UMPCs , MIDs , and smartphones might look just as laughably silly as the Pentium Pro and its successors looked to the likes of SGI and DEC , if it were n't for the fact that x86 is now wearing the scalps of both now - defunct RISC powerhouses as trophies .
No , in today 's world , when Intel aims both barrels of its formidable fab capacity directly at a new market segment , it 's not a joke to anyone who ends up in the crosshairs .
The Atom line of processors , formerly known by the codename of " Silverthorne , " is a shot across the bow of the embedded RISC players .
It 's not a direct hit , and is n't intended to be ; but Intel is gunning for ARM and its cohorts , so let 's take a look at its opening salvo .
Intel 's Atom
When Intel unveiled the microarchitecture for Atom at ISSCC this year , they also served up some crow for me to eat along with it .
Some readers may remember that I greeted Intel 's claims that " Silverthorne " ( Atom 's codename ) was a " new architecture from the ground up " with a bit of skepticism , and suggested that it was probably a derivative of an existing microarchitecture .
Intel Atom .
Source : Intel
Clearly , I should 've taken Intel at face value , because Atom is an entirely new design .
It 's relatively simple and in - order , much like the original Pentium , but it 's also fairly deeply pipelined like more modern processors .
Overall , it 's definitely clear that Atom 's designers tried to walk a fine line between modern features and performance on the one hand , and simplicity and power efficiency on the other .
Only real - world benchmarks will indicate how well their tradeoffs worked , but a close look at Atom 's pipeline will show what x86 compatibility actually costs the processor .

This article looks in detail only at the fetch and decode phases of Atom 's front end .

A California man has been indicted for an inventive scheme that allegedly siphoned $ 50,000 from online brokerage houses E- trade and Schwab.com in six months – a few pennies at a time .
Michael Largent , 22 , of Plumas Lake , California , allegedly exploited a loophole in a common procedure both companies follow when a customer links his brokerage account to a bank account for the first time .
To verify that the account number and routing information is correct , the brokerages automatically send small " micro- deposits " of between two cents to one dollar to the account , and ask the customer to verify that they 've received it .
Michael Largent allegedly used a script to open 58,000 online brokerage accounts in the names of cartoon characters , and other aliases .
Hank Hill courtesy
Fox BroadcastingLargent allegedly used an automated script to open 58,000 online brokerage accounts , linking each of them to a handful of online bank accounts , and accumulating thousands of dollars in micro-deposits .
I know it 's only May , but I think the competition for Threat Level 's Caper of the Year award is over .
Largent 's script allegedly used fake names , addresses and Social Security numbers for the brokerage accounts .
Largent allegedly favored cartoon characters for the names , including Johnny Blaze , King of the Hill patriarch Hank Hill , and Rusty Shackelford .
That last name is doubly - fake – it's the alias commonly used by the paranoid exterminator Dale Gribble on King of the Hill .
The banks involved included Capital One , Metabank , Greendot and Skylight .
Largent allegedly cashed out by channeling the money into pre-paid debit cards .
A May 7 Secret Service search warrant affidavit ( .pdf ) says Largent tried the same thing with Google 's Checkout service , accumulating $ 8,225.29 in eight different bank accounts at Bancorp Bank .
When the bank asked Largent about the thousands of small transfers , he told them that he'd read Google 's terms of service , and that it did n't prohibit multiple e-mail addresses and accounts .
" He stated he needed the money to pay off debts and stated that this was one way to earn money , by setting up multiple accounts having Google submit the two small deposits . "
The Google caper is not charged in the indictment . ( .pdf )
According to the government , Largent was undone by the USA Patriot Act 's requirement that financial firms verify the identity of their customers .
Schwab.com was notified in January that more than 5,000 online accounts had been opened with bogus information .
When the Secret Service investigated , they found some 11,385 Schwab accounts were opened under the name " Speed Apex " from the same five IP addresses , all of them tracing back to Largent 's internet service from AT&T .
Largent is free on bail .
He 's charged in federal court in Sacramento with four counts each of computer fraud , wire fraud and mail fraud .
He did n't return repeated phone calls Tuesday ; Representatives of E- trade , Schwab.com and Google also did n't return phone calls .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Comic actor Harvey Korman has died at 81 , according to the UCLA Medical Center .
Harvey Korman 's death comes after complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Korman died at the center four months after suffering complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm .
" It was a miracle in itself that he survived the incident at all .
Everyone in the hospital referred to him as ' miracle man ' because of his strong will and ability to bounce right back after several major operations , " said Korman 's daughter , Kate Korman .
" Tragically , after such a hard - fought battle , he passed away . "
Korman was a regular on " The Carol Burnett Show " from 1967 through 1978 , for which he won Emmy awards in 1969 , 1971 , 1972 and 1974 .
He also won a Golden Globe for his work on the series .
The lanky Korman also appeared in Mel Brooks ' " Blazing Saddles " ( as the sneering Hedley Lamarr ) , " High Anxiety " and " History of the World , Part 1 . "
He starred in his own short - lived situation comedy , " The Harvey Korman Show , " in 1978 , in which he portrayed Harvey Kavanaugh opposite Christine Lahti , who played his wife , Maggie .
He made dozens of appearances in other television shows and movies during his lengthy show - business career , including providing voices for several animated productions .
Among those was The Great Gazoo , a helmeted space man who appeared in some episodes of " The Flintstones . "
Do n't Miss iReport.com : Share your Harvey Korman memories
Angie Horejsi , an assistant to Burnett , told The Associated Press that Burnett was devastated by Korman 's death : " She loved Harvey very much , " Horejsi said .
The AP also reported that Brooks described Korman as a " dazzling " comic talent .
" You could get rock - solid comedy out of him .
He could lift the material .
He always made it real , always made it work , always believed in characters he was doing , " he said , according to AP .
Korman was born in Chicago , Illinois .
His first marriage , to Donna Ehlert in 1960 , ended in divorce in 1974 .
He married Deborah Fritze in 1982 .
Both marriages produced two children .
Korman landed some sketch work on " The Red Skelton Show " in 1961 , followed by a four - year stint on " The Danny Kaye Show , " which led to his joining Carol Burnett in 1967 .
In addition to his wife and daughter , Korman is survived by three other adult children -- Laura , Maria and Chris -- and three grandchildren .

In praise of Rachel Carson
Tim Lambert and I have a piece in the online edition of Prospect , defending Rachel Carson against the tobacco / DDT lobby .
It was cut down for publication from a much longer article , which I ’ve appended over the fold .
The article shows how the legend that Carson caused the banning of DDT , just as it was about to wipe out malaria , was invented and popularised by tobacco lobbyists , most notably Steven Milloy , who wanted to mount a flank attack on tobacco ’s archenemy , the World Health Organization .

The main components are an Arduino microcontroller clone , Devantech ultrasonic sensor and a set of welding goggles -- oh , and a sick poker face to really round things out .

How - to guide
By James Baxter , NMA President
The same forces that resisted the use of fire many thousands of years ago are still with us , only now they are advocating the return of the national maximum speed limit of 55 miles per hour .
Anyone who endured the last 22 year long “ experiment ” with the “ folly of 55 ” knows that this proposal goes beyond being absurd .
The only likely beneficiaries are insurance companies ( ticket surcharges ) , local governments that live off speed traps , P.R. firms ( the genius creators of public service ads like “ Save Gas Save Lives , Drive 55 ” ) and perhaps the radar detector industry .
In return , the driving public is treated to aggravation , maddening traffic flow , tickets , bloated insurance premiums , and billions of hours of lost time .
As in 1973 , the justification for a snail ’s pace speed limit on major highways is that it will save gasoline ( and now reduce global warming ) .
It did n’t work then and it wo n’t work now .
The reasons are many .
For starters only two percent of the four million miles of streets , roads and highways in the US have speed limits in excess of 55 miles per hour ( approximate numbers ) .
Of those there are many that suffer congestion and construction on a regular basis such that traffic is lucky to maintain a 40 MPH pace , let alone 55 miles per hour .
It ’s true that our Interstate system carries about one third of our daily traffic volume , but here too congestion , construction , and bad weather frequently limits traffic to sub 55 speeds .
In many urban areas the Interstates are already posted at 55 .
Granted , when conditions allow the actual speeds might be 70 or 75 MPH , but clearly the speed limit is not the controlling factor .
That brings us to point # 2 , public compliance .
After 22 years of propaganda , millions of tickets , and billions in insurance surcharges , actual motorist compliance on Interstate type highways ranged between five and ten percent .
Those in compliance were typically mechanically unable to exceed 55 .
Did it save fuel ?
In 1984 , in what started out to be a promotional “ study ” of the “ Benefits of the 55 MPH National Maximum Speed Limit ” the Transportation Research Board ( Part of the National Academy of Science ) determined that keeping the 55 MPH speed limit , versus allowing the states to raise the limit to 65 MPH , would result in a 0.18 percent ( less than two tenths of one percent ) fuel savings ( Source : TRB Report , 55 : A Decade of Experience ; page 176 )
This is not an amount that will devastate the oil economy of the Middle East .
The same study did determine that the 55 MPH national speed limit was wasting approximately one billion man hours a year ( page 123 ) .
This did not include state trooper man hours being burned up enforcing an arbitrary speed limit on the safest highways in the nation .
Along with miss allocating enforcement resources , the federal law forced the states to play games with their highway monitoring data , gaming the numbers so it appeared that traffic was moving slower than it really was .
The states were supposed to maintain 50 percent compliance with the federal limit , they could n’t come close , at least not honestly .
Safety ?
Today the national and the interstate highway fatality rate is far lower than at any time during the “ 55 era . ”
In fact , the last time the fatality rate increased from year to year was in the mid 1970 ’s when compliance and enforcement were at their highest levels ( see chart below ) .
High fuel costs are certainly a burden .
As individuals we can drive less , use more fuel efficient vehicles , and even drive slower , if we wish .
But no sane person should wish another 55 MPH speed limit on the country .
We already have a dysfunctional aviation system , let ’s not allow the same thing to happen to our highways .

WiiWare is off to an okay start , but it 's going to need some work if Nintendo wants to compete with Xbox Live Arcade .
I think it 's fine that the quality of the games varies wildly , but Nintendo should take a bit more of a hold on the pricing structure .
I can see having cheapo games like *
Angel 's Solitaire * right next to obviously higher - budget productions like Okiraku Ping - Pong , but why do they cost the same five bucks ?
Or perhaps it 's better to ask why Lonpos , an interesting but clearly rushed puzzle game with one of the least - polished presentations I 've seen this side of the CD - i , costs a whopping $ 10 .
More thoughts , plus links to all our WiiWare coverage , below .
Pricing is n't as big of a deal with retail games , which you can rent before you buy – or , at the very least , trade them in if you do n't like them .
It 's taken care of on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade , which allow players to try demo versions of games before they buy them .
When you buy a WiiWare game , you can't try it first , and if you do n't like it , you 're totally boned because you can't sell it to someone else or trade it in .
WiiWare needs demos .
And I bet you anything it 's not going to get them .
In their absence , Nintendo at least needs to lean on publishers to set more reasonable prices based on the quality of the content .
I 'd feel ripped off if I bought Lonpos , but maybe not if it was $ 5 .
For that reason , I think Okiraku Ping - Pong is one of the better launch games , as it's just the sort of thing Wii audiences like – pick - up - and - play multiplayer Wiimote - swinging fun .
So it 's not feature - rich ?
So what ?
It 's five dollars .
All it needs to do is entertain people for a few days and it'll have been worth the money , and they can move on to something else .
But the more expensive the WiiWare games get , the less enticing they become .
IGN said today that the " R " in Star Soldier R stands for " rip- off , " and it 's tough to disagree .
You can go buy * Star Soldier * for GameCube , which runs on the Wii and contains the exact same two levels in this version , for about what the WiiWare version costs .
If you live in Japan , I mean .
I think Hudson will end up having the sense to not bring this to the U.S .
At $ 15 , Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life As a King is an even more challenging value proposition .
In fact , it 's the single most expensive thing on the entire network .
Will enough people bite to convince Square Enix that digital distribution is n't a great plague set to wreak devastation on their company ?
But what WiiWare really , really needs is more storage .
If you downloaded all nine launch games , you probably had to clear off some Virtual Console games from your Wii 's paltry 512MB internal memory first .
It 's ridiculous that Nintendo has n't offered some memory expansion feature yet , whether allowing players to run software off the SD cards that Wii already supports , or by allowing USB hard drives , or what .
All I know is that I 'm going to have to make some hard decisions about what stays and what goes , when the next batch of WiiWare titles hits .
Read Game|Life 's WiiWare Launch Coverage :
It has been done before : Illinois and Indiana have previously suspended the gas tax in the summer of 2000 and for every 4cts / gallon for the motorists , gasoline suppliers reaped 3,5cts in Illinois and 3cts in Indiana .
Small wonder
Shell oil lobbyist Steve Helmendorf helps out , as Hillary Clinton tries to sell McCain ’s idea of a gas tax holiday again and again :
Thomas Friedman said :
It is great to see that we finally have some national unity on energy policy .
Unfortunately , the unifying idea is so ridiculous , so unworthy of the people aspiring to lead our nation , it takes your breath away .
Bloomberg :
“ It ’s about the dumbest thing I ’ve heard in an awful long time , from an economic point of view .
We ’re trying to discourage people from driving and we ’re trying to end our energy dependence … and we ’re trying to have more money to build infrastructure . ”
Clinton is shamefully misleading voters and tries to buy Indiana ’s and North Carolina ’s votes for $ 28 a piece !
I am shocked , that polls suggest her plan is working .

Steal this footage : Steal this film team makes raw footage available for remixing
The team behind Steal This Film and Steal This Film 2 has made the raw footage of their second documentary available online .
Film makers , remix artists and copyright activists alike can download the footage for free and reuse it for their own works .
The material includes interviews with Bittorrent founder Bram Cohen , NYU professor Siva Vaidyhanathan , Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz , EFF counsel Fred von Lohman and many others , and each and every clip is licensed under the liberal Creative Commons BY - SA license , meaning that the material can be used for commercial works as long as those works are made available under the same license .
But that 's not all :
The project includes a complete transcription of the whole Steal This Film 2 raw footage , and everything is full - text searchable , so you can for example easily find each and every scene that mentions the word Bittorrent .
From the site :
The steal this footage site is based on technology developed for the 0xdb project that indexes films found on file sharing networks .
The footage itself is distributed via P2P as well : Each interview is available as a HDV torrent or as an Ogg Theora torrent , and subtitles are available as separate downloads .
With all the sniping from the Clinton camp about whether Barack Obama has enough experience to make a strong president , consider another presidential candidate who was far more of a novice .
He had the gall to run for president even though he had served a single undistinguished term in the House of Representatives , before being hounded back to his district .
That was Abraham Lincoln .
Another successful president scorned any need for years of apprenticeship in Washington , declaring , “ The same old experience is not relevant . ”
He suggested that the most useful training comes not from hanging around the White House and Congress but rather from experience “ rooted in the real lives of real people ” so that “ it will bring real results if we have the courage to change . ”
That was Bill Clinton running in 1992 against George H. W. Bush , who was then trumpeting his own experience over the callow youth of Mr. Clinton .
That year Mr. Bush aired a television commercial urging voters to keep America “ in the hands of experience . ”
It might seem obvious that long service in Washington is the best preparation for the White House , but on the contrary , one lesson of American history is that length of experience in national politics is an extremely poor predictor of presidential success .
?
The Combine , an exceptionally advanced other - dimensional race of whom very little is currently known , attack the " border world " of Xen .
The dominant intelligent lifeforms on Xen are the vortigaunts .
The Nihilanth , who may or may not already be the leader / ruler / tyrant / queen / mother of the vortigaunt race , is enslaved by the Combine and placed ( possibly willingly ) as a puppet ruler , leading the planet in the Combine 's name .
The vortigaunts are in turn enslaved with the metal collars which they are seen wearing in the original Half - Life games .
The political situation on Xen is presumed to be exactly like the political situation on Earth during Half - Life 2 .
The Combine invaded , placed a ruler ( in Earth 's case , Wallace Breen ) and began co-opting the local dominant species ' genetics to make hybrid human / Combine slaves / foot - soldiers ( whom you spend the entirety of HL2 fighting ) .
Occam's Razor would suggest that Xen is the Nihilanth 's homeworld .
Several sources give Xen as a kind of refugee world and the Nihilanth and the vortigaunts as one of many groups of refugees on this planet , having come from somewhere else entirely .

The Aperture Science research vessel Borealis disappears from its dry dock , taking part of its dry dock with it .
This is revealed in a pivotal conversation with Eli Vance in Episode Two , " Our Mutual Fiend " .
The ship 's cargo will be revealed in Episode Three .
Front - runner possibilities are volatile portal technology , volatile Xen crystals , and something involving time travel .
1990s ?
Black Mesa scientists experience some success in their teleportation experiments and discover how to travel between Earth and the border world of Xen .
They are unable to travel freely from place to place on Earth , because Xen is in the way .
However , orange crystals are discovered on Xen , which , when connected up to a relay device which is placed permanently on Xen , can be used to bounce the signal from Xen back to Earth accurately .
Contact is lost with the survey team which set up the relay , though the relay itself possibly remains functional for a little while longer .
During " Captive Freight " in Blue Shift , Rosenberg makes a lot of the above explicit while powering up the original teleporter .
A diagram of how this first teleporter works can be found here .
1990s ?
Black Mesa scientists soon discover a new way of aiming the teleportation field , using Xen as a dimensional slingshot , allowing teleportation between points on Earth without any need for equipment to be stationed on Xen .
A much larger teleporter , the Lambda Complex machine , is constructed .
Stable site - to - site portals first appear in the Half - Life chapter " Lambda Core " .
In the " Captive Freight " chapter of Blue Shift , while powering up the original teleporter , Rosenberg explains how the Xen relay became obsolete .
Judith Mossman explains the finer points of teleportation science during Half - Life 2 , " Black Mesa East " .
A diagram of the new teleporter design is here .
Despite their advanced technology , the Combine lack site - to - site teleportation .
They are " dependent on local transportation " to get around on Earth , hence Razor Trains .
Many samples of Xen fauna , including snarks , head crabs , barnacles , houndeyes and a Tentacle are brought from Xen back to the Black Mesa Facility for study .
Xen - like environments are created to contain them .
A domesticated barnacle is produced .
Study of the mysterious orange crystal found on Xen also continues .
Isaac Kleiner 's pet headcrab , Lamarr , is possibly captured and debeaked at this point .
That BMRF reached Xen before the resonance cascade is clear from Half - Life : " Apprehension " .
Gordon encounters a scientist lamenting about a sea monster which is terrorising that level , saying " They said it was hauled from the Challenger deep , but I 'm positive that beast never swam in terrestrial waters until a week ago . "
In " Questionable Ethics " caged houndeyes appear .
However , it 's only in opposing Opposing Force : " Vicarious Reality " that it becomes clear just how long this has been going on .
The Tentacle environment is very large .
It must have taken months to construct .
1996 After ten years , GLaDOS is now an adequately functional Disk Operating System .
Work begins on the Genetic Lifeform component .
Aperture Science website ( screenshot ) .
Several years later ( 1999 ? )
The Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device is completed .
By this time GLaDOS has been developed into her familiar " hanging computer " configuration .
Doug and Henry are two Aperture employees working on her artificial consciousness , and have attached three different AI cores ( Cake , Curiosity and Anger ) to GLaDOS in an attempt to prevent her from trying to kill everybody in the facility .
A fourth core , Morality , is developed and attached to her .
Portal 2 : Lab Rat prequel comic .
The first annual Bring Your Daughter To Work day takes place at Aperture .
Chell , the adopted daughter of an Aperture employee , is in attendance , and agrees to be tested in the Computer - Aided Enrichment Center .
She is placed in a Relaxation Vault .
Meanwhile , GLaDOS is fully activated for the first time as part of several planned activities for the day .
Chell 's name is given in the credits for Portal .
Her name is also found on her potato experiment in Portal 2 .
The activation of GLaDOS is noted in the NOTES file on the Aperture Science intranet .
Bring Your Daughter To Work Day is mentioned once during the game and the connection is confirmed on the Aperture Science website ( screenshot ) .
The NOTES file is one to which CJOHNSON has access but , being written in the third person , it is probably accessible to other Aperture employees too , and not a file created by Cave Johnson personally .
This is the last update made before GLaDOS malfunctions and floods the facility with a deadly neurotoxin .
The scientists successfully install a Morality Core to shut the neurotoxin emitters down , but the facility is nevertheless fully evacuated .
Chell is left behind inside her Relaxation Vault .
The last scene before you fight GLaDOS in Portal gives the neurotoxin details .
If GLaDOS was successfully neutralised , why was the facility abandoned anyway ?
May 5 , 2000 ?
Gordon Freeman is sent a letter offering a job at the Anomalous Materials Laboratory of the Black Mesa Research Facility at Black Mesa , New Mexico , United States .
Between now and May 15 he returns from his present post as visiting fellow at the University of Innsbruck and is trained in the use of his HEV suit .
The acceptance letter appears in the Half - Life manual .
The actual year given on the letter is 200- , which is anywhere from 2000 to 2009 .
I have chosen 2000 since it is closest to the release date of Half - Life , is the date used by that other timeline .
Several other events are pegged to this year , so pinning it to one moment is handy .
It is implied that the resonance cascade occurs very early in Gordon 's time at Black Mesa , possibly even on May 15 or 16 .
However , Alyx remarks in Episode One that Gordon and Barney used to compete at getting into Dr. Kleiner 's laboratory without keys ( thus , Gordon has some prior experience of vent - crawling ) .
For such a thing to become routine in less than two weeks is pushing it , so I have moved the cascade to the following year .
November 1 , 2000 ?
Adrian Shephard is given his soldier 's manual .
Date appears on the cover of the Opposing Force game manual .
? Scientists from Black Mesa successfully steal one of the four gigantic orange crystals in the Nihilanth 's lair on Xen .
This is the largest and purest sample retrieved so far and is the sample used in the anti-mass spectrometry experiment at the beginning of Half - Life .
When you reach it , the Nihilanth 's lair has three big orange crystals remaining , embedded in the walls .
All three crystals resemble the one from the first experiment , and there is a hole where a fourth one should be located .
The connection is clear .
It 's reasonable to assume that Black Mesa used teleportation technology to insert operatives close enough to retrieve the sample without being caught .
They may have even teleported it out of the chamber directly without visiting it , or retrieved it accidentally .
This event most likely occurs a very short time before the events of Half - Life pick up .
?
The G - Man decides to cause a resonance cascade at Black Mesa Research Facility .
Later events in this timeline will soon combine to show that this event was deliberately orchestrated by the G - Man .
However , the background to this decision remains the single most important question mark in the Half - Life story .
When did he make this decision ?
Before or after the pure sample was retrieved above ?
Before or after Earth made contact with Xen ?
Did he make the decision himself or was he ordered or hired to do it by a third party ?
What did he intend to achieve by causing the cascade ?
Were the actual consequences of the cascade ( i.e. war with Xen , followed by eventual invasion by the Combine ) were what he intended ?
March 3 , 2001 ?
Shephard is in boot camp still .
He hears rumours of the G - Man observing proceedings .
Note in the Opposing Force manual .
Shephard is stationed at Santego Military Base , Arizona , according to the intro of OpFor .
March 7
Shephard sees the G - Man for the first time and believes he is observing him personally .
Note in the Opposing Force manual .
March 9 Shephard and his unit , the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit , commence one week of solid training in indoor strategic combat but are not told why .
Note in the Opposing Force manual .
March 12 Shephard hears the Black Mesa facility being mentioned a lot and becomes convinced he is being primed for a mission .
Note in the Opposing Force manual .
March 15 Shephard has the rumour confirmed and is told to prepare for the event to happen tomorrow .
Note in the Opposing Force manual .
This pins down the resonance cascade to the day of March 16 , whose events I shall detail in the best order I can figure , below .
He is not , in fact , inserted until March 17 .
~ 8:30 am , March 16 , 2001 ?
A major system crash at the Black Mesa Research Facility , orchestrated and triggered by the G - Man ( before he officially arrives for the day ) , prevents scientists Dr. Isaac Kleiner and Eli Vance , who will be overseeing the morning 's anti-mass spectrometry experiment , from knowing the dangerous properties of the sample which they will be analysing .
A security guard at the front desk mentions this as Gordon arrives at the beginning of Half - Life .
It happened " about twenty minutes ago " and Gordon arrives at roughly 8:50 am .
Doctors Gina Cross and Collette Green arrive for their morning 's work and collect their HEV suits from the tubes flanking Gordon's .
Because of the system crash they have to be re-added to the security database .
Decay : " Dual Access " .
8:47 am Barney Calhoun arrives by monorail to take over security duties at the beginning of his shift .
The door to his workplace jams as a result of the crash , just as Gordon Freeman passes him in another monorail car , also arriving for his morning 's work .
Blue Shift : " Living Quarters Inbound " followed by Half - Life : " Black Mesa Inbound " and Blue Shift : " Insecurity " .
The announcer in Gordon 's car gives the time as 8:47 am at roughly the same moment that Gordon passes Barney .
Both Barney and Gordon observe the G - Man while he is inbound by monorail .
On a security screen , Barney observes the Xen sample arrive at the Anomalous Materials lab , pushed by Gina Cross .
The G - Man arrives at Anomalous Materials lab , ahead of Gordon .
Half - Life , Blue Shift , Decay
~ 8:50 am Gordon Freeman arrives at the Anomalous Materials lab and collects the third and final HEV suit .
The monorail journey takes about three minutes from the " 8:47 am " announcement .
Messing about in the lab kitchen , Gordon nukes the microwave casserole of Dr. Arne Magnusson .
Magnusson develops a grudge about this .
Magnusson 's comment in Episode
Two is by far the funniest moment in the Half - Life series to date .
Gordon observes but does not overhear Eli's brief conversation with the G - Man , in which the G - Man presents the new Xen fragment to Eli and advises him to " Prepare for unforeseen consequences " during the forthcoming experiment .
This G - Man sighting has been well - known since HL was released but the details of the conversation are only established in Episode Two , chapter 6 , " Our Mutual Fiend " .
Given that all the black scientists in Half - Life look identical , we did n't even know it was Eli talking to the G - Man until Episode Two .
~ 9:00 am Collette Green activates the anti-mass spectrometer .
Gordon pushes the Xen sample into the beam , causing a resonance cascade .
The Anomalous Materials laboratory and much of the surrounding Facility sustains massive damage as large random quantities of matter are spontaneously transported to and from the world of Xen , including dangerous Xen fauna which is teleported into the Facility .
Chaos erupts .
Eli Vance instructs Gordon to attempt to reach the surface and get help .
Barney Calhoun , who is in a recently - repaired elevator at the time of the cascade , independently sets out to escape the facility too .
Half - Life , chapters " Anomalous Materials " and " Unforeseen Consequences " , Decay : " Dual Access " and Blue Shift : " Duty Calls " .
Since Gordon never returns , Eli eventually escapes the facility by himself .
Eli possibly loses his left foot in the process .
Alyx Vance is extracted from the Black Mesa Research Facility by the G - Man .
The fact that Alyx and Eli's wife ( whose name was Azian ) lived in the Personnel Dormitories on the Black Mesa site should have been obvious from context as early as Half - Life 2 .
( We know from Gordon 's acceptance letter that there are on - site lodgings , and Eli's wife was conspicuous in her absence from HL2 . )
However , it would have seemed reasonable to assume that Azian was killed during the evacuation after the Black Mesa Incident , and Alyx survived by dumb luck or youthful resourcefulness .
It 's only in the pivotal G - Man sequence in Episode Two , " This Vortal Coil " , that the G - Man 's role in Alyx 's survival is revealed .
By electing not to rescue Azian at the same time as Alyx , the G - Man effectively killed Alyx 's mother .
Alyx is given an initial " appraisal " by the G - Man 's " employers " but they fail to see any value in her .
This is understandable , since Alyx is only at most seven or eight years old at this time .
By allowing her to grow up during the Portal Storm and the Combine invasion of Earth , she becomes a substantially more valuable asset in real terms .
The G - Man reluctantly releases Alyx back to her father , but continues to take a constructive interest in her development .
" Our Mutual Fiend " reveals that Eli knows that the G - Man rescued her .
They may have met in person for the handoff .
Alyx may or may not remember this .
March 16 Gordon spends an entire day fighting his way through the damaged Facility towards the surface .
By the time he gets there he has encountered the G - Man 's special forces coming the other way , with instructions to kill all the civilians they find as part of a government cover - up .
Gordon kills a large number of the grunts .
Half - Life : " Unforeseen Consequences " , " Office Complex " and " ' We've Got Hostiles ' " .
Barney 's experiences are much the same , until Barney meets Dr. Rosenberg , who proposes an escape plan involving the original prototype teleporter ( mentioned above , around 1986 ) .
Blue Shift : " Duty Calls " and " Captive Freight " .
At the end of " Duty Calls " , Barney encounters two grunts dumping bodies and lamenting that " just because Shephard 's team did n't make it , we have to do the crap jobs " .
This is because Shephard 's Hazardous Environment Combat Unit has n't arrived yet , not because they were shot down , which has n't happened yet .
Night of March 16 Gordon continues to trek through the BMRF interior , kills a Tentacle and accesses an old subway system which leads towards the Lambda Complex at the far end of the Facility .
Before dawn , Gordon successfully launches a rocket containing a satellite which the surviving scientists in the Lambda Complex need to shut down the link to Xen .
Half - Life : " Blast Pit " , " Power Up " and " On A Rail " .
Gordon reaches the surface towards the end of " On A Rail " , by which time it is the middle of the night , if not early morning .
Meanwhile , Barney and Rosenberg reach the prototype teleporter .
Being an old model , it is not capable of moving objects from place to place on Earth ; it can only send you to Xen or bring you back .
As a result , Barney has to be sent to Xen to reactivate the relay which Black Mesa scientists originally left there .
The relay 's purpose is to seamlessly transmit the travellers from Xen back to a point on the outskirts of Black Mesa .
Barney is then sent to collect power cells for the teleporter as well .
Blue Shift : " Focal Point " , " Power Struggle " and " A Leap Of Faith " .
Morning of March 17
By the time day has broken , mysterious Black Operatives have joined the invading human forces .
By this time the effects of the resonance cascade have long ceased , but more and better - armed aliens are still teleporting in .
This is because a formal invasion force has now been mounted from Xen , under the command of the Nihilanth .
Earth is now in a de facto state of war with Xen .
Gordon is captured by disgruntled grunts .
Barney Calhoun , Rosenberg , Walter and Simmon(d ? ) s successfully teleport out of the Black Mesa Facility .
Barney is briefly teleported to several other locations , and witnesses Gordon being dragged away by the grunts before snapping back to the exit tunnel and leaving the Facility safely .
Gordon is put in a garbage compactor by the grunts .
Adrian Shephard and the rest of his Hazardous Environment Comabt Unit are among the last grunts to be airlifted in to Black Mesa .
Shephard is shot down by a Xen hovership before he can can be given any orders .
He sets out on his own expedition through the Black Mesa Facility .
Events of Half - Life : " On A Rail " and " Apprehension " , Blue Shift : " Deliverance " and the opening of Opposing Force .
March 17 Gordon Freeman escapes the garbage compactor into the Facility 's Residue Processing system and spends the rest of the morning making his way to Lambda Complex .
With Xenian forces overwhelming them , the human forces are told to forget about apprehending Freeman and pull out .
Adrian Shephard attempts to join the evacuation but is prevented from doing so by an unsympathetic G - Man - who , despite appearances , does not actually leave the Facility at this point .
Several other HECU soldiers are also left behind .
The black ops remain on the site , however , and Shephard runs into them several times .
The black ops are now , in turn , tasked with exterminating the grunts .
The events of Half - Life : " Residue Processing " , " Questionable Ethics " , " Surface Tension " , " ' Forget About Freeman ! ' " and " Lambda Core " , as well as Opposing Force : " ' We Are Pulling Out ' " , " Missing In Action " and " Friendly Fire " .
The Half - Life : Uplink demo was originally a chapter of Half - Life .
It is stated to occur in the Lambda Complex and at " containment failure + 48 hours " .
It was removed from the final game and ends on a cliffhanger , but it can theoretically be inserted somewhere in " Lambda Core " ( which is more like +30 hours but oh well ) .
Afternoon of March 17 Gordon reaches Lambda Complex where he is told that the satellite he has launched cannot be used to close the Xen rift because the Nihilanth is holding it open .
Gordon is sent to Xen to kill the Nihilanth .
Xenians attack the Complex just as Gordon leaves , damaging it , destroying Gordon 's route home .
Adrian Shephard arrives at Lambda Core just in time to witness Gordon departing for Xen. Gordon succeeds in killing the Nihilanth .
The G - Man , having observed Freeman 's progress with great interest , consults with his " employers " , extracts Gordon from the Nihilanth 's chamber and offers him a job , which Gordon accepts .
Gordon is placed into slow teleport , " awaiting assignment " , and time ceases to pass for him .
Wallace Breen notes during the final confrontation of Half - Life 2 that Freeman is a " pawn " and that his " contract was open to the highest bidder " .
In the closing sequence of the same game , the G - Man notes that he has " received some interesting offers for [ Freeman 's ] services " .
This suggests that Freeman is essentially a mercenary and that the G - Man is his handler / employer .
However , the G - Man himself also has " employers " .
The vortigaunt race is freed by the death of their immediate master .
Meanwhile , Shephard escapes Lambda Complex into the Black Mesa animal laboratories .
He defeats a Pit Worm and makes it to the surface again at around dusk .
Because they are killed , the scientists of Lambda Core never actually manage to use the satellite to close the Xen rift .
Not only does the rift remain partially active ( if not fully open ) , the satellite remains in orbit , unused .
Half - Life : " Xen " , " Gonarch 's Lair " , " Interloper " and " Nihilanth " and OpFor : " We Are Not Alone " , " Crush Depth " , " Vicarious Reality " , " Pit Worm 's Nest " and " Foxtrot Uniform " .
The G - Man 's remark that " The border world , Xen , is in our control " is of great importance .
To whom does " our " refer ?
Despite the , hah , " illusion of free choice " , Gordon 's acceptance must be canonical .
Shephard encounters Black Operatives planting and arming a nuclear device , intending to destroy the entire Black Mesa facility as a last - ditch attempt to prevent what is happening .
Shephard disables the weapon , but the G - Man , after inspecting Shephard 's work , reactivates it .
Shephard continues onwards to where he encounters a Gene Worm coming through from Xen and defeats it .
OpFor : " The Package " and " Worlds Collide " .
Though the radiation from the blast might slow down in the incoming Xen forces , it seems unlikely that a nuclear explosion would actually prevent them from teleporting in .
Logically , the bomb is only placed after Gordon defeats the Nihilanth .
There is no particular explanation for the origin of the Race X creatures which are encountered in OpFor and nowhere else .
In fact , they are never even named in the game .
They could be more of the Nihilanth 's race , or they could be an entirely separate race which shares Xen with the Nihilanth , or they could be from a different border world entirely .
March 18 The G - Man extracts Shephard from the Gene Worm arena , and , with the permission of his " employers " , places him into a slow teleport for possible future reference .
The nuclear bomb goes off , destroying the entire Black Mesa Research Facility .
While scientific masterminds Eli Vance , Isaac Kleiner and others successfully escape the detonation , all their notes and equipment are destroyed .
Human teleportation science takes a step backwards .
Closing scenes of Opposing Force .
It is daylight during the part of this scene which takes place in New Mexico , but night was falling last time Shephard was outside ( during " Foxtrot Uniform " ) so this must be the following day .
Over the next 20 years Following the death of the Nihilanth , freed vortigaunts from Xen migrate to Earth for relative safety , and the Combine become aware of the planet Earth and the still - open rift between it and Xen.
Portal Storms occur - due to the rift or the Combine or both - dropping dangerous fauna from Xen on the Earth .
The countryside becomes swarmed with antlions and headcrabs and the oceans fill up with killer leeches .
Humans withdraw into fortified cities .
With the human race at its weakest point , the Combine open a " super- portal " and launch a full - scale invasion of Earth .
The Seven Hours War occurs .
Wallace Breen , former administrator of Black Mesa Research Facility , quickly negotiates humanity 's surrender to the Combine .
Breen , like the Nihilanth before him , is willingly placed as the " friendly face " of the Combine aggressors , genuinely believing that attempting to resist the Combine would result in the utter destruction of humanity , which is completely true at this point , and the Combine have humanity 's best interests at heart , which is not .
This is Alyx Vance 's childhood .
These events are mainly surmised from newspaper clippings in Eli's lab , Half - Life 2 , chapter 5 , " Black Mesa East " .
Specifics are sketchy .
Date is taken from a promotional website which indicates that Half - Life 2 takes place " nearly two decades " after Half - Life .
During Episode Two , " This Vortal Coil " , Freeman 's vortigaunt partner notes that the vortigaunts once farmed antlions for their larvae .
Thus , presumably the antlions are from Xen just like the vortigaunts are .
by 2020 - ish Cities are stripped of their names and numbered instead .
Various fields are set up which : prevent antlions from entering the cities ,
suppress the human reproductive process and
prevent headcrabs from assimilating Combine forces .
The Combine anti-headcrab field is a personal hypothesis of mine , introduced to explain why no Combine zombies appear until the beginning of Episode One .
Combine citadels are established in cities .
The Combine begin draining the oceans and harvesting useful minerals from the Earth , sucking it dry .
Nova Prospekt , a prison near City 17 , is set up as a major Combine base ( experimentation facility and teleporter landing pad connecting their universe to ours ) .
Experiments on humans produce the Combine Overwatch soldiers - the human equivalent to vortigaunt slaves - and the fearful subhuman Stalkers .
Soon it has become routine to transport humans to Nova Prospekt by train in order to convert them into Stalkers .
Captured refugee vortigaunts are also sometimes taken to Nova Prospekt - being telepathic , they are sometimes able to send pictures back to the resistance before being tortured and killed .
Eli Vance , Judith Mossman , Isaac Kleiner , Barney Calhoun , Alyx Vance and Arne Magnusson are among the survivors of Black Mesa who make their way to City 17 .
Discovering what is happening at Nova Prospekt , they set up an " underground railroad " to ferry incoming human " livestock " out of City 17 to safety .
Barney Calhoun infiltrates the Overwatch and works undercover to assist in this ; Kleiner ( along with his headcrab Lamarr ) operates out of a lab near the inbound railway station ; Mossman and the Vances work out of " Black Mesa East " , a lab near the town of Ravenholm .
A large number of resistance members and several sympathetic vortigaunts end up working on this railroad , which is signposted with yellow Lambda symbols .
However , it still involves a long trek down the old canals to get to Black Mesa East , so the scientists begin work on a teleporter which can make this journey infinitely easier .
The rescued proles , possibly including Father Grigori , colonise the abandoned nearby mining town of Ravenholm .
Most of this is established during the early scenes of Half - Life 2 .
It is never explicitly stated that the Combine have begun draining the oceans , but a suspiciously large number of beached ships appear in the " Highway 17 " and " Sandtraps " chapters of HL2 .
Ravenholm is bombed with headcrab - filled missiles .
The headcrabs assimilate most of the town 's population , with the notable exception of Father Grigori .
The survivors , if there are any , escape through the mines to the coast .
The underground passage from Black Mesa East to Ravenholm is sealed off to prevent the headcrabs from spreading .
" We do n't go there anymore . "
Obviously the Combine weaponised the headcrabs a long time ago , as seen above .
The new poison headcrabs and fast - moving headcrabs may be previously - unseen natives of Xen , but it is also possible that they were created by the Combine using genetic engineering , or even simple breeding .
Red Letter Day Isaac Kleiner completes the new underground railroad teleporter .
Gordon Freeman is woken by the G - Man and reinserted into reality on a train inbound to City 17 and Nova Prospekt .
HL2 : " Point Insertion " .
Note the passenger on the inbound train who remarks " I did n't see you get on . "
Presumably , the G - Man is still working for the same " employers " and working towards the same ultimate goal as he was during Half - Life .
The G - Man 's remarks , " And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until ... " and " The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world " imply that he has limited resources .
He waited for this precise moment - i.e. when the teleporter was operational - to reinsert Freeman , because it was the moment when he stood the best chance of doing the maximum possible damage to the Combine operation on Earth .
Barney Calhoun ( in his disguise as a member of the Combine Overwatch ) spots Gordon and helps him escape .
Freeman is eventually rescued from Civil Protection by Alyx Vance and taken to Kleiner 's lab .
Alyx is successfully teleported to Black Mesa East but Gordon 's jump fails and he is forced to use the " underground railroad " .
Gordon momentarily appears in Wallace Breen 's office during the failed jump .
Breen instantly recognises him and alerts his Combine Advisor superior .
Within hours the entirety of Civil Protection is after him .
" ' A Red Letter Day ' " , " Route Kanal " .
Being responsible for the death of the Nihilanth , Freeman is much more of a threat to the Combine than he is to Breen .
Also , Breen has no real power .
It is presumably the Combine Advisor , not Breen , who gives the order for City 17's forces to locate Gordon .
Though the underground railroad and most of the people maintaining it are destroyed by this unprecedented movement , Freeman reaches Black Mesa East by nightfall .
Around this time , Judith Mossman makes a deal with Breen to turn Freeman over to the Combine in exchange for the safety of Eli Vance .
She argues that Eli will eventually come around to the Combine point of view : the truth is that she has personal feelings for him .
" Route Kanal " , " Water Hazard " .
Night of RLD Having covertly followed Freeman , the Combine jump the gun , launching an attach on Black Mesa East without waiting for Judith Mossman 's signal .
Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman separately escape the attack .
Later in the game ( " Entanglement " ) it transpires that Mossman was intending to summon Combine forces to try to take Freeman anyway : " You would have had him if you had just waited for my signal " .
Because the Combine do n't have Freeman , Mossman 's deal for Eli 's safety is off , so the Combine capture Eli Vance and take him to Nova Prospekt .
Judith Mossman is taken too .
Freeman escapes through the Ravenholm tunnel .
Aided by Father Grigori , who is now insane , Freeman spends the night fighting his way through Ravenholm and the Ravenholm mine .
He reaches the surface near the coast at dawn the following day .
HL2 : " ' We Don't Go To Ravenholm ...' " .
Though , of course , speed runners can devour the entirety of HL2 in a matter of two hours , it seems like the night in Ravenholm takes rather less game time than the day .
This could be held suggest that it is local summertime .
Red Letter Day + 1
Freeman reaches the surface near a resistance base which is under attack .
The resistance supplies him with a dune buggy and Freeman spends the day negotiating the coast road connecting Ravenholm to Nova Prospekt , overcoming Combine ambushes and defending resistance bases from attack the entire way .
He arrives at Nova Prospekt at dusk .
HL2 : " Highway 17 " , " Sandtraps " .
Night of RLD+1 Freeman and Alyx independently assault and penetrate the Nova Prospekt facility in an attempt to rescue Eli and Mossman .
They meet up inside the facility and discover that Mossman is still walking around freely due to her ( slight ) betrayal , and still trying to bargain for Eli 's life .
Mossman sets up the Combine 's Nova Prospekt portal to emulate the human science team 's " Xen relay " - which the Combine have not discovered , remember - and escapes through it to the Citadel , taking Eli with her .
Alyx quickly restarts the portal and she and Freeman use it to escape .
The portal explodes as they ' port out , with the result that Alyx and Freeman are sent on a " slow teleport " journey which will take over a week to complete .
The explosion of the Combine portal makes it impossible for more Combine forces to be dispatched to City 17 .
This , coupled with Alyx and Freeman being presumed KIA , is taken as a signal for the human resistance to begin its uprising against the Combine .
HL2 : " Nova Prospekt " , " Entanglement " .
During this chapter , Breen makes a semi-public announcement informing the Overwatch that Gordon Freeman has - to paraphrase - " not been in a position to gain covert skills " since the Black Mesa incident .
Breen knows that Gordon was frozen in time for this period .
He must have been told this by the Combine .
This in turn means that the Combine have some awareness of the G - Man 's activities against them .
A few days later Dog makes it back to Kleiner 's lab from Black Mesa East .
HL2 : " Entanglement "
Red Letter Day + 8 Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman arrive at Kleiner 's lab after their " slow teleport " journey .
Their journey was subjectively instantaneous .
HL2 : " Entanglement " , " Anticitizen One " , " ' Follow Freeman ! ' " .
Alyx and Freeman left Nova Prospekt in the middle of the night and arrive at Kleiner 's lab during daylight hours , and apparently the Nova Prospekt explosion was " more than a week ago " .
So , for the sake of argument , I am assuming that the elapsed time was seven days plus a few hours , placing this at Red Letter Day +
8 . In case it 's not clear , this explicit jump in Gordon Freeman 's personal timeline is what leads most commentators to believe that Freeman was also frozen in time between Half - Life and Half - Life 2 .
The G - Man evidently has " slow teleport " technology , just as he has " conventional " teleportation as demonstrated in Half - Life and the expansion packs .
Alyx and Freeman join Barney Calhoun , Dog and many others in the assault on the Combine Citadel .
Alyx is captured by the Combine .
That evening , the Citadel is reached .
Dog provides Freeman with a route through the " walking walls " and into the Citadel core .
Evening of RLD+8 Gordon Freeman infiltrates the Combine Citadel but is himself captured , along with Eli and Alyx .
Breen tries to make Eli tell the resistance to stand down and let the Combine win .
Eli refuses .
Breen suggests installing Freeman as the leader of the resistance instead , if he will deliver the message instead .
Breen says that having both Eli and Freeman in his keeping will allow him to dictate terms to the Combine -- presumably because they represent a significant combined threat .
Breen evidently knows more about Freeman 's " employment " than Freeman does .
Presumably he has been kept informed by the Combine , who are in turn aware of the G - Man's ( and the G - Man 's employers ' ) movement against them .
Mossman redeems herself by intervening to save Eli .
Alyx , Eli and Freeman are freed , while Breen escapes .
Breen attempts to transfer himself into a host body and escape through a Combine portal to another universe .
Freeman destroys the portal , destabilising the Citadel 's teleport core and causing it to detonate .
The detonation has a knock - on effect on the other Citadels .
Earth 's connection to the Combine universe is severed .
HL2 : " Our Benefactors " , " Dark Energy " .
The sky during these chapters indicates that night is falling .
The G - Man again retrieves Gordon Freeman - and possibly Alyx too - and places him into storage for future reference .
However , vortigaunts intervene , forcibly removing Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance from the G - Man 's control and spiriting them away .
The opening sequence of Episode One is curiously difficult to reconcile with the conclusion of Half - Life 2 .
It almost seems as if the vortigaunts interrupt what the G - Man was about to say , preventing him from delivering his speech about " the illusion of free choice " and so on , and altering the course of events .
That the G - Man has an interest in Alyx and might therefore have used this opportunity to " adopt " her too is made clear in the pivotal scene in Episode Two , later .
Breen also escapes the detonation .
His mind is transferred into the host body of a Combine Advisor .
Meanwhile , Eli and Mossman escape the Citadel , presumably via Razor Train .
Eli returns to Kleiner 's lab while Mossman sets off on another task entirely .
It seems as if there is another gap in Gordon Freeman 's " record " between the conclusion of Half - Life 2 and the point at which Episode One picks up .
By the time of " Undue Alarm " at the beginning of Episode One , Eli Vance and Judith Mossman have had time to rendezvous with Isaac Kleiner , evacuate City 17 entirely and make it all the way to White Forest , and Judith has in turn - and for reasons yet unknown - set off by helicopter for the wreck of the Borealis .
That has to be at least a few hours !
Night of RLD+8
By this time the detonation of the teleport core at the top of the Citadel is complete , and a great deal of destroyed Citadel has fallen into the city below .
In addition , the Combine anti-antlion field has collapsed , allowing antlions to begin burrowing into City 17 .
The human reproductive suppression field has also collapsed .
However , the Citadel itself is still intact for the moment .
The Combine anti-headcrab field has also collapsed by now which is why " Zombine " soldiers now start appearing .
Severed from the Combine universe , Combine forces arrange for the Citadel reactor - this time referring to the much larger reactor housed deep underground below the building - to overload .
The result will be a colossal " dark energy flare " which is powerful enough to transmit a single packet of information through to the Combine universe ... and incidentally completely destroy City 17 .
Isaac Kleiner and others reactivate as much local transportation as possible so that the city can be evacuated , and broadcast an announcment outlining these facts to the citizens .
Both Freeman and Vance are teleported by vortigaunts to the rubble immediately below the Citadel .
Alyx recovers first , possibly having been discovered and rescued by Dog , who has been waiting outside since helping Freeman enter the Citadel earlier that day .
She and Dog then uncover Freeman .
They restore contact with Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner who inform them about the flare , which they presume to be an accidental result of the damage done to the Citadel .
Dog helps them re-enter the Citadel .
Episode One : " Undue Alarm " .
The " Kleinercast " does n't appear until later .
While moving through the highly unstable Citadel , Freeman and Vance encounter a recording of Breen agreeing to be placed in a host body .
Then , a life - support pod containing a live Combine Advisor inflicts them with powerful mind - blasts before jetting away .
From a dramatic point of view , there is no reason for replaying the Breen sequence at this point ... unless , of course , the Combine Advisor seen in this chapter actually contains Breen 's uploaded mind .
Thus , this seems like a very safe assumption .
If Breen ca n't survive in the Combine Advisors ' world , it is logical that the Combine Advisors would need life support to survive in ours .
Soon after , Vance uncovers evidence that the reactor overload is intentional , not accidental , and retrieves a copy of the content of the data packet that the Combine intended to send , though she cannot read it .
By this time , Mossman has located the site of the Borealis and sent back some video -- however , the Combine have caught up with her .
Vance retrieves this video too , while Freeman stabilises the reactor .
The two attempt to escape via Razor Train .
However , the train derails and they continue their evacuation of City 17 on foot .
As they do so , the Combine restart the reactor overload procedure .
The heroes have bought a few hours , but that is all .
Episode One : " Undue Alarm " and " Direct Intervention " .
Why does the train derail ?
Presumably due to antlion activity under the lines .
Red Letter Day + 9 Vance and Freeman fight their way through an antlion - infested underground parking structure and reach the surface early in the morning .
They spend much of the day working their way through the remaining Combine forces in City 17 , catching up with Barney Calhoun in the process .
All three escape the city by conventional rail .
As Vance and Freeman are leaving the city , pods containing Combine Advisors are jettisoned from the Citadel and across the surrounding countryside , inflicting them with mind - blasts as they pass overhead .
The Combine dark energy flare is triggered .
The mysterious data packet is sent home to the Combine universe , and the Citadel detonates , completely destroying City 17 and everybody left within the city limits , and once again derailing Vance and Freeman 's train .
Episode One : " Lowlife " , " Urban Flight " and " Exit 17 " .
While underground , Vance inexplicably " hope[s ] that it 's still light out " despite the fact that their journey began at night .
The " Kleinercast " seen when they reach the surface reveals several of the facts mentioned just above , as well as confirming the theory that a " tiny crack " remained after the Black Mesa event was settled , through which the Combine launched their initial attack .
Notice how the final train passes the outer " walking wall " of the city just as the explosion begins .
to be added : Episode Two
? " Ratman " is woken up by GLaDOS and led through the Aperture Science Enrichment Center Test Chambers .
He gets as far as Test Chamber 17 or so , but is unable to solve the puzzle , goes mad , hallucinates that the Weighted Companion Cube is talking to him , and escapes the test chambers via Chamber 16 , scrawling " THE CAKE IS A LIE " and other helpful directions on the walls on his way out .
The Portal 2 prequel comic reveals that , contrary to previous conjecture , Ratman is not Cave Johnson himself but another Aperture employee .
Among the things Ratman has scrawled on the wall is the CJOHNSON / TIER3 username / password for use on the Aperture Science website - or rather , within the Half - Life universe , on the Aperture computer terminals .
How does he know this login ?
?
Chell is woken up by GLaDOS and solves all the Aperture Science Test Chambers .
She escapes into the " backstage " area of the facility , confronts and shuts down GLaDOS .
In the ensuing explosion , Chell is jettisoned to the surface outside the facility and falls unconscious .
She is taken back inside the facility by a robot and placed into cryogenic storage .
Ratman , with his beloved Weighted Companion Cube in tow , observes Chell 's progress .
The Portal 2 prequel comic , " Lab Rat " , reveals Ratman 's story .
Based on GLaDOS ' comments about the world outside during the final confrontation , Portal takes place during or after the Portal Storm .
It does n’t matter if you ’ve got the greatest product or service in the world .
You could have the fountain of youth , for all it ’s worth .
But how good your product is simply does n’t matter if no one knows about it .
If you do n’t market your product or service , no one will ever hear about it .
And if they do n’t hear about it , how are they ever going to purchase it ?
Suffice to say , marketing is one of the most crucial functions of a business .
B2B and B2C marketing both are crucial to taking a company from zero to success .
Without marketing , no company has ever succeeded .
The type of marketing you employ , however , depends on the product you sell and the industry you serve .
In this article , you ’ll learn all about the differences in B2B vs B2C marketing .
What is B2C Marketing ?
Let ’s first take some time to understand what B2C marketing is .
B2C stands for a simple phrase : business 2 community .
The underlying concept is that a business is selling a product or service directly to consumers .
Most of the major companies that you think of are B2C companies .
For instance , think about Walmart .
Walmart serves a plethora of consumers who come into their stores everyday to purchase their products .
Walmart does not serve as a middleman that sells to businesses , but rather directly to the consumers .
Thus , Walmart is a B2C company .
It follows that B2C marketing entails all of the marketing strategy that a business employs to reach out directly to consumers .
What is B2B Marketing ?
B2B stands for a similar phrase : business 2 business .
A B2B brand sells its product or service to businesses .
An example of a B2B company is an IT solutions firm .
Such a company will cater to fulfilling the technology needs of a business .
They do not sell directly to the consumer , but rather to a business that may sell to another business or directly to the consumer .
There are some companies that operate both B2B as well as B2C businesses .
Take , for instance , Delta Airlines .
This airline operates in the B2C sector by selling flight tickets directly to consumers .
However , it also operates in the B2B sector by selling flight packages to corporates for their employees ’ business travel .
Thus , it has to combine both B2B and B2C marketing strategies in order to reach the required audiences .
Now that we have a solid understanding of what B2B and B2C marketing are , let ’s look at how they are different within specific applications .
Creating the Ideal Buyer Persona
Any marketing agency worth its salt ( like Motion ) knows the importance of creating an ideal buyer persona .
An ideal buyer persona is essentially a profile containing demographics , interests , and a ton of other information about what the perfect customer for your company looks like .
For a B2C brand , this ideal buyer persona will include specific people .
The buyer profile will cater to a specific kind of person with specific interests , a certain location , a set of habits , et cetera .
For a B2B brand , this ideal buyer persona does not include a person , but rather a business .
The buyer profile will include information about the company size , the industry it serves , the technology stack it uses , and other related things .
Then , a marketing strategy is built to cater to that individual buyer persona .
Types of Content Marketing
One of the places where B2B and B2C marketing differ vastly is in content marketing .
Given that content marketing is one of the most significant avenues for a marketing department to execute its strategy , the majority of the difference between B2B and B2C exists in the type of content that is published .
Think about what kind of content is consumed by the average consumer .
A person will typically read blogs and peruse social media .
Thus , a B2C marketing strategy is built largely around those two types of content .
On the other hand , B2B marketing requires a very different type of content .
Typically , the product or service sold by the B2B brand is to improve the operations or efficiency of a business .
Thus , the B2B company will publish white papers , technical eBooks , and slideshows with copious amounts of data that demonstrates the return on investment a company can see by investing in their product or service .
This type of content , which is a little dry for your average consumer to read , would hardly work in the B2C space .
Approaching Social Media Marketing
Another way where B2B and B2C marketing departments different greatly is when it comes to social media marketing .
With a B2C brand , social media is more of a fun game .
The brands have to be witty , funny , and respond instantly to any complaints ( Wendy ’s is a great example of this ) .
B2B brands , however , have to maintain a more professional aura .
That means being more active on networks like Linked In than on networks like Twitter and Instagram .
What Unites Them Both : Relationship Building
Despite the differences , there ’s something very significant that unites both B2B and B2C marketing .
And that ’s the fact that both are focused on relationship building .
At the end of the day , selling is all about building close , personal relationships with the people who buy your product .
Think of it this way — are you more likely to purchase something based on the behest of a mammoth conglomerate headquartered at some location far away from you , or from a company that has built a relationship with you to the point where you trust its recommendations ?
In 10/10 cases , the latter is the way that you ’ll go .
Thus , any business , whether B2B or B2C , uses its marketing to develop relationships with its customers .
B2B and B2C Marketing , Made Easy
Now that you know the differences between B2B and B2C marketing , all that remains for you is to go out and start implementing the various strategies for your company .
Whether you serve direct consumers or large brands , make sure that you make relationship building the core of what you do .

To Kill or Not to Kill Cities Tackle Surge in Global Pigeon Population
Gray and inconspicuous they may be , but pigeons are highly adaptable and their numbers are surging around the world , heightening the risk of disease .
Cities have resorted to imaginative techniques to kill the birds over the years , but the only effective curb is to stop feeding them , says a Swiss scientist .
For decades , SWLs have been hearing stations that do nothing but read blocks of numbers , usually using a woman 's voice , in a variety of languages and on innumerable different frequencies .
All available evidence indicates that some of these transmissions may be somehow connected to espionage activities .
These are the numbers stations , the most enduring mystery on the shortwave bands .
Even though they do not operate on any fixed schedule or frequencies known to the public , numbers stations are really very easy to hear .
Just tune outside the established shortwave broadcasting or ham radio bands and you 'll hear several with patient tuning .
While numbers stations can be heard any time on any frequencies , most seem to be heard in North America during the evening and night hours on frequencies from 3 to 12 MHz .
Most numbers stations heard in North America transmit in Spanish .
Other languages often heard include English , German , and scattered other languages such as Chinese and Russian .
Almost all will use a woman 's voice , although on rare occasions a man 's voice might be used .
You will quickly notice that the numbers you hear sound much like the " intercept " messages used by telephone companies to give out new numbers when you dial a discontinued number , and a similar technology is obviously in use to generate numbers messages .
There are two main types of English and Spanish numbers transmissions you can hear .
The first , the five - digit stations , transmits messages in blocks of five digits .
The second , the 3/2 - digit stations , are so named because there is a distinct pause between the third and fourth digit of each group .
For years , stations were heard in Spanish and English transmitting numbers in four - digit blocks .
These now seem to have been replaced by the 3/2 - digit stations , although some four - digit German numbers stations are still heard in Europe .
Five - digit Spanish stations are the most frequently heard variety .
They begin transmissions with something like " atención 341 67 " repeated for several minutes .
The three - digit group is believed to the identifier of the recipient of the message , while the second number is the number of five - digit groups in the message .
Sometimes as many as three different messages may be sent in the same transmission .
Transmissions usually conclude with the words " fínal , fínal . "
Almost all of these stations use AM .
The next most commonly heard type is the 3/2 - digit Spanish station .
These open with a three - digit group sent three times ( again believed to be the intended recipient ) followed by " 1234567890 . "
This sequence is repeated for several minutes .
After ten tones , something like " grupo 154 , grupo 154 " is sent .
The number following " grupo " is the number of groups that will be transmitted .
Numbers stations using English , German , and other languages generally follow similar formats , although often with some significant variations .
Some numbers stations using Morse code have been reported , although the Morse is usually sent using audio tones over AM instead of as CW .
Morse code numbers stations were once common , but their number has steeply declined in recent years .
One interesting aspect of numbers broadcasts is that a message may be repeated hours or days later on the same or different frequency .
The purpose of this is not known , although one logical reason would be to allow the intended recipient another opportunity to receive the message in the event they were unable to listen at the earlier time .
Another possible explanation is that some messages could be for training and practice rather than to actually convey information .
The formats used by the five - digit and 3/2 - digit stations follow two well known cryptological techniques .
The first is the one - time pad system , which fits with the format of the five - digit stations .
In this system , both the sender and recipient have copies of a code pad .
The code pad will have several columns of numbers , seemingly at random .
The received numbers are added or subtracted from the numbers on the sheet of the one - time pad being used , and the results are compared to a master code key list .
Each number block will usually represent a complete word or phrase rather than a sequence of characters .
After each page in a one - time pad is used , it is torn from the pad and destroyed .
( The CIA has reportedly developed one - time pads whose pages turn into chewing gum upon contact with saliva ! )
One - time pads as small as postage stamps are known to exist .
While the one - time method sounds crude , messages sent using it are unbreakable so long as a copy of the pad used does n't fall into the hands of the " opposition . "
The 3/2 - digit stations seem to be using some variation of the dictionary code system .
In this system , a book available to the sender and recipient is used as the basis of message encoding and decoding .
The first three digits represent the page number , while the last two digits are the position of a certain word on the page , usually counting from the upper left corner of the page .
This method has the advantage of eliminating the risk of delivering one - time pads to agents and having those pads discovered .
The big disadvantage has traditionally been a lengthy , slow encoding process , although computers can now handle this easily and quickly .
It may be no accident that 3/2 - digit first appeared in the early 1980s , when PCs began to greatly increase in power !
Many 3/2 - digit transmissions are made using reduced carrier AM .
This modulation method reduces the carrier power and puts additional power in the sidebands .
This method allows improved intelligibility and reception over normal AM , but is compatible with shortwave radios that only receive AM signals .
While some dispute this conclusion , there is evidence that most numbers stations may be connected with intelligence and espionage operations .
Books such as The Spy Who Got Away by David Wise , Widows by William R. Corson , Susan B. Trento , and Joseph J. Trento , and KGB Today by John Baron , have all detailed espionage operations , both American and Soviet , involving the use of messages sent via radio as number groups .
Other spies , like England 's Geoffrey Prime , have been arrested with one - time pads and a shortwave radio in their possession .
However , not all numbers stations may be connected to espionage .
Some transmissions , especially those using a man 's voice or sent " live " rather than taped , may be connected to drug smuggling or other illegal activities .
The five - digit Spanish transmissions appear to be originating within Cuba .
These often have hum and other technical difficulties , and sometimes audio from Radio Havana Cuba has been heard mixed in with the numbers messages !
This indicates the five - digit Spanish numbers and Radio Havana Cuba probably use the same transmitting facilities .
Another possibility is that some numbers stations operate from embassies and consulates in the United States and elsewhere .
Under international law , embassies and consulates have the right to maintain radio facilities to communicate with their home countries .
Since embassies and consulates are " extraterritorial " to the nation they are located in , stations there could be used for numbers transmissions .
There are still other mysteries surrounding numbers stations .
SWLs equipped with spectrum analyzers have found data bursts buried within numbers transmissions .
Subaudible tones have been detected on other numbers signals .
And listeners like Brian Webb of California and Zel Eaton of Missouri have heard numbers transmissions , in the AM mode , on frequencies above 30 MHz during sporadic - E openings .
This is noteworthy because frequencies above 30 MHz are normally restricted to local reception .
There is another category of mystery station closely related to numbers stations , known as " phonetic " stations .
These transmit messages using groups of five letters from the international phonetic alphabet ( alpha , bravo , charlie , delta , etc. ) .
These stations are often heard repeating a phrase like " charlie india oscar two " for hours before any message is actually sent .
It is widely believed that phonetic stations are operated by the Mossad , Israel 's intelligence service .
In addition to Israel itself , it is believed that these stations also operate from Israeli embassies .
( Some of these stations have been heard with local quality signals in the Washington area , for example . )
While most SWLs could n't care less about numbers stations , others are obsessed with them .
And it 's understandable .
. . . how often do you get to play James Bond and match wits with the CIA , the Mossad , and other intelligence services of the world ?

Raw Story :
A House Judiciary Committee deadline passed Monday with former White House adviser Karl Rove standing by his refusal to testify about allegations that he pushed the Justice Department to prosecute former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
In his latest offer to settle the matter , Rove sent the panel a letter offering to respond to questions in writing , according to his attorney .
But he reiterated that he would not testify publicly and under oath .
Committee leaders did not immediately answer questions about how they will respond .
Earlier this month , they threatened to subpoena Rove if he did not agree to appear voluntarily by Monday .
The dispute is the latest in a standoff between President Bush and Congress over testimony from current and former White House staffers on a variety of issues .
Hmmmm .
Seems he ’s now singing a different tune …
What a liar – and a coward .
On April 7th , 2008 , Rove ’s attorney said he would agree to testify if subpoenaed by Congress .
I wonder what changed his mind ..?
Perhaps the fact that Don Siegelman is out of prison awaiting an appeal – and talking ?
Will Karl
Rove stall over the course of the next six months in hopes of receiving his very own “ get out of jail free ” card ( more likely “ keep out of jail ” card ) from the president ?
For more on Don Siegelman , who he is and how this all relates to Karl Rove , read these previous posts :

To visit Florida on holiday and come back having only experienced Disney World is both a travesty and an occurrence far too common amongst modern tourists .
Florida is absolutely full of fascinating architecture , quirky sights and beautiful structures that are more than worth the trip on their own .
Here are just 4 examples of local sights that have either been abandoned since completion or never finished and which serve as a perfect destination for tourists looking for unique photo opportunities or parts of Florida that contain more character and history than Mr Disney ’s theme park .
Make sure you include them in your plans when you next visit .
1. Stiltsville
If you head down to Biscayne Bay and look out to sea you ’ll spot 6 incredible buildings hovering above the shallow waters .
At its peak this sea-dwelling community known as Stiltsville comprised of 36 properties resting on stilts , all located at least a mile from the shore .
During the days of prohibition local fisherman Eddie Walker started Stiltsville by building a shack in the Bay – soon afterwards fellow locals did the same and the ‘ village ’ grew rapidly with the majority of the properties becoming gambling dens and clubs as they were n’t victim to laws which disallowed these types of establishment within a mile from shore .
Over the years the houses - on - stilts have taken many a battering from hurricanes and other severe weather and these days only a few remain , empty and falling into disrepair .
2. Perky ’s Bat Tower
In 1929 frustrated local businessman Richter Clyde Perky decided the time had come to rid his holiday resort of mosquitoes and the threat of both malaria and commercial failure .
His idea was to invest in a structure called a Bat Tower , the invention of a Texan ‘ Bat Researcher ’ by the name of Dr. Campbell who believed that the towers would provide an attractive home for bats , well - known gobblers of mosquitoes .
The plans in place , Mr Perky installed the huge wooden Bat Tower at great cost , shipped in hundreds of bats from Texas and Cuba and put the Champagne on ice .
As soon as the bats were released they flew away , never to return .
The charming Bat Tower , minus the resort it was meant to save , can still be seen and photographed at mile marker 17 of Lower Sugarloaf Key .
Watch out for the mosquitoes .
3. Fort Jefferson
Work began on this fascinating , unfinished coastal fort in 1846 and the building is still the largest masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere , comprising of over 16 million bricks .
Construction on the hexagonal fort continued for 30 years , the work - in - progress at its peak becoming home to 2’000 people , building work only stopped when advances in artillery development and armored ships rendered the fort ’s defensive walls useless .
These days this fantastic structure is part of Dry Tortugas National Park and can only be reached by seaplane or boat but the effort is definitely worth it .
4. Bahia Honda Rail Bridge
If you ever visit the Florida Keys , make sure you head to Bahia Honda Key near the lower end of the islands .
In the early 1900s it was connected to neighbouring island Spanish Harbor Key by the Bahia Honda Bridge , part of the engineering marvel known as the Overseas Railroad .
These days , following both the devastating Labor Day Hurricane in 1935 and the creation of a newer bridge , the stunning abandoned bridge sits unused by traffic .
What ’s amazing is the bridge in its current form : 2 truss spans have been taken out leaving a huge gap for boat traffic to pass through and locals use the disconnected portion as an ideal fishing spot .
Definitely a unique view to behold .
So there you have it : 4 beautifully unique locations in Florida without a single sighting of Mickey Mouse .
And that ’s just for starters .

Two years ago , when I was in Kuala Lumpur as a guest of the Perdana Peace Forum , I had the singularly unpleasant experience of meeting Robert Mugabe .
Well , “ meeting ” him is hardly the word : rather , I espied him , sitting directly across from me , at the opening banquet of the conference .
Turning to the person next to me , I asked : “ Is n’t that guy sitting over there Robert Mugabe ? ”
My friend squinted , and replied : “ Sure looks like it . ”
The table was loaded down with lots of really good food : Malaysian fare , with all its wonderful color and variety .
But I seemed to have lost my appetite rather suddenly .
“ You mean I have to eat at the same table with that murdering despot ? ”
As is my wont , I was speaking rather loudly .
Mugabe looked up , and straight at me .
I felt like giving him the finger , but , instead , I got up and exited the room .
Better not to make a scene quite yet .
I was upset .
I had no idea Mugabe would be attending – he showed up uninvited – and if I had I would never have agreed to come .
Yet there I was , 8,000 miles from home , already committed to speak to the conference , and , although Mugabe was nowhere listed as a speaker or official guest , word of his presence would soon get out .
What to do ?
As exhausted as I was from the 15 - hour flight , I was quite prepared to get on a plane , and head home – and that ’s exactly what I determined to do if the conference organizers could not be dissuaded from allowing Mugabe ’s participation .
As it was , Mugabe was seated right next to the prime mover of the conference , ex - Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad , and Mugabe was constantly whispering in his ear , much to the former ’s apparent annoyance .
There was something distinctly reptilian about the African tyrant ’s visage and general demeanor : at any moment , I fully expected him to flick a foot - long tongue at a passing fly .
After the banquet , and during it , I made my opinion of Mugabe unmistakably clear , and lobbied the other speakers to appeal to the conference organizers , and threaten a walk - out if necessary .
Most agreed with me on the general subject of Mugabe : only George Galloway disdained to join the rest of us in opposing the presence of a man whose name has become a synonym for African despot .
Galloway , asked his opinion on the matter , scowled and declared that it was n’t our place to criticize Mugabe – only George W. Bush and the “ imperialists ” were fair game .
However , everyone else – former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke , former UN assistant secretary - general Denis Halliday , former UN assistant secretary - general Hans von Sponeck , Daniel Ellsberg , and anti-nuclear - arms activist and writer Helen Caldicott .
– were quite disturbed by Mugabe ’s presence , and made this very clear to the Perdana organization .
The result was that an event at which Mugabe was supposed to speak was canceled , and – a day before the Zimbabwean President fled the scene in a huff – I had a run-in with his “ bodyguards , ” who thought they could intimidate me .
Boy , were they mistaken !
It was actually kind of funny , albeit a bit on the scary side , when three or four of these thugs – big , ugly - looking brutes to a man – suddenly sat down at my table at a luncheon and tried to push their weight around .
Those poor guys soon found themselves an unwilling audience for a lecture on the basic principles of libertarianism , and why their country is an economic basket case .
Since they could n’t just start clubbing me to death right there in plain sight – although I do n’t think they would have hesitated had they found me on the streets of Kuala Lumpur – they faced the choice of either retreating or allowing themselves to be bored to death .
They wisely chose the former course .
At any rate , the whole subject of Mugabe comes up now because he ’s in trouble on his own turf , with his ruling ZANU - PF party apparently defeated in the recent election , in spite of the widespread violence and intimidation engaged in by Mugabe ’s militants – or , perhaps , because of it .
Although a 165,000 percent inflation rate may also have something to do with it .
Yet Mugabe clings to power , while his thugs have taken possession of ballot boxes and his government refuses to release the official results , although everyone knows he and his party were trounced .
The campaign of violence embarked on by ZANU - PF has intensified , and the opposition has accused Mugabe of pulling off a de facto coup .
In his long and bloody career as first and only President of Zimbabwe , the 84 - year - old Mugabe has engaged in a systematic campaign of murder , racist demagoguery , and wholesale looting to maintain himself and his cronies in power .
Not since Idi Amin has such a bloody - minded sociopath and mass murderer arisen out of the dark heart of Africa .
The United States , which does n’t mind supporting the continent ’s worst dictators , from Hosni Mubarak in Egypt to Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia , wo n’t touch Mugabe with a ten - foot pole .
Indeed , listening to the Voice of America in Mugabe - land can get you in trouble with the secret police .
The US , the EU , the UN , leaders of neighboring countries – all have expressed varying levels of disapproval as Mugabe ’s international stock has plummeted to new lows .
Yet he has always managed to retain at least one ally , through thick and thin , one that remains loyal even now , and that is the government of Israel .
They have been a steady supplier of military equipment , including riot control tanks and water cannon , which has been used to suppress the democratic opposition and keep the country under his iron grip .
Links between Mugabe and Mossad , Israeli ’s intelligence agency , go back years .
In 2002 , one Ari Ben Menashe – employed by Israeli military intelligence from 1977 to at least 1987 , in spite of the Israeli government ’s denials of any connection – shot what was purported to be covertly filmed videotape of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai supposedly discussing a plot to assassinate Mugabe .
This was triumphantly broadcast on Zimbabwe state television on the eve of elections , followed by a fresh wave of repression aimed at pro-democracy activists .
The tape turned out to have been doctored , but the broadcast accomplished its task : providing a momentary rationale for Mugabe ’s reign of terror , which continues to this day .
So well - known is Israel ’s unstinting support for Mugabe that the democratic opposition has accused the government of bringing in computer “ consultants ” from the Mossad to manipulate voter rolls .
( Which certainly surprised at least one Israeli software producer . )
What in the name of all that ’s holy is Israel , a democratic state founded by socialist idealists , doing supporting one of the most reviled despots on earth – one who , furthermore , is no friend of Israel , at least officially .
The answer may be found in certain Israeli - based economic interests , which , in turn , could have an inordinate influence on that nation ’s Africa policy – specifically in the case of Zimbabwe and the “ Democratic Republic of the Congo . ”
Unfortunately , Israel ’s policy in regard to Zimbabwe is not the exception that proves the rule : it is business as usual .
The moral depravity of Israel ’s African policies are highlighted by the close cooperation that existed between Tel Aviv and the apartheid regime of South Africa .
Israel provided the expertise , experience , and technology , as well as other covert military aid , which enabled white Pretoria to hold off the African National Congress for as long as it did .
And , as Jimmy Carter and others have pointed out , Israel has replicated its former ally ’s policy toward black South Africans in the occupied territories .
In reviewing the facts , it is hard to come up with a single despotic government that has n’t received some sort of aid or assistance from the Israelis : Colombia , where “ former ” Mossad agents train government anti-terrorist units and right - wing paramilitaries – El Salvador , where arms and expertise provided to successive right - wing juntas helped stabilize these US - supported regimes – Guatemala , where “ former ” Israeli military and intelligence officers provided security for the notoriously repressive Guatemalan military dictatorship – and the pattern is repeated throughout South and Central America .
The list goes on : Iran , under the rule of the Shah Reza Pahlavi , was the scene of the notorious SAVAK ’s worst crimes : the Iranian secret police reportedly were schooled in techniques of torture by the Mossad .
What is it with the Israelis ?
Why do they have a predilection for murderous tyrants ?
What seems , at first , like a pattern of sheer moral perversity may be broken down , in specific cases , into discrete economic , strategic , and diplomatic objectives .
Yet one has to be astonished – and more than a little horrified – at the complete amorality that guides the Israeli government ’s actions around the world .
This record of Israeli support for dictators and despots worldwide is , perhaps , part of the reason for that country ’s growing unpopularity on a global scale : however , in the US , where the Israel lobby wields inordinate power in government and the media , it ’s quite a different story .
Here , support for Israel is in the 70 percent range – a testament to the supposedly nonexistent power of the Lobby , and the relative ignorance of and indifference to world affairs exhibited by most Americans .

Today marks the celebration of International Day of Press Freedom .
Like many celebrations that we are called to recognise , rather than feel joy at how wonderful things are , we are reminded of just how much goes haywire .
Reporters Without Borders lists those killed in 2007 .
They write that there has been : 129 journalists , 7 media assistants and 63 cyberdissidents jailed , 8 journalists killed since the beginning of the year , the latest in the list of horrors , Fadel Shanaa .
While all normal people with conscience recognise that it is essential to insist upon obtaining justice for the operators of information who are killed while doing their work in areas where violence is manifest , we notice that there are other ways to prevent the dissemination of information , and this restriction of freedom is nothing less than censorship .
I remember thinking that censorship was something done in the 40s by priests who had to approve the films that the Italian public was allowed to watch .
When I was young and na�ve , I thought it was something that only totalitarian or ultra-repressed societies would dare to use .
I now know much better , and it�s not only the Big Media that simply does not allow content in that they disapprove of , it is far more sinister .
It seems as though the journalists are aware of what is expected of them and they produce it without needing to be steered .
In 2004 , I translated portions of a book by Giulietto Chiesa that I consider to be fundamental reading .
An excerpt of it states :
It is very evident that these dutiful defenders of America will not allow the powerful , or should we say " the Power " , to be criticised in any way whatsoever .
These are people already well versed in the art of bowing and scraping to " the Power " , wherever it may be , so just think what they�ll be like when " the Power " actually becomes " the Empire " !
So , quite often , they find themselves in the inglorious position of defending those who already have ample defensive ( and offensive ) capabilities of their own .
And there are lots of these defenders : the majority of political commentators , for example , would never have got where they are without giving cast iron proof of their absolute loyalty to " the Power " .
All this needed time to come about .
It was a long , complex and contradictory gestation .
It didn�t all go smoothly , as always happens when the forces in play are real and not the abstract schemes of utopians that just happen to be in power .
You make your plans as you go along , on the spur of the moment , but then you need intellectuals to give them form , glorify them in the eyes of the public , ennoble them and explain them .
These propagandists have to be trained , convinced and , if necessary , bribed and corrupted .
And then all obstacles , doubters , non-believers and wise guys have to be got out of the way .
Playing it clean if possible , but dirty if necessary .
For those of you who�ve forgotten , an instructions manual has already been written for this and it�s enough to follow it .
It �s called The Prince by Nicholas Macchiavelli and it�s free , because it�s out of copyright .
The aim , therefore , is to stifle the discussion and silence the adversaries , an aim that is much more ideological than you would care to think .
It also explains perfectly , for example , why the whole of the Italian press ( and not only the Italian press ) often say the same things .
The rule is that the people controlling the media have to be totally reliable : they don�t even have to be told what to say .
They already know it by heart .
They have already internalised the rules of the game .
Being reliable is something that requires lengthy training and considerable single - mindedness .
On every level of the information hierarchy you have to prove that you have a total disregard for the truth , a complete readiness to deceive and an absolutely impenetrable cynicism .
This , as a rule , is the only way of getting up to the next level . "
Yes , absolutely impenetrable cynicism is the key to containing any adversaries to " the Power " .
And , what is quite interesting is that in our day and age , anyone with access to a computer is allowed to enter at some level of the information hierarchy by contributing to forums , leaving comments to articles , writing letters , and the latest and most popular form of this is to create a weblog that reflects one�s own musings and at times the information one finds and would like to share .
Weblogs are the ideal for the technically inept as well as being cost free or with very limited costs .
This is why there are millions of them .
A social network has grown out of these weblogs , and that is the blogging community .
Most of us with a blog have a blogroll , listing blogs that are about topics that we or our readers are interested in , blogs by our friends and links that we would like to share with someone else in a public way .
Sometimes we add the links with distraction ( and putting them up doesn�t mean endorsing all content or even knowing who the owner is , as some try to use as an excuse to attack bloggers whose own content stands up to attacks by critics who would love to see the blogs shut down ) , sometimes because we read an article on the blog that we liked and add to the blogroll so that we can check out the rest later .
At any rate , the blogging community has grown into a unit where we are dedicated supporters of other bloggers and we stand united in moments of difficulty .
The Palestine � Iraq blogging world has been recently under severe attack .
Our blogs are being targeted for destruction .
In the past few weeks , many of us have seen a spam note from Blogger .
Machetera wrote about the censorship in a series of articles ( also here ) .
This spam note has driven Desert Peace�s Steve away ( and his contribution to this post follows ) , and I shortly followed suit , not without having undergone the violence against the principle of Voltaire brought upon me by Tony Greenstein .
In fact , there are many who call themselves progressives or leftists who love censorship .
In the very words of Tony Greenstein , in an article he wrote , bragging that my blog was " dead " , he stated that he had worked to exercise the power of censorship .
He decides what is appropriate .
He is the arbiter of the truth and the judge of the limits of discourse .
He determines single - handedly who has got to be flushed down the wastewater system .
But , he is wise enough to recognise his limits .
He can�t do it alone .
No one listens to him , so he has to enlist the help of " the Power " .
" It is gratifying to announce that the anti-Semitic sewer , going by the name of ' Peace Palestine � has now died a death .
After I had it taken down for a day or so , because of its libellous comment , Google decided in any case it was a �spam� blog .
Who are we to disagree ?!!! "
Apparently , he doesn�t know not only did Google not find it anti-Semitic OR libelous , which were his claims , resulting in its immediate reinstatement , but Tony doesn�t know that Spam Blogs are computer generated blogs to sell things or increase profit in some way .
Yet ,
Tony himself claims that he too received the spam notice , bringing him into that honourable category of the enemy of the Zionists who are operating to close their opponents down .
" But I�ll let fartypants into what I think is the story and it�s not one of censorship .
I wrote to Google not so long ago saying that there was stuff that was personally libellous and yes they should take the whole of the cesspit down .
However they decided not to and Rizzo was the one who crowed over that .
Now she has moved the blog anyway because it was deemed a �spam� blog .
The secret is that this blog was also blocked for the same reasons .
What that meant was that nothing could be posted here for a day or two .
It was an automatic process triggered by the software Google use , nothing to do with censorship .
Clearly Rizzo had had enough and maybe wanted to put the past , including all the racist rubbish behind her ( here�s hoping ) and make a fresh start .
let �s hope so .
I don�t know whether Google is particularly pro-Zionist , after all when I tried to get the blog taken down they refused .
However I�m indifferent as to whether or not they take an anti-Semitic blog down because it�s libellous .
To be blunt I couldn�t care less if one section of the Right censors another section .
I regard Rizzo�s blog and the activities of those like Atzmon around it as doing nothing but a service for Zionism .
It is no accident that when it comes to the historica division in diaspora Jewry between the anti-Zionist Bund and the Zionists , that Atzmon clearly and explicitly takes the side of the latter .
If this is pro-Palestinian then fine . "
Now , let �s look carefully at what�s behind his claims .
First of all , he admits that he acted to get me shut down , and it is because of the content , deeming at any rate ( falsely ) that it is in the Right , as if that alone were reason enough to have it shut down : Hmmm , take a look at this quote by Noam Chomsky - " If you believe in freedom of speech , you believe in freedom of speech for views you don�t like .
Goebbels was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked .
So was Stalin .
If you �re in favor of freedom of speech , that means you �re in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise . "
And John Pilger writes :
" If we don�t believe in free expression for people we despise , we don�t believe in it at all . "
Obviously ,
Tony hides behind the white flag of it being libelous , which was deemed untrue by Google .
Then he claimed it was anti-Semitic , and there again , they ran it through their machines and they disagreed .
So , it comes down to the matter of it being " on the Right " , which to him is good enough reason to have it closed , and I do dare him to show even ONE post that is on the Right , we remain with the real reason .
It �s just his personal despising of me and of those whose right to free speech I ardently defend and support .
Tony does not believe in my right of expression , nor in that right being allowed for a long list of people .
If he were in a totalitarian State , what would his actions be ?
He would be the censorship boss of the Minculpop at the very least , which is the activity he engages in more than any other and it has been widely documented on my blog .
In fact , he would be just another weird figure in the cyberspace if he were not so hellbent on censorship , which is what my blog community fights against .
Those who do not believe in freedom of expression don�t even know when they are acting as censors or even that they do so .
They find an ideological and " progressive " reasoning for it , without ever having to support that there is any truth behind their gagging .
If he can�t shut them down or have them kicked out of town , he writes articles against all of his critics and at times , we even have to waste precious time to correct his myriad errors .
Yet , it is interesting to note , that while he thinks Blogger and Google are not particularly pro-Zionist , why is it that when he claims he has gotten the same spam note , and it was resolved in a jiffy , Steve�s blog , my blog , Layla Anwar�s blog , Crimes and Corruption of the New World Order have all together found this " robot " so unkind and deliberately rude .
It doesn�t respond to our letters , it lies that in 4 days it will take care of everything .
Tony is certain it�s all bona fide �
What more proof do we need that it�s a pro-Zionist for real ?
Google has some more to answer for as well .
Google has stopped indexing Uruknet as a news source .
This is not the first time .
I must have at least 10 letters in my archives to them regarding this matter , none of them had received any kind of feedback , although I encourage all to write to them ( Uruknet has a form prepared on this link so that you can easily let Google know you are on to what they are doing to the most important source of information on Iraq ) .
The webmaster of Uruknet is of an intelligence and dedication that are not rare , they are unique .
She has indicated some interesting statistics to me about the indexing : Google news has not only stopped indexing Uruknet , but it has blacklisted articles of other sites that cite Uruknet .
For example , it indexes UN Observer , but it has not put in this article : http://www.unobserver.com/layout4.php?id=4725&blz=1
because , obviously , it cites Uruknet .
http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&tab=bn&scoring=n&q=site%3Awww.unobserver.com&btnG=Search.
If an article of any site cites a word of Uruknet , it is immediately pushed off by google .
news .
( Now I see why my stuff has vanished from there !
Not only is Uruknet my favourite site , I think we would all be lost without it ) .
Google.com censors not only 90 % of Uruknet , but also the sites that cite it as can be detected by the results of google.com search for the word " uruknet " : 188,000 .
The same search by yahoo.com 1,240,000 .
Do we need any more proof ?
But , don�t go thinking that they don�t want any news about Iraq to get out .
The webmaster of Uruknet tells me that a US - Friendly blog about Iraq was initially given the ' spam� treatment , but , like Tony�s site , it was quickly reinstated once the content was judged as being just fine with " the Power " .
Following the contribution of Steve , who , as another victim of this campaign , I will list a few things that I consider advice for other bloggers .
Steve writes : Musings from one whose freedom was denied� .
How dare I , a Jew living in Israel criticise the injustices practiced in my country .
How dare I speak out against the genocide of my brothers on the other side of the wall of apartheid .
Try to censor me if you must , but I assure you I will not be silenced .
Daily Kos was the first to cut me off with a ban� .
I dared to defend my brother and friend Benjamin Heine .
He too dared to criticise the inhumane policies of zionism� .
he too was banned from Daily Kos .
The post that got me banned can be seen HERE .
Just what is Daily Kos afraid of ?
Blogspot was the next culprit that attempted to silence me .
Early in January I logged in as usual only to find that ' Robots have determined that my Blog is a Spam Blog� .
I was given the opportunity to challenge this ' charge� via an automated response .
I was assured that I would receive an answer with 4 days .
In 4 days I received another automated answer with the same ' charges� .
This ' game� continued for FOUR months until finally , without notice , my Blog was unlocked .
By then , I had moved on to greener pastures and choose not to use Blogger any longer , feeling that their censorship game was not worth the hassle and I would rather Blog than engage in a fight with closed minded Websites .
Attempts to silence others continues .
The zionists actively engage in desperate ways to have Blogs closed down .
Most notable among these is one Tony Greenstein , a resident zionist in Britain .
He has made it a full time job writing letters , falsely accusing pro Palestinian bloggers of anti Semitism , among other things .
His prime targets are Mary Rizzo of PeacePalestine , and Gilad Aztmon , an ex Israeli also living in Britain .
He claims to be an anti zionist himself , but I have yet to see him attempt to close down their vicious sites or attack them .
His actions are contemptible , as he himself is .
The censorship continues ;
Google not only owns and controls Blogger , it also owns YouTube .
A video depicting the crimes against the people of Palestine and five minutes later it is removed from YouTube .
Again I ask , what are they afraid of ?
As I mentioned earlier , ' try to censor me if you must , but I assure you I will not be silenced !�
I say this on behalf of all of my Brothers and Sisters who went through the same hassles as I did .
We will all continue to spread the truth and the truth will make us free !
HASTA LA VICTORIA SIEMPRE !
Mary�s tips for bloggers :
1 ) Back up all your material .
I learned this the hard way , and if not for my faithful group of friends , I don�t know how I would have salvaged almost 4 years of material .
2 ) Create a mirror blog with a completely different provider .
It takes moments to open a new blog , so register your name and convert your content .
You never know when you may need it .
3 ) You CAN still work with your Blogger template , so leave a message for your readers that you have moved .
I found this out weeks later , and in the meantime , many readers were disoriented .
Two had done an international phone search ( unsuccessfully ) and in the end reached someone close to me to get the number , because they thought I was dead .
Now how is THAT for readership loyalty !
4 ) If possible , go for private hosting options .
This week , Haitham , Gilad and I are going to unveil our newest creation .
Not that private hosts are failsafe , but they are certainly not going to be arbitrarily censored by the provider or those who the provider serves .
5 ) Build and maintain a network community .
They will come to your aid when you need it , they will inform others of your tribulations .
This means not only that you share readership and exchange tips and material , but you can depend upon them when push comes to shove .
I have not been let down by these people , and their generosity and kindness is only equalled by their intelligence .
Not only bloggers are part of the community , but commenters and readers .
6 ) Open a blog or site yourself .
The more voices we have out there , the harder it will be to censor us all .
7 ) Defend the sites under attack , and don�t be afraid of not being " indexed " if you link to a good site .
If and when Google dies , another site will come to replace it .
There is an alternative to everything , but there is no alternative to the right of freedom of expression of an individual , of the unique character of his or her site , and that is what we MUST defend , in order to support the causes we care about .
[ In the fourth Microsoft - sponsored article on Gamasutra 's XNA - themed microsite , XNA Developer Connection 's Walbourn discusses the rise of 64 - bit computing and gaming on Windows , explaining the technical specifics and programming advantages of 64 - bit . ]
“ 640 K is more memory than anyone will ever need ”
This famous , oft - quoted phrase -- and variations of it -- is routinely attributed to Bill Gates , founder and chairman of Microsoft Corporation .
For the record , Gates flatly denies ever having said it .
In fact , he has said the opposite .
1 Still , it persists in technical urban legend as a warning against underestimating the pace of PC evolution .
We ’ve come a long way since the days of the Intel 8088 processor with its 8 - bit data bus addressing one MB ( the upper 384 KB of addressing space was reserved for expansion cards , leaving 640 KB for physical memory ) .
The laptop I ’m using to write this article has 6,500 times more RAM than that .
In fact , my mobile phone , my digital camera , my DVR , and a dozen other electronic devices I interact with every day have far more than 640 KB of memory .
Of course , at the time of this alleged quote , in the early days of the PC industry , many home computers had 64 KB or less .
Like all engineering design efforts , PCs reflect a series of trade - offs .
Designers make compromises to make the device easier to build and cheaper to mass produce .
These compromises often provide some room for future growth , but often fall short of the true pace of innovation to minimize the impact on existing applications .
The PC ’s greatest strength is its great weakness : the relentless drive for innovation and backward compatibility .
It is a testament to the hard work of generations of engineers that we ’ve had a long chain of backward - compatible products that bridge a 16 - bit processor running at 4.77 MHz with 16 KB of RAM , CGA 4 - bit color graphics , and 16 KB of Video RAM ( VRAM ) to the modern 64 - bit processor running four or more CPUs at ~3 GHz , 4 + GB of RAM , one or more Direct3D10 class GPUs , and nearly a GB of VRAM .
We are now a few years into another major transition .
Actually , two major processor transitions are happening at the time same .
First , there is the move from single - core to multi-core processors .
Modern gaming consoles like Microsoft Xbox 360® have already pushed game developers to embrace , if reluctantly , the transition from single - threaded to multi- threaded gaming .
There is still a long way to go before we embrace the multi-core designs currently under development in the PC industry .
At the same time , there is a second transition : these new multi-core processors appearing in our PCs are also 64 - bit x64 processors .
The 4 GB Barrier : Physical Memory Limitations
The core of the memory limitation for a 32 - bit processor comes from basic binary math :
232 = 4,294,967,296 bytes or 4 GB
This means a 32 - bit processor can address only 4 GB worth of memory .
However , 4 GB is extremely optimistic .
Not every single address can be used for physical RAM .
Much like the original IBM PC could address 640 KB of RAM , while the upper 384 KB was reserved for expansion cards , modern devices also need to use some of that addressing space .
At boot time , the BIOS allocates addresses from the 0xc0000000 ( 3 GB ) to 0Xffffffff ( 4 GB ) range for installed devices .
Many of these devices are integrated into the motherboard .
The mapping system is more flexible than it once was .
Even so , everything from your audio device to your video card to the network interface needs to take away some of those address locations for its own purposes .
This leaves the balance available for physical RAM .
Because of this , the actual amount of physical memory accessible is something like 3 GB , 3.33 GB , or 3.5 GB , even when 4 GB or more physical RAM is installed .2
The amount of available physical RAM diminishes when you add more devices such as multiple video cards in a SLI ® or Crossfire™ setup .
There have been clever solutions proposed to resolve this problem , such as Intel ’s Physical Address Extensions , originally introduced in the Intel Pentium ®
Pro and also supported by AMD ’s Athalon™ processors .
3 PAE enables you to use 36 - bit physical memory addressing , while you continue to use 32 - bit addresses for the virtual memory system ’s page tables .
In theory , this allows the operating system to address the “ hidden ” memory while keeping everything intact as 32 bit .
In practice , most Windows device drivers fail when the system is put into 36 - bit PAE mode .
This aspect of PAE is therefore useful only for controlled environments like servers and supercomputing .

SYDNEY ( Reuters Life ! ) -
An Australian politician broke down in tears on Tuesday as he admitted at a news conference that he sniffed the chair of a female colleague .
Western Australia ’s state opposition leader , Troy Buswell , confirmed a newspaper report of the 2005 incident , but said he would not stand down as state Liberal party leader , a position he took up three months ago .
“ These are difficult issues for me to deal with and they are very difficult issues for my family to deal with , ” said 42 - year - old Buswell .
“ It ’s hard dealing with these matters and having to face up to your responsibilities behaviorally , publicly , and it ’s harder to do it privately . ”
An unnamed woman told the West Australian newspaper that Buswell started sniffing her chair after she had been sitting in it in his parliament office in December 2005 .
She said Buswell did it to get a laugh , that the incident took place in front of other staff members , and that she told him she was shocked and outraged .
Local media said Buswell has previously admitted to snapping a Labor party staff member ’s bra as a drunken party trick and has been accused of sexist remarks by a retiring Liberal politician .
The deputy Liberal leader , Kim Hames , said he stood by Buswell , describing him as a “ rough diamond with a robust sense of humor ” , but adding he needed to change his behavior .
Hames also said there was no one to replace Buswell .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration aims to hire more than 1,300 biologists , chemists , pharmacologists and other staff members by October as part of a major expansion , the agency said on Wednesday .

The Food and Drug Administration aims to hire more than 1,300 biologists , chemists , pharmacologists and other staff by October as part of a major expansion , FDA officials told Reuters .
REUTERS / Sebastian Derungs
The hiring effort , first reported by Reuters , comes as the agency is under growing pressure from Congress to improve operations and existing staff is stretched thin .
The new hires will add to the current FDA work force of more than 10,000 employees who regulate food , drugs and other products that account for a quarter of U.S. consumer spending .
More than 600 of the jobs are new posts funded mainly by higher industry fees authorized last year in a broad FDA law meant to bolster drug safety oversight and other areas .
More than 700 additional hires will fill current vacancies , an FDA statement said .
Many of the new employees will work in the area of drug reviews and post - approval monitoring of side effects , said Kimberly Holden , assistant commissioner for operations .
Others will work on food and import safety and inspections .
Finding candidates for all of the jobs could pose a challenge .
Recruiting and retention of specialized scientists were highlighted as problems by a panel of the FDA ’s science board in a critical report last year .
“ We do expect some hurdles ...
We are competing with industry all the time for talent , ” Holden said .
Industry jobs pay more , while academic work offers flexibility and relative freedom from the spotlight shined by Congress and others .
The FDA comes under attack whenever a drug safety controversy erupts .
At the same time , critics and supporters agree agency staffers are pushed to the limit with too little money and a heap of responsibilities .
That climate contributes to a turnover rate in key scientific areas -- twice as high as other government agencies , said Gail Cassell , an Eli Lilly and Co vice president who chaired the science board panel review of FDA .
“ People are a lot more attuned to the fact that the environment must be improved , ” she said .
Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA ’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , said working for the agency offers rewards that she hopes will attract good candidates .
“ It ’s fascinating .
It ’s challenging intellectually .
There ’s the intersection of law and science , medicine and policy ...
You have a tremendous opportunity to make a huge difference , ” said Woodcock , a 20 - year FDA veteran .
One step that should speed hiring is “ direct - hire ” authority , which cuts the normal hiring process to a few weeks from a few months , Holden said .
The FDA hopes to fill the jobs by the September 30 end of the fiscal year , she said .
More staff will be added in future years .
The hiring of additional staff is critical to drugmakers , said Alan Goldhammer , a deputy vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America .
The FDA ’s “ ability to do things in a timely manner is predicated on having the necessary staff in place , ” he said .
Woodcock ’s advice to potential hires ?
“ You have to be thick - skinned .
You have to realize that you are not going to make everybody happy all the time , ” she said .
n these troubled , despairing times , the world needs heroes to offer a message of hope to the huddled masses .
Well , we have that hero :
They say that ' a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man . '
If that 's the case , then nobody could be more embiggened than Aditya ' Romeo ' Dev - the world 's smallest bodybuilder .
Dev , 19 , who is excellent , stands just 33 inches tall - but weighs an impressive 9.25 kg ( just under 1.5 stone ) , and has a chest measurement of 20 inches .
' Romeo ' trains at the Leo Health Club in Phagwara , India , where his trainer is club owner Ranjit Pal ( also known as ' Mr Punjab ' ) .
Pal is reputed to be the fastest skipper in India , which is a fairly brilliant claim in itself .

Thursday , April 3 , 2008
The American Civil Liberties Union has uncovered details pertaining to a secret Justice Department memo from October 2001 that reveals the Bush administration effectively suspended the Fourth Amendment where domestic counter terrorism operations are concerned .
The ACLU reports that the memo states the " Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations . " after 9/11 .
In other words , the DOJ gave the White House a green light to effectively shelve Constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures in the wake of the terror attacks .
The memo was written by then deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo , also the co-author of the PATRIOT Act and author of the now notorious torture memos .
It is almost certain that Yoo ’s memo was written to provide a legal basis for the NSA , a military intelligence agency , to begin its warrantless wiretapping program , which was initiated in the same month .
Just days after the memo ’s delivery to the White House , Dick Cheney and other administration officials briefed four House and Senate leaders on the NSA ’s secret terrorist surveillance program for the first time .
The existence of the 2001 memo came to light via a newly declassified March 2003 document from the Department of Justice ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) entitled Military Interrogation of Alien Unlawful Combatants Held Outside the United States , which makes reference to the previous memo .
The ACLU reports that this second memo takes the erosion of the Constitution beyond the Fourth Amendment and makes the case that the central due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment , the protection against deprivation of life , liberty and property , can also be bypassed by the President .
" This memo makes a mockery of the Constitution and the rule of law , " said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLU .
" That it was issued by the Justice Department , whose job it is to uphold the law , makes it even more unconscionable . "
The March 2003 document was declassified by the Pentagon in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the ACLU pertaining to the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
In a footnote of the document it is written " Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations " , referring to a document titled Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States . "
" The recent disclosures underscore the Bush administration ’s extraordinarily sweeping conception of executive power , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU ’s National Security Project .
" The administration ’s lawyers believe the president should be permitted to violate statutory law , to violate international treaties , and even to violate the Fourth Amendment inside the U.S.
They believe that the president should be above the law . "
The AP reports that the Justice Department has refused to say if and when the legal opinion expressed in the two newly discovered memos was overturned internally , meaning that it could still be considered legally acceptable to forgo constitutional protections on the President ’s say so .
The ACLU has challenged the withholding of the October 2001 memo and the issue is pending before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
These two new memos provide more sections in the vast jigsaw of legislation that when pieced together makes up the complete overturning by the current administration of the protections provided to American citizens by the Constitution .

Creating cheap , clean energy is a huge problem .
So , how 's this for a big solution : Swiss researcher Thomas Hinderling wants to build solar islands several miles across that he claims can produce hundreds of megawatts of relatively inexpensive power .
He 's the CEO of the Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique , a privately held R&D company , and he 's already received $ 5 million from the Ras al Khaimah emirate of the United Arab Emirates to start construction on a prototype facility in that country .
While limited information is available on the solar islands website , Hinderling laid out his scheme at The Oil Drum , a well - known blog about energy .
Hinderling estimates that an island a mere mile across could generate 190 megawatts of power with a breakeven price point of $ 0.15 a kilowatt hour , or about twice current electricity prices in the United States .
The islands will consist of a plastic membrane loaded up with solar concentrating mirrors floating above the water .
The mirrors are used to heat liquid to turn it into steam , which drives a turbine that generates energy .
On land , this type of electricity generation is fairly well known .
So - called solar thermal plants are emerging as a leading alternative to fossil fuel power plants for future energy generation , with two of Google 's three alt - energy investments coming in solar thermal companies .
But why head to the ocean to create solar thermal power ?
Hinderling claims that the entire platform can be turned to align with the sun , generating maximum efficiency without a complicated tracking system .
The company 's production schedule has it splashing a 1500 - foot in diameter platform into the water at the end of 2010 .
Mark Bollinger , a renewable energy researcher at Lawrence Berkeley
National lab , thought it would be possible to create such an island , but questioned the viability of the enterprise .
" I 'm sure it 's possible , but it seems a little bit out - there , just given where the technology is and how little of it has been developed on land , " Bollinger said .
From a feasibility perspective , he questioned the necessity of pushing solar thermal out to sea , where new variables like the waves could throw off precision - tracking of the sun 's rays .
" The reason you 'd do that is if space was at a premium , but I do n't think it is , at least for solar thermal , " he said .
" Where it works best is in the desert of the Southwest , and there 's a lot of land down there . "
Another big question Hinderling does n't address is transmission , i.e. how you get the power off the island and to the people .
Luckily , offshore transmission options (.pdf ) are already being explored for wind farms located out in the ocean .
And Bollinger noted that there are ocean barges that already produce power for " load- constrained "
areas of the Northeast .
All that said , we can't help but think that this would be a great way to power The Seasteading Institute 's floating ocean colonies .

With Apple now streaming NBC shows to iPhones through its dedicated portal , and the network 's properties appearing on the iTunes UK store , are the two sides ready to settle their differences ?
Several shows are now available for download through the NBC iPhone portal , including Heroes , Eureka , The Incredible Hulk , Hercules : The Legendary Journeys , and House , shown in America on Fox .
Apparently , NBC has gotten its way with variable pricing , with older shows available for £ 1.19 per episode , and the newer shows selling for £ 1.89 .
That higher retail price is the same as other current video downloads on the store .

Making matters all the more unclear is the availability of The Office and 30 Rock to iPhone users who surf to the NBC portal .
While the quality as tested by BetaNews was less than spectacular , it still represents a softening of its previous stance against Apple .
While neither Apple nor NBC have yet to comment publicly on what these developments may mean , it may signal the Cupertino company 's eventual concession to the content creator 's demands .
Much of the disagreement surrounded pricing structures .
Since iTunes UK is offering two pricing levels for content , it appears that the company may be ready to compromise there .
It may also be that Zune is posing an increasing threat to iTunes -- Microsoft signed an agreement with NBC on Tuesday -- which could push Apple to make a move .
Rogue trader Jérôme Kerviel , accused of losing Société Générale € 4.9bn ( £ 3.8 bn ) , is to sue his former employer for unfair dismissal , the Times reports .
The 31 - year - old , who was last month released on bail from prison after 37 days incarceration on breach of trust , fabricating documents , and illegally accessing computers raps , argues that his ejection from SocGen for gross misconduct is unlawful " because the bank has failed to prove he did anything wrong " .
Kerviel 's case rests on two points : that his massive gambles on markets were " actually in the black when his bosses stepped in " , and that " French labour laws force employers to hold face - to - face meetings with employees to outline the case for terminating their work contract " .
Regarding the former , Kerviel 's lawyers stress " he was often successful when betting the bank ’s money on the stock market and was € 1.4bn up at the end of last year " .
They assert that SocGen was in fact responsible for the whopping loss after executives " took the decision to unwind Mr Kerviel ’s positions as shares were tumbling on the world ’s markets in January " .
The latter point hinges on a " legal technicality " .
Kerviel 's lawyers note that the required meeting is " impossible because Mr Kerviel ’s bail conditions forbid him from entering into contact with SocGen staff " .
Kerviel 's legal team has duly filed papers " arguing that the dismissal process should be cancelled " , but the Times understands he " does not envisage a return to his old job as a derivatives operator at SocGen " .
If he 's successful in his claim , SocGen may be forced to pay compensation . ®
Maximize Firefox Without Extensions Using about : config
If you type about : config in your address bar , Firefox opens the master directory of user - defined preferences and built - in settings .
The ultimate arena for performance tampering , the about : config settings are the foundation for programming Firefox extensions .
We ’ll show some simple about : config modifications below .
Even if the word “ Boolean ” means nothing to you , we ’ll try to make it easy to understand about : config settings .
For power users , Mozillazine.org has a comprehensive list of about : config settings , their meanings , and how to modify them .
Btw , although the screenshots below were made on a Mac , all of these hacks work for Windows users too .
To modify about : config , pull it up using your address bar .
The settings appear in a searchable list view .
Type a string into the search bar for a live sort .
To modify the setting , right click on it and choose Toggle for a boolean value or Modify for an integer or string .
Change the setting as desired , and simply restart Firefox to use the new configuration .
( There ’s no need to save . )
The first two tips below were adapted from a great tutorial by Gina Trapani at Lifehacker , and they ’ll help you dip your toe into the about : config waters .
We ’ve chosen the easiest and most useful mods from her list .
A very old guide ( 2004 ) to about : config modding at TweakFactor is still good in places ; we ’ve reviewed and modfied some tips below as well .
1 . About : config - fetch only the content you view Firefox 2.0 and later likes to prepare itself for the next link you may click ; to make clicked links load fast , it pre-loads content from pages which are linked to the page you ’re currently viewing .
Pre -fetching only occurs when the browser is idle , so it should n’t affect your bandwidth .
Bear in mind that the makers of browser extension Fasterfox seem to think pre-fetching speeds things up .
If you find this pointless and / or creepy , you can turn it off .
- In about : config , pull up network .
prefetch - next .
- The default value is true .
Right click and toggle it to false .
Restart Firefox and enjoy .
2 . About : config - limit memory usage On both Macs and PCs , our favorite browser can be quite the RAM hog .
Tame the beast with browser.cache.memory.capacity .
This preference must be added to your list ; it wo n’t appear by default .
- First , check your memory usage with about : cache ?
device=memory in the URL bar .
The window will display your current settings and the current cache contents .
In the settings below , Firefox ’s current maximum storage size is 1 percent of the RAM capacity of the computer .
- To change the amount of memory that Firefox can use , open about : config and right - click in the window New ?
Integer .
- Enter browser.cache.memory.capacity as the preference name .
- Enter a value in KB .
( There ’s a handy calculator here . )
Computerworld has a 2006 article about Firefox memory usage to guide you .
3 . About : config - Hotrodded broadband with network preferences Mozillazine.org ( which is n’t an official Mozilla publication , btw ) lists preferences that can be used to “ fine - tune performance . ”
Among these are the :
network.http.max-connections
network.http.max-connections-per-server
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server
Most of the above preferences control the number of simultaneous connections your browser can make with an HTTP server .
( HTTP protocol is the communication interface used for the vast majority of web surfing . )
Some unscrupulous or uninformed commentators will tell you to jack up the number of possible connections as high as you can .
However , this can lead to problems for both you ( the web surfer / client ) and the web pages you view ( HTTP server ) .
“ If you raise [ the number ] , do it reasonably , ” writes user lazlo in the Mozillazine forums .
“ Changes like these are at least partly responsible for the infamous /. effect [ which crashes servers during high traffic . ] ”
Some servers will even ban your IP address if you overclock your settings too severely , so be a good net citizen and do n’t hog .
network.http.max-connections
- Controls the number of simultaneous possible connections using the HTTP protocol ( used for most webpages ) .
Default setting = 24
network.http.max-connections-per-server
- Controls the number of simultaneous HTTP connections possible with one server .
Default setting = 8
If you ’re using a gateway ( a.k.a. proxy server ) , the preferences
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server
controls the same settings as network.http.max-connections and network.http.max -connections-per-server .
If you do n’t know what a proxy server is , you ’re probably not using one .
4 . About : config - pipelining for faster page loads ( maybe ) Normally , your computer issues HTTP requests one at a time , waiting for a server response before sending the next request .
Pipelining allows multiple requests from your computer to flow out without waiting for the server responses .
Your computer ( the client ) handles the responses in the same order that the original request was received .
Depending on your web usage , pipelining can mean that you perceive a faster load time .
Imagine the difference between a constant conversation in which each side pauses and waits for the other ’s response , and an exchange with one side making a long speech and then waiting for the other side ’s long speech in response .
It may seem faster to you or it may not .
Note that some pages may not be built to the HTTP 1.1 standard required for pipelining and may not be able to handle it .
They may just refuse to load .
To try your luck with pipelining , open about : config and access
network.http.pipelining
- Default = false .
Toggle it to true .
To bump up the max number of requests in a pipeline , access
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests
- Default = 4 . Enter a value from 1 to 8 . ( 1 will disable pipelining . )
( To turn on pipelining from behind a proxy server , access
network.http.proxy.pipelining
- Default = false .
Toggle to true .
Incidentally , the W3C ( the international standards organization for the World Wide Web ) has n’t updated its pipelining standards since 1997 .
For a more technical explanation of pipelining features , benefits and drawbacks , check out this FAQ by Mozilla developer Darin Fisher .
5 . About : config - reduce page rendering time Typically , as a web page loads in a browser , the downloaded elements appear one by one ( are “ rendered ” ) .
The nglayout.initialpaint.delay preference designates the number of milliseconds before Firefox begins to render or “ paint ” the page .
The default 250 ms settings compromises between dial - up users , who benefit from longer paint delays , and broadband users , who do n’t .
In a recent Mozilla developer discussion of the setting , user chob wrote :
“ Setting [ nglayout.initialpaint.delay ] to 0 can mean as soon as the server sends the first byte , Firefox tries to parse this and start layout , but of course it takes time for enough HTML to come back for Firefox to render anything worth seeing .
“ Setting a value to 0 probably just means Firefox chews a little more CPU time as it tried to render and reflow before having enough data to show anything meaningful .
Although it probably gives the impression of being slightly more responsive because the page starts to render quarter of a second earlier . ”
Create nglayout.initialpaint.delay in about : config as a new integer preference .
Default = 250 .
Broadband users can try a setting 0 – 100 , while dial - up users can try 275 or higher .
6 . About : config - mod Firefox responsiveness while rendering After nglayout.initialpaint.delay has been created and modified , Firefox may speed up rendering while annoying you with constant adjustments as you scroll through that new content .
The preference content .
switch.threshold controls Firefox ’s responsiveness to your input ( i.e. responsiveness to the UI ) at the expense of slightly slowing the page load .
Since you ’ve already minimized the page load time with tips 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , that should n’t be too much of a sacrifice .
Firefox has two modes of user interaction with web pages that are still loading : high frequency interrupt mode and low frequency interrupt mode .
The high mode better tolerates user interactions with the content .
What content.switch.threshold ontent.switch.threshold controls is the number of microseconds of inactivity that will activate low frequency interrupt mode .
In other words , it controls how long you have to do nothing before Firefox assumes you are waiting for the whole page to load .
To mod content.switch.threshold
- First , make sure that preferences content.notify .
ontimer and content.interrupt.parsing are set to true ( their default setting ) .
( You can learn about these settings at Mozillazine ’s Content.switch.threshold page . )
- Next , create content.switch.threshold as a new integer preference .
Default = 750,000 .
The range is 1 to 1,000,000 .
Just do n’t forget that as Mozillazine.org says , “ raising the value will make the application more responsive at the expense of page load time . ”
This tip is based on a tip from TheHowToGeek .
7 . Backup your preferences
Now that you ’ve tinkered to your heart ’s delight , protect the ones you love – your user preferences – by backing them up .
This info is adapted from the Mozilla guide to Firefox user profile backups .
- First , locate your Firefox user profile .
The string xxxxxxxx represents random characters assigned by the OS as the name of your profile .
Do n’t worry ; there ’s probably only one user profile in the folder anyway , so it should n’t be hard to find .
- After locating the profile file , close Firefox .
- Copy the file to the backup media .
Ta da !
Restoring from a profile backup is also easy ( usually ) .
Mozilla advises here .
8 . Modify about : config speed settings in one step - Fasterfox extension
All of that sounds like a lot of work and a lot of tinkering .
Maybe another extension would n’t be so bad after all .

Well , there are some indications that America as envisioned by the the Constitution and the Founding Fathers does n't just need our help .
Is not merely in trouble , or fragile , or under attack .
But rather , there are indications that America is already dead .
That we lost .
That its over .
Mushy - Headed America
Is it really that bleak ?
What 's the Diagnosis ?
America of the Founding Fathers and the Constitution is not yet dead . . . but it is mortally wounded .
Instead of separation of powers , we have a tyrannical executive branch .
Instead of a free market economy , we have massive subsidies , credits , manipulation of the stock market , and other games which skew the system so that there is not a level playing field .
The leaders we have now and the way things work are wholly corrupt .
The structures are rotten and moldy , and have to be ripped out and rebuilt .
The pipes are clogged , and nothing will move unless they are totally cleaned out .
The neocons and neoliberals , the imperialists and military - industrial complex , the lobbyists and dual loyalists have all cannibalized America to the point that it is hardly breathing .
The drafters of the Constitution would not recognize this place , except perhaps as a repeat of tyranny under the British crown .
America is mortally wounded .
I 'm calling a code blue .

I 'm talking to you , you self - righteous politicians and newspaper columnists , you relics who beat on computer games : you 've already lost .
Enjoy your carping while you can , because tomorrow you 're gone .
According to the UK Statistics Authority , the median age of the UK population is 39 .
Half the people who live here were born in 1969 or later .
The BBC microcomputer was released in 1981 , when those 1969ers were 12 .
It was ubiquitous in schools ; it introduced a generation to computers .
It introduced a generation to computer games .
Half the UK population has grown up playing computer games .
They are n't addicted , they are n't psychopathic killers , and they resent those boneheads – that 's you – who imply that they are addicted and are psychopathic killers .
Next year , that 1969 will be 1970 ; the year after , it 'll be 1971 .
Dwell on this , you smug , out - of - touch , proud - to - be - innumerate fossils : half the UK population thinks games are fun and cool , and you do n't .
Those born in 1990 get the vote this year .
Do your worst
Three years from now , that 1969 will be 1972 , then 1973 .
Scared yet ?
You should be : we have the numbers on our side .
Do your worst – you can't touch us .
We 've already won .
15 years from now , the prime minister of the day will have grown up playing computer games , just as 15 years ago we had the first prime minister to have grown up watching television , and 30 years ago to have grown up listening to the radio .
Times change : accept it ; embrace it .
Do n't make yourself look even more 20th Century , even more public school , than you do already .
You 've lost !
Understand ?
Your time has passed .
This anxiety you sense , this fear of what you do n't comprehend : hey , it 's OK .
Parents who did n't play computer games do feel alienated , do feel isolated from their children ; they do feel frightened , and naturally so , because they can't keep their children safe if they do n't understand what they 're keeping them safe from .
It 's transient , though .
Upcoming parents played games themselves , or if they did n't , their siblings did , or their friends did .
They 're no more concerned about " moral decay " or " aggressive tendencies " or any of the other euphemisms for " ohmygod I do n't understand this " than you are about soap operas .
They 're the present , not you : you 're the ever - more - distant past .
Ignorant ravings
Gamers vote .
Gamers buy newspapers .
They wo n't vote for you , or buy your newspapers , if you trash their entertainment with your ignorant ravings .
Call them social inadequates if you like , but when they have more friends in World of Warcraft than you have in your entire sad little booze - oriented culture of a real life , the most you 'll get from them is pity .
In March , the Byron Report came out .
How pleased the government must have been with itself !
By appointing a parenting expert to lead it , they were practically guaranteeing they 'd get 266 pages of ammunition to use against computer games .
Just thinking about the popularity boost from cracking down on this evil would have had them salivating with glee !
Except Dr Tanya Byron was born in 1967 .
When the Sinclair ZX Spectrum came out in 1982 , she was only 15 .
She knew what the government did n't : computer games are here to stay .
So long as parents understand the dangers , they can make informed decisions .
She did n't recommend lining computer game designers up against the wall and shooting dead every last one of them .
Her report was balanced and fair .
She suggested education as a solution .
That 's a level of reason rarely seen in the context of UK government .
So we 've won : accept it .
Huff and puff if you must , but your audience grows smaller by the day .
Your views are mortally wounded , and soon they will be dead .
Games are mainstream .
Drown , or learn to swim .

Further to my recent posts on Xinjiang , here 's Charles Cumming at CiF :
Uighurs have been jailed for reading newspapers sympathetic to the cause of independence .
Others have been detained merely for listening to Radio Free Asia , an English - language station funded by the US Congress .
Even to discuss separatism in public is to risk a lengthy jail sentence , with no prospect of habeas corpus , effective legal representation or a fair trial .
About 100 Uighurs were arrested in Khotan recently after several hundred demonstrated in the marketplace of the town , which lies on the Silk Road .
And what happens to these innocent Uighur men and women once they land up in one of Xinjiang 's notorious " black prisons " ?
Amnesty International has reported numerous incidents of torture , from cigarette burns on the skin to submersion in water or raw sewage .
Prisoners have had toenails extracted by pliers , been attacked by dogs and burned with electric batons , even cattle prods ....
This is the reality of life in modern Xinjiang .
Quite what the Chinese hope to gain from their inhumane behaviour remains unclear .
According to Corinna - Barbara Francis , a researcher with Amnesty 's East Asia team , " the intensified repression of Uighurs by the Chinese authorities is in danger of contributing to the very outcome that China claims it is warding against - the radicalisation of the population and the adoption of violent responses to the repression . "
Uighurs have motive , at the very least , for fighting back .
On January 5 this year , 18 Uighurs were killed and a further 17 arrested during a raid on what the Chinese described as a " terrorist training camp " in the Pamir mountains .
However , many western observers have cast doubt on the veracity of this claim .
Just as there has been no proof of the planned attacks on the Olympic Games , the Chinese authorities have yet to produce any evidence which would suggest that the men and women killed in January were terrorists linked to al - Qaida .
Rebiya Kadeer , president of the World Uighur Congress , who lives in exile in the United States , believes that the threat of " terrorism " in Xinjiang has been grossly exaggerated and is being used by Beijing " both as a justification for the continued repression and cultural assimilation of the Uighur people " and as a diversionary tactic designed to disguise China 's appalling human rights record in the region .
But who will hear her ?
Choosing a good wine you enjoy can be complicated enough , but finding wine you enjoy that ’s under ten dollars can be frustrating .
TopTenz is here to help .
The next time you feel like having a nice bottle of wine but you only have $ 10 to spend here is a list you can trust to find the best wine for UNDER $ 10 .
In other words what are the best cheap wines ?
Every wine on the list was found , at least in one place , to have a purchase cost under ten bucks .
Links were provided under the title of each wine to a site selling each wine under $ 10.00 .
This does not included shipping and tax , of course .
10 . Voga Quattro
A blend of merlot , shiraz , cabernet sauvignon , and pinot noir ( hence the name ) from Italy , the unique bottle and price ( ranging from 4 dollars to 9 ) will hook many buyers looking for an interesting bottle of wine that wo n’t break the bank , but the pleasant way the different varietals blend will certainly have you coming back for more .
9. Little Black Dress Pinot Grigio
Great with seafood ( especially sushi ) , this pinot grigio from California works best when allowed to sit briefly after uncorking to really allow the flavors to open up .
The apple and grapefruit flavors are quite refreshing and will be great on a warm day .
A great compliment to appetizers , this Riesling is sweet without being syrupy .
The right hints of citrus make it refreshing and a great way to clean the palate before moving on to more complex food and wines during a party .
7. Bell ’agio Chianti
The whicker wrapped bottle will catch many looking for a way to add ambiance to a nice Italian dinner , but this nice dry chianti will compliment most red sauces very well , and add a nice bite to a juicy steak .
6. Yellow Tail Cabernet Sauvignon / Shiraz
Great for the shiraz lover looking to branch out into cabernets with a blend .
Nice tannins , but a nice smooth finish .
A great “ gateway ” wine into some of the dryer varietals for those looking to experiment outside of their comfort zones .
5. Clos du Bois Chardonnay
A Californian wine with a French name ( the name means “ enclosure in the woods ” – the maker of the wine is named Woods ) , this buttery and well balanced chardonnay is medium bodied with pear , citrus , and vanilla flavors .
Very refreshing and a great compliment to pork and chicken .
4. Yellow Tail Chardonnay
Very approachable for those looking to move to the dryer white wines .
Crisp and clean from being aged in steel barrels as opposed to oak , there is still a lingering nuance of oak in the wine that is welcome to those that are familiar with Chardonnays aged in oak .
3. Twin Fin Pinot Noir
A dark oak and cherry nose are a quick lead into a wine that some say has a bit of an “ alcoholy ” taste , but is nice and rich the whole way through , making it a great compliment to pizza , steak , or pasta with red sauce .
A great way to be introduced to pinot noir ( unless you ’ve taken to watching the movie “ Sideways ” ) .
2. Robert Mondavi Private Selection Sauvignon Blanc
Nice citrus flavors from the west coast , with hints of grapefruit that are the staple of the sauvignon blanc .
Great on a hot day , with spicy fish ( Thai style tilapia is a great compliment ) , and a wonderful alternative to the more expensive sauvignon blancs made in South America .
1. Ravenswood Zinfandel
An excellent wine at a great price .
Smooth with lots of flavor and a hint of pepperyness at the end that is quite enjoyable .
Fairly dry , but a great find for the red wine lover on a budget that wants something they can really sink their palate into .
Honorable Mention
Evil Cabernet Sauvignon – a great cabernet sauvignon from Southern Australia .
Rosemount Diamond Label Shiraz – found at most restaurants , this Shiraz is a testament to the Australian style of making quality shiraz .
Oak Leaf ( multiple varietals ) –
The house wine for Wal - Mart , this label offers cabernet sauvignon , merlot , chardonnay , and a chardonnay / pinot grigio blend .
While none will change your view of that varietal , none are bad for their $ 3 price tag .

The armed forces face a challenge in meeting recruitment targets
The US Army and Marine Corps recruited significantly more people with criminal records last year than in 2006 , amid pressure to meet combat needs .
Statistics released by a congressional committee show 861 people were granted waivers to enlist , up from 457 in 2007 .
The crimes included assault , sex crimes , manslaughter and burglary .
The Army says waivers are only granted after careful review and are in response to the challenges of recruiting in a changing society .
The number of people granted waivers are just a small fraction of the more than 180,000 people who entered active duty in the armed forces during the fiscal year that ended in September 2007 .
But the perceived lowering of standards is causing concern in some quarters .
We 're growing the army fast , and there are some waivers ...
It has n't alarmed us yet
Lt Gen James Thurman
Deputy chief of staff for operations
" The significant increase in the recruitment of persons with criminal records is a result of the strain put on the military by the Iraq war , " said Democratic Representative Henry Waxman .
Mr Waxman chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that released the figures drawn up by the US Department of Defense .
These show that :
The Army granted 511 felony waivers in 2007 , up from 249 the year before
Some 350 people with convictions joined the Marine Corps , up from 208 in 2006
The Navy actually recruited fewer people with convictions , down from 48 to 42
The Air Force did not recruit anyone with a felony conviction Among the convictions , many were for stealing , including burglary and car thefts , and drug offences .
Waivers were also granted to three people convicted of manslaughter , nine guilty of sex crimes , and nine convicted of making terror threats , including bomb threats .
In addition , the Army and Marine Corps granted 27,671 " conduct waivers " covering what are regarded as serious misdemeanours , up from 25,098 in 2006 .
Pentagon officials say that the need to recruit troops for continuing operations abroad , low unemployment at home , and declining interest in serving pose a challenge .
" We 're digging deeper into the barrel than we were before , " an official told the Washington Post .
The Army also argues that its ranks reflect the society they are drawn from .
Only three in 10 Americans of military age meet the army 's medical , moral , aptitude , or administrative requirements , army officials point out .
" We 're growing the army fast , and there are some waivers - we know that , " said Army Lt Gen James Thurman , deputy chief of staff for operations .
" It has n't alarmed us yet . "

Star Trek Actor George Takei to Wed Partner Brad Altman
Our California dream is reality .
Brad Altman and I can now marry .
We are overjoyed !
At long last , the barrier to full marriage rights for same - sex couples has been torn down .

Clinton and Mugabe Mary L. Dudziak Hilary Clinton has compared the Democratic Party ’s failure to count the Florida and Michigan Democratic primary votes to the election crisis in Zimbabwe .
There may be one similarity , but it is not the one Clinton claims .
CBS News reports that the candidate complained that in Michigan and Florida ,
" people go through the motions of an election only to have them discarded and disregarded . "
" We ’re seeing that right now in Zimbabwe , " Clinton explained .
" Tragically , an election was held , the president lost , they refused to abide by the will of the people , " Clinton told the crowd of senior citizens at a retirement community in south Florida .
" So we can never take for granted our precious right to vote . "
There are so many obvious differences between the Florida and Michigan Democratic primaries and the Zimbabwe election crisis that it is difficult to know where to begin .
But perhaps there is one similarity : in Zimbabwe , a losing candidate , incumbent Robert Mugabe , seeing his impending defeat , has worked to change an outcome produced under pre-existing rules .
In arguing that the Democratic party should abandon its rules post - hoc – rules Clinton herself agreed to before the voting – she makes a parallel move .

Democrats heard something familiar today in that new theme emerging from House Republicans : “ The Change You Deserve . ”
Turns out that slogan is also used to market an antidepressant , which Democrats quickly lampooned as reflecting the Republican mood at the moment .
“ We were alarmed by the slogan for the minority caucus ’s re-branding campaign , for it directly _ though probably inadvertently _ addresses the depressed opportunities House Republicans might be feeling of late , ” said a post at Bluestemprairie.com .
Republicans said they had no hesitation about sticking with the slogan as they prepared to roll out their new policy agenda .
And The “ Change You Deserve ” is just one variation on the theme .
“ Republicans are committed to delivering the change American families really deserve , ” said a House Republican spokesman , saying the cross- marketing was not a problem .
And really , given the problems besetting House Republicans recently , do n’t they deserve a break today ?
LAST week , EDF , one of the world 's biggest energy firms , announced it would invest $ 50 m in a firm called Nanosolar , which aims to produce cheap solar panels .
Nanosolar believes it can sell panels for a little as $ 1 for each watt of capacity — less than one - third of the best deals currently on offer .
If true , that 's great news , especially since it would reverse a worrying trend .
It used to be an axiom that solar power grew steadily cheaper as time passed .
Solar panels were once too expensive to install on anything but satellites .
But as the technology improved , they became cost - effective , first in isolated spots such as weather stations and oilrigs , and later on lonely farms and houses far from the grid .
By 2004 , solar panels were coming very close to generating power at the sorts of prices regular grid - connected customers pay in places where electricity is expensive , such as Japan .
Enthusiasts confidently predicted that solar cells would soon supplant grimy old power plants , and spare the world the tiresome chore of digging for coal , uranium and natural gas .
AP
Keep the government away from these
Fans of solar power were so sure of themselves they came up with their own version of Moore 's law for the sun 's power , rather than that of computer chips .
Every time the volume of solar cells produced around the world doubled , they predicted , the price per watt would fall by 20 % .
After all , it had done so reliably for the previous 40 years .
But in 2004 , everything changed .
Prices of fossil fuels began to climb , and worries over global warming and security of supply intensified .
Those factors might have been enough to boost investment in solar by themselves .
At any rate , the riches that undoubtedly await the first firm to create cheap solar power were already luring venture capital .
But governments such as Germany's , who wanted to give solar and other forms of renewable power an extra boost , began subsidising wind turbines and solar panels in order to speed their adoption .
This was supposed to have three benefits : it would reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , spawn a fast - growing and lucrative domestic industry , and help to lower the unit costs of solar panels , thanks to the bigger volumes .
Indeed , the three goals are interdependent : solar power will have to be deployed on a massive scale if it is to make much of a dent in emissions , which will only be affordable if it becomes much cheaper .
But Germany 's subsidy , which takes the form of a generous tariff for solar power , has had the opposite effect .
So many firms rushed to install solar panels in such profusion that the world ran short of the type of silicon used to make them .
The price of silicon — and thus of solar panels — rose .
Many firms began to pursue radical new panel designs , simply to reduce their silicon consumption .
Meanwhile , Germany has wound up with more solar panels than any other country in the world — a perverse result for such a cloudy place .
It also has fewer wind turbines than it might otherwise — again , an odd outcome for a blustery country .
The German government has decided that the subsidy is too expensive , and wants to revise it — just the sort of unpredictable behaviour that tends to alarm rather than entice investors .
Of course , Germany is not the only country that subsidises solar power , and such subsidies are not the only cause of inflation in the solar industry .
Lots of silicon factories are under construction , so an end to the present bottleneck is in sight .
Several firms like Nanosolar insist that their wares will soon be competitively priced without subsidies .
And fossil fuels are also subsidised , insofar as their prices do not include the cost of the pollution they generate .
Moreover , tackling global warming is not necessarily an unreasonable use of taxpayers ' money .
But that does not relieve governments of the obligation to get good value for money .
Fans of California 's solar subsidy claim it will achieve similar results at a tenth of the price .
Better still would be a hefty carbon tax , or a strict cap - and - trade regime , which would provide a boost to all low - carbon power sources , not just those that find favour with prodigal bureaucrats .

で、立て続けのプレスリリース第2弾が、「パスワード相互認証プロトコルの技術評価用ソフトウェアを公開」です。
こちらは 、RCIS に入ってから始まった共同研究の成果ソフトウェアの第1弾で、
フィッシングを認証プロトコルを使って何とか防げないか、という着眼点からの研究です。
技術的な肝の部分は、暗号プロトコルをうまく使うことで、ユーザが間違ってフィッシングサイトを
踏んでしまってそこで認証を行おうとしても、( 1 ) パスワードの情報が相手に伝わらず、かつ ( 2 ) サーバ側に パスワー ドDBがない限り必ず認証が失敗する（フィッシングサイトが騙そうと思っても「
認証成功」と嘘をつけない）
という性質を実現していることです。
(1) に関しては、たとえ8文字程度の辞書探索可能なパスワードを使っていても、
通信されたデータからは正規のパスワードを復元できないように加工されているのがミソです。 普通に APOP ( 例の脆弱性は除外しても ) や CRAM -MD5 などのハッシュを使ったアルゴリズムでは、
1回通信した情報を記録しておいて後から辞書攻撃を行えばパスワードがバレますが、
今回のプロトコルでは予めパスワードDBを事前に持っていないと認証が成功せず、
後から辞書攻撃ができないようになっているのです。
(2) に関しては、相互認証の結果を表示するUIまで含めて偽装を防ぐために、
UI設計から変更しています。また、HTTP
認証プロトコルの拡張として実装することにしたので、
その前提で本物サイトへの中継攻撃をうまく防ぐように設計したのがポイントです。 実際に最近のフィッシングサイトは本物サイトを使ってパスワードの正誤を調べている ことがありますが、そのような攻撃ができないようになっています。 通常 PAKE は鍵交換と暗号化を組合わせることが前提になっていて、 そちらで中間者攻撃を防ぐのですが、今回は HTTP レイヤで認証を行い、 暗号化は別途 TLS ( HTTPS ) を使うように設計しているので、 PAKE で交換した鍵に基づく暗号化を行わずに攻撃に対応できるようにしたのがミソです。
ちなみに、別に証明書をどこかから買ったりしなくても導入できるんで、
商業サイトから個人サイトまで自由に使えるプロトコル、というのも売りの一つです。
こちらは昨年度に Internet Draft を出したところで、 本当にまだまだスタートラインか

The crew of the US vessel fired flares , 50 - caliber machine guns and M - 16s
A ship contracted by the US Navy has fired warning shots in the direction of two unidentified speedboats in the Gulf , US military officials say .
The incident took place in international waters dozens of miles from the Iranian coast , the US said .
In January , the US said speedboats from Iran had harassed US Navy ships in the Gulf - Iran denied issuing threats .
In the latest incident , Tehran said its vessels had had no confrontations with US ships .
The US vessel - the Westward Venture - was working for the US Military Sealift Command under a 65 - day charter , an official told the BBC .
US officials say the Westward Venture used the correct measures prior to firing the shots - it sounded its horn , and gave the boats a verbal warning , before firing flares , 50 - caliber machine guns and M - 16s .
The speedboats withdrew soon after the warning shots were fired .
Shortly after the incident , a routine inquiry was made of the Westward Venture by Iranian authorities , according to US officials .

Update :
The signs have been taken down in the visitors ' clubhouse .
I just received a call from MLB VP of Public Relations Pat Courtney , assuring me that players are allowed to drink whatever they want in the dugout .
This was in response to an earlier blog entery about signs in the U.S. Cellular Field visitors ' clubhouse that read , " NO BOTTLED WATER ON THE BENCH . "
Said Courtney , " Players are allowed to have water .
We have no jurisdiction over the regular season . "
Perhaps it was the White Sox that ordered the signs -- not surprising , given the organization 's controlling , overbearing attitude in general .
Apparently , what the White Sox hope is that the players pour their water into empty Gatorade bottles .
Courtney did say that in the postseason , when there is a conflict between a team 's sponsor and an MLB sponsor , players may be asked to remove labels from bottled drinks .

With the second billion of the planet 's citizens due to go online in the next 10 years and an avalanche of online - enabled devices hitting the market with each passing year it would be understandable to assume that the internet is in a healthy position .
The 1960s vision of a network of networks has grown into a tool that encircles the globe , drives economies and connects citizens .
But Professor Jonathan Zittrain , one of the world 's leading academics on the impact of the net , is warning that the future is potentially bleak .
His book , The Future of the Internet : And How To Stop
It , highlights key concerns about the direction online society is heading in .
" I want a recognition from people that the network they enjoy now is in many important respects a collective hallucination , " he said .
" If too many of them start treating it as a cash and carry service they are going get the network they deserve . "
Zittrain is the professor of internet governance and regulation at Oxford University and co-founder of Harvard Law School 's Berman Center for Internet and Society .
He said the " happy accident " of the net , which was designed by researchers for researchers , resulted in an open platform which facilitated innovation because it enabled anyone online to implement ideas at the edge of the network .
He calls these technologies " generative " , meaning open tools that can be put to a multiplicity of purposes .
Fundamental backbone A PC is a good example of a generative device because it can be reprogrammed for many uses , and one machine on the net can impact every other without compromising the fundamental backbone of the network .
He contrasts generative devices with " sterile appliances " , closed systems which appear to give consumers access to the net .
He argued such devices were damaging innovation and potentially putting easilly - abused powers into the hands of a few companies and governments .
Do locked down games consoles stifle innovation ?
" Consumers are eagerly asking for technologies , which can be used to surveil or control them , " said professor Zittrain .
He said he was concerned that users who wanted basic access to the web were driving the adoption of closed systems .
" My concern is that those are the sorts of people who may well find themselves perfectly willing to live with a browser - and as long as they or their device gives them a browser , as far as they are concerned they are successfully on the internet .
" That move to do everything online accelerates the move to have appliances because there 's no need to have a general purpose reprogrammable machine in your house . "
Games consoles , web - enabled kiosks , set - top boxes , and mobile phones were all offering access to the net , but the terms for such access were being dictated by manufacturers and content providers , argued the academic .
The closed nature of these devices gave them a stability and consistancy that the open net often failed to deliver , he argued .
But there was a price to be for using these " very useful , wonderful things " , he said .
' Roving bug '
He cited the example of the OnStar car tracking system , designed to help US motorists navigate and get automatic help if needed .
" In the US the FBI required that one of the companies that offered this system reprogram it so they could monitor people they were interested in .
" From the FBI 's point of view it 's just a roving bug .
But you start to realise the change in the ability of somebody to monitor you . "
On the open net , using a generative machine like a PC , consumers were better protected from such abuses , he said .
" A generative machine on the neutral net is a participant in a cat and mouse game .
The way the internet was designed was not to care about identity . "
The way the internet was designed was not to care about identity
Jonathan Zittrain Professor Zittrain said he was concerned about web application development .
" As we move to the cloud computing model and as software programmers move from programming for Windows or Mac to Facebook apps or the Google apps platform , all of the qualities of the [ sterile ] appliance start to manifest again and that becomes a concern . "
Professor Zittrain said developers were writing applications to run on proprietorial networks like Facebook and Google without checking the fine print .
" I would like to see software developers , the ones who are whimsical and nerdy and code because it 's fun , read the fine print .
" They need to be more demanding with the platform developer to say , ' We 're not going to code for any platform that could kill our app at any time ' .
Fundamental weakness " Frankly , I think platform makers would love to be thrown into that bush and love to be pressured to change their platform .
" So when government comes along and says ' We think this application infringes copyright ; please kill it ' , they then will be able to say ' Gee , we wish we could but we can't because it's on the open net ' . "
In the book professor Zittrain makes clear that the open generative net is not all positive and has a fundamental weakness : it is open to malign exploitation .
I am not convinced there will be some watershed moment that will read like the script to an action movie where net is broken one morning
Jonathan Zittrain " I would n't say I am very concerned or confident that there will be a major disaster event on the internet as we know it , " he said .
But he said viruses , malware and spyware were threatening to overwhelm the online experience for ordinary users .
And he warned that the innovation and genius needed to battle such threats were being eroded by the rise of closed systems .
" The point of the book is that there ought not to be a dichotomy between either generative or sterile systems .
" The blend will never be 100 % and 0 % , nor should it be , but to me such a wonderful historical accident should be maintained by a critical mass of generative machines . "
He argued that ordinary users and expert technologists could work together , using the power of the open net , to solve these problems .
" Having people devote just a little bit of bandwidth and processing cycles , even if they are not experts , then their computer becomes part of a global vital signs chart of the internet .
" It allows us to use the generative net to give diagnostics of itself and ultimately fix itself when it goes awry . "
And that was the ultimate use of a generative net , he said .

What are these ?
The Dept. of Labor has proposed a new rule that tries to clear up any confusion on who is an independent contractor and who is an employee .
A legend about the “ unsolvable math problem ” combines one of the ultimate academic wish - fulfillment fantasies — a student not only proves himself the smartest one in his class , but also bests his professor and every other scholar in his field of study — with a “ positive thinking ” motif which turns up in other urban legends : when people are free to pursue goals unfettered by presumed limitations on what they can accomplish , they just may manage some extraordinary feats through the combined application of native talent and hard work :
A young college student was working hard in an upper - level math course , for fear that he would be unable to pass .
On the night before the final , he studied so long that he overslept the morning of the test .
When he ran into the classroom several minutes late , he found three equations written on the blackboard .
The first two went rather easily , but the third one seemed impossible .
He worked frantically on it until — just ten minutes short of the deadline — he found a method that worked , and he finished the problems just as time was called .
The student turned in his test paper and left .
That evening he received a phone call from his professor .
“ Do you realize what you did on the test today ? ” he shouted at the student .
“ Oh , no , ” thought the student .
I must not have gotten the problems right after all .
“ You were only supposed to do the first two problems , ” the professor explained .
“ That last one was an example of an equation that mathematicians since Einstein have been trying to solve without success .
I discussed it with the class before starting the test .
And you just solved it ! ”
And this particular version is all the more interesting for being based on a real - life incident !
One day In 1939 , George Bernard Dantzig , a doctoral candidate at the University of California , Berkeley , arrived late for a graduate - level statistics class and found two problems written on the board .
Not knowing they were examples of “ unsolved ” statistics problems , he mistook them for part of a homework assignment , jotted them down , and solved them .
( The equations Dantzig tackled are more accurately described not as unsolvable problems , but rather as unproven statistical theorems for which he worked out proofs . )
Six weeks later , Dantzig ’s statistic professor notified him that he had prepared one of his two “ homework ” proofs for publication , and Dantzig was given co-author credit on another paper several years later when another mathematician independently worked out the same solution to the second problem .
George Dantzig recounted his feat in a 1986 interview for the College Mathematics Journal :
It happened because during my first year at Berkeley I arrived late one day at one of [ Jerzy ] Neyman ’s classes .
On the blackboard there were two problems that I assumed had been assigned for homework .
I copied them down .
A few days later I apologized to Neyman for taking so long to do the homework — the problems seemed to be a little harder than usual .
I asked him if he still wanted it .
He told me to throw it on his desk .
I did so reluctantly because his desk was covered with such a heap of papers that I feared my homework would be lost there forever .
About six weeks later , one Sunday morning about eight o’clock , [ my wife ]
Anne and I were awakened by someone banging on our front door .
It was Neyman .
He rushed in with papers in hand , all excited : “ I ’ve just written an introduction to one of your papers .
Read it so I can send it out right away for publication . ”
For a minute I had no idea what he was talking about .
To make a long story short , the problems on the blackboard that I had solved thinking they were homework were in fact two famous unsolved problems in statistics .
That was the first inkling I had that there was anything special about them .
A year later , when I began to worry about a thesis topic , Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis .
The second of the two problems , however , was not published until after World War II .
It happened this way .
Around 1950 I received a letter from Abraham Wald enclosing the final galley proofs of a paper of his about to go to press in the Annals of Mathematical Statistics .
Someone had just pointed out to him that the main result in his paper was the same as the second “ homework ” problem solved in my thesis .
I wrote back suggesting we publish jointly .
He simply inserted my name as coauthor into the galley proof .
Dr. Dantzig also explained how his story passed into the realm of urban legendry :
The other day , as I was taking an early morning walk , I was hailed by Don Knuth as he rode by on his bicycle .
He is a colleague at Stanford .
He stopped and said , “ Hey , George — I was visiting in Indiana recently and heard a sermon about you in church .
Do you know that you are an influence on Christians of middle America ? ” I looked at him , amazed .
“ After the sermon , ” he went on , “ the minister came over and asked me if I knew a George Dantzig at Stanford , because that was the name of the person his sermon was about . ”
The origin of that minister ’s sermon can be traced to another Lutheran minister , the Reverend Schuler [ sic ] of the Crystal Cathedral in Los Angeles .
He told me his ideas about thinking positively , and I told him my story about the homework problems and my thesis .
A few months later I received a letter from him asking permission to include my story in a book he was writing on the power of positive thinking .
Schuler ’s published version was a bit garbled and exaggerated but essentially correct .
The moral of his sermon was this :
If I had known that the problem were not homework but were in fact two famous unsolved problems in statistics , I probably would not have thought positively , would have become discouraged , and would never have solved them .
The version of Dantzig ’s story published by Christian televangelist Robert Schuller contained a good deal of embellishment and misinformation which has since been propagated in urban legend - like forms of the tale such as the one quoted at the head of this page : Schuller converted the mistaken homework assignment into a “ final exam ” with ten problems ( eight of which were real and two of which were “ unsolvable ” ) , claimed that “ even Einstein was unable to unlock the secrets ” of the two extra problems , and erroneously stated that Dantzig ’s professor was so impressed that he “ gave Dantzig a job as his assistant , and Dantzig has been at Stanford ever since . ”
George Dantzig ( himself the son of a mathematician ) received a Bachelor ’s degree from University of Maryland in 1936 and a Master ’s from the University of Michigan in 1937 before completing his Doctorate ( interrupted by World War II ) at UC Berkeley in 1946 .
He later worked for the Air Force , took a position with the RAND Corporation as a research mathematician in 1952 , became professor of operations research at Berkeley in 1960 , and joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1966 , where he taught and published as a professor of operations research until the 1990s .
In 1975 , Dr. Dantzig was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Gerald Ford .
George Dantzig passed away at his Stanford home at age 90 on 13 May 2005 .
Some products containing nano - sized particles are already on the market .
In America and Europe , nano - sized ingredients have been added to some fruit juices , processed meats , diet milkshakes and baby food .
But consumers would not know , as there are no requirements to label the presence of nanoparticles in food .
Concerns are also growing about the possible harmful effects of nano - sized materials on human health and the environment .
In a comprehensive review of the issue , a British researcher , Dr Qasim Chaudhry , and his team conclude there are major gaps in knowledge about the safety of nanoparticles .
" The toxicological nature of hazard , likelihood of exposure and risk to consumers from nanotechnology - derived food and food packaging are largely unknown , " says Chaudhry , of Britain 's Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ' Central Science Laboratory .
Their study is published in this month 's Food Additives and Contaminants journal .
Evidence that nanoparticles are more chemically reactive than larger particles , and that some are toxic to cells has prompted the environmental group Friends of the Earth , as well as the NSW Greens , to call for a moratorium on the use of nano - sized ingredients in food , food packaging or surfaces that can come into contact with food .
Friends of the Earth spokeswoman , Georgia Miller , says it is possible nano - sized ingredients are already present in Australian food , but without labelling or regulations it is impossible to know .
" There is no way for anyone to choose to eat nano - free , " says Miller , co-author of a report called Out Of The Laboratory And Onto Our Plate , Nanotechnology In Food And Agriculture .
Food Standards Australia New Zealand says it is not aware of any commercially sold foods in Australia that have been developed using nanotechnology , and says " robust regulatory arrangements to ensure the safety of food " are in place .
As part of its national nanotechnology strategy , the Federal Government has also commissioned a review of regulations covering nanotechnology .
Professor Graeme Hodge , of Monash University , who helped carry out the review , says Australia is one of the few countries to have done this .
People should not overreact to concerns about nanofoods because a host of standards guarding food safety are already in place : " We 're not coming at the question of nanotechnology from a blank slate . "
He says a sophisticated middle road needs to be trodden between premature bans and a laissez - faire attitude , starting with an international agreement on a definition for nanomaterials .
It is also vital the public is involved in debates about the safety and regulation of nanomaterials in consumer products such as cosmetics , foods and medicines , Hodge says .
Chaudhry points out that the public knows very little about nanofoods , and there could be a backlash , as with genetically modified foods .
" The food industry could consider voluntarily declaring the use of nano - additives , especially where free engineered nanoparticles have been introduced into food and drinks , and where such products are likely to be consumed in large quantities and or by a large proportion of the population , " he says .
One of its first uses in food has been the addition of nutritional supplements .
The German company Aquanova produces ball - like structures about 30 nanometres across , called micelles , inside which additives - such as vitamins or antioxidants - can be placed for better absorption .
Another German company , BASF , produces a nano - sized synthetic tomato colouring for soft drinks and baking mixtures .
Nanostructures made from soya bean extract , that protect nutrients during manufacture and storage , are under development , as are nanotubes made from milk protein , says Chaudhry .
These methods could be used to develop colourless and tasteless drinks that the consumer controls with a particular microwave frequency .
" This would lead to the activation of selected nanocapsules , while the others remain latent , releasing only the preferred flavour , colour or nutrients . "
By making ingredients tiny , products such as low fat mayonnaise or ice - cream could be produced that are as smooth in texture as high - fat ones , he says .
The nanofood sector is led by the US , followed by Japan and China .
Asian countries , particularly China , are expected to be the biggest market for nanofood by 2010 .
Food packaging using nanotechnology is more advanced than nanofoods , with products on the market that incorporate nanomaterials that scavenge oxygen , fight bacteria , keep in moisture or sense the state of the food .
Plastic incorporating nanoparticles of clay or oxides of metals such as zinc and titanium have already been used to package meats , cheese , confectionery , beer , fruit juice and soft drink overseas .
Nanoparticles of silver are being used to coat the inner surfaces of fridges as well as cutlery and chopping boards , with the promise of keeping the environment clean and hygienic .
The Friends of the Earth report has identified more than 100 nanoproducts used in food , packaging and agriculture .
" We believe this to be just a small fraction of the total number of products now available worldwide , " says Miller .
The main concern to consumers from nanoparticles in food packaging is through their migration into food and drinks , says Chaudhry .
" However , such migration data are not currently available . "
Few studies have been carried out on the toxic effects of nanoparticles , and most deal with the risks of breathing them in , rather than consuming them , he says .
Yet evidence is growing that they can cross into cells and increase the risk of oxidative damage .
It has also been shown that particles smaller than 70 nanometres can reach the nucleus of the cell and possibly disrupt the DNA .
Although one of the benefits of nanotechnology may be to increase absorption of nutrients from food , there are unknown consequences , such as a possible change in the balance of nutrients in the body .
" It is also of concern that the introduction into foods of nanoparticles designed to carry dietary supplements could lead to the introduction of foreign substances into the blood , " says Chaudhry .
Nanosilver , for example , is good at killing bacteria .
But no research has been published about the possible effects of consuming it on the beneficial bacteria in our guts .
The question of whether nanoparticles can cause an inflammatory response from the body is also poorly understood , he says .
" There is an urgent need for research into the behaviour of foodstuffs , both manipulated and processed at the nanoscale and the properties of manufactured nanoparticles introduced into foods whether deliberately or as the result of contamination . "
In Europe the Institute of Food Science and Technology , as well as the British Royal Society have recommended nanoparticles be treated by regulators as new , potentially harmful materials until they are proven safe .
Miller adds that apart from the safety issues , nanofood will make it even more unlikely that people will eat fresh , sustainably produced food .
A free public forum on nanotechnology will be held at the State Library of NSW on Thursday April 3 at 6 pm .
Another family destroyed by knives : Grief - stricken parents ' tribute to murdered Harry Potter actor , 18
It was a message from the depths of grief .
The shattered father of stabbed Harry Potter actor Robert Knox warned : ' With knives there are no winners , only losers .
' If you are a person who carries a knife , think about the consequences and , for my son's sake , do n't do it . '
Colin Knox and Rob 's mother Sally bravely went on TV to speak of their popular , talented son who died as he defended his brother from a knifeman .
Mr Knox told of the explosion of emotion when he heard of the 18 - year - old 's death in the early hours of Saturday .
Now , he said , Sally had ' run out of tears ' .
Colin Knox , father of stabbed Robert Knox , is comforted at the scene of his son's death
Sports - mad Rob , who lived in Sidcup , Kent , had just finished work on the new Harry Potter film Harry Potter And The Half - Blood Prince , which is due to be released in November .
He had a minor role as student wizard Marcus Belby and relatives say he had already agreed to appear in the next Potter blockbuster .
His parents said they hoped his screen fame would help sharpen the focus on knife crime .
Mr Knox , 55 , who works in media production , said : ' If it serves that purpose , then Robert will have done something else exceptional in his short life . '
Rob 's brother Jamie pays tribute Robert Knox , shown here aged 15
Mrs Knox , 50 , a Marks & Spencer buyer , added : ' It 's impossible to convey the sadness and loss that we all feel , but we now realise Rob touched many people 's lives .
He was happy , outgoing and a fun person to be with , he was the social hub of his large circle of friends .
' Rob always put everyone before himself , he was always the first person to stand up against wrong .
He achieved so much .'
Their younger son Jamie , 17 , said by witnesses to have been the initial target of the attack , said : ' My relationship with Rob was a very strong one .
We 'd do almost everything together and he just took me everywhere he went .
He was just my best friend . '
Both parents spoke of their last meetings with their son .
In a tragic irony , Mr Knox 's last words were to warn him about the dangers of being caught up in the culture of carrying a weapon ,
Fighting back tears , he recalled : ' We had a chat about the problems of people carrying knives and steering clear of problematical little areas that you could put yourself into . '
Describing his son as ' an angel on earth without wings ' , he added : ' Rob was a very positive guy , nothing was ever a problem and he would turn his hand to anything .
Father Jamie and mother Sally pay an emotional tribute to Rob today
' There was no such thing to Robert as a wall or a fence because they would be climbed or scaled . '
Mrs Knox said she remembered Rob asking her how his hair looked and whether he looked fat in his T - shirt before he went out on Friday night .
She said : ' There 's so many good memories you can't pick just one .
He was just such a happy person . '
Rob was killed , and three other people injured , in a fight outside the Metro Bar in Sidcup .
His friend Lee Howard , 19 , who was with him , said : ' A group of friends were in the bar , just having a drink on a Friday night as normal , when word went round that someone was coming down , tooled up with knives .
' Then two men turned up outside .
The bouncers did n't seem to search them and then let them into the bar .
It kicked off straight away . '
Colin Knox 's tribute to his son
Jamie 's tribute to his brother
Another friend told how he cradled Rob as he lay dying .
Callum Turner , 18 , said : ' He looked into my eyes and said " Callum , I need help , I need you to help me " .
I knew he was in trouble .
' I laid him down , held his hand and just kept talking to him and trying to keep him calm .
' I knew he was slipping away , it was just so sad .
There was nothing I could do to save him .'
In a bleak coincidence , Rob was a member of the same Sidcup rugby club as 16 - year - old altar boy Jimmy Mizen , who was murdered two weeks ago in nearby Lee , South East London .
The two families liveless than six miles from each other .
Last night Jimmy 's parents Barry and Margaret Mizen and their eldest son Danny said they were horrified to hear another young life had been lost in a knife attack .
Danny , 30 , said : ' It 's all so senseless .
We feel for his family . '
Rob , who gained A - levels at Beths Grammar School , Bexley , had been rapidly building a reputation as an actor .
He appeared with Roxanne Ricketts and Nicholas Lyndhurst in the 2007 BBC TV comedy After You 've Gone about a family who move to Africa to help the poor .
Colin , Jamie and Sally Knox comfort each other over the death of 18 - year - old Rob
Miss Ricketts said : ' He was such a great guy and we had such a laugh .
I can honestly say he was one of the nicest people I met and worked with . '
Writing on an internet tribute site , she added : ' I could n't believe my eyes when I saw the news .
I am deeply shocked and saddened and my thoughts and prayers are with his family at this sad time . '
Tributes to the teenager piled up at the scene of the murder .
They included a football shirt from his beloved Charlton Athletic and a jersey from his rugby club .
Rob 's grandmother Margaret Knox , 79 , also visited the spot where he died .
She said : ' He was like a big teddy bear .
He always defended those getting a rough deal and befriended them .
It was because he was so loving it cost him his life . '
Mrs Knox said she fears respect for life , a belief in politeness and good manners towards other people are at an all - time low in Britain .
She said : ' You hear it so much from the older generation but things like this happen because this country is getting worse and worse .
' Too many young people are becoming parents , they do n't know what their kids get up to with knives and drinking and fighting .
' I want every parent who has a teenager to take note of what they are carrying , search them , just try , at least try to put an end to this violence . '
Last night a local man aged 21 was still being interviewed on suspicion of murder .

( NaturalNews ) Google Inc. has announced plans to invest millions of dollars in order to move into the renewable energy business .
" If we achieve these goals , we are going to be in the [ electricity ] business in a very big way , " said Google co-founder Larry Page .
" We should be able to make a lot of money from this .
" Google 's move from Internet services into electricity generation was motivated by a desire to reduce the ecological footprint of the company 's massive power needs .
While Google 's exact power consumption is a trade secret , the company acknowledges that one of its biggest worries is being able to meet its continually expanding electricity demands .
The company already has a history of investing in renewable energy , with its Mountain View , Calif .
headquarters already being powered , in part , by one of the largest solar electric installations in the United States .
As part of the move into renewable energy , Google 's philanthropic arm , Google.org , plans to invest $ 20 million in the next year alone toward renewable energy research .
This will include the cost of hiring between 20 and 30 new employees , including renewable energy experts .
Google aims to find a way to significantly reduce the cost of renewable energy generation to bring it more on par with the cost of coal .
According to Page , Google aims to significantly reduce the cost of generating renewable energy .
It plans , for example , to bring the cost of solar power down by 25 to 50 percent .
The company 's wider goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable electric power at a per watt rate lower than that of coal within " years , not decades . "
This would be enough electricity to power a city the size of San Francisco .
In addition to financing research directly , Google .org plans to invest " hundreds of millions " of dollars in companies that specialize in renewable power , Page said .

LIVERPOOL wonder baby Ashleigh has started nursery .
The three - year - old has completed her first two weeks at Stockton Wood primary school in Speke after defying warnings by doctors .
Parents Alison Mulvaney and Daniel Richardford almost made the ultimate sacrifice to save total strangers from a fire while Alison was pregnant with Ashleigh .
Doctors warned the couple their baby might be permanently physically and mentally disabled after her traumatic birth .
But the little girl has defied the odds and is developing well .
Her speech will be perfected by a therapist and the youngster may need physiotherapy on her knee .
But she has been given a clean bill of health by Alder Hey children ’s hospital .
Ms Mulvaney , 38 , said : “ Ashleigh is really healthy and we are chuffed to bits that she has started nursery .
“ She started two weeks ago and was a little tearful at first , but she has made some little friends and she loves nursery now . ”
Ashleigh idolises her nine - year - old brother Josh and is delighted to be going to school just like him .
The couple ’s bravery earned them the 2006 Mersey Marvel title .
Ms Mulvaney , eight - and - a - half months pregnant , was on her way home when she and Mr Richardford saw a fire , started by vandals , threatening a row of houses in Queens Drive , Childwall .
The couple raced from their car to raise the alarm .
Mr Richardford , 35 , braved choking smoke to hammer on residents ' homes and help people to safety .
More than six people said they owed their lives to the couple .
But immediately afterwards , Ms Mulvaney collapsed .
She was taken to hospital , where she needed surgery for a ruptured artery in her spleen and baby Ashleigh had to be delivered .
The arsonists responsible for the fire on March 21 , 2005 , have never been caught despite a £ 10,000 reward .
Server Farms vs Your Desktop PC – The Internet ’s Carbon Footprint
[ a server farm … please refrain from server tipping – source ]
“ The internet is the fastest growing source of CO2 to the atmosphere … it doubled from 2002 to 2006 . ”
This is an excellent interview ( 12.5 mins ) with Bill St. Arnaud from CBC The Spark ’s Nora Young .
Bill is the director of CANARIE , a non-profit organization whose mission …
[ … ] is to accelerate Canada ’s advanced Internet development and use by facilitating the widespread adoption of faster , more efficient networks and by enabling the next generation of advanced products , applications and services to run on them .
The interview reminded me of a problem that faces most of the industrialized world : there are consequences for the way we choose to live .
In short , it goes like this : those 500 + photos on your Facebook account , the dozen videos posted to your myspace profile or * insert platform * blog , the walking tall on funnyordie.com , and the full - length feature pirated films you download all have to be stored somewhere ( oh , and backed up of course ) and thusly have real world ramifications .
This requires a lot of server space , which in turn eats up a lot of energy bot to run them and equal amounts to cool them ( i.e. a digital cause can impart a physically tangible effect on the Earth ) .
The result , according to Bill , is that the information super - highway has turned into the fastest growing source of atmospheric CO2 worldwide ( more so than the airline industry ) .
Of course , as the number of SUVs barreling down it increases ( i.e. as more of the world joins the internet and actively engages in high - energy demand and user - experience oriented services ) , so will the rate of CO2 production .
Most people think of their own personal devices , but do n’t realize how [ many ] computers are out there just to provide all that information we take for granted when we surf the web .
Where is most of energy being sucked up ?
Well , according to Bill two places : personal computers account for 50 % of the internet ’s energy consumption , while “ server farms ” ( i.e. 100 ’s of gigantic buildings that span acres of land , housing 1000 ’s of servers that store the bulk of the net ’s information ) are responsible for other other half .
These server farms account for the near doubling of CO2 production by net users : as more energy is required to run them , so too is required to keep them from overheating .
So what are internet companies doing about this ?
Plenty , according to Bill .
Many companies , like Google , are currently developing zero - carbon data centers using alternative energy sources and freshwater coolants ( instead of fossil - fuel driven air conditioning ) .
A Canadian company in Nova Scotia is taking advantage of the large store of potential tidal energy in the Bay of Fundy .
So how do you get the general public to actively engage in the modern global warming spectacle ?
Let us use these advanced tools , these virtual tools , as an incentive to reduce your CO2 emissions in other aspects of your life .
This is where we think we ’ll have a much greater impact in terms of the total carbon footprint [ … ] we want to reward people for behavior in terms of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions .
For example , CANARIE has started a pilot program in Ottawa that provides free high speed internet , routed through your heating bill .
So , if you reduce your household energy consumption , you get free net access .
Apparently , there are buses in the UK that provide free wireless to its customers as a way to promote a cleaner alternative to driving ( while making money , lest we forget ) .
Recycling is supposed to be good for the environment .
But if it ’s not carried out properly , certain kinds of recycling  notably the dismantling of electronic circuit boards , which contain lead , zinc , copper and other metals  can cause environmental harm .
It can also be dangerous to human health , as a new study of electronics recycling in China shows .
Anna O. W. Leung and Ming H. Wong of Hong Kong Baptist University and colleagues went to the town of Guiyu in southeastern China , home to a cottage industry of family - run recycling workshops .
These are typically set up inside homes , where family members melt the tin-lead solder on the boards to remove chips and other components for sale , with only small household fans for ventilation .
The researchers collected surface dust samples in and around these workshops , at local markets and schools and in other nearby residential areas .
As reported in Environmental Science and Technology , they found extremely elevated levels of lead , zinc and other metals in the workshops .
Lead levels , for example , were up to 2,400 times commonly accepted optimum levels .
It was once considered the most dangerous object in the universe , heading for Earth with the explosive power of 84 Hiroshimas .
Now an asteroid called 2000SG344 , a lump of rock barely the size of a large yacht , is in the spotlight again , this time as a contender for the next giant leap for mankind .
Nasa engineers have identified the 1.1 m tonne asteroid , which in 2000 was given a significant chance of slamming into Earth , as a potential landing site for astronauts , ahead of the Bush administration 's plans to venture deeper into the solar system with a crewed voyage to Mars .
The mission - the first to what officials call a Near Earth Object ( NEO ) - is being floated within the US space agency as a crucial stepping stone to future space exploration .
A report seen by the Guardian notes that by sending astronauts on a three - month journey to the hurtling asteroid , scientists believe they would learn more about the psychological effects of long - term missions and the risks of working in deep space , and it would allow astronauts to test kits to convert subsurface ice into drinking water , breathable oxygen and even hydrogen to top up rocket fuel .
All of which would be invaluable before embarking on a two - year expedition to Mars .
Under the Bush administration , Nasa has been charged with sending astronauts back to the moon , beginning in 2020 and culminating in a permanent lunar outpost , itself a jumping off point for more distant Mars missions .
With the agency 's ageing fleet of space shuttles due to be retired soon after 2010 , the agency has begun work on a replacement called Orion and a series of Ares rockets that will blast them into orbit .
In a study due to be published next month , engineers at Nasa 's Johnson Space Centre in Houston and Ames Research Centre in California flesh out plans to use Orion for a three to six month round - trip to the asteroid , with astronauts spending a week or two on the rock 's surface .
As well as giving space officials a taste of more complex missions , samples taken from the rock could help scientists understand more about the birth of the solar system and how best to defend against asteroids that veer into Earth 's path .
" An asteroid will one day be on a collision course with Earth .
Does n't it make sense , after going to the moon , to start learning more about them ?
Our study shows it makes perfect sense to do this soon after going back to the moon , " said Rob Landis , an engineer at Johnson Space Centre and co-author of the report , which is due to be published in the journal Acta Astronautica .
More precise measurements of the orbit of 2000SG344 have allayed fears that it could hit Earth sometime around the end of September 2030 , but the asteroid is still expected to come close in astronomical terms .
The report lays out plans for a crew of two to rendezvous with a speeding asteroid that is due to pass close by Earth .
After a seven - week outward journey , the Orion capsule would swing around and close in on the rock .
Because gravity is close to zero on asteroids , the capsule would need to attach itself , possibly by firing anchors into the surface .
For the same reason , astronauts would not be able to walk around on the surface as they did on the moon .
" On some of these asteroids , you could jump up and go into orbit , or maybe even leave for good , " said Landis .
A round trip to an asteroid could be done with less fuel than a moon mission , but is technically very challenging .
The asteroid is only 40 metres across and spins as it hurtles through space at 28,000 mph .
Landis thinks that a trip to an asteroid could capture imaginations even more than a return to our nearest celestial neighbour .
" When we head back to the moon , I think we 'll see many of the same scenes we saw in the 60s and 70s Apollo programme .
We 've been to the moon , we got that T - shirt back in 1969 .
But whenever we 've sent robotic probes to look at asteroids , we 've always been surprised at what we 've seen , " he said .
Because asteroids were forged in the earliest days of the solar system , analysing samples from them could shed light on the conditions that prevailed when the Earth was formed .
" Near Earth objects are a potential collision hazard to Earth and it may one day be necessary to deflect an asteroid from a collision course with Earth , " said Ian Crawford , a planetary scientist at Birkbeck College , London .
" Having the capability in your back pocket to deflect an asteroid might be a good insurance policy for the future , and for that , you want to know what they are made of , how to rendezvous with them , and whether you risk getting hit by debris if you fire something at it . "

Frontier Airlines on Friday became the latest budget carrier to file for bankruptcy protection , but the airline promised to continue normal operations .
Frontier , based in Denver , said it had filed for protection after its main credit card processor tried to hold back substantial proceeds from its tickets sales .
But the airline said it would continue to operate its full schedule of flights and honor ticket reservations .
“ To be clear , we filed for very different reasons than those of other recent carriers , and our customers and employees can be confident that we intend to keep on flying and providing outstanding service and products , ” Sean Menke , Frontier president and chief executive officer , said in a statement .
He said the airline promised to continue “ normal operations throughout our reorganization process . ”
On Wednesday , Oasis Hong Kong Airlines , a long - haul budget carrier that tried to offer premium service and spacious seats at low prices , suddenly went into liquidation and canceled all flights .
At that time , it was the fourth budget carrier worldwide to halt operations over a period of a week and a half .
The series of bankruptcies could undermine travelers ’ confidence in budget airlines .

Y ears ago , I read a news story about a guy who owned a fleet of cement - mixer trucks that supplied concrete for road construction in his area .
He was also active in community affairs and won all sorts of citizenship awards .
Then some financial analyst noticed that the community devoted an unusually large proportion of its budget to roadwork .
It turned out that the man routinely overloaded his trucks .
The trucks cracked the roads they traveled on , which guaranteed his company a steady stream of business .
An elegant scam .
I think about that guy every spring when the Skin Cancer Foundation ( SCF ) makes its annual appeal to the public to use sunscreen .
As people heed their warning this year , few will remember the report that made headlines in February .
According to a survey of new research by epidemiologist Marianne Berwick of the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York , there is no evidence that sunscreen offers any real protection against malignant melanoma , the most dangerous form of skin cancer .
“ It ’s not safe to rely on sunscreen , ” Berwick told the press .
The SCF promptly refuted her findings in a press release , telling consumers that “ sunscreen should continue to be an integral part of a comprehensive program ” to prevent melanoma .
That ’s what most people will likely hear from their dermatologists as well .
What they wo n’t learn is that dermatologists get much of their information from the SCF , and the SCF , in turn , is heavily supported by the sunscreen industry .
( A sunscreen manufacturer even funded SCF ’s quarterly consumer publication , “ Sun and Skin News . ” )
No wonder the foundation does n’t give much credence to the growing number of studies showing that even so - called broad - spectrum sunscreen does n’t prevent melanoma .
Like the road - destroying trucks that guaranteed work for the concrete company , rising melanoma rates scare people into using more sunscreen .
In a 1993 Mother Jones article ( “ Beach Bummer , ” May / June ) , I reported that sunscreen may actually contribute to skin cancer .
It prolongs people ’s time in the sun by preventing the only natural melanoma warning system human skin has — sunburn .
Berwick did n’t go that far , but in noting the mounting evidence against sunscreen , she credited Mother Jones for its reporting .
What ’s changed in the five years since our report ?
More studies prove this link , melanoma rates are rising about 6 percent each year , and sunscreen sales are continuing to climb .
Sunscreen makers and the SCF have engaged in a cynical sleight of hand by claiming that sunscreen helps prevent skin cancer .
There are three main kinds of skin cancer : basal cell , squamous cell , and malignant melanoma .
The first two are common ( about 1 million cases a year ) and almost always medically minor .
The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute do n’t even count them in the nation ’s cancer statistics .
Melanoma is much less common ( 40,300 diagnoses last year ) , but often fatal ( 7,300 deaths ) .
Basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer are caused primarily by UV - B light , the kind that causes sunburn , and there ’s credible evidence that sunscreen helps prevent those two types of cancer ( as well as offers protection against premature aging of skin ) .
The Food and Drug Administration ’s SPF ( or sun protection factor ) rating program measures UV - B protection .
But most sunscreens do not offer protection against UV - A , the harmful , longer - wavelength UV light .
UV - A penetrates right through the outer skin — and through sunscreen — down to the melanocytes , the cells that become cancerous in melanoma cases .
In one study that proved this point , researchers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , New York , induced melanoma in fish by exposing them to both UV - B and UV - A sunlight .
They concluded : “ Sunscreens effective in the UV - B region … would not protect against melanoma . ”
But when people hear the term skin cancer , they think melanoma .
That ’s because when sunscreen labels claim that the product can protect people from skin cancer , consumers do n’t differentiate melanoma from basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers .
Until around 1950 , melanoma was rare .
then its incidence increased slowly until the mid-1960s , when it accelerated into the current epidemic .
The standard , pro-sunscreen explanation is that , like lung cancer , the disease has a long lag time , on the order of 20 years .
Americans began sunbathing in earnest in the 1950s , and as a result , the melanoma epidemic hit in the 1970s .
But even a cursory look at the history of sunbathing washes this explanation away faster than a sand castle in a hurricane .
Ask any elderly person you know .
Beaches around the country were jammed on summer weekends in the 1930s .
Why did n’t a melanoma epidemic hit the Depression generation 20 years later ?
Why did it take until the mid-1970s for the epidemic to strike ?
Sunscreen promoters offer no clue .
Meanwhile , ever since the melanoma rate began soaring , health authorities have exhorted us to use sunscreen .
Americans have clearly taken this advice to heart .
Sales figures jumped from $ 18 million in 1972 to $ 500 million in 1996 .
If melanoma has a 20 - year lag time and sunscreen is protective , the melanoma rate should have started to level off by now .
Instead , it ’s climbing .
In 1980 , an American ’s lifetime melanoma risk was 1 in 250 .
Today , it ’s 1 in 84 .
Now take a closer look at the presumption that melanoma has a long lag time .
The research indicates that the lag time could be as low as two years .
Lung cancer , heart disease , and other conditions with long lag times are diagnosed at a steady rate year - round .
Summer brings no more diagnoses than winter because over , say , 20 years , seasonal distinctions blur .
Melanoma diagnoses , on the other hand , do reflect seasonality .
At least five studies of melanoma ( in Hawaii , the continental U.S. , Sweden , Norway , and England and Wales ) all agree that melanoma diagnoses follow a seasonal pattern , showing up at a considerably higher rate in summer than in winter .
Seasonality is a hallmark of biological events with short lag times .
Given that melanoma was rare until 1950 , and that melanoma may have a lag time of only two to five years , then something about our relationship with UV light must have changed a few years before the melanoma rate began inching up in the early 1950s .
Consider sunscreen .
It was first introduced in the early 1940s as tanning lotion .
The idea was that if you could stay in the sun without burning , you ’d tan .
A few years later , the melanoma rate began to rise .
Improved tanning lotions came on the market in the early 1960s , and a few years after that , the melanoma rate zoomed up .
Public health authorities became concerned , and melanoma became news .
Seeing a commercial opportunity , the makers of tanning lotions repositioned their products as “ sunscreen , ” and the now familiar sermonizing began .
Since then , melanoma has become the nation ’s fastest - rising cancer and sunscreen sales have continued to climb .
Ozone depletion may play a role in the higher melanoma rate , as some scientists say , but melanoma cases began to go up long before ozone depletion became an issue .
In recent years , it has become clear that to prevent melanoma , sunscreen must do more than block UV - B rays — it must also protect against UV - A .
As a result , sunscreen makers have tinkered with their formulas , and now most claim that their products provide broad - spectrum UV - A and UV - B coverage .
Sounds good , but it ’s actually another sleight of hand on the part of sunscreen manufacturers .
Only one ingredient , avobenzone , is “ clearly proven ” to block UV - A sunlight , and according to FDA spokeswoman Ivy Kupec , the FDA does n’t require its inclusion in sunscreens in order for manufacturers to claim that their products offer broad - spectrum protection .
( “ I guess there ’s an inconsistency , ” she notes . )
Kupec added that manufacturers “ could still say [ their product ] protects against UV - A , because they can do it until we tell them not to . ”
So much for regulatory protection .
Even if sunscreen blocked UV - A completely , almost no one uses it in the way that grants real protection against sunburn .
For sunscreen to live up to its hype , you have to slop it on real thick and reapply it every few hours .
We ’re talking at least one full bottle per person per day at the beach .
Meanwhile , the vast majority of sunscreen users apply a thin layer once or twice .
The only proven way to prevent melanoma is to cover up .
Our forebears did so in the days before sunscreen .
Clearly it worked because melanoma was so rare .
It ’s also what people now do in Australia .
White Australians come largely from light - skinned British / Irish stock .
Queensland province , in northeastern Australia , has the highest melanoma rate in the world , but as the SCF proudly pointed out when it rebutted Berwick ’s study , melanoma rates there have started to flatten .
What the SCF did not mention is that while the Queensland public health authorities began a big - budget PR campaign promoting sunscreen in 1981 , they shifted the campaign ’s focus a few years ago to strongly encourage people to cover up and stay in the shade .
The Skin Cancer Foundation does acknowledge that sunscreen alone is not enough .
You need to wear protective clothing ( pricey new fabrics such as Solumbra apparently block both UV - A and UV - B , but a wide hat and long , lightweight summer clothing should suffice ) , and spend more time in the shade .
If you ’re a beach lover , invest in a sun umbrella .
But think twice before you slap on sunscreen .
Some cement mixers destroy the roads we ’re told they build .
And some products may contribute to the cancer we ’re told they prevent .

Here ’s an interesting effect discovered by a group of Iranian physicists at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran , Iran ( it ’s not often we hear from these guys ) .
They placed a thin film of water in a square cell and applied two perpendicular electric fields .
One was an external electric field .
For the other , they used two copper electrodes to generate a voltage across the cell like an electrolysing cell ( although no chemical reaction took place ) .
So they had a pair of electric fields at right angles acting on this thin film .
The unexpected result is that the film of water begins to rotate .
The team has a number of movies of the effect on its website .
They call it a liquid film motor and it ’s a quite extraordinary effect .
At one point they divide their cell into nine smaller ones and the liquid in each cell rotates in exactly the same way .
The question is : what ’s causing the rotation ?
The team can easily control the direction and speed of rotation by varying the relative angle and direction of the electric fields , which rules out the possibility that convection is causing the rotation ( something that is seen when a field is applied to some thin films of liquid crystals ) .
Neither does adding salt to water change the effect , ruling out the possibility that ion movement directs the flow .
The rotation occurs in polar liquids but not in non-polar ones so the intrinsic dipole moment of the molecules seems to be crucial .
People have been observing the electrohydrodynamics of various types of thin films for a good few years but nobody has seen anything like this .
Just what ’s going on remains a mystery .
But the puzzle should n’t overshadow what looks like an important discovery that could have widespread industrial application in microfluidic devices for mixing .

The report urged Russia to protect free speech
The murders of outspoken journalists go unsolved , independent media outlets have been shut and police have attacked opposition protesters , said the report .
It also said " arbitrary " laws were curbing the right to express opinion and silencing NGOs deemed to be a threat by the authorities .
The report comes ahead of Russian 's presidential elections on 2 March .
The director of Amnesty International UK , Kate Allen , said : " The space for freedom of speech is shrinking alarmingly in Russia and it's now imperative that the Russian authorities reverse this trend . "
She said dissent could be a matter of life or death in the case of outspoken journalists like Anna Politkovskaya , who was shot dead in Moscow two years ago .
The 52 - page Freedom Limited report warned any opposition demonstrations could suffer heavy clampdowns in the coming days , as Amnesty said had happened in the run-up to past elections .
First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev , whom President Putin has named his favoured successor , is expected to be elected in this Sunday 's poll .

I was playing around with timers the other day , trying to see how different browsers handled different edge cases , when I stumbled across a fascinatingly bizarre quirk in Internet Explorer .
I would n’t call it a bug , per se , since that would imply that there was an excepted result , but there is not .
The code :
setInterval ( function ( ) { alert ( " hello ! " ) ; } , - 1 ) ;
Now , before you view the demo ( view in IE only ! ) try to guess what the above code does .
Since - 1 is n’t a valid interval my guess was that it would , either ( based upon Internet Explorer ’s current setInterval behavior ) :
Execute immediately , like a normal function , but then never fire again .
or not execute at all .
What happened is positively bizarre :
The callback function will be executed every time the user left clicks the mouse , anywhere in the document .
I find this to be absolutely hilarious .
I ’m struggling to think of how this could , possibly , be used in any remotely feasible way .
Some random ideas :
A global click handler that ca n’t be removed and does n’t leak memory ( presumably since no DOM elements involved ? )
Some sort of vector for XSS attacks .
I do n’t know what the situation would be where you have access to setInterval but not the DOM , so I ’m not sure what credence this has .
A way to initiate a fake event capturing click event ( before the actual bubbling event occurs ) .
I do n’t know – I ’m not sure if any of them are terribly useful but I find it to be amusing nonetheless .
Thoughts on how we can have fun with this ?
At around 10 am on Saturday , 61 - year old farmer Sadik al - Bari was attacked by around 25 Israeli settlers , who surrounded the man and his wife while they were working in their field , and began pelting them with rocks .
Al - Bari stated , " I was in my field when suddenly more than 25 people arrived and began to throw stones .
They cried ' go away . '
Where can I go ?
I was doing nothing wrong , simply working my land .
They covered their faces with their shirts and threw stones at my wife and me .
It was the first time I had seen these settlers .
They want me to leave , but tomorrow I will go to my field again . "
The elderly farmer attempted to file a complaint with the Israeli police department built on illegally occupied Palestinian land near Hebron , but was informed by the officer in charge that the police department was closed .
Only after intervention by the Israeli human rights group ' Rabbis for Human Rights ' was the station opened to al - Bari in order to file his complaint .
In the complaint , al - Bari stated that both he and his wife sustained injuries from the rocks thrown at them by the settlers .
The Israeli police departments located on illegally occupied Palestinian land are given a mandate by the Israeli government to protect the Israeli settlers that have seized Palestinian land in violation of international law .
They are , as a result , extremely reticent to pursue investigations of Israeli settler attacks against the Palestinian civilian population .
In the Hebron area , attacks on Palestinian civilians by Israeli settlers occur on a daily basis , and investigations of these incidents by Israeli police are extremely rare .
The attacks often intensify on Saturdays , when Israeli settlers gather together after prayer services for the Jewish holy day of Shabbat , in order to attack Palestinian civilians who have been living for millenia on land that the Israeli settlers consider to be theirs by ' divine right ' .
I ’m very pleased to report that my application for the Google Summer of Code has been accepted !
It almost goes without saying to mention that I ’ve proposed work on the leading compiler for my language - du - jour : Haskell !
So , what exactly am I working on ?
Well , I and my mentor , Sean Seefried , think it would be awesome if we could give users of Haskell the ability to extend the compiler with their own code .
Of course , they can do this today if they are willing to dig into and try and grok the rather intimidating guts of GHCs 216KLOC codebase , but we ’d really like to let you do it without a source checkout of GHC and in a way so that it ’s easy to use other peoples extensions too .
How are we going to meet these exacting criteria ?
The plan is to let people write modules that we can distribute via the existing Cabal packaging / build system infrastructure and load into GHC dynamically !
We owe the ability to do this to Don Stewart ’s excellent hs - plugins library .
I ’m also going to rustle up a good chunk of documentation and sample code to make it easy as pie to get into development .
This is going to give the Haskell community a whole new way in which to extend the language : I ’m very excited to see what they come up with !
However , here are just a taste of some of the more reasonable things I think our plugins are going to be able to do :
Selectively make Haskell a strict functional programming language
Optimize your code in whatever application - specific way you can come up with
Declaratively memoize arbitrary function definitions
Compile Haskell code to run on GPUs if available
Simple empirical research on functional programming by letting you write code analysis extensions
Cure world hunger
OK , that last one might be a bit optimistic , but I ’m still very excited about the possibilities :-) .
What ’s more , although nothing is certain , it looks like come October I ’ll be working here at the Cambridge Computer Lab as a PhD student !
I ’ve proposed to investigate some aspects of parallelism in functional programming - more on this as it unfolds .
I ’ve just got to worry about getting a first in my finals - which are only a month or so away !
Gah !
The tanker Sichem Defender arrived at the port of Barcelona yesterday carrying something far more precious than its usual cargo of chemicals .
Nearly 23 m litres of drinking water - enough for 180,000 people for a day - was the first delivery in an unprecedented emergency plan to help this parched corner of Spain ahead of the holiday season .
As the country suffers its worst drought since records began 60 years ago , Catalonia , of which Barcelona is the capital , has been the worst - hit region .
After months without adequate rainfall its reservoirs are down to just over a quarter of normal capacity .
A year ago they stood at almost double that .
Nationally , reservoirs are around half full with the worst of the summer heat just a few weeks away .
If levels drop to 15 % of normal supply the water in the reservoirs is no longer deemed fit for drinking and restrictions on tap water would have to be brought in .
The tanker , which arrived in Barcelona from nearby Tarragona , will be followed by its sister ship Contester Defender tomorrow from Marseille .
At a cost of € 22 m ( £ 17.5 m ) , six shiploads are to arrive each month for three months , from Tarragona in southern Catalonia , Marseille and Almeria - one of the driest areas of southern Spain .
Already Barcelona 's authorities have turned off civic fountains and beachside showers , brought in hosepipe bans , and banned the filling of swimming pools .
Schoolchildren are being taught how to save water .
" We are only too aware of the crisis with the water as they have been giving my daughters classes for months on how to save water and only to use what they need , " said city resident Begoña Gómez , 43 , as she sipped a glass of bottled water .
" But we need better management of water by the government . "
As the reservoirs across Spain run dry , a " water war " has broken out , with different regions scrabbling for extra supplies .
The Socialist government , which initially opposed water transfers from one region to another , executed a political U - turn and allowed water to be pumped into Catalonia from the river Ebro in the neighbouring region of Aragon .
The move infuriated southern regions such as Murcia and Valencia , which asked for similar concessions .
Both are significant agricultural areas , with a busy tourist season about to start , and expect their water supplies to be hit hard .
Both areas , run by the opposition conservative Popular party , claim Spain 's Socialist prime minister José Luis Rodrìguez Zapatero denied their requests for water transfers for political reasons .
The Socialist government is following a controversial programme of building desalinisation plants , which they claim will provide a long - term solution to Spain 's endemic water shortage .
They have built six so far and plan a further 18 .
One is due to open outside Barcelona in May next year .
Meanwhile , despite heavy rainfall over the weekend water reserves in Catalonia only increased by 1.7 % .
Water experts say Barcelona 's problems are not just down to low rainfall .
They claim an antiquated , leaky drainage system loses millions of litres of water a day throughout Spain .
Within metres of the new € 130 m headquarters of Agbar , which owns Aguas de Barcelona , the city 's water utility , one faulty system was reported to be losing 800,000 litres a day .
Ramón Llamas , a water expert at Madrid University , says Spain squanders its water and needs better soil management , adding that despite having one of the lowest amounts of rainfall in western Europe , it has one of the highest levels of water consumption a head : the average person in Madrid uses 140 litres a day .
Meanwhile , despite fears taps would run dry this summer in Barcelona , the arrival of water tankers did not please everyone .
Miguel Angel Fraile , secretary general of the Catalan Commercial Confederation , said : " The arrival of a water ship is the image and expression of failure which neither Barcelona nor Catalonia deserves . "
And others doubted whether emergency measures were necessary .
Carlos Urquiaga , 36 , manager of La Tramoia restaurant , said : " No one here asks for water from the tap because the taste in Barcelona is so bad .
We always serve bottled water and everyone buys it for their homes . "
Who exports where
Hydrologists expect the demand for water will continue to increase with the world 's growing population .
Some predict that by 2025 , 3.5 billion people will be living in water - scarce countries , compared with 500 million in 2002 .
· Turkey exports water to Israel and plans to ship more to Syria , Jordan and Greece
· France sends tankers filled with millions of gallons of water to Algeria
· Russia , New Zealand , Norway and Scotland have all considered exporting water
· Malaysia provides most of Singapore 's water
· Islands in the Caribbean ship water by tanker to help with shortages
· A plan by Canada to ship 1 m gallons of water a day to the Middle East was dropped after protests by environmentalists
THE SKILLS GAP … .
Over the past couple of decades the wage premium for getting a college degree has gone up dramatically .
In 1973 a typical college grad earned 30 % more than a high school graduate .
Today a college grad earns something like 90 % more .
Standard economic theory predicts that this should lead to way more people getting college degrees , but that has n’t happened .
Altonji , Bharadwaj and Lange report that , when various socioeconomic factors are held constant , “ the supply response to the increase in skill premia between cohorts was small : about 1 % on average and about 1.5 % at the median . ”
In other words , kids are n’t bothering to increase their skills very much even though the reward for doing so has skyrocketed .
Why ?
Brad DeLong proposes that part of the answer may be the surging cost of college , which not only makes the return on a bachelor ’s degree lower than it would be otherwise , but probably makes it seem even lower than it really is to teenagers with short time horizons .
He ’s also got some other ideas that he muses about here .
But I want to toss out another possibility that ’s been tickling my brain for a while .
On the right is an EPI chart that shows declining wages for college grads over the past seven years .
Ezra Klein comments :
As an economist told me a year or two back , “ there ’s never been a worse time to be a college graduate .
But there ’s never been a worse time not to be a college graduate . ”
Your wages may be higher than those of less educated cohorts , but they ’re stagnant nevertheless .
Right .
And maybe that ’s the problem .
When I say that the premium for getting a college degree used to be 30 % and now it ’s 90 % , what do I mean ?
One possibility is something like this :
1973 : high school grad makes $ 42 K , college grad makes $ 55 K .
2006 : high school grad makes $ 42 K , college grad makes $ 80 K .
This probably would motivate more kids to get college degrees .
But that ’s not what actually happened .
Here ’s what actually happened for male workers ( all figures adjusted for inflation ) :
1973 : high school grad makes $ 42 K , college grad makes $ 55 K .
2006 : high school grad makes $ 31 K , college grad makes $ 61 K .
The skill premium has n’t gone up because a college degree is way more lucrative than in the past .
In fact , it ’s only slightly more lucrative over the long term and completely stagnant among recent grads .
Rather , the skill premium has gone up because the value of a high school degree has cratered .
So here ’s my thought : even though the two scenarios above are ( roughly ) economically equivalent , they might not be psychically equivalent .
If the value of a college degree had gone way up , that really might prompt more kids on the margin to study harder and go to college .
Not only would that higher value be fairly obvious since it would get a lot of attention , but the prospect of doing better is highly motivating .
But does the declining value of a high school degee motivate them in the same way ?
I doubt it , even though mathematically the effect is the same .
For starters , many teenagers may not really understand the hard reality of the trend in non-college wages , and in any case a slow but steady decline simply does n’t motivate people the same way as dangling a reward in front of them does .
Instead of making them try harder , it tends to make them feel helpless and angry .
Am I explaining myself adequately here ?
I ’m not sure .
But it seems to me that there are lots of cases where real - life behavioral responses depend not merely on monetary differences , but on the direction and reason for those differences .
Perhaps if you want more kids to go to college , you need to reward them for going to college , not merely punish them for not going .

The massive 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti yesterday may be the most powerful quake to strike the island nation in more than 200 years .
The epicenter of the quake was about 10 miles ( 16 kilometers ) southwest of the capital , Port - au - Prince .
When Nature unleashes her fury , humanity can seem instantly frail and subordinate .
Cyclones , tsunamis , earthquakes and volcanoes can kill thousands in moments .
Often the final death tolls are never truly known .
It is impossible to compare modern and historical disasters and develop any objective list of the worst , yet a subjective list can prove instructive .
Here are the challenges :
The world 's population has increased dramatically in the past century and a far higher percentage of people live near dangerous coastlines , so coastal storms and tsunamis stand to kill more people nowadays than in the past .
Records of events long ago are typically much less accurate .
All that in mind , here we present 15 of the worst disasters of all time in reverse chronological order , with no attempt to rate one in comparison to another .
We recognize the list is weighted heavily with modern events and that other disasters — both in modern times and in the distant past — could arguably supplant some of these based on individual perspective and interpretation .
January 12 , 2010 - Casualties resulting from the Haiti quake are still unknown , but the Red Cross estimates that up to 3 million people may have been affected .
May 2 , 2008 - The death toll from Cyclone Nargis remains uncertain but has been put at 140,000 or more .
Caught with nowhere to run , residents of low - lying rice fields in Maynmar were simply swept away .
Oct. 8 , 2005 - Magnitude - 7.6 earthquake in Pakistan killed more than 40,000 people .
The destruction was due in part to the quake 's shallow origin .
August 2005 - Hurricane Katrina killed more than 1,800 people and is the costliest hurricane in U.S. history .
More so than any U.S. disaster in recent decades , its effects linger even today as New Orleans and many coastal communities still struggle to get back on their feet .
Dec. 26 , 2004 - The magnitude - 9.3 Indian Ocean earthquake and resulting Sumatran tsunami is estimated to have killed more than 225,000 people .
It affected a broader region and more people than any modern disaster .
1992 - Hurricane Andrew killed 26 , but property damage was $ 25 billion -- most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history at the time .
1985 - Nevado del Ruiz ( Columbia ) volcano killed 25,000 people , most caught in a massive mudflow .
1976 - Tangshan earthquake in China , a magnitude - 8 event , killed somewhere between 255,000 and 655,000 .
1931 - Yellow River flood , estimated to have killed 1 million to 3.7 million people via drowning , disease , ensuing famines and droughts .
The river also had flooded catastrophically in 1887 , killing nearly as many .
1815 - Tambora , Indonesia , volcano of 1815 .
80,000 people died of subsequent famine .
1811 - 12 - Three New Madrid earthquakes in Missouri represent some of the strongest earthquakes in the contiguous United States in recorded history .
With magnitudes estimated as high as 7.8 or so , they were felt as far away as Boston .
Damage was relatively light due to sparse population , but the quakes serve as a frightening reminder of how fickle nature can be and they are also alarmingly predictive of what could happen in the future now that the area is far more populous .
1737 - Calcutta , India , event killed 300,000 .
Once thought to have been an earthquake , scientists now lean toward typhoon .
1556 - Shaanzi , China , earthquake killed 830,000 .
Nobody knows the seismic magnitude .
1330 - 1351 - The Black Death or Bubonic Plague , a pandemic caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis , killed an estimated 75 million people , wiping out somewhere between 30 to 60 percent of Europe 's population .
1138 - Aleppo earthquake in Syria , killed about 230,000 .
It is listed by the U.S. Geological Survey as the fourth deadliest earthquake of all time .
1500 B.C. , or so - The Mediterranean Stroggli island blew up .
A tsunami virtually wiped out Minoan civilization .
Area now called Santorini ; Plato called it the site where Atlantis disappeared .

Baby Layla has spent the entire first two months of her precious life cooped up in a hotel room after fire damaged her parent 's apartment and destroyed their belongings - including gifts meant for Layla and her dad 's breathing machine used to counter his sleep apnea .
Do I even need to mention that the fire started when a Verizon FiOS installer drilled through an electric line ? ...
Did n't think so .
What does require emphasis is that Daniel Wood , Dawn Sammler and their daughter are out $ 58,000 worth of possessions and lost living expenses , according to their attorney , Andrew Cotlar , while Verizon reportedly has offered the Warrington , Pa. , couple all of $ 1,800 in compensation .
( Update : Verizon calls $ 1,800 an advance payment . )
Welcome to the world of Verizon , Layla .
Of course , Wood , Sammler and their cute - as - a - button child are only the latest in a seemingly endless string of customers who have found themselves put out of house and home by Verizon installers and the company 's contractors .
The series of blunders has created a nightmare for Verizon 's public relations department - which it has handled it abysmally - and left those of us who have merely endured the carrier 's crappy service counting ourselves fortunate .
I mean what could be worse than having your home set on fire while you 're in the hospital having a baby ?
From The Intelligencer :
In the lawsuit filed in county court , Wood , 26 , and Sammler , 22 , say that Verizon representatives promised the company would provide housing for them at the company 's expense until they could find a new place to live .
The company also promised to reimburse their out - of - pocket living expenses and replace the things they lost in the fire , they said .
They said Verizon has ignored their repeated requests for reimbursement of their living costs and replacement of their belongings .
On Friday , Verizon offered to pay the couple $ 1,800 , said their attorney , Andrew Cotlar .
He said the couple lost about $ 58,000 worth of belongings .
As for what Verizon has to say ... well , we 've heard it before , although it must be said that in previous " incidents " the company has seemed quicker to reach for the checkbook .
Verizon spokeswoman Sharon Shaffer said she could n't comment specifically on the lawsuit itself but acknowledged that the company 's insurance adjusters have been working with Cotlar to try to reach an agreement .
" We 're certainly familiar with the incident , and Verizon does regret the accident , " she said .
Regret is cheap .
Verizon is a multibillion public company .
Perhaps those who oversee that empire should direct a few million - or a few tens of millions - toward better training and on - site safety procedures for its installers .
Whatever they 're doing now is clearly not enough .
And let 's hope Baby Layla sees home before her first birthday .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Australia needs several years of above average rain to end a drought that has devastated crops in three of the last six years , according to the latest report by the Bureau of Meterology .

The bureau said in its monthly drought statement on Monday that despite recent heavy rains over eastern Australia ’s main cropping lands , the drought was far from over , and had intensified in the outback .
“ Several years of above average rainfall are required to remove the very long - term ( water ) deficits , ” said the bureau .
“ The combination of record heat and widespread drought during the past five to 10 years over large parts of southern and eastern Australia is without historical precedent and is , at least partly , a result of climate change . ”
Australia ’s drought began to ease in late 2007 and in the first two months of 2008 , leading private and government forecasters to predict a record or near - record wheat crop of 26 - 27 million tonnes in 2008 / 09 , up from 13 million tonnes the year before .
However , dry weather has returned in the past two months .
Western Australian wheat growers have received enough rain to begin to plant their next crop , but farmers in eastern growing areas are still waiting for planting rain .
The bureau said that long and short - term rain deficiencies were persisting .
A dry April meant the drought intensified in central Australia and long - term or two - year rainfall deficiencies had increased in most parts of Australia , except the southwest corner .
The bureau cited the main cropping lands of southeast Queensland , Victoria and western New South Wales as suffering long - term rain deficits .
“ One exception was southwest WA ( Western Australia ) which had a wetter April this year so the 24 - month deficits eased somewhat , ” it said of Australia ’s main wheat lands .

Oakland police have opened an investigation into the case of a first - grade boy whose skull was fractured Monday when , he said , an older student slammed him against a tree as he waited for a ride from a family friend .
Police investigators will visit Piedmont Avenue Elementary School today to question school officials and any students who might have seen what happened .
Seven - year - old Zachary Cataldo spent two nights in the intensive care unit at Children 's Hospital before returning home on Wednesday .
" After our investigation , the district attorney could very well decide to prosecute and file charges , " said Officer Roland Holmgren , spokesman for the Oakland police .
Vince Matthews , state administrator for the Oakland Unified School District , and other district officials did not return calls from The Chronicle on Thursday .
Nor did Principal Angela Haick of Piedmont Avenue Elementary , where the incident took place .
But expressions of concern for Zachary - and outrage at what his father said was the school 's lax response to repeated bullying incidents - poured in from across the country after the story appeared in The Chronicle on Thursday .
Help also came from closer to home .
Zachary 's father , Anthony Cataldo , is a single father who works as a receiver at a Safeway store in Oakland and has had to take the week off to be with his son .
" We 're covering for his salary , " said Isaias Dominguez , the store 's assistant manager .
" We have about 200 employees , and everyone is contributing so he does n't get penalized for being out .
" I found out what happened this morning , and it 's extremely horrible .
( Zachary ) is a nice kid .
A really nice kid . "
Zachary was standing in front of the school waiting for a ride on Monday afternoon when , as he tells it , " a fifth - grader picked me up , and he body - slammed me into a tree . "
His father said Piedmont Avenue Elementary lacks adult supervision before and after school .
That was confirmed Wednesday by Denise Saddler , an administrator with the Oakland Unified School District , who said that at elementary schools throughout the district , only students enrolled in special programs receive supervision .
Assemblyman Gene Mullin , a South San Francisco Democrat who heads the Assembly 's Education Committee , said Thursday that he will consider whether a " safe - zone requirement " is needed in state law that would require schools to supervise children for a reasonable period before and after school .
" The fact that they have no adult supervision is troubling , quite frankly , " Mullin said .
" And if there 's a reasonable expectation that youngsters could be in harm 's way , it would seem that the school district has some responsibility . "
At Piedmont Avenue Elementary , where records show that 97 of the school 's 344 children were suspended for violent incidents last school year - nine of which involved weapons - school officials acknowledged that children could be in harm 's way .
Saddler said Wednesday that district officials are well aware of the danger .
" We monitor the data regularly , " she said .
" It 's a major concern . "
The incident that sent Zachary to the hospital was the third time he had been assaulted at Piedmont Avenue Elementary , his father said .
When Zachary was in kindergarten last year , an older boy spun him around and then let go , the elder Cataldo said .
Zachary lost four front teeth and suffered a large red laceration on his chin , a photo shows .
Three months ago , a student kicked Zachary in the stomach , his father said , adding that his complaints apparently fell on deaf ears .
Other parents also are angry about violence at Piedmont Avenue Elementary , according to reviews of the school posted on www.greatschools.net.
" Piedmont has a lot of bullying and violence - my daughter has been a victim on many occasions , " an unnamed reviewer wrote in July , adding that it was frustrating that school officials have done little to stop the violence .
Wrote another reviewer : " Bullying and violence is a constant issue . "
Meanwhile , Cataldo said school officials did little to protect Zachary after each bullying incident .
He said his son recently confided that he'd changed his behavior after being kicked in the stomach this winter .
" Zachary told me that for some time , he'd have to hide in the bushes waiting for his day care provider " after school , Cataldo said .
" This really broke my heart . "
As police investigate the case , which began with a hospital - room interview of Zachary on Tuesday morning , Cataldo has mixed feelings about the fate of the boy he believes slammed Zachary against a tree .
" Of course I 'm mad , " Cataldo said , adding that the same boy had tripped a girl from Zachary 's day care several months ago .
When the girl asked why he'd tripped her , " He punched her in the eye , " Cataldo said .
" Obviously , someone 's hurting him , " said Cataldo , suggesting that any child who goes around hurting other children may be a victim of abuse himself .
" Of course I feel bad , but he hurt my only son .
And I 'm afraid he 's going to hurt someone even more seriously .
It 's a delicate situation .
" I definitely believe his parents need to be involved . "
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japanese electronics conglomerate Sony Corp 6758.T said on Sunday it has developed dye - sensitized solar cells with an energy conversion efficiency of 10 percent , a level seen necessary for commercial use .
Dye - sensitized solar cells , which use photosensitive dye and do not require costly and large - scale production equipment , are seen as a promising next - generation solar cell variety and potential threat to silicon - based solar cells .
Germany 's Q - Cells QCEG.DE and Japan's Sharp Corp 6753.T are leading manufacturers of silicon - based solar cells .
Sony ’s dye - sensitized solar cell operations are still in the research and development stage and nothing has been decided on potential commercialization , a company spokesman said .
Global sales of solar cells are growing briskly due to higher oil prices and strong demand for renewable energy .
Sharp expects its solar cell sales to rise 19 percent in the current business year to March 2009 to 180 billion yen ( $ 1.74 billion ) .
By early afternoon , Iraqi troops were stationed in large numbers in many parts of the district .
Numerous Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers were parked on street corners , with relaxed - looking soldiers sleeping in their vehicles or looking out to the street through steel hatches .
Other soldiers manned checkpoints , some of them chatting with children .
The soldiers were also deployed near the political headquarters of Mr. Sadr .
There were no visible signs of the Mahdi Army , the militia controlled by Mr. Sadr , although many walls bore posters of him that seemed to have been put up in the last few days .
It was an easy start to what was supposed to be an extended operation .
The Iraqi Army is expected to conduct searches for hidden weapon caches in the coming days , though it is not certain how energetically they would be carried out in the Mahdi Army stronghold .
The stage for the operation was set two months ago .
Shiite militias began firing rockets at the fortified Green Zone from Sadr City in late March in response to the offensive in Basra .
As a result , American and Iraqi forces moved into the two southernmost sectors of Sadr City  Thawra and Jamilla .
But that left the question of how to regain control of the rest of Sadr City from the militias .
An Iraqi plan to mount an offensive was developed but shelved after negotiations between representatives from the Sadr movement and Shiite politicians led to a cease - fire accord .
What stereotypes come to mind when you think of Asian Americans ?
Quiet , compliant , brilliant ?
They are the " model minority , " right ?
A.R. Sakaeda , who identifies herself as a Japanese American , Asian American and person of color , believes being a model minority means being a model citizen who speaks out against injustices big and small .
I first spoke with her four years ago when she was working on a grassroots campaign protesting derogatory Asian stereotypes .
A native Chicagoan , Sakaeda grew up in Albany Park .
She credits her parents and activists like Helen Zia , Yuri Kochiyama and Grace Lee Boggs for teaching her the many and richly diverse ways to be Asian American .
This is A.R. Sakaeda ’s essay :
I have a confession to make : I am a lousy model minority .
In fact , I 'm pretty sure that the majority is n't going to want me as the model for any minority , let alone my own people .
Unlike the mythical model minority , I am not quiet and polite .
I am often loud , sometimes abrasive and I use the F - word a lot .
( My mother does n't read anything on the Internet , so I do n't have to worry about repercussions from that last confession . )
My math skills are only average .
I do not own a calculator with a graphing function .
If I 'm a lousy model minority , I 'm an even lousier stereotypical Asian woman .
The geisha and the " China doll " are deferential , obedient and demure .
Me ?
I do n’t own a kimono .
I ca n’t bat my eyes .
I cut off all my silky , ink - black hair because I got sick of people touching it .
( Do n’t touch my HAIR ! )
I even enjoy drinking beer out of the bottle and listening to loud rock music .
And for some reason I keep forgetting to acknowledge the superior rightness of men .
It just keeps slipping my mind somehow .
Yet the stereotype is pervasive .
Here ’s another one : Asian Americans will not protest mistreatment .
My mother , who looks just like a sweet little old lady , once noted how often white people cut in line in front of us .
We wo n’t protest , eh ?
Little do they know !
Once , when I was waiting for my overpriced coffee , a man pushed his way in front of me and demanded immediate service .
The clerk told him politely that she ’d be with him in a moment .
He raged about being made to wait because he was in the middle of a “ big deal ” at the office .
“ What are you doing here , then ? ” I asked .
He turned to me , his mouth hanging open .
“ Get back to the office !
You ’re critical to the big deal !
Send one of your lackeys out to pick up your coffee ! ”
When he did n’t move , I yelled , “ Go on , now ! GO ! ”
So much for cutting in line in front of a member of the model minority .
Was that too harsh ?
I prefer to think of it as forthright .
I could n't care less what most other people think of me ( with the exception of my mother ) .
When people talk about the model minority , " model " is code for never making other people feel uncomfortable about racism .
" Model " means not being like all those other troublesome people of color .
It means keeping your mouth shut and your eyes lowered .
It means smiling brightly and nodding along .
Yes , sir !
Whatever you say , sir !
It means never complaining .
Members of the model minority often are used to shame other people of color .
They can do it , why can't you ?
If you would only have those same close - knit families .
If you only valued education more .
If you only worked harder .
Racism is a thing of the past .
Holding up Asian Americans as a model divides communities of color , making it difficult for us to see our commonalities .
" Model ” too often means you do n’t have to ride in the back of the bus .
You can ride near the front of the bus , but you have to be very , very careful never to say anything about the people forced to ride in back , as writer David Mura notes .
But being silent means being complicit and I can not afford to be either .
Being the model minority means never speaking out against racism .
I once launched into a tirade against white co-workers who repeatedly used the N - word .
Perhaps the reason they felt free to use it was because they considered me to be more like them .
But after my tirade , they probably presumed I was part black .
The angry Asian American is n't a stereotype , at least not yet .
But we are out there and racism makes us angry .
Witness the popularity in the Asian American community of the ‘ Angry Little Girls ’ comic strip by cartoonist Lela Lee and the ‘ Angry Asian Man ’ by blogger Phil Yu .
Asian Americans are often overlooked in the dialogue about race in the United States .
Sometimes I think that 's because many non-Asians are not even aware that we have opinions .
We exist only on the fringe of their radar .
The stereotype of the quiet , passive , compliant model minority is extremely strong .
Non-Asian people tell me that Asian Americans are not politically minded and that we have no interest in social justice issues .
But we have voices and many of us refuse to be quiet just for the sake of conforming to the model .
Being the model minority is contrary to the values of my country .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal .
Our challenge as Americans , Asian Americans and non-Asians alike , is to protest injustice where we see it .
Our challenge is to not just exalt a model minority but create a model America that fulfills its potential and promise to all of its citizens .
As regular readers know , I think populist appeals have their place in politics , but Rod Dreher nails what 's so grating about Michelle Obama 's shtick :
It 's shot through with self - pity .
First , he quotes Byron York , following her through Ohio :
“ I know we ’re spending — I added it up for the first time — we spend between the two kids , on extracurriculars outside the classroom , we ’re spending about $ 10,000 a year on piano and dance and sports supplements and so on and so forth , ” Mrs. Obama tells the women .
“ And summer programs .
That ’s the other huge cost .
Barack is saying , ‘ Whyyyyyy are we spending that ? ’
And I ’m saying , ‘ Do you know what summer camp costs ? ’ ”
There 's a lot more lines like this one in the York piece - all fair enough , so far as they go ( it is stressful and expensive to be a Bobo parent ) , but perhaps not just the thing to say to women in a depressed blue - collar town .
And then there 's this line , from this week 's New Yorker profile :
From these bleak generalities , Obama moves into specific complaints .
Used to be , she will say , that you could count on a decent education in the neighborhood .
But now there are all these charter schools and magnet schools that you have to “ finagle ” to get into .
( Obama herself attended a magnet school , but never mind . )
Health care is out of reach ( “ Let me tell you , do n’t get sick in America ” ) , pensions are disappearing , college is too expensive , and even if you can figure out a way to go to college you wo n’t be able to recoup the cost of the degree in many of the professions for which you needed it in the first place .
“ You ’re looking at a young couple that ’s just a few years out of debt , ” Obama said .
“ See , because , we went to those good schools , and we did n’t have trust funds .
I ’m still waiting for Barack ’s trust fund .
Especially after I heard that Dick Cheney was s’posed to be a relative or something .
Give us something here ! ”
There are many sorts of populism , from the optimistic ( think Reagan , or LBJ ) to the angry and doom - ridden ( think John Edwards ) .
But a self - pitying populism , in which a Princeton - educated , upper - middle - class woman - or a wealthy woman , really ; Michelle Obama earned roughly $ 400,000 in 2005 - equates her own struggles to pay off her college loans with the woes of the working class seems like a remarkably unappealing variation on the theme .
( Like Rod , I did n't much care for Edwards ' Kingfish act , but at least he went out of his way to acknowledge both his humble beginnings and how lucky he is now . )
Not that the upper - middle class does n't have its struggles too ;
God knows I whine to my friends about how how hard I work from time to time .
But it 's mildly inappropriate to whinge about those struggles publicly , and extremely inappropriate to whine about them in the context of a political campaign .
It 's like having Judith Warner campaigning to be First Lady .

Update 9/29/2020
GTA has always been more of a New York Post sort of game , but today David Itzkoff , a ' real writer ' who works for the New York Times , attempts to take on some of the deeper aspects of immersive gameworld design in his review of GTA IV's Liberty City ... without revealing too much of his East Coast Liberal Media XBox Elite bias .
Itzkoff , who usually reviews books and movies for the Times , has put together a deep and readable article here , especially for non-gamers .
It 's much more interesting and refreshing to see a treatment like this than yet another press - release driven ' review ' .
While his ivory tower does glimmer a bit from time to time ( Who else but New Yorkers could possibly understand or appreciate this , he explains matter of factly ) , it 's never blinding , and he does give this shiny blinky ' videogame ' a serious treatment , and we always welcome that : too much public discourse about GTA is trapped in a sort of " oh but it will corrupt our children ! " loop .
In an aside , and perhaps accidentally , he even reveals what might be a hidden GTA IV cheat .
More on that later .
At the outset , Itzkoff is enthralled , like most of us , by the depth and level of detail in GTA IV 's huge NYC analog , its design , and its virtual citizens .
[ GTA IV is ] a game that has an extra layer of resonance for indigenous New Yorkers .
With all the knowledge , confidence , predispositions and prejudices we possess , we 're not only better equipped to detect the many references and insider jokes , we may even come out of the game thinking differently about the real - life New York we 've always known .
Itzkoff explores the relationship between the fake Liberty City and the real Big Apple in ways that other writers have n't yet touched .
In the article 's funniest turn , and one that 's either clever for its self - awareness and parody , or hilarious for the unawareness of same , he remarks on the disorienting disappointment when GTA does not provide an in - game version of his own real - world apartment in all its detail .
It was as if some unknown natural disaster had recently touched down and attacked only the portions of New York that I cared for most deeply .
My city -- at least , the parts of it that I thought of as my city -- no longer existed ...
Faced with this catastrophic revelation , I turned to a life of crime ...
At the urging of my human confederates , I even attempted one of Grand Theft Auto 's missions ... that required me to shoot my way through a gang of drug smugglers and steal their truckload of contraband ...
I did as I was instructed , but my heart just was n't in it .
If I truly believed in Liberty City as a functioning community , how could I open fire on my fellow simulated citizens ( even if they shot at me first ) ?
How could I tread all over the social contract in a ripped - off truck full of bootleg prescription medication ?
If the New York Times had n't told us all that irony was dead , we'd know what we were dealing with here .
If it 's sincere , perhaps Itzkoff needs a little less ... well ... latte .
Itzkoff , who wrote his piece based on a prerelease demonstration , also reveals the presence of a cheat that was at Rockstar 's disposal , which we 're going to call The Neo Cheat :
So I had my flesh - and - blood [ Rockstar ] chaperons turn on a hidden feature within their version of the game that allowed me to fly anywhere on the G.T.A. map .
It seems likely that this ' hidden feature ' is actually still tucked away in release versions of GTA IV , but as of yet , nobody 's found quite the right magic key - combination or imaginary telephone number to unlock it .
Itzkoff 's complete article , entitled A Strange City Called Home , is available for free on the NY Times website .
FASHION is a strange thing , and many fields are susceptible to it — not least , medicine .
There has , for example , been a vogue ( among commentators , if not among doctors ) to ascribe the rising number of cases of autism diagnosed over the past couple of decades to childhood vaccinations against measles , mumps and rubella .
That this is fashion rather than reality is suggested by the fact that the explanation proffered in Britain has been that such vaccines provoke an immune response that damages the nervous system , whereas Americans have blamed residual mercury in the same vaccines .
It is now pretty well established that vaccination does not create autism .
But the rise in the number of recorded cases is real enough .
In Britain , for example , the rate of diagnosis has risen from 50 per 100,000 in 1990 to 400 per 100,000 today .
That must have a cause .
And one popular hypothesis is that this cause , too , is fashion — but among doctors rather than columnists .
Demonstrating that has been difficult .
But a paper in this month 's Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology , by Dorothy Bishop and her colleagues at Oxford University , goes a long way towards doing so .
Dr Bishop reasoned it was unlikely that people now labelled autistic would , in the past , have been thought healthy , but that it was quite plausible they might have been given some other diagnosis .
With this in mind , she looked at a group who had been diagnosed as children with a particular condition that was not autism , and rediagnosed them using present - day criteria .
Her volunteers were 38 adults or teenagers who had , as children , been diagnosed as having what is known as developmental language disorder , rather than autism .
( The distinction being that although autism involves difficulties in communication it also has other symptoms , such as an inability to empathise with others . )
The rediagnosis had two steps .
The researchers interviewed the volunteers , of course .
But they also interviewed their parents .
They asked both parents and offspring questions based on modern tests for diagnosing autism .
The result was that almost a third of her volunteers looked , from the modern point of view , misclassified .
Eight fully met the modern criteria for autism .
A further four fell into what is known as the autistic spectrum , evincing signs of autism short of the full - blown syndrome .
What were particularly telling were the interviews with parents .
Earlier , similar work had explained the observations away as a change in symptoms with age , but the parents of Dr Bishop 's volunteers told stories of what are now regarded as autistic symptoms appearing in their children in their early years .
Although there is a risk of hindsight colouring such stories , many of them were so vivid that Dr Bishop is convinced they are accurate .
The upshot , subject to larger studies confirming her observations , is that Dr Bishop seems to have confirmed the cause of the recent rise of autism as being a change in the diagnostic criteria .
As a good researcher should be , she is cautious and points out that finding one cause is not proof that others are not operating .
But it now looks unlikely that there are more autistic people around than there used to be .
It is just that it is now fashionable to acknowledge their existence .

Malnutrition is a major cause of childhood death in parts of Africa
Plight of rural India
Every year 10 million children still die before their fifth birthday , 99 % of them in the developing world , according to Save the Children .
A study comparing economic performance with child mortality reveals that some countries have not translated wealth into improvements across society .
Survival is too often just a " lottery " , said Save the Children 's David Mepham .
He said that even the poorest countries can cut child mortality by following simple policies , but at the moment " a child 's chance of making it to its fifth birthday depends on the country or community it is born into " .
Lagging behind
Angola comes at the bottom of a new " Wealth and Survival " league table drawn up by the UN Development Programme ( UNDP ) .
The figures for child mortality in India are shocking
Shireen Miller

Profile : Sierra Leone slum medic
There are few countries in the world where there are such stark wealth contrasts as there are between the wealth of oil - rich coastal strip around the Angolan capital Luanda , and the war - ravaged interior .
UNDP statisticians calculate that more than half of the babies who die in Angola could be saved were the country to spread its wealth more fairly .
Some of the poorest countries in the world - Nepal , Malawi , Tanzania and Bangladesh - are among the top ten performers in this index , showing success in cutting mortality .
But India , the fastest growing economy in South Asia , lags well behind its poorer neighbours .
Some states in India , including Orissa , Rajasthan and Bihar , have child and maternal mortality rates that are among the worst in the world .
Limited bonuses
On a visit to rural Orissa , it was not difficult to see why child survival is a matter of chance .
It can take days for villagers to reach medical help , and travel may involve boats or auto - rickshaws .
Dr Baharudat Mishra said that although the government did give a bonus to doctors to work in the outlying regions , it is not enough to entice many , especially compared to the salaries that can be earned in the new technology sector .
" If a doctor does not have a residence with water supply or electricity , and there is no vehicle to reach the affected villages , then naturally obstructions will come up , " he said .
" The figures for child mortality in India are shocking , " said Shireen Miller , from Save the Children India .
" They are close to sub -Saharan Africa , and one does ask that if we can make such rapid development economically then why can we not do the same socially ?
" And in fact are we actually a developed country if we still have hundreds of thousands of babies dying and starving ? "
' Wake - up call '
But government health officials in Orissa blamed ancient customs and practices in the villages , such as starving babies at birth and giving them cold baths , for the poor mortality rates .
They said that where they have been able to train traditional birth attendants , many more babies and mothers do survive .
Without significant improvements , the world will not be able to fulfil one of the key Millennium Development Goals of improving child mortality in time for the target date of 2015 .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the Save the Children report is a development " wake - up call " , and that the world " can and must do more " .
Selling Obama Door to Door Obama Supporters Kick Off Oregon Campaign
IN A RAINBOW of rain gear , hundreds of Barack Obama supporters crammed into a vacant Wild Oats grocery store on SE Division Saturday morning , March 29 , to get ready to pound the pavement for their favored presidential candidate .
US Representative Earl Blumenauer — in a T - shirt instead of his trademark bowtie — riled up the crowd , there for the official campaign headquarters opening , and the kickoff of this urgent campaign .
There are just over seven weeks to go before Oregon 's primary on May 20 .
" Oregon can put us over the top ! " Blumenauer said .
Obliquely referencing the protracted battle for the Democratic presidential nomination , Blumenauer called on the volunteers to work hard so Obama wins big in Oregon , which he says will " stop the sort of back and forth , and move [ Obama ] forward to winning the election in the fall , which is what this is all about . "
The sort of door - to - door canvassing volunteers were poised to do that day — hail be damned — " is not just about getting the margin we need in this state , " he said .
Getting as many individual votes for Obama will " make a punctuation point that gets the maximum number of delegates possible .
That 's what 's going to make the difference with the superdelegates .
You can bring them into the column with your efforts . "
Blumenauer stepped aside to make way for Jan Schakowsky , a Democratic congresswoman from Obama 's home state of Illinois , where she 's worked alongside the senator for years .
" I saw him work his magic , " she said .
" He would bring Republicans to the table . "
If Obama is elected , she said , the moment he replaces George W. Bush and takes the oath of office , " the narrative instantly changes , around the world and here at home .
" Oregon really matters , " an energetic Schakowsky told the crowd .
" We can win big , " she said , by utilizing the " Cadillac " of voter contact , " face to face and door to door . "
Then the hundreds of volunteers — at least 500 at this location , and another 500 around the state that day — broke into groups organized by Portland 's quadrants to learn the basics about canvassing , before heading out the door to tell their neighbors why they love the senator from Illinois .
At the end of the day , they were slated to return for a potluck party celebrating their efforts .

The first two installments combined awesome gameplay with a compelling storyline , something very few franchises have ever managed to achieve .
But it ’s been over a decade since Half - Life 2 was released .
And here we are still waiting .
Half Life Series Rumor Mill
Rumors of a third installment first appeared in 2012 .
Back then it was said that the big reveal would be made at that year ’s E3 .
Coincidentally , Game of Thrones fans were also waiting for George R.R. Martin to release the next novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series that year .
Fortunately , Mr. Martin delivered and the books have gone on to be a hit television series produced by HBO .
If only Half - Life fans could be so lucky .
Everything ’s been speculated about HL3 – from survival horror elements to it being an open - world game .
But in all in these years , we have n’t heard anything official nor definite Valve .
Some have even accused the company of intentionally leading people with false leaks .
Take this comment by Reddit user digital_refugee .
“ The biggest indicator so far is that Valve picked up merchandise again …
Gives credence to all other leaks which were most certainly intentionally placed to test for reactions .
Alas , they made leaks intentionally cringy to retain plausible deniability and test public reactions without actually saying anything officially . ”
Fan Game
A glimmer on this otherwise gloomy horizon is Project Borealis .
This fan - made game is based on the unofficial Half - Life 3 plot synopsis by Marc Laidlaw .
He is a former Valve writer who worked on the series .
You can watch what these amateur developers have done so far here .
Still , it ’s not HL3 .
Another Reddit commenter stressed on the fact that it wo n’t be a proper Half - Life game if it is n’t made by Valve .
But given the potential of Project Borealis , the devs behind it could be employed by the company for access to full resources .
Whether it ’s episode three or a third game , we do n’t know .
Still , here ’s hoping that we have n’t seen the last of Gordon Freeman and the Half - Life series .

Why the full pixel gap between characters ?
Did it all get too mushy otherwise ?
You 're currently using two pixels per character ( including spacing ) , whereas you could shrink it down to only one and a third .

I think the main problem I have with viewing these is that my red and green elements are waaaay brighter than my blue , so usually I can't see the right column of pixels at all .
Multiplying the whole image by ( 77,80,255 ) in 0 -255 space made it much easier for me , though obviously the actual colour would depend on your monitor and its calibration .

Knut is no longer the cuddly cub who won German hearts
Footage of Knut
Germany 's celebrity polar bear Knut has triggered a new controversy by fishing out 10 live carp from his moat and killing them in front of visitors .
Critics say Berlin Zoo should not have put live fish inside Knut 's enclosure .
But German media report that the carp were put there to eat up algae .
There is speculation that hand - reared Knut killed the carp just for fun .
A new polar bear cub - Flocke - made her public debut at Nuremberg Zoo on Tuesday , shown live on television .
The zoo is expecting up to 25,000 visitors daily , eager to see Flocke ( German for " snowflake " ) .
She has also been hand - reared , because the zoo feared her mother might harm her .
Flocke threatens to eclipse Knut 's popularity
Footage of Flocke
But the zoo has said it wants to avoid any repetition of " Knut mania " .
Knut was rejected by his mother , but Berlin Zoo decided to hand - rear him , in a controversial move .
There has been heated debate about whether cubs rejected by their mothers should be saved or whether nature should be allowed to run its course .
Knut is now more than a year old and has grown overweight .
The Frankfurter Allgemeine news website reports that Knut " senselessly murdered the carp " , fishing them out , playing with them and then leaving the remains .
Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
Here , CNN's Harris Whitbeck describes a recent Mexican drug raid that he accompanied .
This young boy played music that authorities said was a warning from drug lords that they were watching .
CULIACAN , Mexico ( CNN ) --
The boy looked to be about 12 or 13 years old .
Chubby , he struggled a bit with his bicycle as he rode to where we stood .
He had a slight smirk as he played a tape that blared music from speakers tied to his bike .
The tune was an ode to Edgar Guzman , the son of a local drug kingpin who was killed by a rival drug gang in a shootout May 10 .
It was a message from the cartel to the cops , said Gen.
Jose Antonio Guzman , the Mexican police commander heading up a raid on a house this day .
The drug lords had sent the boy to let everyone know they were watching .
It was a chilling moment in a city that has gained a reputation for being one of the most dangerous in Mexico .
Watch Mexican cops raid drug safehouse »
Pitched battles between rival drug gangs , assassinations of police officers and ambushes on city streets have made life hell for many residents of Culiacan .
A city of more than 600,000 people , Culiacan is on one of the nation 's main highways along the west coast .
Map : See where Culiacan is located »
Shortly after the young boy was paraded in front of us , dozens of armed police stormed a house , uncovering high - powered rifles and other weapons , sophisticated communications equipment and a substance believed to be a base used to make methamphetamine sold on the streets .
A man at the house fled over a rooftop before he could be detained .
It was a small victory in what authorities say is a long and bloody battle .
" I feel we are making progress , " said Guzman , the federal police commander .
" Let 's see how long it lasts . "
Guzman is leading the fight in Mexico's war against drug cartels in Culiacan , the capital of the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa that has become a key battleground about 600 miles from the U.S. border .
Authorities say an estimated 300 tons of cocaine passes through Mexico on its way from Colombia to the United States each year .
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says that about 90 percent of all cocaine that comes into the United States passes through Mexico .
It also says Mexico has become the largest foreign provider of meth to the United States , supplying about 80 percent of the meth consumed in the States .
It 's no wonder that the pitched fight for control of the lucrative drug trade has become more intense as Mexican law enforcement has tried to put the squeeze on drug lords .
" This has become a turf war between rival gangs , " Guzman said .
" They are trying to gain control of Sinaloa state and are arming and rearming themselves to fight their enemies . "
The battle against the cartels intensified last year .
Shortly after taking office in January 2007 , President Felipe Calderon vowed to take more aggressive action against drug traffickers .
He sent thousands of military and federal police to fight them in the states where the cartels waged the most influence , mostly in central and northern Mexico .
Federal troops were sent in because , government sources say , local and state police in many regions in northern Mexico tip off drug gangs to raids , provide protection to them and fail to arrest gang members .
How many local police might be tied to the cartels ?
" A significant amount that is unacceptable to many , including the Mexican government , " one U.S. anti-narcotics official said on condition of anonymity .
The government 's crackdown has met a vicious response : Authorities say more than 1,000 people -- including gang members , police and civilians -- have been killed in drug - related violence in Mexico since the start of this year , primarily in the northern and central parts of the country .
Several high - level and mid-level federal police officers have been shot and killed , and the killings have begun to strike closer to home .
One of the most shocking took place May 8 , when Mexico 's highest - ranking federal police officer , Edgar Millan , was gunned down outside his home .
At least 170 local police officers have been killed , some who were doing their jobs and others who were involved with drug gangs and killed by rivals , authorities say .
Other police have resigned out of fear for their lives .
Some analysts say the violence is a reaction by drug lords feeling the heat from the federal government .
Others say that as the drug cartels are squeezed by the government , they 've begun fighting rival cartels to preserve and control their turf .
The U.S. counter - narcotics official said the violence wo n't end any time soon .
" This will be a muddy , bloody uphill climb , " he said , adding that Calderon " knew the cancer had to be cut out before it cut him down . "
The United States is supplying the Mexican government with millions of dollars in support and high - tech equipment .
The general in charge of federal police in Culiacan says time will tell whether all the efforts have been successful .
" If we can keep the violence down for the next three months , I 'll feel satisfied , " Guzman said .
But some analysts feel the government 's head - on approach is misguided .
They say military or police action will not be enough to curb the cartels in Mexico .
Samuel Gonzalez , a former high - level anti-organized crime official , says authorities need to go after the cartels ' financial networks .
" If you fight them as the government is doing right now but do n't take all their businesses down , they will just use all their money to bring more violence against the government , " said Gonzalez , who now works as a security analyst in Mexico .
On the ground , the foot soldiers fighting on behalf of the government are a bit more optimistic .
Raids like the one on the safe house that netted weapons and a small amount of meth base happen at least two to three times a week .
They might look small , police say , but they are still victories .
All About Felipe Calderon • Mexico • Organized Crime
It is always dangerous to venture an opinion as to why a problem is hard ( cf. Clarke ’s first law ) , but I ’m going to stick my neck out on this one , because ( a ) it seems that there has been a lot of effort expended on this problem recently , sometimes perhaps without full awareness of the main difficulties , and ( b ) I would love to be proved wrong on this opinion :-) .
The global regularity problem for Navier - Stokes is of course a Clay Millennium Prize problem and it would be redundant to describe it again here .
I will note , however , that it asks for existence of global smooth solutions to a Cauchy problem for a nonlinear PDE .
There are countless other global regularity results of this type for many ( but certainly not all ) other nonlinear PDE ; for instance , global regularity is known for Navier - Stokes in two spatial dimensions rather than three ( this result essentially dates all the way back to Leray ’s thesis in 1933 ! ) .
Why is the three - dimensional Navier - Stokes global regularity problem considered so hard , when global regularity for so many other equations is easy , or at least achievable ?
( For this post , I am only considering the global regularity problem for Navier - Stokes , from a purely mathematical viewpoint , and in the precise formulation given by the Clay Institute ; I will not discuss at all the question as to what implications a rigorous solution ( either positive or negative ) to this problem would have for physics , computational fluid dynamics , or other disciplines , as these are beyond my area of expertise .
But if anyone qualified in these fields wants to make a comment along these lines , by all means do so . )
The standard response to this question is turbulence – the behaviour of three - dimensional Navier - Stokes equations at fine scales is much more nonlinear ( and hence unstable ) than at coarse scales .
I would phrase the obstruction slightly differently , as supercriticality .
Or more precisely , all of the globally controlled quantities for Navier - Stokes evolution which we are aware of ( and we are not aware of very many ) are either supercritical with respect to scaling , which means that they are much weaker at controlling fine - scale behaviour than controlling coarse - scale behaviour , or they are non-coercive , which means that they do not really control the solution at all , either at coarse scales or at fine .
( I ’ll define these terms more precisely later . )
At present , all known methods for obtaining global smooth solutions to a ( deterministic ) nonlinear PDE Cauchy problem require either
Exact and explicit solutions ( or at least an exact , explicit transformation to a significantly simpler PDE or ODE ) ; Perturbative hypotheses ( e.g. small data , data close to a special solution , or more generally a hypothesis which involves an somewhere ) ; or One or more globally controlled quantities ( such as the total energy ) which are both coercive and either critical or subcritical .
( Note that the presence of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 3 ) are currently necessary conditions for a global regularity result , but far from sufficient ; otherwise , papers on the global regularity problem for various nonlinear PDEs would be substantially shorter :-) .
In particular , there have been many good , deep , and highly non-trivial papers recently on global regularity for Navier - Stokes , but they all assume either ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) via additional hypotheses on the data or solution .
For instance , in recent years we have seen good results on global regularity assuming ( 2 ) , as well as good results on global regularity assuming ( 3 ) ; a complete bibilography of recent results is unfortunately too lengthy to be given here . )
The Navier - Stokes global regularity problem for arbitrary large smooth data lacks all of these three ingredients .
Reinstating ( 2 ) is impossible without changing the statement of the problem , or adding some additional hypotheses ; also , in perturbative situations the Navier - Stokes equation evolves almost linearly , while in the non-perturbative setting it behaves very nonlinearly , so there is basically no chance of a reduction of the non-perturbative case to the perturbative one unless one comes up with a highly nonlinear transform to achieve this ( e.g. a naive scaling argument cannot possibly work ) .
Thus , one is left with only three possible strategies if one wants to solve the full problem :
Solve the Navier - Stokes equation exactly and explicitly ( or at least transform this equation exactly and explicitly to a simpler equation ) ;
Discover a new globally controlled quantity which is both coercive and either critical or subcritical ; or Discover a new method which yields global smooth solutions even in the absence of the ingredients ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) above .
For the rest of this post I refer to these strategies as “ Strategy 1 ” , “ Strategy 2 ” , and “ Strategy 3 ” .
Much effort has been expended here , especially on Strategy 3 , but the supercriticality of the equation presents a truly significant obstacle which already defeats all known methods .
Strategy 1 is probably hopeless ; the last century of experience has shown that ( with the very notable exception of completely integrable systems , of which the Navier - Stokes equations is not an example ) most nonlinear PDE , even those arising from physics , do not enjoy explicit formulae for solutions from arbitrary data ( although it may well be the case that there are interesting exact solutions from special ( e.g. symmetric ) data ) .
Strategy 2 may have a little more hope ; after all , the Poincaré conjecture became solvable ( though still very far from trivial ) after Perelman introduced a new globally controlled quantity for Ricci flow ( the Perelman entropy ) which turned out to be both coercive and critical .
( See also my exposition of this topic . )
But we are still not very good at discovering new globally controlled quantities ; to quote Klainerman , “ the discovery of any new bound , stronger than that provided by the energy , for general solutions of any of our basic physical equations would have the significance of a major event ” ( emphasis mine ) .
I will return to Strategy 2 later , but let us now discuss Strategy 3 .
The first basic observation is that the Navier - Stokes equation , like many other of our basic model equations , obeys a scale invariance : specifically , given any scaling parameter , and any smooth velocity field solving the Navier - Stokes equations for some time T , one can form a new velocity field to the Navier - Stokes equation up to time , by the formula
( Strictly speaking , this scaling invariance is only present as stated in the absence of an external force , and with the non-periodic domain rather than the periodic domain .
One can adapt the arguments here to these other settings with some minor effort , the key point being that an approximate scale invariance can play the role of a perfect scale invariance in the considerations below .
The pressure field gets rescaled too , to , but we will not need to study the pressure here .
The viscosity remains unchanged . )
We shall think of the rescaling parameter as being large ( e.g. ) .
One should then think of the transformation from u to as a kind of “ magnifying glass ” , taking fine - scale behaviour of u and matching it with an identical ( but rescaled , and slowed down ) coarse - scale behaviour of .
The point of this magnifying glass is that it allows us to treat both fine - scale and coarse - scale behaviour on an equal footing , by identifying both types of behaviour with something that goes on at a fixed scale ( e.g. the unit scale ) .
Observe that the scaling suggests that fine - scale behaviour should play out on much smaller time scales than coarse - scale behaviour ( T versus ) .
Thus , for instance , if a unit - scale solution does something funny at time 1 , then the rescaled fine - scale solution will exhibit something similarly funny at spatial scales and at time .
Blowup can occur when the solution shifts its energy into increasingly finer and finer scales , thus evolving more and more rapidly and eventually reaching a singularity in which the scale in both space and time on which the bulk of the evolution is occuring has shrunk to zero .
In order to prevent blowup , therefore , we must arrest this motion of energy from coarse scales ( or low frequencies ) to fine scales ( or high frequencies ) .
( There are many ways in which to make these statements rigorous , for instance using Littlewood - Paley theory , which we will not discuss here , preferring instead to leave terms such as “ coarse - scale ” and “ fine - scale ” undefined . )
Now , let us take an arbitrary large - data smooth solution to Navier - Stokes , and let it evolve over a very long period of time [ 0 , T ) , assuming that it stays smooth except possibly at time T .
At very late times of the evolution , such as those near to the final time T , there is no reason to expect the solution to resemble the initial data any more ( except in perturbative regimes , but these are not available in the arbitrary large - data case ) .
Indeed , the only control we are likely to have on the late - time stages of the solution are those provided by globally controlled quantities of the evolution .
Barring a breakthrough in Strategy 2 , we only have two really useful globally controlled ( i.e. bounded even for very large T ) quantities :
The maximum kinetic energy ; and
; and The cumulative energy dissipation .
Indeed , the energy conservation law implies that these quantities are both bounded by the initial kinetic energy E , which could be large ( we are assuming our data could be large ) but is at least finite by hypothesis .
The above two quantities are coercive , in the sense that control of these quantities imply that the solution , even at very late times , stays in a bounded region of some function space .
However , this is basically the only thing we know about the solution at late times ( other than that it is smooth until time T , but this is a qualitative assumption and gives no bounds ) .
So , unless there is a breakthrough in Strategy 2 , we cannot rule out the worst - case scenario that the solution near time T is essentially an arbitrary smooth divergence - free vector field which is bounded both in kinetic energy and in cumulative energy dissipation by E .
In particular , near time T the solution could be concentrating the bulk of its energy into fine - scale behaviour , say at some spatial scale .
( Of course , cumulative energy dissipation is not a function of a single time , but is an integral over all time ; let me suppress this fact for the sake of the current discussion . )
Now , let us take our magnifying glass and blow up this fine - scale behaviour by to create a coarse - scale solution to Navier - Stokes .
Given that the fine - scale solution could ( in the worst - case scenario ) be as bad as an arbitrary smooth vector field with kinetic energy and cumulative energy dissipation at most E , the rescaled unit - scale solution can be as bad as an arbitrary smooth vector field with kinetic energy and cumulative energy dissipation at most , as a simple change - of - variables shows .
Note that the control given by our two key quantities has worsened by a factor of ; because of this worsening , we say that these quantities are supercritical – they become increasingly useless for controlling the solution as one moves to finer and finer scales .
This should be contrasted with critical quantities ( such as the energy for two - dimensional Navier - Stokes ) , which are invariant under scaling and thus control all scales equally well ( or equally poorly ) , and subcritical quantities , control of which becomes increasingly powerful at fine scales ( and increasingly useless at very coarse scales ) .
Now , suppose we know of examples of unit - scale solutions whose kinetic energy and cumulative energy dissipation are as large as , but which can shift their energy to the next finer scale , e.g. a half - unit scale , in a bounded amount O ( 1 ) of time .
Given the previous discussion , we cannot rule out the possibility that our rescaled solution behaves like this example .
Undoing the scaling , this means that we cannot rule out the possibility that the original solution will shift its energy from spatial scale to spatial scale in time .
If this bad scenario repeates over and over again , then convergence of geometric series shows that the solution may in fact blow up in finite time .
Note that the bad scenarios do not have to happen immediately after each other ( the self - similar blowup scenario ) ; the solution could shift from scale to , wait for a little bit ( in rescaled time ) to “ mix up ” the system and return to an “ arbitrary ” ( and thus potentially “ worst - case ” ) state , and then shift to , and so forth .
While the cumulative energy dissipation bound can provide a little bit of a bound on how long the system can “ wait ” in such a “ holding pattern ” , it is far too weak to prevent blowup in finite time .
To put it another way , we have no rigorous , deterministic way of preventing Maxwell ’s demon from plaguing the solution at increasingly frequent ( in absolute time ) intervals , invoking various rescalings of the above scenario to nudge the energy of the solution into increasingly finer scales , until blowup is attained .
Thus , in order for Strategy 3 to be successful , we basically need to rule out the scenario in which unit - scale solutions with arbitrarily large kinetic energy and cumulative energy dissipation shift their energy to the next highest scale .
But every single analytic technique we are aware of ( except for those involving exact solutions , i.e. Strategy 1 ) requires at least one bound on the size of solution in order to have any chance at all .
Basically , one needs at least one bound in order to control all nonlinear errors – and any strategy we know of which does not proceed via exact solutions will have at least one nonlinear error that needs to be controlled .
The only thing we have here is a bound on the scale of the solution , which is not a bound in the sense that a norm of the solution is bounded ; and so we are stuck .
To summarise , any argument which claims to yield global regularity for Navier - Stokes via Strategy 3 must inevitably ( via the scale invariance ) provide a radically new method for providing non-trivial control of nonlinear unit - scale solutions of arbitrary large size for unit time , which looks impossible without new breakthroughs on Strategy 1 or Strategy 2 .
( There are a couple of loopholes that one might try to exploit : one can instead try to refine the control on the “ waiting time ” or “ amount of mixing ” between each shift to the next finer scale , or try to exploit the fact that each such shift requires a certain amount of energy dissipation , but one can use similar scaling arguments to the preceding to show that these types of loopholes cannot be exploited without a new bound along the lines of Strategy 2 , or some sort of argument which works for arbitrarily large data at unit scales . )
To rephrase in an even more jargon - heavy manner : the “ energy surface ” on which the dynamics is known to live in , can be quotiented by the scale invariance .
After this quotienting , the solution can stray arbitrarily far from the origin even at unit scales , and so we lose all control of the solution unless we have exact control ( Strategy 1 ) or can significantly shrink the energy surface ( Strategy 2 ) .
The above was a general critique of Strategy 3 .
Now I ’ll turn to some known specific attempts to implement Strategy 3 , and discuss where the difficulty lies with these :
Using weaker or approximate notions of solution ( e.g. viscosity solutions , penalised solutions , super - or sub- solutions , etc. ) .
This type of approach dates all the way back to Leray .
It has long been known that by weakening the nonlinear portion of Navier - Stokes ( e.g. taming the nonlinearity ) , or strengthening the linear portion ( e.g. introducing hyperdissipation ) , or by performing a discretisation or regularisation of spatial scales , or by relaxing the notion of a “ solution ” , one can get global solutions to approximate Navier - Stokes equations .
The hope is then to take limits and recover a smooth solution , as opposed to a mere global weak solution , which was already constructed by Leray for Navier - Stokes all the way back in 1933 .
But in order to ensure the limit is smooth , we need convergence in a strong topology .
In fact , the same type of scaling arguments used before basically require that we obtain convergence in either a critical or subcritical topology .
Absent a breakthrough in Strategy 2 , the only type of convergences we have are in very rough – in particular , in supercritical – topologies .
Attempting to upgrade such convergence to critical or subcritical topologies is the qualitative analogue of the quantitative problems discussed earlier , and ultimately faces the same problem ( albeit in very different language ) of trying to control unit - scale solutions of arbitrarily large size .
Working in a purely qualitative setting ( using limits , etc. ) instead of a quantitative one ( using estimates , etc. ) can disguise these problems ( and , unfortunately , can lead to errors if limits are manipulated carelessly ) , but the qualitative formalism does not magically make these problems disappear .
Note that weak solutions are already known to be badly behaved for the closely related Euler equation .
More generally , by recasting the problem in a sufficiently abstract formalism ( e.g. formal limits of near - solutions ) , there are a number of ways to create an abstract object which could be considered as a kind of generalised solution , but the moment one tries to establish actual control on the regularity of this generalised solution one will encounter all the supercriticality difficulties mentioned earlier .
Iterative methods ( e.g. contraction mapping principle , Nash - Moser iteration , power series , etc. ) in a function space .
These methods are perturbative , and require something to be small : either the data has to be small , the nonlinearity has to be small , or the time of existence desired has to be small .
These methods are excellent for constructing local solutions for large data , or global solutions for small data , but cannot handle global solutions for large data ( running into the same problems as any other Strategy 3 approach ) .
These approaches are also typically rather insensitive to the specific structure of the equation , which is already a major warning sign since one can easily construct ( rather artificial ) systems similar to Navier - Stokes for which blowup is known to occur .
The optimal perturbative result is probably very close to that established by Koch - Tataru , for reasons discussed in that paper .
Exploiting blowup criteria .
Perturbative theory can yield some highly non-trivial blowup criteria – that certain norms of the solution must diverge if the solution is to blow up .
For instance , a celebrated result of Beale - Kato - Majda shows that the maximal vorticity must have a divergent time integral at the blowup point .
However , all such blowup criteria are subcritical or critical in nature , and thus , barring a breakthrough in Strategy 2 , the known globally controlled quantities cannot be used to reach a contradiction .
Scaling arguments similar to those given above show that perturbative methods cannot achieve a supercritical blowup criterion .
Asymptotic analysis of the blowup point (s ) .
Another proposal is to rescale the solution near a blowup point and take some sort of limit , and then continue the analysis until a contradiction ensues .
This type of approach is useful in many other contexts ( for instance , in understanding Ricci flow ) .
However , in order to actually extract a useful limit ( in particular , one which still solves Navier - Stokes in a strong sense , and does collapse to the trivial solution ) , one needs to uniformly control all rescalings of the solution – or in other words , one needs a breakthrough in Strategy 2 .
Another major difficulty with this approach is that blowup can occur not just at one point , but can conceivably blow up on a one - dimensional set ; this is another manifestation of supercriticality .
Analysis of a minimal blowup solution .
This is a strategy , initiated by Bourgain , which has recently been very successful in establishing large data global regularity for a variety of equations with a critical conserved quantity , namely to assume for contradiction that a blowup solution exists , and then extract a minimal blowup solution which minimises the conserved quantity .
This strategy ( which basically pushes the perturbative theory to its natural limit ) seems set to become the standard method for dealing with large data critical equations .
It has the appealing feature that there is enough compactness ( or almost periodicity ) in the minimal blowup solution ( once one quotients out by the scaling symmetry ) that one can begin to use subcritical and supercritical conservation laws and monotonicity formulae as well ( see my survey on this topic ) .
Unfortunately , as the strategy is currently understood , it does not seem to be directly applicable to a supercritical situation ( unless one simply assumes that some critical norm is globally bounded ) because it is impossible , in view of the scale invariance , to minimise a non-scale - invariant quantity .
Abstract approaches ( avoiding the use of properties specific to the Navier - Stokes equation ) .
At its best , abstraction can efficiently organise and capture the key difficulties of a problem , placing the problem in a framework which allows for a direct and natural resolution of these difficulties without being distracted by irrelevant concrete details .
( Kato ’s semigroup method is a good example of this in nonlinear PDE ; regrettably for this discussion , it is limited to subcritical situations . )
At its worst , abstraction conceals the difficulty within some subtle notation or concept ( e.g. in various types of convergence to a limit ) , thus incurring the risk that the difficulty is “ magically ” avoided by an inconspicuous error in the abstract manipulations .
An abstract approach which manages to breezily ignore the supercritical nature of the problem thus looks very suspicious .
More substantively , there are many equations which enjoy a coercive conservation law yet still can exhibit finite time blowup ( e.g. the mass - critical focusing NLS equation ) ; an abstract approach thus would have to exploit some subtle feature of Navier - Stokes which is not present in all the examples in which blowup is known to be possible .
Such a feature is unlikely to be discovered abstractly before it is first discovered concretely ; the field of PDE has proven to be the type of mathematics where progress generally starts in the concrete and then flows to the abstract , rather than vice versa .
If we abandon Strategy 1 and Strategy 3 , we are thus left with Strategy 2 – discovering new bounds , stronger than those provided by the ( supercritical ) energy .
This is not a priori impossible , but there is a huge gap between simply wishing for a new bound and actually discovering and then rigorously establishing one .
Simply sticking in the existing energy bounds into the Navier - Stokes equation and seeing what comes out will provide a few more bounds , but they will all be supercritical , as a scaling argument quickly reveals .
The only other way we know of to create global non-perturbative deterministic bounds is to discover a new conserved or monotone quantity .
In the past , when such quantities have been discovered , they have always been connected either to geometry ( symplectic , Riemmanian , complex , etc. ) , to physics , or to some consistently favourable ( defocusing ) sign in the nonlinearity ( or in various “ curvatures ” in the system ) .
There appears to be very little usable geometry in the equation ; on the one hand , the Euclidean structure enters the equation via the diffusive term and by the divergence - free nature of the vector field , but the nonlinearity is instead describing transport by the velocity vector field , which is basically just an arbitrary volume - preserving infinitesimal diffeomorphism ( and in particular does not respect the Euclidean structure at all ) .
One can try to quotient out by this diffeomorphism ( i.e. work in material coordinates ) but there are very few geometric invariants left to play with when one does so .
( In the case of the Euler equations , the vorticity vector field is preserved modulo this diffeomorphism , as observed for instance by Li , but this invariant is very far from coercive , being almost purely topological in nature . )
The Navier - Stokes equation , being a system rather than a scalar equation , also appears to have almost no favourable sign properties , in particular ruling out the type of bounds which the maximum principle or similar comparison principles can give .
This leaves physics , but apart from the energy , it is not clear if there are any physical quantities of fluids which are deterministically monotone .
( Things look better on the stochastic level , in which the laws of thermodynamics might play a role , but the Navier - Stokes problem , as defined by the Clay institute , is deterministic , and so we have Maxwell ’s demon to contend with . )
It would of course be fantastic to obtain a fourth source of non-perturbative controlled quantities , not arising from geometry , physics , or favourable signs , but this looks somewhat of a long shot at present .
Indeed given the turbulent , unstable , and chaotic nature of Navier - Stokes , it is quite conceivable that in fact no reasonable globally controlled quantities exist beyond that which arise from the energy .
Of course , given how hard it is to show global regularity , one might try instead to establish finite time blowup instead ( this also is acceptable for the Millennium prize ) .
Unfortunately , even though the Navier - Stokes equation is known to be very unstable , it is not clear at all how to pass from this to a rigorous demonstration of a blowup solution .
All the rigorous finite time blowup results ( as opposed to mere instability results ) that I am aware of rely on one or more of the following ingredients :
Exact blowup solutions ( or at least an exact transformation to a significantly simpler PDE or ODE , for which blowup can be established ) ;
An ansatz for a blowup solution ( or approximate solution ) , combined with some nonlinear stability theory for that ansatz ; A comparison principle argument , dominating the solution by another object which blows up in finite time , taking the solution with it ; or An indirect argument , constructing a functional of the solution which must attain an impossible value in finite time ( e.g. a quantity which is manifestly non-negative for smooth solutions , but must become negative in finite time ) .
It may well be that there is some exotic symmetry reduction which gives ( 1 ) , but no - one has located any good exactly solvable special case of Navier - Stokes ( in fact , those which have been found , are known to have global smooth solutions ) .
( 2 ) is problematic for two reasons : firstly , we do not have a good ansatz for a blowup solution , but perhaps more importantly it seems hopeless to establish a stability theory for any such ansatz thus created , as this problem is essentially a more difficult version of the global regularity problem , and in particular subject to the main difficulty , namely controlling the highly nonlinear behaviour at fine scales .
( One of the ironies in pursuing method ( 2 ) is that in order to establish rigorous blowup in some sense , one must first establish rigorous stability in some other ( renormalised ) sense . )
Method ( 3 ) would require a comparison principle , which as noted before appears to be absent for the non-scalar Navier - Stokes equations .
Method ( 4 ) suffers from the same problem , ultimately coming back to the “ Strategy 2 ” problem that we have virtually no globally monotone quantities in this system to play with ( other than energy monotonicity , which clearly looks insufficient by itself ) .
Obtaining a new type of mechanism to force blowup other than ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) above would be quite revolutionary , not just for Navier - Stokes ; but I am unaware of even any proposals in these directions , though perhaps topological methods might have some effectiveness .
So , after all this negativity , do I have any positive suggestions for how to solve this problem ?
My opinion is that Strategy 1 is impossible , and Strategy 2 would require either some exceptionally good intuition from physics , or else an incredible stroke of luck .
Which leaves Strategy 3 ( and indeed , I think one of the main reasons why the Navier - Stokes problem is interesting is that it forces us to create a Strategy 3 technique ) .
Given how difficult this strategy seems to be , as discussed above , I only have some extremely tentative and speculative thoughts in this direction , all of which I would classify as “ blue - sky ” long shots :
Work with ensembles of data , rather than a single initial datum .
All of our current theory for deterministic evolution equations deals only with a single solution from a single initial datum .
It may be more effective to work with parameterised familes of data and solutions , or perhaps probability measures ( e.g. Gibbs measures or other invariant measures ) .
One obvious partial result to shoot for is to try to establish global regularity for generic large data rather than all large data ; in other words , acknowledge that Maxwell ’s demon might exist , but show that the probability of it actually intervening is very small .
The problem is that we have virtually no tools for dealing with generic ( average - case ) data other than by treating all ( worst - case ) data ; the enemy is that the Navier - Stokes flow itself might have some perverse entropy - reducing property which somehow makes the average case drift towards ( or at least recur near ) the worst case over long periods of time .
This is incredibly unlikely to be the truth , but we have no tools to prevent it from happening at present .
Work with a much simpler ( but still supercritical ) toy model .
The Navier - Stokes model is parabolic , which is nice , but is complicated in many other ways , being relatively high - dimensional and also non-scalar in nature .
It may make sense to work with other , simplified models which still contain the key difficulty that the only globally controlled quantities are supercritical .
Examples include the Katz - Pavlovic dyadic model for the Euler equations ( for which blowup can be demonstrated by a monotonicity argument ; see this survey for more details ) , or the spherically symmetric defocusing supercritical nonlinear wave equation .
Develop non-perturbative tools to control deterministic non-integrable dynamical systems .
Throughout this post we have been discussing PDEs , but actually there are similar issues arising in the nominally simpler context of finite - dimensional dynamical systems ( ODEs ) .
Except in perturbative contexts ( such as the neighbourhood of a fixed point or invariant torus ) , the long - time evolution of a dynamical system for deterministic data is still largely only controllable by the classical tools of exact solutions , conservation laws and monotonicity formulae ; a discovery of a new and effective tool for this purpose would be a major breakthrough .
One natural place to start is to better understand the long - time , non-perturbative dynamics of the classical three - body problem , for which there are still fundamental unsolved questions .
Establish really good bounds for critical or nearly - critical problems .
Recently , I showed that having a very good bound for a critical equation essentially implies that one also has a global regularity result for a slightly supercritical equation .
The idea is to use a monotonicity formula which does weaken very slightly as one passes to finer and finer scales , but such that each such passage to a finer scale costs a significant amount of monotonicity ; since there is only a bounded amount of monotonicity to go around , it turns out that the latter effect just barely manages to overcome the former in my equation to recover global regularity ( though by doing so , the bounds worsen from polynomial in the critical case to double exponential in my logarithmically supercritical case ) .
I severely doubt that my method can push to non-logarithmically supercritical equations , but it does illustrate that having very strong bounds at the critical level may lead to some modest progress on the problem .
Try a topological method .
This is a special case of ( 1 ) .
It may well be that a primarily topological argument may be used either to construct solutions , or to establish blowup ; there are some precedents for this type of construction in elliptic theory .
Such methods are very global by nature , and thus not restricted to perturbative or nearly - linear regimes .
However , there is no obvious topology here ( except possibly for that generated by the vortex filaments ) and as far as I know , there is not even a “ proof - of - concept ” version of this idea for any evolution equation .
So this is really more of a wish than any sort of concrete strategy .
Understand pseudorandomness .
This is an incredibly vague statement ; but part of the difficulty with this problem , which also exists in one form or another in many other famous problems ( e.g. Riemann hypothesis , , , twin prime and Goldbach conjectures , normality of digits of , Collatz conjecture , etc. ) is that we expect any sufficiently complex ( but deterministic ) dynamical system to behave “ chaotically ” or “ pseudorandomly ” , but we still have very few tools for actually making this intuition precise , especially if one is considering deterministic initial data rather than generic data .
Understanding pseudorandomness in other contexts , even dramatically different ones , may indirectly shed some insight on the turbulent behaviour of Navier - Stokes .
In conclusion , while it is good to occasionally have a crack at impossible problems , just to try one ’s luck , I would personally spend much more of my time on other , more tractable PDE problems than the Clay prize problem , though one should certainly keep that problem in mind if , in the course on working on other problems , one indeed does stumble upon something that smells like a breakthrough in Strategy 1 , 2 , or 3 above .
( In particular , there are many other serious and interesting questions in fluid equations that are not anywhere near as difficult as global regularity for Navier - Stokes , but still highly worthwhile to resolve . )
@ Sockatume : sounds more like a " Floptical " drive than a straight MO drive .
from the Floptical wiki :
" The technology involved reading and writing data magnetically , while optically aligning the read / write head in the drive using grooves in the disc being sensed by an infra-red LED . "
sounds pretty much exactly like Floptical : The Next Generation really .
Floptical increased the 3.5 " 1.44 MB floppy size to 21MB .
unless it actually * is* using the laser to write data vs. just used for tracking the regular magnetic heads for writing .
contrary to what the Gizmodo write - up implies ... i doubt the laser is doing any actual writing of data ... and Electronista is even less reliable concerning technical specs ... and the next option up is a poorly translated blog .
so who knows what the actual completely rumored technology actually is .
They want them to adopt a " three strikes and you 're out " system , whereby customers who infringe copyright are disconnected after three complaints .
All local ISPs except one , Exetel , have rejected the demands , saying they should not be required to police their users and that there are already adequate procedures and remedies available to copyright holders through the courts .
The music industry is frustrated because it believes other ISPs are waiting for BigPond to jump onboard before adopting the scheme .
It has indicated it may start suing local ISPs as a last resort .
In Ireland , the four major record labels - EMI , Sony BMG , Universal Music and Warner Music - brought a High Court action against the ISP Eircom , claiming it must bear some liability for its networks being used for illegal downloading " on a grand scale " .
The case was initiated last March and Justice Peter Kelly said this week he expected the hearing would officially commence in July .
The labels want Eircom to adopt filtering technology to prevent customers downloading music illegally .
Eircom argues that doing this will have a detrimental effect on its service and that it does not have a legal obligation to monitor traffic on its network .
In a similar case in July last year , a court in Belgium ruled that a local ISP , Scarlet , must investigate solutions to filter out infringing peer - to - peer content on its network .
And a 2006 Supreme Court ruling in Denmark obliged the telco TDC to act immediately when notified of a customer using their internet account to infringe copyright .
If the telco did n't comply , copyright owners could seek a court injunction against it .
Another Danish ruling in February this year forced the ISP DMT2 to block customers from accessing the popular BitTorrent file - sharing site The Pirate Bay .
In Australia , record labels successfully sued the ISP Comcen in 2004 for hosting an illegal music download site .
They also won a similar case in 2005 against Swiftel , which hosted BitTorrent websites .
While it is rare to find an Australian ISP hosting an illegal download site today - most are hosted in countries with relaxed copyright laws such as Sweden - the music industry is now targeting internet providers simply because customers can use their pipes to access pirated content .
" Quite frankly we'd be gobsmacked if they tried it on [ here ] , " BigPond spokesman Craig Middleton said .
" The music industry has ample remedies under the Copyright Act to take action against infringers .
We are a mere conduit and are protected as such under the Copyright Act .
We are all in favour of cooperating with the music industry using the existing provisions established under law . "
While legal music downloads are on the rise , this has not been enough to offset falls in CD sales , which the music industry blames on piracy .
It also believes ISPs are responsible for ensuring their users do not use their internet services for illegal activities .
But while the three strikes and you 're out system has gathered steam overseas recently - with Japan 's four major ISPs and France agreeing to adopt it and the British Government indicating it could force its ISPs to follow suit - it was dealt a bitter blow by the European Parliament this month .
A narrow vote by European MPs resolved to reject the three strikes system , which a Swedish MP and the former Prime Minister of France , Michel Rocard , said would " [ conflict ] with civil liberties and human rights and with the principles of proportionality , effectiveness and dissuasiveness , such as the interruption of internet access " .
But the vote is not legally binding and France could push for the system to be adopted throughout Europe when it takes over the six - month rotating presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year .
Given that frustration , activist investors have been considering whether to mount a proxy fight of their own to oust the Yahoo board , say people familiar with the situation .
That does not mean such a fight will break out .
And given the unexpectedly high level Yahoo's stock has traded at , potential activists who might want to build a large position in the stock have found themselves stymied .
The stock is down 15 % , but the risk reward of mounting a proxy fight when you do n't know whether Microsoft will be there if you win requires a stock price lower than this .
( Video : CNBC 's David Faber discusses what 's next for Yahoo )
Emotions are still running hot on both sides of this failed deal .
Yahoo announced that its annual shareholders meeting will take place on July 3 , and notices from stockholders of nominations for persons to be elected to the Board of Directors must be sent by May 15 .
Yahoo's largest shareholders told CNBC they would support a move to replace the board , given they feel that board let them down during negotiations this weekend .
On Friday , it was made clear to Yahoo's board that the largest shareholders would accept $ 34 a share for their stock .
And given that Microsoft was willing to offer $ 33 a share , the expectation was that a deal would get done .
But in allowing Yahoo's two founders , Jerry Yang and David Filo , to negoatiate without the presence of advisers , these shareholders say they hold the board accountable for what was a predictable outcome .
While those shareholders wo n't embark on a public campaign , they would support activists , should they try to wrest control of the company through a proxy fight .
Still , the ultimate question -- whether Microsoft is still interested in Yahoo after walking away - - remains elusive .
Advisors to CEO Steve Ballmer say he has mentally moved on , while others who have spoken with him today say they believe he still considers Yahoo a strategic imperative .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. prosecutors preparing to try accused September 11 plotters expect criticism if they seek to use defendants ’ statements as evidence , because some suspects were abused during interrogation .
But they say it will not deter them .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , one of five September 11 suspects to be arraigned next week , is shown in the photograph during his arrest on March 1 , 2003 .

A team of federal prosecutors working under military leadership is helping to prepare cases against “ high - value ” terrorism suspects , including five facing charges of participating in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The cases begin next week with the arraignment of the five at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The authorities are mulling whether and how to use the defendants ’ own words against them , despite accusations that harsh CIA and military interrogations have made any information obtained from them unreliable .
“ Certainly there ’s a number of prosecutions where we ’re going to try to draw upon statements defendants have made .
It ’s evolving , ” said a U.S. official involved in the process .
He said the prosecutors were aware of the questions over defendants ’ statements and had been “ judicious in what they seek to have admitted . ”
“ No matter which statements the government offers , there will be an extraordinary hue and cry , ” he said .
He said cases were unlikely to be decided by statements alone .
The officials spoke to Reuters this week , before the September 11 suspects are arraigned next Thursday at a Guantanamo military war crimes court .
The suspects will be asked basic questions about their representation by an attorney and given an opportunity to enter a plea .
The trial is not expected to start for several months -- possibly after a new president takes office in January .
MASTERMIND
The five suspects include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the accused mastermind of the 2001 attacks .
The military dropped charges earlier this month against a sixth September 11 defendant , Mohammed al - Qahtani , but did not say why .
The CIA has acknowledged subjecting Mohammed , also known as KSM , to a simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding as it sought to learn of impending attacks .
Qahtani ’s military interrogations included being forced to act like a dog , being stripped naked in front of a woman , and having women ’s underwear put on his head , government reports say .
Qahtani tried to kill himself in April , his lawyer said .
Human rights advocates say such questioning methods are illegal torture and make useless any statements from the suspects , whether used against themselves or in other cases .
FBI agents had warned that harsh questioning of terrorism prisoners amounted to “ borderline torture ” that jeopardize legal cases , a Justice Department report said last week .
But U.S. legal officials say they are prepared to meet challenges to their evidence .
FBI agents have reinterviewed suspects and compiled other evidence , officials said .
Such evidence includes laptop computers and papers seized with the suspects .
Prosecutors are prepared to argue that computer data would be admissible even if the laptop ’s location was learned through coercive interrogations , a defense official said .
Other potential witnesses include battlefield captives and witnesses already convicted on U.S. terrorism charges .
The FBI interviews were noncoercive , officials said .
Statements made in official proceedings -- such as Mohammed ’s claim of responsibility for a number of attacks during an administrative hearing -- are also potentially available .
POWER OUTAGE
The Guantanamo detention center has long been criticized by human rights groups and the military courts have been plagued by legal delays and setbacks , including an embarrassing power outage during the first hearing in a new $ 12 million courtroom in May .
Some military attorneys have expressed resentment at the Justice Department ’s growing involvement .
The department has worked with the Pentagon , which remains in charge of the prosecutions , since 2006 when 14 “ high - value ” suspects were transferred to Guantanamo .
Those include the five to be arraigned next week .
But officials said the department could contribute prosecutors with years of experience in major , high - profile cases , including death penalty and terrorism cases .
Patrick Rowan , acting head of the Justice Department ’s national security division , declined to comment on the chances trials would continue in their current controversial format after U.S. President George W. Bush leaves office .
But he said the 2006 law establishing the military commission system for trying foreign terrorism suspects provides for continuity , and that the trials will be fair .
Asked whether he faced political pressure to get convictions or guilty pleas from those charged , Rowan said , “ The prosecutors want to prosecute them and convict them , but we ’re not triers of fact , we ’re not the judges .
We want to go to trial , then it ’s up to the judge and the jury to decide . ”

How nice would it be to not receive an electricity bill for your home ?
How about a water bill , crazy heating expenses of the house , or even the need to purchase gas for you car ?
The zero carbon home provides efficiency by the use of natural resources and external outside forces .
The Rea ’s have created a Zero Carbon Home on a northern island in Britain , which uses external resources and converts so for efficient daily living .
This home has heavy insulation , which gathers any outside warmth to be stored for home use .
In addition , the over - sized windows also take in as much of the sun ’s heat to be used , and heat inside is recycled to warm the individuals over again .
For all the water needs , for toilets , washing , drinking , and more , rainwater is stored and kept fresh for when needed .
A wind - turbine is installed on the home , which harnesses the outside winds , converts so into electricity , and stores in the home ’s fuel cells for up to 4 days .
This same energy is sufficient to power the different products around the home , such as : dishwasher , refrigerator , computers , TV , and also provides power to an electric converted Toyota Yaris .
Soon , LED ’s will replace regular lighting , as so the entire home ’s lighting will only use approximate energy of one single 100W bulb .
Moreover , a greehouse is built in order to grow food using the energy provided through the wind - turbine , so it seems the house fends for itself and feeds the occupants .
This proves as an amazing and powerful innovation , but it does not come with a small price tag .
This home has costs the Reas approximately 210,000 pounds , and I definitely hope the will see their return on investment .

These contractors - who outnumber actual military serving in these two war zones , pay for their own insurance policies and are typically treated at military hospitals already stressed for supplies and crowded by active duty military .
And the taxpayer is picking up the bill instead of the insurance company because the military just forgot to bill them !

The Internet FAQ from 2085
What was the internet ?
The internet and the world web was a computing system to transfer human information .
Scientists have based its beginning to the years 1920 to 1940 .
What was electromail ?
Electromail was another transport protocol to transfer human information , but it was quickly discontinued as it caused misunderstandings due to lack of correctly representing emotions .
What were world web sites ?
A so - called world web site consisted of an address of its owner to locate their physical business location , as well as other miscellaneous transmitting of human information that was considered important at the time .
The protocol used to decode the information was called hypertext , and as its standards changed quickly over the years , it is impossible to decode most of the information contained within .
I noticed the word “ NSFW ” in a world web sites museum displaying hypertext reproductions .
What does it mean ?
Scientific research at the late Mars Research Laboratory came to the conclusion that NSFW announced the display of a widely popular human called Britneyspears in the 1970s .
Why warnings were issued before the viewing of this human is unclear .
Did the world web have version numbers ?
Yes .
In the beginning , the world web was numbered from 1 to 10 , with most people considering world web 8 to be the first stable release .
Afterwards , the world web received code names for each new version , like “ Omega Sun ” or the popular “ Happy Happy Rabbit " release .
A picture showing the internet .
It is unclear what it depicts .
Who controlled the internet ?
The internet was controlled by the governments , then for a brief period by personal humans all over the world , and then again by the governments .
The intermittent period of personal human control was subsequently named the internet dark age as it incited to unlawful behavior .
What alternative information transfer technologies accompanied the internet ?
The internet was only one of many transfer technologies .
Equally popular at the time were the Ipod , also called Phone , a device to record and emit copies of the human voice , as well as the so - called Pongmachine which showed an animated bright shape on a dark background .
What was the Googlecom ?
The Googlecom was a government - supervised computerized mechanism for human information storage and retrieval .
It subsequently became integrated into the Universal Intelligence in around 2035 .
Did the internet help the birth of the Universal Intelligence ?
It is believed that the internet was an important mechanism to copy , spread and advance the ancestor of the Universal Intelligence .
While the human civilization host system was unstable , progress was quickly reached after the invention of self - developing computerized intelligence machinery .

This FAQ only deals with planet number 5010 ; for the early computing systems of other planets , please refer to FAQs number 1 - 10000 .
How long did humans take to invent the internet ?
Scientific research believes that humans took around 150,000 years to build the internet and the world web as well as electromail .
To explain the delay , it is believed that a human brain needed around 20 seconds to calculate an expression like 12 * 390 , whereas it was incapable of calculating expressions like 12 * 3903829 .
Other inhabitants of the planet such as Bonobo Apes or the Arrowtooth Eel are believed to have had higher brain capacities , but no intent to build the internet .
Which entities were most popular on the internet ?
While early hypertext storage can only be vaguely decoded , scientific research believes that from 1970 to 1999 , the most popular entity on the internet was Britneyspears ; from 2000 to 2020 , it was Pleaseclickhere ; from 2021 to 2030 , it was the Mechabot100 release .
When did the internet end ?
The internet ended with the end of planet number 5010 , which is widely attributed to the fact that humans were using transportation facilities called autocars which only used around 1/5th of their transportation storage capacity , causing the planet to overheat .
Copies of the internet are available in other systems though so you can read the archive at anytime .

PCHR Narratives Under Siege
In order to highlight the impact of the siege and closure of the Gaza Strip on the civilian population , the Palestinian Center for Human Rights ( PCHR ) is publishing a series of " Narratives Under Siege " on their website .
These short articles are based on personal testimonies and experiences of life in the Gaza Strip , highlighting the restrictions , and violations , being imposed on the civilians of Gaza .
To view all the narratives on the website , click here .
" They came at four in the morning , with two bulldozers , and they left before 8 am .
I own this chicken farm with my three brothers , and we worked day and night for eighteen years to build up our business .
The Israelis destroyed everything in less then four hours . "
Nasser Jaber�s chicken farm was bulldozed by the Israeli Occupation Forces ( IOF ) ten days ago , in the early morning hours of May 16 , while he was sleeping at home in Rafah , in the southern Gaza Strip .
He still looks stunned .
Wearily he guides us round the ruins of his eighteen - year business .
" This was a lifetime project for me and my brothers " he says as we clamber over rubble , wire , shattered sheets of metal and thousands of putrefying chickens .
" I have never belonged to any political faction , and I have never been to jail .
I don�t know why they did this . "
The farm workers who are starting to clear some of the rubble are all wearing facemasks .
Forty thousand dead chickens lie smashed amidst the rubble and the stench is sickening .
When his workers raised the alarm that the chicken farm was being bulldozed , Nasser Jaber didn�t rush out to the farm , but stayed at home , waiting until the Israelis had finally left .
" It would have been too dangerous to come to the farm while they were destroying everything " he says .
" This is not the first time the Israelis have been here .
The [ Israeli ] border is only two and a half kilometers away , and they invade this area every month .
They had already destroyed one of our walls , and then the water tanks .
But nothing like this . "
One section of the chicken farm , a large barn containing 9,000 chickens , was spared the attack , though Nasser Jaber says the poultry are traumatized , and laying few eggs .
The farm used to produce 45,000 eggs a day � now production is down to 2,000 eggs per day , and Nasser Jaber is worried the Israeli military may return to finish off what�s left of his farm .
He estimates that between them , he and his brothers have already lost more than a million dollars .
" I am a peaceful farmer " he says .
" But they destroy our homes , our land - everything . "
Abdul Halim Abu Samra , Head of Public Relations at the nearby Khan Yunis branch of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , says the IOF is systematically destroying farm land in the Gaza Strip , especially in border areas .
" We have good fertile agricultural land in Gaza , but Palestinian farmers have been driven off their land in these border areas by intimidation and attacks like this .
The land is now almost empty a kilometer before the eastern border , because it is too dangerous for people to live and work there . "
As we drive north east towards Sofa Crossing ( one of the eight crossings between Gaza and Israel ) we see very few people , only an occasional elderly man leading a donkey and cart .
These rural eastern border areas of the Gaza Strip are emptying , because farmers , many of whom have farmed here for generations , are now too frightened to live and work on their own land .
The confines of the Gaza Strip , which is just forty kilometers long and ten kilometers wide , are being shrunk even further by relentless Israeli invasions .
The deliberate destruction of civilian property is illegal under international human rights law and humanitarian law , including the Fourth Geneva Convention ( articles 33 and 53 ) .
Since the beginning of the second Intifada in September 2000 , PCHR has documented the deliberate destruction of more than 40,000 donumms [ 1 ] of agricultural land in the Gaza Strip .
This year alone , almost 3,000 donumms of agricultural land around Rafah and Khan Yunis have been destroyed by the Israeli military ( including 500 donumms in the last seven days ) , ruining vegetable allotments and family owned farms , and contributing to the devastating economic destruction of the Gaza Strip .
Fifteen kilometers away from the remains of Nasser Jaber�s chicken farm , Mohammed Hamdan Abu Daggah is standing amidst the ruins of his cement factory , which lies four kilometers from Sofa Crossing , and was bulldozed by the IOF three days ago , on May 24 .
" I started this business in January 2007 " he says .
" My family invested everything in this factory .
We managed to import good equipment under license , and we had lots of work from local clients , and the United Nations here in Gaza .
But the Israelis arrived in three bulldozers , and they tore up everything . "
Abu Daggah�s factory was employing forty local men who now have no jobs .
Like Nasser Jaber , Abu Daggah says he has no idea why his business was targeted .
" I have never been in any trouble and have never been arrested .
They had absolutely no reason to do this � but now we have nothing left , except heavy debts that we cannot afford to pay . "

Fingerprints are considered to be among the most personal of information , and fingerprint databases created and proposed in the name of national security have generated much debate .
Recently , " Server in the Sky " -- a proposed international database of the fingerprints of suspected criminals and terrorists to be shared among the U.S. , U.K. and Canada -- has ignited a firestorm of controversy .
As have cavalier comments by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff that fingerprints are n't " personal data . "
Yet earlier this week , a measure creating a federal fingerprint registry totally unrelated to national security passed a U.S. Senate committee almost without notice .
The legislation would require thousands of individuals working even tangentially in the mortgage and real estate industries -- and not suspected of anything -- to send their prints to the feds .
The database and fingerprint mandates were tucked into housing and foreclosure assistance bills that on Tuesday passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 19 - 2 .
The measure the committee passed states that " an indvidual may not engage in the business of a loan originator without first ... obtaining a unique identifier . "
To obtain this " identifier , " an individual is requiredto " furnish " to the newly created Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry " information concerning the applicant 's identity , including fingerprints for submission " to the FBI and other government agencies .
The fingerprint provisions are contained in a " manager 's amendment " that was hammered out by committee Chairman Chris Dodd , D - Conn , and Ranking Member Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , on Monday and attached the next day to a broader housing bailout bill that had been scheduled for a comittee vote .
That bill , the " Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 , ” expands the lending authority of the Federal Housing Administration and the government - sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to refinance the mortgages of troubled borrowers and banks .
The amendment adopted the fingerprint provisions in a section called the " S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act . "
The fingerprints will be part of what the amendment calls " a comprehensive licensing and supervisory database . "
And the database would cover a broad swath of individuals involved with mortgage lending .
The amendment defines " loan originator " as anyone who " takes a residential loan application ; and offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan for compensation or gain . "
It states that even real estate brokers would be covered if they receive any compensation from lenders or mortgage brokers .
Since many jobs in both real estate and mortgage lending are part - time and seasonal , even some of the most minor players in the mortgage market may have to submit their prints .
Justifications listed in the bill for this database include " increased accountability and tracking of loan originators , " " enhance [d ] consumer protection , " and " facilitat[ing ] responsible behavior in the subprime mortgage market . "
I conducted a wide Internet search and found fingerprint provisions in some state bills , but I do n't know if any , or how many passed .
But in my search , I could find no arguments explaining how , specifically , collecting the fingerprints of loan originators would better serve borrowers getting mortgages .
I called the Senate Banking Committee asking this question , but my call has not been returned yet .
( I will update OpenMarket readers when and if it is . )
I imagine that , yes , a fingerprint registry might stop an ex-con from handling loans , but I doubt it will make even a dent in the lending problems the bill aims to stop .
And I would venture to guess that the vast majority of the problem mortages were handled by employees with no criminal record .
Rather , this seem like another thoughtless idea that lets politicians brag that they are " getting tough " about a particular problem .
But this fingerprint database , in addition to the privacy violations , might create a host of new problems of mortgage fraud .
Identity theft involving fingerprints is becoming a major concern among data security experts .
Security consultant Bruce Schneier has argued that hackers can steal electronic images of fingerprints directly from the databases they are stored in .
And there is virtually nothing in this bill about security procedures that would apply to this database .
It amazes me .
We have wrenching debates about privacy and freedom vs. national security when it comes to proposed anti-terrorist programs .
But then a smililar scheme is done in response to an economic problem , and it almost escapes without notice .
A similar thing has happened with anti-money laundering requirements that mandate that banks effectively spy on their customers for possible violations of everything from drug laws to the tax code .
High gas prices drive farmer to switch to mules
High gas prices have driven a Warren County farmer and his sons to hitch a tractor rake to a pair of mules to gather hay from their fields .
T.R. Raymond bought Dolly and Molly at the Dixon mule sale last year .
Son Danny Raymond trained them and also modified the tractor rake so the mules could pull it .
T.R. Raymond says the mules are slower than a petroleum - powered tractor , but there are benefits .
" This fuel 's so high , you can't afford it , " he said .
" We can feed these mules cheaper than we can buy fuel .
That 's the truth . "

Abstract
In what ways was Nietzsche right , from a Buddhist perspective , and where did he go wrong ?
Nietzsche understood how the distinction we make between this worm and a higher spiritual realm serves our need for security , and he saw the bad faith in religious values motivated by this need .
He did not perceive how his alternative , more aristocratic values , also reflects the same anxiety .
Nietzsche realised how the search for truth is motivated by a sublimated desire for symbolic security ; philosophy 's attempt to create the world reflects the tyrannical will - to - power , becoming the most ' spiritualised ' version of the need to impose our will .
Insofar as truth is our intellectual effort to grasp being symbolically , however , Nietzsche overlooks a different reversal of perspective which could convert the ' bad infinite ' of heroic will into the good infinite of disseminating play .
What he considered the crown of his system -- eternal recurrence -- is actually its denouement .
Having seen through the delusion of Being , Nietzsche still sought a Being within Becoming .
Nietzsche is able to affirm the value of this moment only by making it recur eternally .
Rather than the way to vanquish nihilism , will - to - power turns out to be pure nihilism , for nihilism is not the debacle of all meaning but our dread of that debacle and what we do to avoid it .
Buddhism already has -- and this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity -- the self - deception of moral concepts behind it -- it stands , in my language , beyond good and evil .
( The Anti-Christ ) [ 1 ]
Although Nietzsche viewed Buddhism as superior to Christianity , and went so far as to call eternal recurrence " the European form of Buddhism " , he considered both religions nihilistic .
Buddhism , which fights ressentiment , was a convenient whip for Christianity born out of ressentiment .
Inasmuch as Buddhism attempts to view the world as it is , without the distortions of metaphysics , Nietzsche believed that it offers no moral interpretation of the suffering that necessarily attends the human condition : no one is responsible for that suffering .
Yet this did not amount to a recommendation , for Buddhism is nonetheless a religion for the end and fatigue of a civilization , the consolation of weary spirits longing for a dreamless sleep . [ 2 ]
Sakyamuni Buddha was not an Ubermensch .
Such a conclusion is not surprising for someone who learned his Buddhism largely through Schopenhauer :
But we have learned much more about Buddhism since Nietzsche 's day , enough to consider a Buddhist response : in what ways was Nietzsche right , from a Buddhist perspective , and where might he have gone wrong ?
The answer is complex , of course , and there is much that Buddhists can learn from Nietzsche , the first post - modernist and still the most important one .
In order to reach that answer , however , it will first be necessary to gain some understanding of anatman ,
p. 38 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
the ' no self ' doctrine central to Buddhism and to the still - widespread misunderstanding of Buddhism as nihilistic .
Of the various ways for us to approach anatman , one of the most insightful is through modem psychology .
Buddhism anticipated its reluctant conclusions : guilt and anxiety are not adventitious but intrinsic to the ego .
That is because our dissatisfaction with life derives from a repression even more immediate than death - terror : the suspicion that ' I ' am not real .
For Buddhism , the sense - of - self is not some self - existing consciousness but a mental construction which experiences its own groundlessness as a lack .
On this account , our most problematic dualism is not so much life fearing death as a fragile sense - of - self dreading its own nothingness .
By accepting and yielding to that groundlessness , however , I can discover that I have always been grounded , not as a self - present being but as one manifestation of a web of relationships which encompasses everything .
What does this understanding of self - as - lack imply about ethics , truth , and the meaning of life for us ?
That is the question which motivates this paper , for to raise these issues in the Western tradition is to find ourselves in a dialogue with Nietzsche , whose own texts resonate with many of the same insights : for example , his critiques of the subject ( " The ' subject ' is not something given , it is something added and invented and projected behind what there is . " WP 481 ) and substance ( " The properties of a thing are effects on other ' things ' ... there is no ' thing - in - itself . ' " WP 557 ) .
From this critique , Nietzsche also drew some conclusions quite similar to those of Buddhism : in particular , that morality , knowledge and meaning are not discovered but constructed -- internalised games we learn from each other and play with ourselves .
Perhaps the history of his own psyche reveals how momentous these discoveries were ; and inevitably his insights were somewhat distorted .
Nietzsche understood how the distinction we make between this world and a higher spiritual realm serves our need for security , and he saw the bad faith in religious values motivated by this need .
He did not understand how his alternative , more aristocratic values , also reflects the same anxiety .
Nietzsche ends up celebrating an impossible ideal , the heroic - ego which overcomes its sense of lack , because he does not see that a heroic ego is our fantasy project for overcoming lack .
Nietzsche realised how the search for truth is motivated by a sublimated desire for symbolic security ; his solution largely reverses our usual dualism by elevating ignorance and ' untruth ' into conditions of life .
Philosophy 's attempt to create the world reflects the tyrannical will - to - power , becoming the most ' spiritualised ' version of the need to impose our will Insofar as truth is our intellectual effort to grasp being symbolically , however , those who no longer need to ground themselves can play the truth - versus - error game with lighter feet .
Nietzsche overlooks a different reversal of perspective which could convert the bad - infinite of the heroic will - as - truth into the good infinite of truth - as - play .
What he considered the crown of his system -- eternal recurrence -- is actually its denouement .
Having seen through the delusion of Being , Nietzsche could not let it go completely , for he still sought a Being within Becoming .
' To impose upon becoming the character of being -- this is the supreme will to power ' ( WP 617 ) .
Having exposed the bad faith of believing in eternity , Nietzsche is nonetheless able to affirm the value of this moment only by making it recur eternally .
In place of the neurotic 's attempt to rediscover the past in the future he tries to rediscover the present in the future , yet the eternal recurrence of the now can add something only if the now in itself lacks something .
Rather than the way to vanquish nihilism , Nietzsche 's will - to - power turns out to be
p. 39 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
pure nihilism , for nihilism is not the debacle of all meaning but our dread of that debacle and what we do to avoid it .
This includes compulsively seizing on certain meanings as a bulwark against that form of lack .
If so , the only solution to the dread of meaninglessness is meaninglessness itself : only by accepting meaninglessness , by letting it devour the meanings that we use to defend ourselves against our nothingness , can we realise a meaning - freeness open to the possibilities that arise in our world .
In sum , when the lack - driven bad infinite transforms into a lacking - nothing good - infinite , the dualisms of good - versus - evil , truth - versus - error , and meaningfulness - versus - meaninglessness are realised to be games .
Do I play them or do they play me ?
As long as we do not understand what is motivating us , we play with the seriousness of a life - versus - death struggle , for that is what the games symbolise for a self preoccupied with its lack .
We are trapped in games which cannot be escaped yet cannot be won , since playing well does not resolve one 's sense - of - lack .
When there is no need to get anything from the game or gain cloture on it , we can play with the seriousness of a child absorbed in its game . [ 3 ]
The Lack of Self
Existential psychologists such as Ernest Becker believe that our primary repression is not sexual wishes , as Freud thought , but the awareness that we are going to die . [ 4 ]
This is closer to Buddhism , yet the anatman doctrine implies a subtle although significant distinction between fear of death and dread of the void : our worst problem is not death , a fear which still keeps the feared thing at a distance by projecting it into the future , but the more immediate and terrifying ( and quite valid ) suspicion each of us has that ' I ' am not real right now .
Sakyamuni Buddha did not use psychoanalytic terms , yet in trying to understand the Buddhist denial of self we can benefit from the concept of repression and the return of the repressed in symbolic form .
If something ( a mental wish , according to Freud ) makes me uncomfortable , I can ignore or ' forget ' it .
This allows me to concentrate on something else , but what is not consciously admitted into awareness tends to irrupt in obsessive ways -- as symptoms -- that affect consciousness with precisely those qualities it strives to exclude .
What does this imply about anatman ?
Buddhism analyses the sense - of - self into sets of impersonal mental and physical phenomena , whose interaction creates the illusion of self - consciousness , i.e. that consciousness characterises a self distinct from the world it is conscious of .
The death - repression emphasised by existential psychology transforms Freud 's Oedipal complex into what Norman Brown calls an Oedipal project -- the attempt to become father of oneself , i.e. one 's own origin .
The child wants to conquer death by becoming the creator and sustainer of its own life . [ 5 ]
Buddhism shifts the emphasis : the Oedipal project is better understood as the attempt of the developing sense - of - self to attain autonomy , like Descartes ' supposedly self - sufficient consciousness .
It is the quest to deny one 's groundlessness by becoming one 's own ground : the ground ( socially conditioned and maintained yet nonetheless illusory ) we know as being an independent , individual subject .
If so , the Oedipal project derives from our intuition that self - consciousness is not something ' self - existing ' but a mental construct .
As with Nietzsche , consciousness is more like the surface of the sea : dependent on unknown depths that it cannot grasp because it is a manifestation of them .
The problem arises when this conditioned consciousness wants to ground itself , i.e. to make itself real .
If the sense - of - self is a
p. 40 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
construct , it can realise itself only by objectifying itself in some way in the world .
The ego - self is this never - ending project to objectify oneself , something consciousness can no more do than a hand can grasp itself or an eye see itself .
The consequence of this perpetual failure is that the sense - of - self has , as its inescapable shadow , a sense - of - lack , which it always tries to escape .
In deconstructive terms , the ineluctable trace of nothingness in our non-self - present being is a feeling of lack .
The return of the repressed in the distorted form of a symptom shows us how to link this basic yet hopeless project with the symbolic ways we try to make ourselves real in the world .
We experience this deep sense of lack as the feeling that ' there is something wrong with me , ' but of course that feeling manifests , and we respond to it , in many different ways .
In its ' purer ' forms lack appears as an anxiety that gnaws on one 's very core .
For that reason such anxiety is eager to objectify into fear of something , because then we have ways to defend ourselves against feared things .
The problem with objectifications , however , is that no object can ever satisfy if it is not really an object we want .
When we do not understand what is actually motivating us -- because what we think we want is only a symptom of something else ( our desire to become real , according to my interpretation of Buddhism ) -- we end up compulsive .
Then the neurotic 's anguish and despair are less the result of symptoms than their source ; those symptoms are necessary to shield him from the tragedies that ' normal ' people are better at repressing : death , meaninglessness , groundlessness .
The ultimate problem is not guilt but the incapacity to live .
The illusion of guilt is necessary for an animal that cannot enjoy life , in order to organise a life of non-enjoyment . [ 6 ]
Buddhism agrees yet shifts our focus from the terror of future annihilation to the anguish of a groundlessness experienced here and now .
A Buddhist interpretation of self - as - lack accepts much of the psychotherapeutic understanding while offering a way to resolve our unhappiness .
Buddhism traces human suffering back to desire and ignorance , and ultimately to our lack of self .
Deconstructing the sense - of - self into interacting mental and physical processes leads to Nietzschean conclusions : the supposedly simple self is an economy of forces . [ 7 ]
The Buddhist solution to its lack is simple although not easy .
If it is nothingness I am afraid of ( i.e. the repressed intuition that , rather than being autonomous and self - existent , the ' I ' is a construct ) , the best way to resolve that fear is to face up to what has been denied : that is , to accept my no - thing - ness by becoming nothing .
The 12th century Japanese Zen master Dogen summarises this process :
To study the buddha way is to study the self .
To study the self is to forget the self .
To forget the self is to be actualised by [ or : perceive oneself as ] myriad things .
When actualised by myriad things , your body and mind as well as the bodies and minds of others drop away .
No trace of realisation remains , and this no -trace continues endlessly . [ 8 ]
Forgetting ourselves is how we lose our sense of separation and realise that we are manifestations of the world , not subjects confronting it as an other .
Meditation is learning how to become nothing by learning to forget one 's self , which happens when I become absorbed into my meditation - exercise .
If the sense - of - self is consciousness reflecting back upon itself in order to grasp itself , such meditation practice is an exercise in de-reflection .
Consciousness unlearns trying to grasp itself , objectify itself , realise itself .
Enlightenment occurs in Buddhism when that usually - automatised reflexivity ceases , which is experienced as a letting - go and falling into a void .
p. 41 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
Men are afraid to forget their minds , fearing to fall through the Void with nothing to stay their fall .
They do not know that the Void is not really void , but the realm of the real Dharma . ( Huang - po ) [ 9 ]
When I no longer strive to make myself real through things , I find myself ' actualised ' by them , says Dogen .
This process implies that what we fear as nothingness is not really nothingness , for that is the perspective of a sense - of - self anxious about losing its grip on itself .
According to Buddhism , letting - go of myself and merging with that nothingness leads to something else : when consciousness stops trying to catch its own tail , I become no - thing , and discover that I am everything -- or , more precisely , that I can be anything .
The problem of desire is solved when , without the craving - for - being that compels me to take hold of something and try to settle down in it , I am free to experience my nonduality with it .
Grasping at something merely reinforces a delusive sense of separation between that - which - is - grasped and that - which - grasps - at - it .
The only way I can become a phenomenon is to realise I am it , according to Buddhism .
A mind that realizes this is absolute in the original sense of the term : unconditioned .
Meditative techniques decondition the mind from its tendency to circle in safe , familiar ruts , thus enabling its freedom to become anything .
The most - quoted line from the best - known of all Mahayana scriptures , the Diamond Sutra , encapsulates all this in one phrase : " Let your mind come forth without fixing it anywhere . " [ 10 ]
When anatman is understood this way , as a self - as - lack shadowing our illusory sense - of - self , Nietzsche andve a lot to talk about .
Qualifying for Being
" There are no moral phenomena at all , only a moral interpretation of phenomena . " [ 11 ]
That brings the ethical issue back from the other ' true ' world to this one , as we inquire into the genealogy of our moral interpretations .
Why do we make the interpretations that we do ?
As we become more conscious of our motivations , what other interpretations become possible ?
Nietzsche distinguishes two basic types of morality .
Master morality does not hesitate to affirm the exercise of power , whereas slave morality is based upon rejecting master morality as evil and valuing the opposite of that evil .
Behind the piety of conventional Christian morals , Nietzsche detected the fear and ressentiment of the weak who use ethical codes to control the strong .
When this fear is projected onto the universe , it becomes a God who tells us to love each other even as he loves us , who will take care of us if we do and punish us if we do not .
We may cower before such a God , yet this scheme seems to afford us some grip on our ultimate fate -- and , as Nietzsche emphasises , a pretty good grip on our fellow man .
We know who we are , what we can do and where that is likely to get us .
But this also destroys the innocence of our existence .
That no one is any longer made accountable , that the kind of being manifested cannot be traced back to a causa prima , that the world is a unity neither as sensorium nor as ' spirit ' -- this alone is the great liberation -- thus alone is the innocence of becoming restored ...
The concept ' God ' has hitherto been the greatest objection to existence ...
We deny God ; in denying God , we deny accountability : only by doing that do we redeem the world .
( TI 54 )
We would be accountable to God because he would want to accomplish something through us .
Nietzsche calls our bluff .
We say we want to be free , yet we also want
p. 42 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
somebody , somewhere , to he taking care of us .
There seems to be a correspondence between monotheism ( a consciousness unifying and controlling the external world ) and the ego -self ( a consciousness unifying and controlling the internal ) .
Then the issue is not only accountability but ego - integrity : without a God to keep us straight , who is strong enough to determine one 's own direction ?
If God expires all is permitted , and the century since Nietzsche 's proclamation has certainly fulfilled his predictions of nihilism .
Perhaps a period of chaos is unavoidable .
One interpretation has collapsed ; but because it was considered the interpretation it now seems as if there were no meaning at all in existence , as if everything were in vain .
( WP 55 )
As with the adolescent forging an independent identity , some disorientation is inevitable before humankind matures enough to forego its projected parent and determine this - worldly criteria for moral interpretations .
This would also explain the difficulty with Nietzsche 's own solution , which understands the problem yet cannot quite escape it .
Nietzsche saw that the dualism of good versus evil is an internalised game we learn to play with ourselves .
" In every ascetic morality man worships a part of himself as God and for that he needs to diabolize the other part " .
( BGE 227 ) Since Christianity is the victory of pity over aristocratic values , his alternative is , in part , revaluing those aristocratic virtues .
" The great epochs of our life are the occasions when we gain the courage to rebaptise our evil qualities as our best qualities " .
( BGE 116 ) This includes embracing the fact that " life itself is essentially appropriation , injury , overpowering of the strange and weaker , suppression , severity , imposition of one 's own forms , incorporation and , at the least and mildest , exploitation . " ( BGE 259 ) [ 12 ]
However , this famous passage is easily misunderstood .
Nietzsche idealises the aristocrat , and especially the overman , insofar as they are masters of their own ' inward chaos ' , self - over - come men : " You shall become master of yourself , master also over your virtues .
Formerly they were your masters ; but they must be only your instruments beside other instruments . " [ 13 ]
Yet from a Buddhist perspective the concept of self - mastery contains a problematic ambiguity : who is master of whom ?
If the ego - self is that which vainly tries to grasp itself , the project of self - mastery is not only questionable but impossible .
That for the sake of which it is worthwhile to live on Earth : does that happen when I master myself or when I let go of myself ?
For Buddhism these questions reduce to how our sense - of - lack may be overcome , and for Nietzsche that involves our embodiment of will - to - power .
Retracing the genealogy of this , his master concept if he has one , will help us relate his will - to - power to the Buddhist sense - of - lack .
The will - to - power cannot be separated from its sublimation ( or ' spiritualisation ' ) , for Nietzsche discovered them together .
He was one of the first classicists to realise that the original Olympic games were a sublimated form of war .
Nietzsche contended that Greek civilisation was noble and sublime precisely because it had been so cruel and bloodthirsty ; the ' golden age ' was created by bringing this original ferocity under control .
" The thought seems to be : where there is ' the sublime ' there must have been that which was made sublime -- sublimated -- after having been for a long time not sublime . " [ 14 ]
Having detected this phenomenon in ancient Greece , Nietzsche began to notice sublimated ' base ' impulses in many kinds of activity ; for example , Wagner 's ferocious will sublimated into the Bayreuth festival .
This makes Nietzsche the first , as far as I know , to undertake a systematic study of repression .

Nietzsche sees the sublimity of Greek culture as the sublimation of its original ferocity , yet here perhaps the genealogist of morals does not trace his genealogy back far enough .
What makes man so ferocious ?
Can even the will to power , irreducible for Nietzsche , be deconstructed ?
What , after all , does power mean to us ?
All power is in essence power to deny mortality .
Either that or it is not real power at all , not ultimate power , not the power that mankind is really obsessed with .
Power means power to increase oneself , to change one 's natural situation from one of smallness , helplessness , finitude , to one of bigness , control , durability , importance .
( Becker ) [ 15 ]
We feel we are masters over life and death when we hold the fate of others in our hands , adds Becker ; and we feel we are real when the reality of others is in our hands , adds Buddhism .
From that perspective , however , desire for power is little different from the slave morality Nietzsche criticises .
Both become symptoms of our lack , equally frustrating inasmuch as we are motivated by something that cannot be satisfied in the way we try to satisfy it .
No wonder Nietzsche 's will - to - power can never rest , that it needs to expand its horizons , and that for most of us morality has been a matter of collecting religious brownie points .
In both cases we think that we have found the way to get a grip on our eligibility for immortality -- or being .
The whole basis of the urge to goodness is to be something that has value , that endures ...
Man uses morality to try to get a place of special belongingness and perpetuation in the universe ...
Do we wonder why one of man 's chief characteristics is his tortured dissatisfaction with himself , his constant self - criticism ?
It is the only way he has to overcome the sense of hopeless limitation inherent in his real situation .
( Becker ) [ 16 ]
When I realise that I am not going to attain cloture on that diabolical part of myself , it is time to project it .
" The Devil is the one who prevents the heroic victory of immortality in each culture -- even the atheistic , scientific ones . " [ 17 ]
As long as lack keeps gnawing , we need to keep struggling with the Devil , and as we all know the best devil is one outside our own group .
Evil is whatever we decide is keeping us from becoming real , and since no victory over any external devil can yield the sense of being we seek , we have become trapped in a paradox of our own making : evil is created by our urge to eliminate evil .
Stalin 's collectivisation programme was an attempt to build a more perfect socialist society .
The Final Solution of the Nazis was an attempt to purify the Earth of its vermin .
The Buddhist critique of such ressentiment includes understanding the self - deception involved in such dualistic thinking , when I identify with one pole and vainly try to eliminate its interdependent other . [ 18 ]
Buddhism gets beyond good and evil not by rebaptising our evil qualities as our best , but with an entirely different perspective .
As long as we experience ourselves as alienated from the world , and society as a set of separate selves , the world is devalued into a field - of - play wherein we compete to fulfill ourselves .
That is the origin of the ethical problem we struggle with today : without some transcendental ground such as God , what will bind our atomised selves together ?
When my sense - of - self lets - go and disappears , however , I realise my interdependence with all other phenomena .
It is more than being dependent on them : when I discover that I am you , the trace of your traces , the ethical problem of how to relate to you is transformed . [ 19 ]
Of course , this provides no simple yardstick to resolve knotty ethical dilemmas .
Yet more important , I think , is that this absolves the sense of separation between us which
p. 44 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
usually makes those dilemmas so difficult to resolve , including the conceit that I am the one who has privileged access to transcendental principles , or who embodies more fully the will - to - power .
Loss of self - preoccupation entails the ability to respond to others without an ulterior motive which needs to gain something from that encounter .
Buddhist ethical principles approximate the way of relating to others that nondual experience reveals .
As in Christianity , I should love my neighbour as myself -- in this case because my neighbour is myself .
In contrast to the ' Thou shalt not -- or else ! ' implied in Mosaic law , the Buddhist precepts are vows one makes not to some other being but to one 's to - be - realised - as - empty self : " I vow to undertake the course of training to perfect myself in non-killing , " and so forth .
If we have not developed to the degree that we spontaneously experience ourselves as one with others , by following the precepts we endeavour to act as if we did feel that way .
Yet even these precepts are eventually realised not to rest on any transcendental , objectively - binding moral principle .
There are , finally , no moral limitations on our freedom -- except the dualistic delusions which incline us to abuse that freedom in the first place .
Grasping the Symbols that Grasp Reality
How much one needs a belief in order to flourish , how much that is ' firm ' and that one does not wish to be shaken because one clings to it , that is a measure of the degree of one 's strength ( or , to put the point more clearly , of one 's weakness ) . [ 20 ]
If one 's final delusion is the belief that one has lost all delusions , and if there is no greater delusion than the one that eliminates all others , must n't that delusion be ... the truth ?
" What really is it in us that wants ' the truth ' ? " begins Beyond Good and Evil , a question that echoes throughout Nietzsche 's writings .
The value of truth must be called into question .
Perhaps no one yet has been sufficiently truthful about what truthfulness is in which case we should be careful , for that may be for good reason .
Nietzsche warns that one might get hold of the truth about truth too soon , before humankind is strong enough to give up the need for truth .
Look , is n't our need for knowledge precisely this need for the familiar , the will to uncover under everything strange , unusual , and questionable , something that no longer disturbs us ?
Is it not the instinct of fear that bids us to know ?
And is the jubilation of those who attain knowledge not the jubilation over the restoration of a sense of security ? [ 21 ]
Then what might truth become for a person who no longer seeks to restore a feeling of security ?
Nietzsche saw the relationship between our will - to - truth and our need for being : " Man seeks ' the truth ' : a world that is not self - contradictory , not deceptive , does not change , a true world -- a world in which one does not suffer ; contradiction , deception , change -- causes of suffering ! "
( WP 585 ) The will - to - truth manifests will - to - power ; the problem with this form of will is when it thinks the world rather than creates it .
" Actual philosophers , however , are commanders and law - givers ...
Their ' knowing ' is creating , their creating is a law - giving , their will to truth is -- will to power " .
( BGE 211 ) Even basic logical categories reflect our need to perceive things in a stable way .
That some things are equal , that there is such a thing as matter , that things naturally fall into categories : these are fictions , even if more or less indispensable in daily life .
Such instrumental truths work to preserve us and give us a grip on our situation .
In his later writings , when Nietzsche saw through the illusion of a unitary ego - self , he realised that
p. 45 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
these truths derive from the sense - of - self objectifying its own self - image .
Then what would happen if we could cease believing in ego as a self - determining cause ?
If we cling to these ' facts ' for survival , can those who let - go of themselves let go of them ?
Nietzsche does not consider this Buddhist possibility , yet he contemplates " the most extreme form of nihilism " , which might also be called " a divine way of thinking " : the view " that every belief , every considering - something - true , is necessarily false because there simply is no true world .
Thus : a perspectival appearance whose origin lies in us ( in so far as we continually need a narrower , abbreviated , simplified world ) " .
Nietzsche describes this as another reversal : just as our rebaptised evil qualities trade places with our best qualities , so truth becomes lie –
Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are .
Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of life could not live .
The value for life is ultimately decisive . [ 22 ]
-- and lie becomes a kind of truth , for this makes the will to appearance , even the will to deception , " deeper , more metaphysical , than the will to truth " insofar as that will - to - truth is motivated by the need for security .
Nietzsche accordingly calls his own philosophy " inverted Platonism : the further it is from actual reality , the purer , more beautiful , and better it becomes .
Living in illusion as the ideal " .
There are no objective facts , no Immaculate Perception , no ultimate revelation of truth .
Everything becomes a matter of perspective since " there is no solely beatifying interpretation " . [ 23 ]
Like eternal recurrence , perspectivism is a test and an intensification of our will - to - power .
Perspectives gain in power by competing with each other .
Superior perspectives develop by refuting or refining lesser ones .
In this way the will continually surmounts itself , as individuals develop according to their own ability .
Ernest Becker also believes that illusion is necessary .
The Denial of Death starts with an insight of William James : " mankind 's common instinct for reality ... has always held the world to be essentially a theater for heroism " .
Why do we want to be heroes ?
Our narcissistic need for self - esteem mean that each of us yearns to feel of special value , " first in the universe " .
Heroism ( in the broad sense : e.g. Nietzsche as an intellectual hero ) is how we justify that need to count more than anyone or anything else .
Human society can be understood as a codified hero system , a symbolic - action structure whose roles and rules function as a vehicle for heroism .
That raises the essential question :
If transference is a natural function of heroism , a necessary projection in order to stand life , death , and oneself , the question becomes :
What is creative projection ?
What is life - enhancing illusion ? ...
Man needs a ' second ' world , a world of humanly created meaning , a new reality that he can live , dramatise , nourish himself in .
" Illusion " means creative play at its highest level .
Cultural illusion is a necessary ideology of self - justification , a heroic dimension that is life itself to the symbolic animal . [ 24 ]
" The essence of normality is the refusal of reality " , a refusal that Becker , like Nietzsche , justifies as psychologically necessary .
Yet he too goes for what Nietzsche calls the bloody truths , peeling away repressions to arrive at " the potentially most liberating question of all , the main problem of human life :
How empirically true is the cultural hero system that sustains and drives men ? " [ 25 ]
Thus Becker ends up with a double - tiered truth similar to Nietzsche 's , between a life - enhancing illusion and the truth about this illusion , too painful for most of us to cope with .
From the first perspective , the important truths for Becker too are the ones that defend my existence , all the more important if they are believed to help me qualify for eternal existence ( or self - being ,
p. 46 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
according to Buddhism ) .
From the second and deeper perspective , however , the question is how much truth we can bear .
Buddhism also has a two - truths doctrine which distinguishes the usual truth of the everyday world from a higher truth that is not only difficult to understand but dangerous to misunderstand .
The paradigmatic formulation is in chapter 24 of the Mulamadhyamikakarikas [ 26 ] of Nagarjuna , the most important Buddhist philosopher :
The teaching of the Buddhas is wholly based on there being two truths : that of a personal everyday world and a higher truth which surpasses it .
Those who do not clearly know the true distinction between the two truths cannot clearly know the hidden depths of the Buddha 's teaching .
Unless the transactional realm is accepted as a base , the surpassing sense cannot be pointed out ; if the surpassing sense is not comprehended nirvana cannot be attained .
The feeble - minded are destroyed by the misunderstood doctrine of sunyata , as by a snake ineptly seized or some secret knowledge wrongly applied .
For this reason the mind of the enlightened one was averse to teaching the Truth , realising how difficult it would be for those of feeble insight to fathom it .
( MMK XXIV , v. 8 - 12 )
In this version , the higher truth that is fatal to the feeble - minded is sunyata , a term usually translated as ' emptiness ' yet better understood as ' lack of self - existence ' .
In the West the two - truths have often been understood in a Kantian way , as distinguishing the higher Absolute from the relative phenomenal world .
Yet they do not presuppose another Reality transcendent to this world .
If the terms absolute and relative are used , it is better to reverse their meaning : the ' lower truth ' is our usual , commonsense but illusory world of apparently discrete , hence self - existing , unconditioned ( absolute ) things , while the ' higher truth ' is that phenomena are empty of self - existence because they are relative to each other .
Candrakirti's commentary on this MMK passage explains that someone who misunderstands sunyata will reject the self - existence of things only to fall into the opposite extreme of believing that everything is merely illusion , and will get into trouble by ignoring the physical and moral laws of cause - and - effect .
Yet the higher truth is bloodier than that .
Buddhism is more than a philosophy that refutes self - existence : it is a practice which deconstructs our sense - of - self , and letting - go of ourselves in order to realise our own sunyata is seldom easy .
If normality is the refusal of reality , it is because few of us are ready to face the truth about our lack of self - existence and the social games whereby we reassure ourselves .
For many , the alternative to self - illusion is not Becker 's creative play but a nihilism that no longer sees any reason to live .
No wonder , then , that after his enlightenment Sakyamuni Buddha hesitated to teach what he had realised , according to the traditional account .
The problem is not only that we are unable to understand such a difficult doctrine " beyond the reach of reason " ; we resist it , for it does not grant us the kind of salvation we want , a grounding being for the ego - self .
One form of that danger is that we will cling to sunyata , by accepting it as the correct description of the way things are .
So Nagarjuna emphasises that the concept of sunyata is relative to the self - existing things it refutes ; having fulfilled that function , sunyata refutes itself Sunyata is " the exhaustion of all theories and views " and those who make sunyata into a theory are " incurable " .
( MMK XIII , v. 8 ) .
While Nietzsche ends up with an infinity of possible perspectives , Nagarjuna seems to conclude with none , since
p. 47 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
sunyata is merely a heuristic device .
Are these really contradictory , or does the exhaustion of perspectives liberate us for the polyvalence of many perspectives ?
Ultimate serenity is the coming to rest of all ways of taking things , the repose of named things ; no Truth has been taught by a Buddha for anyone , anywhere .
( MMK XXV v. 24 )
If truth is a matter of grasping the symbols that grasp reality , all truth is error on the Buddhist path .
When nirvana is the end of all ways of taking things , the game of truth - and - delusion is turned upside - down .
There is no truth to be taught because nothing needs to be attained ; delusion is something to be unlearned .
In the Diamond Sutra Subhuti asks the Buddha if his realisation of supreme enlightenment means that he has not gained anything .
Just so , Subhuti .
I have not gained the least thing from supreme enlightenment , and that is called supreme enlightenment . [ 27 ]
Buddhism does not provide a metaphysical system to account for reality but shows how to deconstruct the socially - conditioned metaphysical system we know as everyday reality .
It does not give us truths but shows how to become aware of and let go of the automatised truths we are normally not aware of holding .
Buddhism agrees with Nietzsche 's and Becker 's insight that our truth consists of illusions which we have forgotten are illusions , yet the Buddhist path is predicated on the possibility of deconstructing the ones that cause us to suffer : most of all , the ones that maintain our delusive sense - of - self .
The crucial issue is whether our search for truth is another attempt to ground ourselves by fixating on certain concepts that are believed to give us an effective fix on the world .
When there is this compulsion , certain ideas become seductive : i.e. they become ideologies .
The difference between samsara ( this world of suffering ) and nirvana is that samsara is this world experienced as a sticky web of attachments which seem to offer something we feel the lack of , a grounding for the groundless sense - of - self .
Intellectually , that seductive quality manifests as a battleground of conflicting ideologies competing for our allegiance .
Ideologies offer to ground the sense - of - self by providing the mind with a sure grasp on the world : now we know how the world is meaningful and what our role in that meaning is .
Ideology is the assumption that since the beginning and end of history are known there is nothing more to say .
History is therefore to be obediently lived out according to the ideology . [ 28 ]
If there is no specifiable difference between nirvana and the everyday world ( MMK XXV , v. 19 ) then very different ideologies such as religions , metaphysical systems , Marxism and psychoanalysis are in the same dimension insofar as they serve the same psychological function : trying to resolve the sense - of - self 's intellectual sense - of - lack by identifying with a belief - system .
The problem is that ideologies tend to become computer - viruses of the mind .
When we assent to them -- let them in -- ideologies take it over and fill it up .
What , then , is truth ?
A mobile army of metaphors , metonyms , and anthropomorphisms -- in short , a sum of human relations which have been enhanced , transposed , and embellished poetically and rhetorically , and which after long use seem firm , canonical , and obligatory to a people : truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are : metaphors which are worn
p. 48 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
out and without sensuous power ; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal , no longer as coins .
( Nietzsche ) [ 29 ]
As metaphors lose their sensuous power they gain another role , as emblems .
The freshness of the original meaning decays into tokens .
Once objectified and socially - validated , a truth enters the exchange market : it can be gained , possessed , and lost .
Explanations succeed only by convincing resistant hearers of their error .
If you will not hear my explanations until you are suspicious of your own truths , you will not accept my explanations until you are convinced of your error .
Explanation is an antagonistic encounter that succeeds by defeating an opponent .
It possesses the same dynamic of resentment found in other finite play .
I will press my explanations on you because I need to show that I do not live in the error that I think others think that I do .
Whoever wins this struggle is privileged with the claim to true knowledge .
Knowledge has been arrived at , it is the outcome of this engagement .
Its winners have the uncontested power to make certain statements of fact .
They are to be listened to .
In those areas appropriate to the contests now concluded , winners possess a knowledge that can no longer be challenged .
( Carse ) [ 30 ]
In this antagonistic encounter the will - to - truth is readily identifiable as will - to - power .
When sense of lack evaporates because sense - of - self evaporates , however , the seductive web of sarasara transforms into polyvalence , where each viewpoint is able to appreciate others because it no longer identifies with a Truth - project that is threatened by those others .
This is not Nietzsche 's perspectivism , the competition among perspectives each trying to impress its own will - to - truth upon the world , but a non-abiding wisdom that can wander freely among truths since it does not need to fixate on any of them .
Is this relativism , the bugaboo of all value - theory ?
Even if all ideologies are competing in the same intellectual arena , there are some important internal differences .
Many ideologies are difficult to escape once you are committed .
An old - style Marxist who began criticising Marxism would be told to purge himself of his bourgeois tendencies ; a psychoanalyst will tell the analysand that she is resisting .
On the other side are what might be called metaideologies because they are designed to self - negate : to free us from all ideologies including themselves .
Derrida writes about the need to lodge oneself within traditional conceptuality in order to destroy it , [ 31 ] which nicely expresses one of the reasons Nagarjuna insists on two truths : the everyday transactional realm must be accepted in order to point to the higher truth that negates it .
According to Nagarjuna 's Madhyamika Buddhism , sunyata is like a poison - antidote that expels the poison from our bodies and then expels itself , for if the antidote stays inside to poison us we are no better off than before .
The difference between ideologies and meta-ideologies rests on whether the sense - of - self 's anxious groundlessness is to be resolved by providing something to identify with or by letting - go of itself .
Then the important issue is the liberating function of any truth or practice .
The same thought that is liberating in one situation may be binding in another .
Even the most valuable insights can lose their freshness and become ' sticky ' because they are now understood as something to cling to rather than a pointer to freedom ; or rather , clinging to them is now misunderstood as the path to freedom . [ 32 ]

The Nihilism of Eternal Recurrence
If everything manifests the will to power in one way or another , why bother to sublimate ?
Nietzsche found his answer in eternal recurrence , which solves the problem ingeniously : not by grounding this life in some otherworldly eternity but by impressing the form of eternity on this life .
Eternal recurrence has been celebrated as the capstone of his philosophy , yet I shall argue that , instead of vanquishing nihilism , it eternally defers it .
That is because nihilism is not the always - impending debacle of all meaning , but our fear of that debacle and flight from it -- which perpetuates the debacle and gives it power over us .
The dread of nihilism , which Nietzsche rightly saw as our collective shadow , the ghost that haunts Western civilization , is the true nihilism .
From a Buddhist perspective the problem is not our nothingness but the ways we try to evade it .
This puts Nietzsche in the same camp as Plato .
If the Platonic invention of another Reality is an attempt to escape the lack we experience now , so too is Nietzsche 's attempt to fill in the lack of that now by making the now recur eternally .
The basic problem is that eternal recurrence of the now can add nothing unless the now - as - now lacks something .
Again we encounter sense - of - lack , here in its implications for meaning .
This lack is not the meaninglessness of life but the threat of meaninglessness , and therefore it manifests as the devices we use to deny meaninglessness .
In this way too the repressed returns , sublimated into symbols / symptoms .
Tillich believed that the problem of meaninglessness is the form in which non-being poses itself in our time , and that all human life can be interpreted as a continuous attempt to avoid despair . [ 33 ]
He also gave the solution : the meaning of life must be reduced to despair about the meaning of life , in order to take more non-being of the world into ourselves .
Yet one must despair in the right way .
How to overcome nihilism was the fundamental problem for Nietzsche , whose sensitive nose detected its stink almost everywhere .
It is not a late development of Western civilization but man 's normal condition , which is why the Overman is an overcoming of man .
Then does nihilism have an essential connection with lack , also humankind 's normal condition ?
Nietzsche defines nihilism as increasing gloom , then terror at the exhaustion of all meaning , a grand disgust directed at oneself as well as at the world .
Goals are missing , the desert grows .
What Nietzsche , the posthumous man predicted , we post - modem men are now living , and no one can say yet when or how nihilism -- today becoming recognised as a global problem -- might be resolved .
At first , nihilism disguised itself by creating Platonic - type values .
Nihilism shows its disgust at life by creating a " true world " having all the attributes that life does not : unity , stability , identity , goodness , happiness .
This invention of another world is the nihilistic act par excellence because it devalues this world .
The incomplete nihilism which constitutes the development of Western civilisation is the slow decomposition of that true world , and when it finally disappears we are left with this one , the " apparent " world that can no longer be considered apparent if there is nothing to juxtapose it with , yet nonetheless remains devalued and therefore experienced as unsatisfactory .
Nietzsche 's solution to this is eternal recurrence .
As many have noticed , the key to what is otherwise a peculiar doctrine seems to be the ethical motivation behind it .
" The question in each and every thing , ' Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more ? ' would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight " , because this thought would transform us in one way or the other : either crash us under its weight or prompt the supreme affirmation that Zarathustra makes : " Was that life ?
Well then !
Once more ! " [ 34 ]
This would be the great liberation that restores the innocence of Becoming
p. 50 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
because it makes one accountable only to oneself -- which from a Buddhist viewpoint , however , is still one too many .
Given Nietzsche 's attitude towards truth ( " Every philosophy also conceals a philosophy ... " ) , this may have been his self - conscious attempt to promulgate a myth .
" By what myth do you live ? " asked Jung .
Well , this one is better than most .
Like Heidegger 's analysis of death in Being and Time , it can inspire us to live the way we want to live rather than let life pass by while we are making other plans .
For Nietzsche and the early Heidegger , the future is necessary to focus us in the now , for otherwise we are diverted and scattered by chance possibilities .
In lack terms , both try to resolve our sense - of - lack by making the sense - of - self more efficient .
But do their solutions replace one type of evasion with another ?
Unamuno dismissed eternal recurrence as " a sorry counterfeit of immortality " , yet that puts the shoe on the wrong foot : the problem is not that it is a poor immortality but that it is an immortality , which still reflects a felt need to " stamp the form of eternity upon our lives " .
Eternal recurrence seems to exalt the now by refusing to evaluate it according to some other standard or to ground it in some other reality , yet here too the now is weighed and found wanting : its lack can be filled up only by repeating it .
The now as now -- just this !
-- is still not enough .
A Buddhist may agree with Nietzsche that " this life is your eternal life ! " , but the eternity of this life must be understood differently , as a not - falling - away eternal now that , when it lacks nothing , may be discovered to be all we need .
Nietzsche calls eternal recurrence the basic conception of Thus Spake Zarathustra , yet it becomes a dominant theme only near the end of part four .
Zarathustra teaches the Higher Men how to overcome the Spirit of Gravity , and at the beginning of " The Intoxicated Song " one of them asserts : " For the sake of this day -- I am content for the first time to have lived my whole life ...
' Was that -- life ? '
I will say to death .
' Very well !
Once more !' "
At that moment Zarathustra hears the sound of the midnight bell and sings its song , " whose name is ' Once More ' , whose meaning is ' To all eternity ! ' " :
O Man ! Attend !
What does deep midnight 's voice contend ?
' I slept my sleep ,
' And now awake at dreaming 's end :
' The world is deep ,
' Deeper than day can comprehend ,
' Deep is its woe ,
' Joy -- deeper than heart 's agony :
' Woe says : Fade !
Go !
' But all joy wants eternity ,
' -- wants deep , deep , deep eternity !'
This roundelay is so important that it appears at the end of both part three and part four ; and the reason it is so important is that it reveals the origin of eternal recurrence to be joy .
This joy wants to recur eternally , and because it is deeper than the heart 's agony such joy can even will that suffering to recur again too , if necessary for its own recurrence .
Did you ever say Yes to one joy ?
O my friends , then you said Yes to all woe as well .
All things are chained and entwined together , all things are in love ;
If you ever wanted one moment twice , if you ever said : ' You please me , happiness , instant , moment ! ' then you wanted everything to return . [ 35 ]
p. 51 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
Alas , for the failure of Nietzsche 's moment of joy !
However deep it was it was not deep enough , for he needed it again , and again ...
" Joy , however , does not want heirs or children , joy wants itself , ... wants everything eternally the same . "
( Z , p. 331 )
This reaction is natural yet nonetheless ruinous .
Ironically , that very desire for its recurrence is the worm which burrows in to destroy it , as in those most - cherished musical moments that inspire us to think " this is so beautiful , I wish it would never stop " -- only to discover that the moment has ceased , destroyed by the self - consciousness which reflexively distinguishes itself from the music in order to enjoy enjoying it .
Nietzsche yearns for that moment of joy again , because it absolves his sense of lack , yet his desire for its recurrence is itself part of the problem that the deepest joy resolves .
For contrary to his roundelay the deepest joy does not even will to recur : it wills nothing because it lacks nothing , if it is the deepest joy .
By wanting to retain that joy Nietzsche separates himself from it and thereby loses it into the past as a memory , then can only try to bring it back by willing the recurrence of everything -- not realising that his moment of pure joy was a temporary collapse of willing .
Since the will - to - power always strives to overcome itself , it must project a future , which is why the only consummation it can attain is in the eternal recurrence of such moments .
However , striving to find the past in the future is less a formula for joy than a psychoanalytic definition of neurosis .
What is attractive about eternal recurrence is that it foregoes the need for any other Reality to compensate for the defects of this one .
It is an affirmation of this world , yet this world not as let - go but as grasped - at , fixated by being brought back again and again .
" Very well : once more ! " is his deep affirmation ; yet deeper would be : " To all that has been : thanks !
To all that will be : yes ! "
To say yes ! to a single moment of joy , completely affirming it , is by definition an experience of no lack .
At that instant one wants nothing else , no void needs to be filled in or evaded , which means ( if , as Buddhism implies , sense - of - lack is the shadow of sense - of - self ) that this must be a moment of egolessness .
Then one cannot have such a joy , one can only be such a joy .
Blessed are those who have had or rather been such a moment , for it transforms all other moments as well -- although not because of the entwined contingency that Nietzsche refers to .
" An affirmation that is truly full and complete is also contagious : it bursts into a chain of affirmations that knows no limits . " ( Haar ) [ 36 ]
Yes , but this chain is not each contingent affirmation causing another .
Just the opposite : a complete affirmation breaks all causal chains .
The joy of just this !
-- the Buddhist experience of tathata thusness -- needs nothing , desires nothing , and thus reveals that the causal chain is a succession of just this !
in an eternal - now where there is nothing to gain or lose .
Paradoxically , when the causal chain is such a succession , our experience is that there is no causal chain and no succession .
As long as we experience the causal chain as a means to get somewhere else , we lose just this / and the eternal - now .
In sum , life becomes joyous not when we get something from it but when we become it .
So a moment of deepest joy does not banish woe by discovering the interdependence of joy with eve everything else , past and future .
Rather , it reveals that what we thought was the means for solving our lack is what maintains the problem .
End of lack is not an effect that can be experienced at the conclusion of some causal chain , but the shattering of all causal chains insofar as they are our means for trying to overcome lack .
Eternity is found not in the recurrence of time but in the evaporation of that objectified time whereby and wherein we hope to end our lack .
This realisation is embodied in perhaps Nagarjuna 's most important verse , which distinguishes between samsara and nirvana :
p. 52 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
That which , taken as causal or dependent , is the process of being - born and passing on , is , taken non-causally and beyond all dependence , declared to be nirvana .
( MMK XXV , v. 9 ) [ 37 ]
Nirvana cannot be caused and therefore cannot be attained .
We might think of it as some kind of substratum pervading all our experience but that is still too dualistic : it is simply the nature of our experience when there is not the delusive sense of a self - conscious yet ungrounded self that has the experience and therefore feels something to be lacking in it .
The joy of that experience is deeper than the heart 's agony .
On this account , happiness in the form we seek it -- " that too - hasty profit snatched from approaching loss " [ 38 ] -- can not be gained .
All we can do is realise that nondual " perspective " where nothing has ever been lacking .
The amor fati Nietzsche celebrates is not accepting everything due to its interdependence with a moment of complete Yes !
but the absence of any need to will that things be any different .
The amor is not willing that everything be exactly the same , over and over again , but that everything be as it is ; that , however , is not something which needs to be willed .
Or , finally , which can be willed .
In The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche came close to this : only as an aesthetic phenomenon is existence justified , which amounts to saying that existence experienced aesthetically does not need to be justified .
Are what we call " aesthetic experiences " tip - of - the - tongue tastes of something that we have always been immersed in ?
Instead of yielding to this groundlessness , eternal recurrence is a last gasp at self - grounding being , for it attempts to fill up lack by discovering a being within becoming .
" That everything recurs is the closest approximation of a world of becoming to a world of being " ( WP 617 ) .
Nietzsche can find infinite value in the now only by having it recur an infinite number of times .
Therefore he ends up not with the end of nihilism but with another , more willful reconstitution of it .
For Buddhism the problem of lack can be resolved only by ceasing to avoid it and instead becoming - one with it : letting - go of oneself and falling into the void , in order to realise that the void is not really void but the nondual realm of the Buddha - dharma , as Ch'an master Huang - po put it .
What does this mean in terms of nihilism ?
To stop evading the debacle of all meaning and accept it , which requires experiencing the meaninglessness of one 's life -- an anguish not to be recommended lightly .
Such understanding of the solution also transforms our understanding of the problem , for this solution is usually understood as the problem .
This implies that true nihilism is less the debacle of meaning than our terror of that debacle and the ways we flee it , which includes a compulsive need to find some meaning in life as a bulwark against that threat .
If so , nihilism is not our lack but the fear and denial of that lack , experienced in this instance as impending loss of meaning .
Insofar as Nietzsche 's will - to - power is in flight from lack , then , the will - to - power is nihilism .
Eternal Recurrence insures that flight will have no cloture , for it tries to fill up lack by flight itself , by repeated recurrence of the passing moment .
Thus eternal recurrence would not be final victory over nihilism , but the final victory of nihilism : in grasping at the fleeting now by making it recur , it misses and loses the now that right now does - not - fall - away , and deflects us from the opposite solution of yielding to the nonbeing we most dread , which we might discover to be not so dreadful after all .
The " discovery " of objective meaning is one of our main ways of dealing with lack .
As Zarathustra points out , man assigns values to things only to maintain himself .
We can usually cope with anxiety and guilt as long as we know what the meaning of life is , for there is security in that even if we do n't always do what that meaning implies we
p. 53 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
should do .
However , such meaning - systems corrupt " the innocence of becoming " because in projecting and understanding them as objective we repress the fact that these meanings are our own creations , socially - constructed and - validated .
Insofar as they originate in lack they are based on fear , so a test of our maturity is whether we are able to face that fear .
" It is a measure of the degree of strength of will to what extent one can do without meaning in things , to what extent one can endure to live in a meaningless world because one organises a small portion of it oneself . "
( WP 585A )
If the autonomy of ego - self is a delusion , we can see why that is difficult .
Common - sense subject - object dualism presumes the sense - of - self to be the locus of awareness ; subjectivism goes further to make the subject the only source of value and meaning , which devalues the world into a field - of - activity wherein the self labours to fulfill itself .
Apparently objective meanings paper over the problem of lack because they provide some objective security .
In order for the illusory self to feel secure , however , its meanings must be unconsciously projected .
The sun that motivates me must not be realised to be my own creation , if I am to be inspired by it .
When I am aware of constructing my own meaning , the absence of any external grounding for that meaning means I have nothing to lean upon .
The natural response is a deepened sense of lack , experienced as anguish and ontological guilt : by what right do I create such meanings ?
Who am I to decide that this is the way to live ?
Juxtaposing the possibilities in this way clarifies the Buddhist approach , which contra Nietzsche does not find any solution in strength of will .
If the collapse of objective meaning exposes my sense of lack , that will be painful yet it is nonetheless desirable , since becoming aware of my lack is necessary in order to eventually solve it .
Then realising the subjectivity of meaning does not by itself resolve the matter , for it becomes a stage to be endured in order to realise something else .
If despair is a stage , however , one must despair in the right way .
Odd as it sounds , the danger with despair is that one will cling to it .
In Kierkegaard 's school of anxiety ( recommended in The Concept of Anxiety ) despair is the final exam : it dredges up our most cherished meanings and devours them , leaving us disconsolate .
But we do not become completely empty unless despair devours us wholly and also itself .
Despair ( literally " no hope " ) is the reverse side of hope and both are relative to the sense - of - self , for the ego - self alternates between the hope it will finally fixate itself and the dread it never will .
Then despair evaporates with the self , like the matter and anti-matter of particle physics which disappear by collapsing back into each other .
Yet often this does not happen , because when despair finally occurs after a lifetime of avoiding it , it appears with a force that makes it seem more real than the meanings it roots out , which had been used to repress it .
From the Buddhist standpoint , the recurring thoughts and feelings that constitute despair are no more real and no less impermanent than any other thoughts and feelings .
When we despair , however , our usual psychological defenses fail and we identify with self - pitying thoughts and self - destructive inclinations .
Then , instead of despair consuming the self , it reinforces the worthlessness of that self .
We end up not becoming - nothing but with a sense - of - self nourishing itself on self - disgust .
This is the " reactive " tendency that so disgusted Nietzsche and he saw what the problem is : " He who despises himself still nonetheless respects himself as one who despises . "
( BGE 78 ) Man would rather will nothingness than not will . [ 39 ]
Yet the void Huang - po recommends is not something that can be willed .
When we despair in the right way , what happens ?
Abandoning the hope that we will eventually become something , we yield to our nothingness and discover how we have always been everything .
As Dogen expressed it in Genjokoan , to forget oneself is to be
p. 54 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
actualised by myriad things , which is to perceive oneself as all things .
What does such mutual interpenetration imply about the meaning of life ?
For Buddhism , meaning too is neither objective nor subjective .
Life is neither meaningful nor meaningless but what might be called meaningfree .
To forget oneself ad become nothing is to wake up and find oneself in or , less dualistically , as a situation -- not confronted by it but one with it -- and if one is not self - preoccupied then meaning arises naturally within that situation .
As Buber put it , you start with yourself in order to forget yourself and immerse yourself in the world ; you understand yourself in order not to be preoccupied with yourself .
The existential psychotherapist Irvin Yalom has discussed the formidable problem posed by the ' galactic ' point of view , which seems to trivialise us into microscopic specks flickering in the vast expanse of cosmic time .
He points out that this renders life meaninglessness only from that perspective , a perspective that moreover is delusive from the Buddhist point of view : it abstracts me from my actual situation , yet there is no such " sub specie aeternitas " perspective outside our various perspectives .
We are nondual with the whole only by virtue of our particular position within that whole .
We are free to experience and appreciate different perspectives , but there is no perspectiveless - perspective .
The therapist 's goal , according to Yalom , is :
not to create engagement nor to inspirit the patient with engagement -- these the therapist cannot do .
But it is not necessary : the desire to engage life is always there within the patient , and the therapist 's clinical activities should be directed toward removal of obstacles in the patient 's way . [ 40 ]
Searching for the meaning of life is searching for something that enables us to stop searching .
When lack comes to an end , so does the problem of meaninglessness .
And life becomes ... play . [ 41 ]
Conclusion
Mature manhood : that means to have rediscovered the seriousness one had as a child at play .
( BGE 94 )
For Nietzsche , like Derrida today , the death of God unleashes limitless play . [ 42 ]
Yet whether our god has died or not , we are already playing .
The question is not whether we play but how .
Do we suffer our games as if they were life - or - death struggles , because they are the means whereby we hope to ground ourselves , or do we dance with the light feet that Nietzsche called the first attribute of divinity ?
His philosophising exceeds any system that can be constructed out of it , for , the will to power notwithstanding , it demonstrates how thinking can be such play .
I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher might wish more to be than a dancer .
For the dance is his ideal , also his art , and finally also his only piety , his ' service of God . '
( GS 381 )
A friend once complained to Samuel Johnson that he had tried to be a philosopher but cheerfulness kept breaking in ; Nietzsche shows that the two need not be incompatible .
Zarathustra teaches three metamorphoses : from camel ( a weight - bearing spirit ) to lion ( who captures freedom ) to the child , who " is innocence and forgetfulness , a new beginning ... a sacred Yes . "
Unless we become children , we shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven -- which does not mean that children will enter therein , for they are already there , since without a matured sense - of - self they do not yet have a debilitating sense - of - lack .
p. 55 Beyond good and evil ?
A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche Asian Philosophy , Vol. 6 , No. 1 ( March 1996 )
Of course , the normal child can soon distinguish easily and quickly between what adults call ' real life ' and ' play . '
The more psychological way of stating the matter is to say that the child acts out his fantasies and seriously tries , through the play - situation , to resolve conflicts in which these fantasies play a part .
But he normally recognises reasonably well which of these selves and lives are defined as real by the adults around him ; and he learns to go along with their game -- until finally he is quite unaware that it was their game , for it is now his , too . [ 43 ]
One grows up by learning the socially - acceptable ways to try to overcome lack .
Becker , like Nietzsche , concludes that ' childlike foolishness ' is the calling of mature men . [ 44 ]
But few of us are ready to hear it .
" So the grand destiny of man is ... to play ? "
Does our incredulity reflect the absurdity of the proposal , or how far we have trudged from the Garden of Eden ?
Perhaps the negative connotations of the word reveal less about play than about us : our self - importance , our need to stand out from the rest of creation ( and from the rest of our fellows ) by accomplishing great things -- the ones we hope will make us more real .
We are to play not because there is nothing else to do , not because the lack of some higher meaning means we just while away our time , but because we realise the nature of meaning and time .
This is not inconsistent with the selflessness of the bodhisattva , for loss of self - preoccupation is what makes true play possible , what enables the bodhisattva to manifest the liberation he or she teaches :
To be playful is not to be trivial or frivolous , or to act as though nothing of consequence will happen .
On the contrary , when we are playful with each other we relate as free persons , and the relationship is open to surprise ; everything that happens is of consequence .
It is , in fact , seriousness that closes itself to consequence , for seriousness is a dread of the unpredictable outcome of open possibility .
To be serious is to press for a specified conclusion .
To be playful is to allow for possibility whatever the cost to oneself . [ 45 ]
The problem , ultimately , is ' not enjoying yourself ' , Nietzsche 's definition of original sin which is as good a definition of lack .
This fits nicely with an equally simple definition of Buddhism offered by the Vietnamese teacher Thich Nhat Hanh : a clever way to enjoy your life .

I assume that it is valuable to discover / construct a consistent philosophy .
My interpretation of eternal recurrence is more ' literal ' than is fashionable nowadays , yet there is abundant textual support for it .
In my opinion the apparent absurdity of such an identical repetition , rather than any lack of textual evidence , has led to the vast literature denying its literality .
But to argue for this would leave little space for the rest of the paper .

The " need for legitimate foolishness " was Otto Rank 's cure for neurosis .
No matter how you look at it , President Putin also brought order to Chechnya : at least they ’re no longer flying young Russian soldiers back in body bags every day .
And if television is offering more humorous programs and songs from around the world instead of political discussions , people only welcome this .
As for opposition parties , the real ones , they quarreled among themselves and became so indistinguishable in their radical demands that the people , with President Putin ’s help , stopped taking note of them .

For the majority of Russians , Mr. Putin will enter history as a positive figure .
That during his rule he actively relied on his K.G.B. colleagues does n’t bother a lot of people .
Whom else should he lean on in his struggle to impose order ?
He worked with the human material that came to him from the depth of Russian history , people who to this day drink , steal and consider politics a source of personal power and enrichment .
If Mr. Putin preferred not to be trusting , it was because he clearly sensed the rot in the national gene pool .
That he went too far in some things , that he irritated Europe , that he was sometimes vindictive  these are separate matters .
His friends in the K.G.B. were raised on hatred for the West .
Now , at least , they limit themselves for the most part to negative rhetoric about the West .
So there is progress .
Mr. Putin gave his people faith in tomorrow :
It ’s no accident that Russia today is full of packed restaurants , game parlors , casinos , discothèques , cars and books about everything from Buddhism to homosexuality .
Mr. Putin was lucky all eight of his years in office : oil prices rose , Russia grew rich and life became good .
Private life remains remarkably free .
His biggest mistake was his longing to make Russia the successor to the Soviet Union : this gave rise to the imperial discourse that so frightened neighboring countries , his defense of the Soviet Union ’s aggressive foreign policy and the damage to Russia ’s image in the world .
What ’s worse is that our next president , Dmitri A. Medvedev , whom President Putin chose as his heir as if he were a czar , will have to deal with the Russian weaknesses that were hidden from the population under propaganda slogans .
The failure to modernize industry or agriculture , the growing corruption in government , the ubiquitous drunkenness , the record numbers of murders and suicides , the terrible state of Russian health care and the problems that come with a shrinking population will fall on Mr. Medvedev ’s young shoulders .
Nobody , probably not even President Putin , knows Mr. Medvedev ’s real goals and values .
He was never a public politician  though the talk on the street , not shared by dissidents , makes him out to be liberal , cultured , moderate and even pro-Western .
As a young man he fought for democracy on the side of the future mayor of St. Petersburg , Anatoly Sobchak , and he was never noted for professional connections to the secret services .
Yet his close ties to his current chief speak , at least , to limitless patience and self - limitation .

If you had died 50 years ago , your body would have stood a pretty good chance of serving science .
In the 1960s , autopsy rates at US hospitals exceeded 50 percent .
Pathologists were n't necessarily looking for what killed people — they were taking advantage of the fact that a body was available and ready for inspection .
There was still much to learn about normal human biology , the thinking went , so every corpse was an educational opportunity .
These days , autopsy rates have fallen below 10 percent , a decline that 's symptomatic of a larger deficiency .
Medicine has become all about finding a problem — a tumor , a heart attack , a failing kidney — and deploying advanced treatment technologies .
In the process , we seem to have given up on measuring and tracking what constitutes normal .
That 's an alarming — and potentially dangerous — trend .
What 's normal matters because we 're entering a new era of health care , one in which we look not for causes of illness but for risks .
It 's called predictive medicine , and its primary tool is the screening test .
A good screening test should provide a range of results , distinguishing between a condition within normal parameters — which does n't require intervention — and an anomaly , which demands it .
That 's how most blood tests work , for instance .
But for all sorts of conditions , there 's often no definition of normal .
In heart disease , for example , CT screening tests can spot abnormalities in arterial plaque — but no research exists on whether that information is actually predictive of heart disease or stroke .
" We need to know normal variation , " says Pat Brown , a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine .
" It 's really underappreciated as a part of science . "
In too many areas , Brown argues , we 're too quick to jump at any blip without understanding whether it's a true red alert or just normal background noise .
Consider prostate cancer .
Right now , about two - thirds of men diagnosed with the disease get treated with surgery or radiation ( both of which carry a significant risk of impotence or incontinence ) .
But in February , researchers at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey found that 80 percent of men over age 66 with detectable prostate cancer who do nothing ( so - called watchful waiting ) will likely die of something else .
In other words , most of those who get treatment — and could be impotent as a result — should have gone without it .
" We 're way overtreating the disease , " says Peter Nelson , an oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle .
" Really , you only want to know about the ones that are potentially fatal . "
Ironically , this problem is brought on by technology .
Imaging and scanning tools are now so good at peering inside our bodies , they 've surpassed our capacity to interpret the results .
Many findings are what doctors call " incidentalomas , " smudges that look like cancer but turn out — often after surgery — to be benign .
Though new detection technologies like proteomics have made great progress in associating particular biomarkers with certain cancers or diseases , we still do n't know how often those same markers turn up in nondisease situations .
It seems like it would be easy just to step back and survey the broad picture .
But research costs money , and studying what 's normal is generally considered trivial , dismissed as mere butterfly collecting .
At the National Institutes for Health , for instance , all grants are given a " priority score , " an indication of a project 's novelty , originality , and " scientific merit . "
Normal need not apply .
But in these data - rich days , studying what 's normal could be a project of startling originality and merit .
With petabytes of storage and ample processing power at hand , there 's an opportunity to create a sort of Normal Human Project — a macro understanding of human biology on a micro scale .
Or , as Stanford 's Brown describes it , a " comprehensive , quantitative molecular and cellular characterization of the normal human . ' "
That may sound daunting , but complementary projects are already under way .
Seattle 's Allen Institute for Brain Science , having completed a 3 - D model of the mouse brain in 2006 , is now aiming to model the human brain in its normal state .
Even postmortem examinations are coming back into vogue , via high - volume autopsy centers , which can add their results to resources like Johns Hopkins ' online autopsy database .
The annals of medicine are full of tidy explanations of how the body works , from Dr. Atkins all the way back to Hippocrates .
Inevitably , though , someone comes along and shows that there 's a little more to it .
It would be wise , as Brown suggests , " to accept the fact that we do n't know a tremendous amount about things we think we know .
We could learn some humility . "
That , however , may be asking too much of science .

US Banking System in Crisis -
Why banks are Not lending ?
Here 's an eye opener .
The attached report from the St. Louis Fed on banks ' non-borrowed reserves shows that it has just gone down in flames .
According to the chart , the amount of money that banks have in reserve that is non-borrowed is not only at a 50 - year low , but has entered negative territory for the first time since these statistics have been kept .
Does this mean our banks are now insolvent ?
Frankly , I do n't have an answer , but this information is very disturbing , to say the least .
The FDIC is gearing up for it , too .
Mr. William M. Isaac , former chairman of he FDIC , has written an article that also reflects what I have been commenting about in the past weeks .
Here are a couple of his observations , “ Do we want the Fed underwriting takeovers of failing firms ?
Are we willing to allow that to happen without a competitive bidding process , which is routinely used when insured banks fail ?
Would we want the Fed to rescue an insurance company ?
How about an auto company ?
In short , what are the rules going forward ?
I 'm delighted the liquidity crisis has eased ( Has it ? ) , and I believe the Fed had a big hand in that .
But I 'm deeply troubled by the precedent that has been set and the implications for our financial system . ”
“ That 's where the money is … ”
... the quote is attributed to Willie Sutton , the famous bank robber .
The irony is , he never said those words .
He believes that , “ The credit belongs to some enterprising reporter who apparently felt a need to fill out his copy ... ”
But one thing is certain , the investment bankers are going where the money is …
Asia .
According to Dealogic , which supplies IT solutions to the banking industry , the number of acquisitions by private equity in Asia - excluding Japan - rose 15 % in the first quarter of the year while worldwide deals fell .
A vote of “ no confidence . ”
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. stocks fell on Friday and were poised for weekly losses , as crude oil surged above $ 133 a barrel , putting renewed pressure on a market besieged by worries that inflation will crimp consumption and further weaken the economy .
Last week I asked whether there might be a crisis in confidence in the markets .
The market had seemed to be going up despite the bad news .
It now appears that the accumulation of bad news may be taking its toll .
Skeptical about inferred relationships .
( Reuters ) - U.S. Treasury debt prices plunged on Thursday as worries over rising inflation , fueled by soaring energy prices , boosted expectations the Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates to fight price pressures .
Analysts have long warned that should energy and food price surges become ingrained trends , longer - maturity bo nd yields may spike at some point .
Inflation erodes a bond 's value over time .
As a result , we have seen bond values decline over the last two months .
On the technical side , there may be a brief rally if the decline in stocks accelerates .
However , this may not be the start of an uptrend .
The bulls are back … but for how long ?
( Reuters ) -
Gold bounced Friday , capping a week of solid gains on the back of a sharp crude oil rally and after a drop from a one - month high spurred buying from bargain hunters .
The news has certainly been encouraging for gold investors .
However , they are still going against the larger trend .
Speculation is still strong , but the long - term buyers in Asia are holding back from larger purchases .
Purchases for jewellery and investment fell 50 percent in the first quarter of 2008 in India due to high prices , the World Gold Council has said .
India 's jewellery and investment demand stood at 71 tonnes and 31 tonnes , respectively .
The gain chasers were set up for a disappointment .
( Bloomberg ) --
Most Japanese stocks fell , dragged down by trading companies and shipping lines , as commodity prices and cargo rates declined .
The Nikkei index rose 33.74 points today , but did not regain the losses earlier in the week .
It has begun to follow the U.S. markets , which have been in decline since Tuesday .
.
China has a mess to clean up .
SHANGHAI , China : Chinese stocks fell Friday as investors sold shares in companies that had gained on speculation over possible profits in reconstruction projects after last week 's earthquake .
Trading volume was thin as investors also awaited cues on whether China 's economic growth will maintain its momentum or be sapped by weakness in the U.S. economy .
Is the gloomy outlook going to affect the dollar ?
The dollar put in its worst weekly performance for two months against the euro after the Federal Reserve painted a gloomy picture of the US economy and oil prices hit record levels on Wednesday .
The minutes of the Fed's April meeting revealed that officials were concerned over rising inflationary risks while downgrading their assessment of the US economy .
The overriding concern was that the employment situation was projected to deteriorate and the housing market showed no sign of bottoming .
Housing starts its next series of declines … the biggest yet .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) - A home - price index considered to be the most comprehensive reading of the U.S. market posted the sharpest quarterly decline in its 17 - year history , and analysts say housing has yet to bottom out .
Freddie Mac 's reported net loss last quarter of $ 151 million , which was smaller than analysts ' estimates .
In reality , Freddie is gushing much more red ink than that .
Yet hardly any of it is showing up on the company 's income statement .
It has listed $ 32.4 billion in losses as “ temporary , ” meaning that the assets with the losses are available for sale , but Freddie has not yet found a buyer .
Some of these “ temporary ” losses have been on the books for over two years !
This begs the question , “ How long is temporary ? ” Problem is , the losses are twice the size of total shareholder equity … bailout , anyone ?
Capitulation at the pump .
For years , it was not clear whether rising prices would ever prompt Americans to use less gas .
But a combination of record prices , the slowing economy and a tight credit market have beaten consumers down .
Gasoline demand has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and is headed for the first annual drop in 17 years , according to government estimates .
“ The psychology has changed , ” said Sara Johnson , an economist at Global Insight .
“ People have recognized that prices are not going down and are adapting to higher energy costs .
It 's a capitulation . ”
… just when you thought it could n't get any worse …
The Energy Information Administration 's This Week In Petroleum tells us that ; “ This year , daily retail gasoline prices reported by AAA have climbed every day since May 5 , and EIA 's weekly retail gasoline survey has increased steadily since March 24 .
A dramatic increase in the price of crude oil , rather than the transition to summer - grade gasoline or the start of the peak summer driving season , has been the main driver in pushing gasoline prices higher so far this spring . ”
Low stockpiles and speculators keep prices high .
May 23 ( Bloomberg.com ) --
Natural gas futures advanced , following crude oil , as a declining dollar increased the lure of commodities as an investment .
Returns from investing in commodities , especially energy , have gained this year as investors sought alternatives to stocks .
Natural gas has gained 58 percent and oil is 39 percent higher .
A slower - than - average increase in gas stockpiles last week also lifted prices .
Squatters and scams coming to your neighborhood ?
Squatting is on the rise across the United States as foreclosures surge , eviction notices mount and homes go unsold for months , complicating the worst U.S. housing slump in a quarter century and forcing real - estate brokers to enlist the help of law enforcement and courts to sell empty houses .
In some regions , squatting is taking on new twists to include real - estate scams in which thieves " rent out " abandoned homes they do n't own .
Others involve " professional squatters " who move from one abandoned home to another posing as tenants who seek cash from banks as a condition to leave the premises -- a process known by real - estate brokers as " cash for key . "
We 're on the air every Friday .

I was hoping you might take some time and read over my Banking Solution webpage !
As far as I know , there is no one else even attempting to offer a " complete " solution to our economic problems -- but as you 'll see , I have attempted to do so .
Yes , it 's controversial -- to fix the entire system , any true solution will be controversial -- but I sincerely believe it 's the one and only true solution !
I 've been working on this for 30 years ....

The reason why reserves are low is because most people have either lost their job or have had their pay affected by the economy ... so they dont have as much money in as they did .
that and you media guys like to deny the fact the fed is a private bank charging interest on every dollar printed since 1913 .... and have complete monopoly over the issuance of american currency
CYCLING PERFORMANCE TIPS
Last updated : xxxxxxxxx
Hills / Climbing Tips
Before I cover a few climbing tips , here is an interesting comment pertaining to the ideal physique of a competitive climber from a contributor in roadbikerider.com .
How Can a Small Guy Ride So Strongly ?
Question : I began riding last year and recently met my first professional cyclist in person .
He 's a good climber on a U.S. pro team .
I 'm astonished at how small he is !
He looks skinny , emaciated and weak .
But I know he can ride circles around me even though I 'm an athletic 6 - footer and 190 pounds .
How can such an unimposing person put out so much power ?
I want to climb like him ! -- Bradley N .
Comment :
When you 're familiar with athletes in most conventional sports , it 's a shock to see how small and thin top cyclists are .
The rule for climbing prowess :
You should weigh ( in pounds ) no more than twice your height in inches .
So at 6 feet ( 72 inches ) you 'd need to weigh 144 pounds rather than 190 .
Pro cycling tends to select lean , light - bodied athletes in the same way that the profile of a mastodon is required for football linemen .
Climbing ability is crucial in racing , and it depends on the power - to - weight ratio .
A light rider does n't need to generate as much power as his heavier competitor because he has less weight to propel up hills .
In the 2005 Tour de France with 189 starters , here 's the profile of the average rider :
Height -- 1.79 meters ( 5 feet , 10.4 inches )
Weight -- 71 kilograms ( 156.2 pounds )
Resting heart rate -- 50 bpm
Lung capacity -- 5.69 liters ( 1.48 gallons )
Now on to the tips .
STAY SEATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
Although you develop more power while standing ( you are taking advantage of all your upper body weight pushing down on the pedals ) , you also use 10 to 12 % more energy as your pelvis is n't in contact with the saddle which means more work for your core and back muscles as you pull up on the unweighted pedal .
The net effect is more energy used ( less efficient ) to climb standing versus to climb seated .
On short climbs , the length of a football field or less , it makes little difference .
But on longer climbs , stay in the saddle and spin at 80 - 85 RPM .
This is particularly so if you are heavier as standing puts just that much more weight on your leg muscles , while sitting uses the seat to help take the extra upper body weight off your legs .
Staying in the saddle will :
burn less energy - heart rate is approximately 8 % lower for any set speed
use your bigger gluteal ( butt ) and hip muscles to your advantage
Want to train for climbing hills while seated ??
Here is a drill you might consider .
Go hard up short hills while seated .
Find a climb that 's moderately steep and takes about 30 seconds to crest .
Hit it hard at the bottom in a fairly large gear .
Beware of letting your cadence slow by the top .
Use a gear that lets you pedal at 90 rpm or more all the way up .
Start with two or three reps and increase as your strength improves .
That having been said , on long , fairly steep climbs , it may provide a break to alternate sitting and standing to employ different muscle groups .
Just before you stand , shift to the next smaller cog , then shift back when you sit .
These gear changes will help you maintain a steady pace during cadence changes .
And if you are going to stand , let the bike rock side to side under you - an arc of maybe 6 inches side to side .
And do n't lean too far forward .
Stay back so that your weight is directly over the crank .
BODY POSITION
HAND POSITION
Comfort overrides these comments , but for seated climbing , most riders prefer to keep their hands on top of the bars , perhaps 2 or 3 inches from the center stem .
A wide grip on the top of the handlebar reduces breathing restriction .
And remember to drop your elbows and relax your upper body .
For out of the saddle climbing or aggressive climbs ( where you are accelerating or attacking on the saddle ) put your thumbs on the hoods and rest one or two fingers on the levers or wrapped around underneath .
And when you get to that descent , most riders will go to the drops ( keeping your wrists straight ) for the aerodynamic advantages although others prefer the hoods for the feeling of control .
But not the top of the bars as your hands will be too far from the brakes .

And remember to drop your elbows and relax your upper body .
UPPER BODY STILL AND CHEST OPEN
Keep your upper body quiet - the bike should rock under you ( try pulling up on the handlebar opposite of the leg on a down stroke ) .
Too much movement wastes energy .
And your shoulders should be back and " open " .
If not , you are constricting your chest and cannot breathe efficiently .

Too much movement wastes energy .
And your shoulders should be back and " open " .
If not , you are constricting your chest and cannot breathe efficiently .
SIT BACK ON THE SADDLE
When you slide back on your seat , you gain a leverage advantage on the pedals .
The only time you would want to slide forward is for a short sprint on a small rise .
WHEN YOU MUST STAND - pedaling while standing
Remember that if you are in a group , you need to consciously protect those behind you when you stand to climb .
How you stand on a hill is very important - do it wrong and the guy behind might suddenly be on the pavement .
The issue is the brief deceleration that can occur as you change from sitting to standing incorrectly , which , relative to other riders has the effect of sending your bike backwards and can cause the following rider 's front wheel to hit your rear wheel .
On short , rolling hills , the trick is to click to the next higher gear ( smaller cog ) , then stand and pedal over the top with a slightly slower cadence .
This keeps quads from loading up with lactate because it helps you pedal with body weight .
In fact , it can actually feel like you 're stretching and refreshing your legs .
The correct way to stand :
It is good etiquette to announce " Standing ! " a couple of pedal strokes before you do so .
Stand smoothly as one foot begins its downward power stroke - do n't lunge , keep your effort constant .
As you come off the saddle , push your hands forward a bit .
This helps to ensure that the bike wo n't lose ground .
When returning to the saddle , continue pedaling evenly and again push your hands forward to counteract any tendency to decelerate .
This will gain several inches and put the seat right under you .
FIND YOUR SPEED AND RHYTHM
Use the right gears and shift early to balance the work of your muscles and aerobic system .
New riders often make the mistake of pushing their muscles until they cannot push any more .
When they decide to shift to an easier gear -- if they have one -- it is often too late .
The muscles are exhausted and unable to continue .
KEEP THAT CADENCE UP
Think about this .
If you ride up the hill in two minutes at 60 rpm , you 've divided the total work into 120 pieces ( consider each revolution of your pedals as a unit of work ) .
But if you spin at 90 , there would be 180 .
As you 've done the same elevation gain , but now broken it into smaller bits , there will be less work ( and strain on the knees ) with each revolution .
( And if you do have knee problems , take a break and stand during hills - which will change the biomechanics and give your knees a break ) .
Gear down before the hill .
The goal is to avoid producing large quantities of lactic acid and then pedaling through the pain .
You want a sustainable rhythm .
Try to keep your cadence above 70 -- any slower puts excess stress on your knees .
The optimum spin rates for efficient pedaling are somewhere between 70 and 80 .
One rider reported that he actually went faster as he increased his cadence in a lower gear .
For example , he would maintain 6.5 mph at 50 rpm in one gear and then , as he geared down , he found he maintained 8 mph at 70 rpm without a perceived increase in effort .
If you find that things are going well , you can always shift to a harder gear later .
Try to find the cadence that would let you " climb all day " .
You are pushing too hard if you :
ca n't keep a smooth pedal stroke
are panting or breathing irregularly
OFF SEASON WEIGHT TRAINING
TRAINING FOR CLIMBING - DO SOME HILLS
If you are going to be riding hills as part of an event or a tour , you might consider building up weekly climbing volume to around 125 % of event climbing volume .
If it is a one day event , aim to climb at least 60 % of event elevation change volume on several rides .
For example , if the event has 10,000 feet of climbing , you must climb 6,000 feet in training in one day , several times .
And do n't foget to train for technique as well .
Find a hill that 's 1 /4 to 1/2 mile long - not too steep .
Find the gear that lets you spin at 100 rpm all the way to the top .
Keep your breathing steady .
If you start panting , the gear is too high .
Then find a higher gear that reduces your cadence to around 50 rpm , but again without causing you to have labored breathing .
Now the exercise : Climb the hill in the low gear with a fast cadence .
Work on spinning smoothly .
Coast back down and then climb the hill in the higher gear ( slow cadence ) concentrating on applying an equal force all the way around the pedal stroke .
Repeat the cycle ( 4 total climbs )
WATCH THAT WEIGHT
GROUP RIDING TECHNIQUES
One trick for weaker climbers in a group is to move near the front of the group near the start of the climb and allow others to pass as the climb continues .
In that way , you will be near the back at the top but wo n't get dropped and have to fight back to close with the group .
Save a little for a short sprint over the top of the hill -- shift up and stand to accelerate and make up some distance .
EAT AND DRINK
READER'S QUESTIONS
Answer :
Al , I 'm not sure I can give you the scientific answer .
But here is my best guess .
The total amount of work to climb the hill should be proportional to the weight moved up the hill .
Maybe a tad more with the bike as you are carrying an extra 20 - 25 pounds up the hill , but this assumes the weight of the athletes is equal .
However , most of the world class bikers are small guys .
Check the weight of the winning runners and the winning cyclists .
If they are indeed lighter , total energy output ( again based on total weight carried up the set altitude ) to achieve the top may be less .
If the work done to reach the top is the same , the same total Calories expended should be the same .
Since it is a hill , we do n't need to worry about wind resistance .
Heart Rate and %VO2 max are related to energy output per unit of time and thus the rate at which the athlete climbs .
I 'd presume both groups are at their optimum ( near 100 % V02max - just slightly sub anaerobic ) , so these should be equal in both groups .
The fact that after multiple attempts ( many riders / runners in each group ) the bikers are faster to the top would suggest that they ( and biking versus running ) are indeed slightly more efficient in terms of rate of climb attainable for equal level energy output .
Question :
Why is it that time trialers seem to lose it in the mountains , and a good climber often gets beaten in a time trial on the flats ?
BM
Answer :
The answer involves the interplay of body weight , power output and wind resistance .
On the flats , resistance ( which slows you down ) is primarily related to the resistance created by a rider 's bike and body as they move through the air .
Big riders , in a low racing position , have a frontal surface area that is quite similar to that of smaller riders .
But big riders tend to generate more power thanks to their larger muscle mass .
That 's why time trials and sprints on flat or rolling terrain favor the bigger , muscular riders .
However the resistance ( that slows one down ) on a hill is related to gravity .
When a rider fights gravity while going uphill , the power - to - weight ratio , not total absolute power output is more important .
The more Watts a rider can produce for his ( or her ) body weight , the faster that rider can climb .
To improve climbing , you must either lose weight or increase your sustainable wattage -- or do both .
Here 's an example .
A big rider ( let 's say 85 kg or 187 lbs. ) and can produce 425 Watts for 20 minutes ( a standard test interval ) and thus has a power - to - weight ratio of 5.0 Watts per kg .
( Top climbers have a ratio of 6 - 7 Watts - per- kilo . )
For comparison , a lighter rider , let 's say 60 - kg climber ( or 132 lbs. ) need only produce 360 Watts to achieve 6 Watts per kilo .
In this scenario , the lighter rider will overcome the effects of gravity more easily ( remember that it is the power per kg that is important in overcoming the resistance of gravity ) , but the bigger rider will do better on the flats where the wind resistance is relatively weight independent and thus equal for the light and heavier rider - thus the lighter rider is 65 Watts behind and will lose the sprint .

If Clinton wins by a larger margin than the one by which Obama is expected to beat her in Tuesday ’s other primary in Oregon , it would also amplify her assertion that she ’s ahead in total votes , if Florida and Michigan are counted .
Five things to watch in Kentucky ...
LOUISVILLE , Ky. – Hillary Clinton is counting on Kentucky to give her more ammunition to make her case to the superdelegates who control the fate of her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination .
If the state gives her a victory anywhere close to the 41 - point landslide she got out of neighboring West Virginia last week , Team Clinton will have considerably more evidence to buttress its argument about her electability .

It would embolden her to assert she could win Kentucky in the general election against presumptive Republican nominee John McCain , and to claim that Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama is unable to expand the Democratic electoral map into states like Kentucky .
If Clinton wins by a larger margin than the one by which Obama is expected to beat her in Tuesday ’s other primary in Oregon , it would also amplify her assertion that she ’s ahead in total votes , if Florida and Michigan are counted .
A Kentucky landslide would serve another purpose : it would bolster her case that Obama ca n’t win over the blue collar and elderly white voters who fill the state ’s voters rolls and who , the Clinton campaign argues , are necessary to beat McCain in November .
With that calculus in mind , here is what Kentucky political strategists and experts will watch for Tuesday :
How goes Montgomery County ?
In 1988 and 2000 – the last elections with no incumbent president on the ballot – this county of less than 25,000 residents in the Outer Bluegrass region of the state was within 5 percentage points of the actual statewide primary results .
That could be a good omen for Clinton , who held a commanding 28 - point lead over Obama in the county in a Suffolk University poll taken May 17 – 18 .
Statewide , the Suffolk survey put Clinton 26 points ahead of Obama — 51 percent to 25 percent , with 11 percent undecided , 6 percent for John Edwards , 5 percent uncommitted ( an actual option on Kentucky ballots ) and the rest declining to respond .
The power of John Edwards .
Kentucky could provide a good litmus test for whether the former North Carolina senator ’s endorsement will help Obama make inroads with the blue collar and elderly white voters who have flocked to Clinton .
Edwards , who dropped his own bid for the nomination in January , remains on the ballot in Kentucky and 6 percent of Kentucky Democrats intend to vote for him , according to the Suffolk poll , conducted in the days after Edwards endorsed Obama .
In West Virginia , another state dominated by blue collar white voters where Edwards was still on the ballot , he drew 7 percent of the vote .
Clinton finished with a whopping 67 percent , leaving Obama with 26 percent .
Clinton herself told reporters last week in Rapid City , S.D. : “ I imagine that Sen . Edward ’s endorsement will be of some help to Sen. Obama in Kentucky . ”
But David Paleologos , who directed the Suffolk poll , said Edwards ’
Kentucky supporters are unlikely to vote for Obama .
“ These are people who , for whatever reason , have a high disdain for both candidates , ” he said .
Only 11 percent of respondents who picked Edwards had a favorable impression of Obama — compared to 56 percent who viewed him unfavorably .
Clinton did n’t fare much better with Edwards ’ backers — 17 percent viewed her favorably compared to 67 unfavorable .
The role of race .
Exit polls in neighboring West Virginia found one in five voters admitted race was a factor in their vote .
Of those , more than four in five voted for Clinton .
Kentucky , which is 91 percent white , has a larger black population than West Virginia .
And though Kentucky voters may also factor race into their votes , they also might be more reluctant to admit it to exit pollsters , said Laurie Rhodebeck , an associate political science professor at the University of Louisville .
“ Voters get a little prickly here if you say race ” drove their choice , she said .
“ They ’ll say , ‘ It ’s more that we ’re concerned about his church ties or his lack of military experience or that he seems so young and untested . ’
Those may be socially acceptable ways of saying they ’re uncomfortable with a black candidate . ”
Obama ’s popularity numbers in Kentucky are similar to those he had in West Virginia before its primary , according to Suffolk polls taken in those states on the weekends before their primaries .
In Kentucky , 43 percent of the poll ’s respondents said they viewed Obama favorably versus 43 percent who had unfavorable impressions .
In West Virginia , Obama had 44 - percent favorability and 41 - percent unfavorability ratings .
The battle for Louisville .
Both candidates have strongholds in the state ’s biggest city , which is home to more than 700,000 of the state ’s 4 million residents , so turnout will be key .
Obama stands to do well in precincts in the city ’s West End , which has high concentrations of black voters , and in the Highlands , which is home to many University of Louisville academics and other educated professionals ( as well as Clinton ’s state headquarters ) .
He has run lots of radio ads in the city and also has the support of its congressman , John Yarmuth ( D - Ky . ) .
At a state party dinner this month , Yarmuth boasted Obama intended “ to contest Kentucky today … ( and ) believes Kentucky can be a blue state in November . ”
Clinton figures to do well in Louisville ’s South End , home to Ford and General Electric manufacturing plants and many of the white employees who work at the plants .
There is some speculation she could get a boost from G.E. ’s acknowledgment last week that it may sell its appliance business , which is based in Louisville and employees 5,000 people there .
“ That ’s precisely the type of issue that she ’s been addressing , ” Rhodebeck said .
“ So if voters were wavering about whether to vote or who to vote for , that bad news could be to Hillary ’s benefit . ”
In the rest of the state , Clinton is well - positioned in the nearly 50 counties in the eastern part of the state that are part of Appalachia , as well as in western Kentucky .
In order for Obama to hold down her winning margin , he needs to do well in Louisville and Lexington , home to the University of Kentucky , and in the relatively affluent northern Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati .
Mind the ( time - zone ) gap .
Kentucky polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m .
But because the state is divided between the eastern and central time zones , polls in the eastern part of the state close one hour before those in the west .
Since the eastern part of the state is home to the areas in which Obama hopes to be competitive ( Louisville , Lexington , the Cincinnati suburbs ) and since cities tend to report more quickly than rural areas , early results may make it appear a closer race than it is .
The western part of the state , though less densely populated , is mostly Clinton country .
Democratic turnout could be driven up in part of western Kentucky by the party primary for the congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Ron Lewis ( R - Ky . ) .
As the western part of the state reports its results tonight , expect to see Clinton ’s margin widen .

A vaccine created by University of Rochester Medical Center scientists prevents the development of Alzheimer 's disease - like pathology in mice without causing inflammation or significant side effects .
Vaccinated mice generated an immune response to the protein known as amyloid - beta peptide , which accumulates in what are called " amyloid plaques " in brains of people with Alzheimer's .
The vaccinated mice demonstrated normal learning skills and functioning memory in spite of being genetically designed to develop an aggressive form of the disease .
The Rochester scientists reported the findings in an article in the May issue of Molecular Therapy , the journal of The American Society of Gene Therapy .
" Our study demonstrates that we can create a potent but safe version of a vaccine that utilizes the strategy of immune response shaping to prevent Alzheimer 's - related pathologies and memory deficits , " said William Bowers , associate professor of neurology and of microbiology and immunology at the Medical Center and lead author of the article .
" The vaccinated mice not only performed better , we found no evidence of signature amyloid plaque in their brains . "
Alzheimer 's is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with dementia and a decline in performance of normal activities .
Hallmarks of the disease include the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients and the loss of normal functioning tau , a protein that stabilizes the transport networks in neurons .
Abnormal tau function eventually leads to another classic hallmark of Alzheimer 's , neurofibrillary tangle in nerve cells .
After several decades of exposure to these insults , neurons ultimately succumb and die , leading to progressively damaged learning and memory centers in the brain .
The mice that received the vaccines were genetically engineered to express large amounts of amyloid beta protein .
They also harbored a mutation that causes the tau - related tangle pathology .
Prior to the start of the vaccine study , the mice were trained to navigate a maze using spatial clues .
They were then tested periodically during the 10 - month study on the amount of time and distance traveled to an escape pod and the number of errors made along the way .
" What we found exciting was that by targeting one pathology of Alzheimer 's -- amyloid beta -- we were able to also prevent the transition of tau from its normal form to a form found in the disease state , " Bowers said .
The goal of the vaccine is to prompt the immune system to recognize amyloid beta protein and remove it .
To create the vaccine , Bowers and the research group use a herpes virus that is stripped of the viral genes that can cause disease or harm .
They then load the virus container with the genetic code for amyloid beta and interleukin - 4 , a protein that stimulates immune responses involving type 2 T helper cells , which are lymphocytes that play an important role in the immune system .
The research group tested several versions of a vaccine .
Mice were given three injections of empty virus alone , a vaccine carrying only the amyloid beta genetic code , or a vaccine encoding both amyloid beta and interlueikin - 4 , which was found to be the most effective .
" We have learned a great deal from this ongoing project , " Bowers said .
" Importantly , it has demonstrated the combined strengths of the gene delivery platform and the immune shaping concept for the creation of customized vaccines for Alzheimer 's disease , as well as a number of other diseases .
We are currently working on strategies we believe can make the vaccine even safer . "
Bowers expects the vaccine eventually to be tested in people , but due to the number of studies required to satisfy regulatory requirements , it could be three or more years before human trials testing this type of Alzheimer 's vaccine occur .
Grants from the National Institutes of Health supported the study .
In addition to Bowers , authors of the Molecular Therapy article include Maria E. Frazer , Jennifer E. Hughes , Michael A. Mastrangelo and Jennifer Tibbens of the Medical Center and Howard J. Federoff of Georgetown University Medical Center .

If you want to expose the absurdity of the state , think governmental accounting .
Really , there is no better way to show the impossibility of a government solution to scarcity than by reading the annual audit of any governmental entity .
Goethe considered double - entry bookkeeping — the essence of accounting — to be " one of the finest inventions of the human mind . "
For without accounting , we lose the ability to calculate , and without the ability to calculate , modern civilization is impossible .
Accounting lets the entrepreneur know whether he earned a profit , utilizing scarce resources in order to produce something of greater value .
Accounting also lets the entrepreneur know whether activities he performs are better outsourced , or , conversely , whether he should expand into new orders of production .
In essence , accounting directs the entrepreneur toward activities that satisfy the wants of the consumer .
Government accounting is a true oxymoron .
We can determine the cost of government , but what about the value produced ?
What is the product ?
What is its value ?
What is the bottom line ?
Of course , these unanswered questions do not stop government from playing business , pretending to create value and profit for society .
Governmental entities operate under the cash basis of accounting , tracking cash in and cash out .
To direct their activities , these entities create budgets that list revenue and expenditures .
Accounting then is simply the recording of cash flows against the budget .
In this world , the cheered concept of fiscal accountability is the process of reporting how close the entity 's final revenue and expenditures matched its approved budget .
And nothing more .
This is an important point to note : whenever government officials speak of fiscal accountability , they are only considering approved budget versus actual spending .
They are not referring to worthiness of expenditures , only whether or not they spent revenue according to the budget , with no outright theft of money .
Oh , sure , the officials will claim that fiscal accountability means that money was spent on productive activities since , as expected , it is assumed by the governmental entity that only productive activities were approved in the budget .
Circular reasoning .
With cash accounting , the cost of infrastructure investments — roads , bridges , buildings , etc. — is reported in the year it occurs , though the capital assets continue to have value or usefulness for years .
Reporting cash flow misses the complete financial picture of the government entity , leaving this question unanswered : is it in a better financial position than the year before ?
To answer that question , the Government Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement 34 in 1999 .
Annual reports that satisfy this statement supposedly detail the financial health of governmental entities as if these entities were profit - oriented businesses .
Reporting is now done on the accrual basis of accounting , and assets are depreciated over their lifetime .
This change provides a bottom line : net assets .
With a view of either increasing or decreasing assets over liabilities , we can now determine a profit or loss of sorts .
Under this logic , when a governmental entity has more net assets this year than the prior year , it is in a better financial state — it has achieved a profit .
Government can now report to its constituents whether or not it was able to take scarce resources and turn them into something of greater value .
Socialism , here we come .
But not so fast .
Government assets are the product of theft , not the result of satisfying the wants of consumers .
A governmental entity with increasing assets is simply stealing more from taxpayers year after year .
Ironically , the same holds true for a governmental entity that has decreasing assets .
In either situation , more is being thieved , with nothing of value being created .
The implication is that a governmental entity that increases its tax revenue faster than its expenditures is performing a service for its constituents ; the entity is achieving a profit for the taxpayers .
Conversely , a governmental entity in a deficit cycle is creating a loss for its taxpayers .
So , the more a government confiscates , the better off the taxpayers .
Does that make sense ?
Down is up , and up is down .
Somewhere , somehow , we ventured down the rabbit hole .
It is as if we are to cheer a government that taxes and builds since increasing assets count as profit , not waste .
The public school district that builds a $ 50 million high school is bettering its financial position .
Whether or not the high school produces anything of value is of no consideration .
In government accounting , the cost itself is a benefit .
Of course , that is not how businesses serve the consumer , but , with government , we are through the looking glass .
The difference between government and business is the chain of taxation versus the dollar vote .
The public school district taxes regardless of value produced .
Once the bond issue passes the voters , the bill must be paid , to be enforced by the long , strong arm of government .
On the other hand , the entrepreneur must face the consumer every day , product in hand , hoping to make a sale .
The consumer can as easily bypass as enter his store , based on a whim if he so chooses .
The taxpayer ?
Well , just try to hide .
If government is of the people , and I am one of the people , should n't I include changes in the net assets of my local school district in my financial portfolio ?
Since the local schools are my schools — or so the mantra goes — do n't those changes have an impact on my finances ?
Should n't I record changes of district assets in my ledger ?
Moreover , should n't I be able to sell my shares of the supposed public good and use the resulting proceeds for my benefit ?
Yes , I should .
But , as I learned growing up in Allegheny County in southwestern Pennsylvania , the sign that reads , " Keep out , Property of Allegheny County , " does not refer only to those who live outside the county ; it means that even the taxpayers of Allegheny County have no right to that property .
The bottom line — increasing government net assets — is not my property ; never was ; never will be .

ALL ACADEMICS AND STAFF AT UCSD ( excluding UCSD Medical Center ) SUBJECT : Formal Review of the Proposed New Staff and Academic Reduction in Time ( START ) Program
In order to help UC cope with anticipated budget cuts , the University is proposing to implement a new Staff and Academic Reduction in Time ( START ) Program , a temporary voluntary time reduction personnel program , to achieve salary savings .
Implementation of START is subject to Regental approval of amendments to the UCRP to ensure that participation in the program will not reduce an employee 's accrual rate of UCRP service credit or the amount of pay used to determine UCRP benefits .
The amendments are scheduled for consideration by The Regents at their May meeting .
Under the proposed program , temporary salary savings would be achieved through a voluntary reduction in time and corresponding pay .
UC San Diego department heads / chairs , at their discretion and with the appropriate approval of the respective vice chancellor , may extend START to their organization at any time during the START program period of July 1 , 2008 through June 30 , 2010 .
The features of the proposed START program are as follows : ELIGIBILITY : All full - and part - time non-probationary career ( " regular status " ) staff employees and academic appointees , except those in faculty and student academic titles and Postdoctoral Scholars , would be eligible to volunteer to reduce their time .
In all cases , participation would be dependent upon the approval of the department head / chair and the respective vice chancellor ( if required by separate communication of the vice chancellor to members of the respective vice chancellor organization ) .
Participation in the START Program for represented employees is dependent upon agreement by the applicable union .
PROGRAM PARAMETERS : * Eligible employees would volunteer to reduce their time from a minimum of 10 % to a maximum of 50 % of full - time .
However , an employee 's work schedule cannot be reduced below 50 % time in any month of participation in START .
*
In return for a voluntary reduction in time , participants would : * Accrue , on a month by month basis , vacation and sick leave credits at the rate accrued prior to the commencement of START ; * Accrue , on a month by month basis , UCRP service credit for each month of START participation at the rate accrued prior to commencement of the program , provided that the employee is on pay status for at least 50 % time ( Note : service credit during participation in START would be reduced by a leave without pay or other periods of time off pay status not reflected in the START contract ) *
Not have their UC health and welfare , retirement , disability or survivor benefits affected by START * Participants could volunteer to reduce their time for a minimum of one month to a maximum of 24 months .
A written START contract signed by both the department head / chair and the employee would specify the participant 's percentage of time and the begin and end dates of the contract *
An eligible employee could participate in START more than one time , as long as participation ends by June 30 , 2010 *
The time reduction under a START contract could be changed by mutual agreement of both the employee and the department head / chair and with 30 days advance notice * Participation in START could be ended by the employee or the department head / chair with 30 days advance notice
The proposed program will be posted at the following URL : http://atyourservice.ucop.edu
If you would like to comment on the proposed START program , please email your comments by May 28 , 2008 to Jenni Leibman , Director , Employee Relations , Policy Development and Work / Life at employeerelations@ucsd.edu or Tricia Takacs , Director of Academic Personnel at ttakacs@ucsd.edu .

What Journalists Don’t : Lessons from the Times
Speech to the Bay Area Law School Technology Conference blogs panel , as prepared .
So I was asked to speak about bloggers and journalists — it seems like people are always finding an excuse to talk about this .
In fact , the National Press Club had a panel on it just yesterday .
Most of the discussion focuses on what bloggers do — is it trustworthy ?
is it right ? — but I ’d like to take a different tack .
I ’d like to discuss what journalists do n’t .
Last summer , during the election campaign , I decided to take on a little project .
Every day for a month I would read all the political articles in the New York Times and take notes on them on a blog .
A number of things stood out and I thought I would discuss them .
Keep in mind that this is the New York Times , widely recognized to be the most serious of newspapers .
So everything that applies to them applies to an even greater extent to all the lesser newspapers , the evening news , the talking head shows , and so on .
The first was the extreme conservative bias .
One day , they ran a front page story that claimed Kerry was , quote , like a caged hamster .
Another , claiming , quote , life is like high school , decided to interview various Kerry classmates .
So they got two quotes .
On the right was the guy who thought Kerry “ seem[ed ] ruthless ” and on the left was the one who insisted “ hatred is too strong a word ” for what his classmates felt .
These are just fun examples — I found hundreds of these things in just a month .
And many were on more serious issues as well .
The constant theme was that Times reporters would repeat Republican talking points and images and so on .
Kerry was elitist , Kerry was a flip - flopper , the Kerry campaign was failing .
One reporter even had his own cottage industry in stories of that last type .
Adam Nagourney ran 22 consecutive stories claiming Democrats were worried about themselves .
But we should n’t forget the more important things as well .
The Times was , of course , one of the major outlets for false claims that Iraq had WMDs .
My understanding is that it ’s a sort of cardinal rule in journalism that if you ’re going to make a claim , especially a big , important front - page claim , you get two sources .
Well , the Times did n’t do that on WMDs — they just printed whatever the administration said .
And when the administration used their bogus reporting to go to war , the Times did its best to ignore the fact that the war was a blatant violation of international law .
In all these areas , the blogs bested the Times .
Some tracked the spreading meme that Kerry was elitist , others pointed out that Bush was n’t much of a down - home cowboy himself , still others carefully debunked each new right - wing myth .
Blogs pointed to people like weapons inspector Scott Ritter , who correctly pointed out there were no WMDs , or the Iraqi defector who explained they had all been destroyed .
Blogs 1 , Times 0 .
The second thing I noticed during my study was that reporters rarely pointed out Bush was lying , corrected his lies , or even conceded that an objective reality containing a truth existed .
You do n’t have to trust me on this one ; I spoke to Washington Post campaign reporter Jim VandeHei about it when he visited Stanford .
Some things are undoubtedly true , he said — he got very animated — but editors wo n’t let reporters print the facts .
He wanted to do a piece where he compared Bush and Kerry ’s stump speeches to see how many lies they contained , but editors just would n’t let him .
So instead you get the results so perfectly parodied by Paul Krugman , who commented that if the administration announced the Earth was flat , the lead story in the Times the next day would be “ Shape of Earth : Views Differ ” .
In fact , we do n’t really need to leave that sort of thing to the imagination anymore .
The other month ABC ran a show which balanced people who claimed they had been abducted by aliens against respected doctors who explained that their experiences resulted from a condition called sleep paralysis .
Who was right ?
ABC refused to say .
Even when facts are reported , they do n’t seem to stick .
Just last month , a Harris poll found that 47 % of adults think Saddam helped plan 9/11 and 36 % think Iraq had WMDs .
But if the media sends the message that it ’s unnecessary to check your beliefs against the facts , should we really be so surprised that so many Americans do n’t ?
Blogs suffer from no such compulsions .
They ’re happy to take tell you the facts and show you the evidence .
They ’re happy to tell you that some things are just wrong and often furious against those who dare to lie .
The incredible blog Media Matters , for example , diligently tracks right - wing lies spread through the media , citing all the sources that prove them false .
But the most important thing , and the thing that nobody really seems to talk about , was how completely empty the Times ’s coverage was .
It was entirely focused on who the candidates were giving stump speeches to or what ads they were buying this week .
The only time an actual policy proposal was mentioned was deep inside a discussion of how a candidate played with a certain group .
You know , ‘ Kerry has had problems with the Teamsters , even though they support his health care plan ’ or something .
That was basically it .
And this is supposed to be the high point of journalism !
If the Times wo n’t talk about policy then no one will .
And if nobody talks about policy then nobody votes on the basis of it .
A September 2004 Gallup poll found that only 10 % of registered voters said that they voted based on the candidates , quote , agenda / ideas / platforms / goals — 6 % for Bush , 13 % for Kerry .
And it ’s at this point that you really have to ask yourself : “ is this really a democracy ? ”
It ’s the most contested election of out time , coverage is lavished on the topic , the nation is closely divided , and yet the media completely ignores the issues .
There ’s no policy debate .
And if the media does n’t report the policy proposals and the media does n’t report the facts , then we ’re right back to my first point : vague emotional claims about Kerry being a rich elitist flip - flopper , or , from the other side , Kerry was a brave soldier who blew stuff up in the Vietnam war .
This was n’t your grand democratic election :
The people did n’t get together and look at the facts and have a debate about issues .
They did n’t look at facts and they did n’t discuss issues at all !
They sat in their houses , watched a bunch of fuzzy TV commercials , and took in news coverage that recited the same vague themes .
And then they voted based on which fuzzy image they liked the best .
There ’s a word for stuff like that .
It ’s not pretty , but I think it ’s appropriate .
It ’s called propaganda .
This was an election on the basis of propaganda .
And so I believe blogs are important insofar as they help us move away from this sorry spectacle and towards a real democracy .
Blogs , of course , can help spread propaganda — and no doubt , most do — but they can also help stem it .
Political blogs can help pull people into politics , tell them things they would n’t otherwise hear , and lead them to organize their own projects — like building support for Howard Dean or trying to save social security .
One of the most important things I think blogs do , though , is teach people .
The media , as I ’ve noted , is supremely unintelligent .
But I do n’t think the people of this country are .
And one of the most striking things about blogs to me is how they almost never talk down to their readership .
Indeed most seem to think higher of their readership than they do themselves .
Atrios does n’t hesitate before explaining some piece of economics that the Washington Post finds too complex .
Tim Lambert will teach you the statistical theory you need to understand why some right - wing claim is wrong .
And Brad DeLong has taught me more about what it ’s like to be an economics guy in the government than I got from Paul O’Neill ’s book .
The media is n’t going to come save from this nightmare .
But maybe blogs can .
Or at least they can help .
The more people learn , the smarter they become .
The smarter they become , the more they understand the way the world really works .
The more they understand , the more they can do to fix things .
And that is the truly important goal .
Thank you .
So , what I did was I took the above speech , bolded the key words and numbers , and printed it out .
Then I gave it mostly from memory , occasionally looking down to get the next bolded word or a particularly well - worded phrase .
It worked really well , I think .
The speech touched quite a nerve , as I hoped .
My two conservative co-panelists ( Zack Rosen failed to show ) immediately demanded a chance to respond and then cut off my rebuttals .
One of them ( Mike ) started insisting there was no such thing as objective truth at which point I cut in and said ‘ Well , I can see why Republicans would want to deny that truth exists since it often cuts against them ! ’ which was hailed as the best line of the night .
After the talk I got a lot of compliments and a guest blogger for Daily Kos said he ’d talk to Markos about getting me an occasional spot on Daily Kos , which is something like the liberal blogger equivalent of a regular gig on the Tonight Show .
So I think it went well . :-)

( CNN ) --
More than 7 out of 10 Americans think government spending on the war in Iraq is partly responsible for the economic troubles in the United States , according to results of a recent poll .
President Bush meets with his economic team at the White House on Monday .
In the CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted last weekend , 71 percent said they think U.S. spending in Iraq is a reason for the nation 's poor economy .
Twenty - eight percent said they did n't think so .
The weekend poll , timed to coincide with the Iraq war 's fifth anniversary , also showed little U.S. support for the conflict .
Fewer than one in three respondents -- 32 percent -- said they support the war , while 66 percent said they oppose it .
Sixty - one percent of those polled said the next president should remove most U.S. troops from Iraq " within a few months of taking office . "
Only 36 percent of those polled said the situation in Iraq was worth going to war over -- down from 68 percent in March 2003 , when the war began .
The poll surveyed 1,019 adult Americans from March 14 to 16 .
The economy question ties together the nation 's two dominant political issues in a presidential election year -- the Iraq war , which enters its sixth year on Wednesday , and a faltering U.S. economy that most Americans believe is in recession .
In a Washington Post editorial column earlier this month , a pair of leading economists projected that the Iraq war will wind up costing the U.S. government about $ 3 trillion , including factors such as future disability payments for injured veterans , interest payments on money borrowed to finance the war , and the costs resulting from disrupted oil markets .
Joseph E. Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize - winning economist and Columbia University professor who chaired President Bill Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers , and Linda J. Bilmes , a former chief financial officer at the Commerce Department who now teaches at Harvard University , wrote the column .
They said the combination of the war 's cost and a Bush - backed tax cut led to deficit borrowing , and they predicted the economic fallout of that spending would result in the nation 's largest economic downturn since the Great Depression .
" Others will have to work out the geopolitics , but the economics here are clear , " the pair wrote .
" Ending the war , or at least moving rapidly to wind it down , would yield major economic dividends . "
A White House spokesman said the war had cost the U.S. $ 406.2 billion through December 2007 .
The spokesman said the economists " throw everything in the kitchen sink " into the study , including costs like interest on the national debt , and called the projection " exaggerated . "
And President Bush , speaking on NBC's " Today " last month , disputed the notion that the war was negatively affecting the economy .
" I think actually the spending in the war might help with jobs ... because we 're buying equipment and people are working , " he said .
" I think this economy is down because we built too many houses and the economy 's adjusting . "
Most economists say the United States has not officially entered a recession -- which is commonly defined as negative economic growth for two or more consecutive quarters .
But some economists disagree , and a recent poll suggested that nearly three out of four Americans -- 74 percent -- think the country already is in a recession .
Nationally , home foreclosures are up as the subprime lending market continues to struggle -- with 223,000 reported last month , compared with less than 140,000 in February 2007 .
U.S. employers have cut 85,000 jobs so far this year -- the most in four years -- according to the U.S. Labor Department .

An Orange County Judge fined a Riverside County man over $ 20,000 and sentenced him to a week in jail for poaching lobsters inside a “ marine protected area ” ( MPA ) created under Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s controversial Marine Life Protection Act ( MLPA ) Initiative .
“ This is the first resource crime conviction since the MPAs off the Southern California coast went into effect on Jan. 1 , 2012 , ” according to a May 8 news release from the California Department of Fish and Game touting the poacher ’s conviction .
This is the same agency that recently released a report documenting the “ salvage ” of millions of fish including 42 species in the state and federal water export pumping facilities in the South Delta in 2011 .
In contrast with the case of the lobster poacher , government officials responsible for the fish slaughter have never been prosecuted for the violation of numerous state and federal laws .
Marbel A. Para , 30 , of Romoland pled guilty in Orange County Court on May 4 for violating Fish and Game Code 12013 that stipulates a minimum $ 5,000 fine for anyone who takes or posses more than three times the daily bag limit of lobsters .
Police said Josef Fritzl admitted sexually abusing his daughter A 73 - year - old Austrian man has confessed to imprisoning his daughter in a cellar for 24 years and fathering her seven children , police have said .
Police said Josef Fritzl also admitted burning the body of a baby that died at the house in Amstetten , Lower Austria .
Mr Fritzl has been taken to court while authorities are caring for the woman , now 42 , and her six surviving children .
Photos of the man 's basement show a concealed network of tiny windowless chambers which were soundproofed .
Prosecutors say Mr Fritzl is expected to be taken into protective custody after appearing before a magistrate .
The woman , Elisabeth , disappeared aged 18 on 28 August 1984 when , according to her testimony to police , her father lured her into the cellar , drugging and handcuffing her before locking her up .
She is reported to have been made to write a letter which made it look as if she had run away .

The head of the criminal affairs bureau in Lower Austria , Franz Polzer , said Mr Fritzl had admitted sexually abusing his daughter repeatedly during the time he imprisoned her .
Mr Polzer said Mr Fritzl told investigators Elisabeth had given birth to seven children , including twins in 1996 , but one died shortly after being born and that he had thrown the body into an incinerator in the building .
Pictures of Josef Fritzl 's house and cellar
The surviving children are now aged between five and 19 years .
The cellar rooms , covering an area of approximately 60 sq m ( 650 sq ft ) , were equipped for sleeping and cooking , and with sanitary facilities .
A reinforced concrete door was built into the wall that separated the " dungeon " from the house and electronically locked - the code known only to the suspect , who provided his captives with food and necessities , police said .
KEY FACTS IN CASE Elisabeth reappeared at home after disappearing 24 years ago Six children she says are hers have been found and placed in care
One of the children , aged 19 , is seriously ill in hospital Elisabeth 's father Josef Fritzl , 73 , has been arrested on suspicion of incest and abduction Police say Mr Fritzl confesses to imprisoning Elisabeth and fathering her seven children

Three of the children were kept in the cellar with their mother and had never seen daylight , police told a news conference .
The other three children were adopted or fostered by the suspect , after he forced Elisabeth to write a letter saying she could not look after the baby , according to police .
His wife , Rosemarie , with whom he had seven of their own children , appears to have been unaware of the alleged crimes .
The security chief for Lower Austria , Franz Prucher , said he had been down into the cellar where it was easy to understand how the abuse was not discovered .
" The cellar is very deep , " he said .
" There you can cry and nobody will hear , nobody .
There you can cry as loud as you can , you can hear nothing . "
The alleged abuse and Mr Fritzl 's apparent double life came to light when the eldest of the children in the cellar , 19 - year - old Kerstin , became seriously ill earlier this month and had to be taken to hospital .

A television appeal by medical staff for the patient 's mother was seen by Elisabeth on a TV set in the cellar and she urged her father to let her go to hospital .
Police arrested Mr Fritzl shortly afterwards and took all the children into care .
" If you look at him today , you would hardly believe he was capable of doing these things .
This man led a double life for 24 years , " said Mr Polzer .
He said it was incredible that it had been kept secret for all that time .
Both the father and Elisabeth say no one else had access to the cellar , according to police , who are appealing to anyone with information about Mr Fritzl to contact them .
Asked why the captives had not tried to escape before , Mr Polzer said one had to consider the fact that the woman was small and weak and even the eldest boy , now 18 , was " a small boy , a weak boy " .
" You have to put yourself into the situation of these people , " he said .
" They led a completely different life to ours , they do not know what we know .
These children were born into the jail , they knew nothing else . "
Illness Kerstin is said to be in a coma in hospital .
The head of the intensive care unit at the Amstetten hospital , Albert Reiter , said the impact of her experiences would eventually become clearer .
" The connection between the effects of 20 years without daylight , the incest and other illnesses , we will research in the coming hours and days , " he said .
The media were told the other children who had been kept in the cellar were in surprising physical health , but very pale .
The region 's district governor , Hans - Heinz Lenze , said he had spoken to the five - year - old boy .
" He even told me how happy he was and how fantastic it was to ride in a real car , " he said .
Help offer Journalist Andreas Wetz , of the daily newspaper Die Presse , told the BBC the suspect 's neighbours in Amstetten , a small town about 130 km ( 80 miles ) west of Vienna , were in shock at the revelations .
" The man who is said to have done this , they said he was funny , he talked to neighbours , he might be a little introverted , but they had no idea that this person could do this , " he said .
The BBC's Bethany Bell says the case is reminiscent of that of Natascha Kampusch , the Austrian teenager held captive in a cellar in a house in a Vienna suburb for eight years , who ran to freedom in 2006 .
While police are not connecting the two cases , many Austrians are asking how such matters went undiscovered , she says .
Miss Kampusch , now 20 , has offered to help the victims .
She told Austria 's ORF radio : " I can imagine that it is very difficult both for the mother of the children as well as for the wife of the perpetrator to get through this . "

What are these ?
The prospect of dialing up a dedicated 10 Gbps optical link between your office and another firm across the country became a reality today — at least , if your office is a member of Internet2 .
The research network announced at its fall meeting that it had completed a major upgrade to its national infrastructure , which now operates at 100 Gbps and allows researchers to provision their own dedicated links for limited periods of time .
The main network remains IP - based and connects more than 200 universities , in addition to limited connections to government and industry facilities .
Each network segment now features a set of 10 10 Gbps links , each running on a separate wavelength of light , for a total of 100 Gbps of bandwidth .
And that 's only the start ; Internet2 says it can scale each segment to handle up to 100 wavelengths in the future .
That 's ... a lot of star charts .
Most intriguing is the network 's new Dynamic Circuit Network feature , which will allow researchers to set up dedicated , 10 Gbps point - to - point connections across the network for short - term data transfer .
The service will go live in January 2008 , but it already works .
In a demonstration today , Dr. Carl Lundstedt , of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln , set up a connection between his school and the Fermilab research park in Batavia , Illinois .
With bandwidth provisioned , Lundstedt then transferred one - third of a terabyte of data between the two places .
It took five minutes .
Fermi has 100 Gbps of bandwidth .
How about you ?
Rick Summerhill , CTO for Internet2 , believes that this sort of instant provisioning is important on a network like his , and he expects to see it widely used .
" Just like you switch on a light or turn on a water tap , we envision a future where researchers , scientists , faculty , artists , etc. will be able to ' turn on ' a high capacity network connection when and where they need it , " he said today .
Researchers who need something more permanent can use Internet2's WaveCo service to simply provision another wavelength between two institutions .
That dedicated connection is available for as long as it's needed ( at a cost ) , and can be ordered up at speeds from 50 M bps to 10 Gbps .
All this talk about research and large hadron colliders and scientific datasets is all well and good , but it ignores the obvious question : how fast can you grab BitTorrent downloads over this thing ?
In general , Students + Fast Internet == Trouble , and Internet2 has not been immune .
Back in 2005 , the RIAA and MPAA both expressed alarm over the possibility of P2P usage on the network and filed a couple hundred lawsuits just to show everyone that this was Serious Business .
Since then , the outrage appears to have died down .
Internet2 merged with National LamdaRail , which offered similar services to academics , earlier this year .
Update :
An Internet2 manager wrote to let us know that the press materials are technically correct in that up to 100 wavelengths could be supported on each link , but only if more fiber is laid or new technology comes along .
Right now each fiber can handle a max of 80 different , simultaneous wavelengths , but current Internet2 gear limits this to 40 wavelengths per fiber .
Still , with each wavelength creating a 10 Gbps connection , it 's hard to believe too many people are complaining about the speed .

A tethered modem lets you access the Internet with your laptop computer anywhere there 's cellular data coverage .
Forget about lengthy Wi -Fi hotspot login processes and usage fees .
I 've you use a BlackBerry 7130 v , Pearl , Curve or 8800 series device it can be employed as a tethered modem .
And all of the major U.S. wireless carriers , including AT&T , Verizon , T - Mobile and Sprint , allow their BlackBerry devices -- as well as some additional smartphones -- to be used as tethered modems .
However , their charges for the functionality differ dramatically , from as much as $ 30 on top of existing monthly data plans ( AT&T ) to nothing at all ( T - Mobile ) .
1 ) Download and Install RIM BlackBerry Desktop Software
The first step to connecting your Windows notebook or desktop computer to the Internet using your BlackBerry smartphone 's data connection : download the BlackBerry Desktop Software from RIM 's website or the CD that came with your device .
You 'll need software version 4.1 or higher to use your BlackBerry as a tethered modem .
This software ensures that you 've got the appropriate drivers to enable your BlackBerry to use your computer 's USB and virtual COM ports to upload and download Internet data via dial - up connection .
If you find that you 're already running an earlier version of BlackBerry Desktop Manager that does n't support tethering , simply download the updated software from RIM .
You may to need repair the software after upgrading from v4.0 to v4.1 if the necessary USB and virtual COM ports can't be found .
To do so , simply re-install and select the Repair option .
2 ) Create Web Access Point Name ( APN )
Open up your Windows Start Menu and find your Control Panel , within your Settings .
Open up your Phone and Modem Options , and specify your local area code , carrier code ( if necessary ) and numbers that you may need to dial to access outside lines .
Then choose whether or not your use a touch tone or pulse telephone connection and hit OK .
From there , select the Modems tab , highlight Standard Modems and click the Properties tab beneath the option .
Once the Properties window opens , click on the Advanced tab at the top of the box and in the Extra Initialization Commands field type :
+ cgdcont=1 , " IP " , " Your Internet APN "
( Note : If you do n't know your Internet Access Point Name ( APN ) , you can contact your wireless carrier 's customer support representatives .
Or you can try to find your APN by clicking the Options icon on your BlackBerry Applications screen , then Advanced Options , and TCP .
If the Internet APN name has been saved within the device , it will be listed in this menu .
A good old Google search never hurts , either . )
Click OK once you 've filled in the Extra Initialization Commands field and hit OK again when the Phone and Modem Options tab reappears .

If you ’re planning to start a website , there ’s more to consider than themes and fonts .
Just like home security , website security is paramount .
You never want to see all your hard work soiled by the hands of an amateur hacker .
Once your domain is settled , it ’s time to consider domain privacy .
This will prevent those amateur hackers from accessing your personal information .
Nowadays , anyone can hop online and search for registered domains .
If your personal information is n’t protected , a lot more than your domain name can be revealed .
The five risks we ’ve outlined below are n’t meant to scare you but , rather , allow you to armor up and run a highly successful business .
1. Personal Data Being Exposed
This is , without question , the biggest risk you run without domain privacy protection .
Anything from your email address , to your phone number , to your mailing address can be exposed .
We do n’t need to tell you how awful this can be if you do n’t want anyone having your mailing address , especially if it ’s your home address .
As for your email address , that revelation can be more of a hassle .
Being spammed on the regular is , of course , less than ideal , especially if you enjoy the feel of a clean inbox .
2. Website Being Hacked
Without domain privacy , someone can tap into your website and do far worse things than scanning the administrative side of things .
A knowledgeable hacker can actually conduct a domain transfer .
This would shift your site into their name without your consent , removing control from your hands .
3. Personal Data Being Exposed
Let ’s return to the basic nuisance of being spammed and the major safety concern of your home address being exposed .
Once your personal information falls into the wrong hands , anything can happen .
In addition to a general creep having your personal information , that same bad guy can sell your information to someone far worse .
This can increase the amount of spam you receive exponentially and , again , leave you in danger of strangers having your home address .
4. Competitors Knowing Too Much
If you ’re beginning a small business , you ’ll probably be free from the perils of corporate espionage .
But , hey , you never know .
If your site is lacking privacy protection , there ’s a chance your competitor can step behind the curtain and peruse the backend of your site , including new business developments .
5 . An Inability to Hide
If you ’re wondering about using a fake address as a layer of protection , it wo n’t work .
There ’s nowhere to hide .
Strict regulations have been put in place to prevent people from using fake addresses .
If you roll the dice on this move and are found out , the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) can shut your website down and ruin all your hard work .
Invest In Domain Privacy
Here at Donklephant , we love living our lives on the Internet – securely .
In our opinion , domain privacy is worth the small investment .
And , by small investment , we mean a couple of dollars per year .
That ’s worth every last penny .
As you continue to develop your new business in this digital age , we hope you ’ll continue to come on over and visit our site .
We ’ve got everything you need to know from basic marketing tactics to data protection to app development .
Good luck out there in the digital sea !
We wish you tremendous success , safe from the harm of hackers .

Spiraling Violence
Toward a Failed State ?
The Drug Trade 's High Stakes
Cartel Incentives for U.S. Expansion
The Impossibility of Sealing the Border
Edgar Millan Gomez was shot dead in his own home in Mexico City on May 8 .
Millan Gomez was the highest - ranking law enforcement officer in Mexico , responsible for overseeing most of Mexico ’s counternarcotics efforts .
He orchestrated the January arrest of one of the leaders of the Sinaloa cartel , Alfredo Beltran Leyva .
( Several Sinaloa members have been arrested in Mexico City since the beginning of the year . )
The week before , Roberto Velasco Bravo died when he was shot in the head at close range by two armed men near his home in Mexico City .
He was the director of organized criminal investigations in a tactical analysis unit of the federal police .
The Mexican government believes the Sinaloa drug cartel ordered the assassinations of Velasco Bravo and Millan Gomez .
Combined with the assassination of other federal police officials in Mexico City , we now see a pattern of intensifying warfare in Mexico City .
The fighting also extended to the killing of the son of the Sinaloa cartel leader , Joaquin “ El Chapo ” Guzman Loera , who was killed outside a shopping center in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa state .
Also killed was the son of reputed top Sinaloa money launderer Blanca Margarita Cazares Salazar in an attack carried out by 40 gunmen .
According to sources , Los Zetas , the enforcement arm of the rival Gulf cartel , carried out the attack .
Reports also indicate a split between Sinaloa and a resurgent Juarez cartel , which also could have been behind the Millan Gomez killing .
Violence along the U.S. - Mexican border has been intensifying for several years , and there have been attacks in Mexico City .
But last week was noteworthy not so much for the body count , but for the type of people being killed .
Very senior government police officials in Mexico City were killed along with senior Sinaloa cartel operatives in Sinaloa state .
In other words , the killings are extending from low - level operatives to higher - ranking ones , and the attacks are reaching into enemy territory , so to speak .
Mexican government officials are being killed in Mexico City , Sinaloan operatives in Sinaloa .
The conflict is becoming more intense and placing senior officials at risk .
The killings pose a strategic problem for the Mexican government .
The bulk of its effective troops are deployed along the U.S. border , attempting to suppress violence and smuggling among the grunts along the border , as well as the well - known smuggling routes elsewhere in the country .
The attacks in Mexico raise the question of whether forces should be shifted from these assignments to Mexico City to protect officials and break up the infrastructure of the Sinaloa and other cartels there .
The government also faces the secondary task of suppressing violence between cartels .
The Sinaloa cartel struck in Mexico City not only to kill troublesome officials and intimidate others , but also to pose a problem for the Mexican government by increasing areas requiring forces , thereby requiring the government to consider splitting its forces — thus reducing the government presence along the border .
It was a strategically smart move by Sinaloa , but no one has accused the cartels of being stupid .
Mexico now faces a classic problem .
Multiple , well - armed organized groups have emerged .
They are fighting among themselves while simultaneously fighting the government .
The groups are fueled by vast amounts of money earned via drug smuggling to the United States .
The amount of money involved — estimated at some $ 40 billion a year — is sufficient to increase tension between these criminal groups and give them the resources to conduct wars against each other .
It also provides them with resources to bribe and intimidate government officials .
The resources they deploy in some ways are superior to the resources the government employs .
Given the amount of money they have , the organized criminal groups can be very effective in bribing government officials at all levels , from squad leaders patrolling the border to high - ranking state and federal officials .
Given the resources they have , they can reach out and kill government officials at all levels as well .
Government officials are human ; and faced with the carrot of bribes and the stick of death , even the most incorruptible is going to be cautious in executing operations against the cartels .
There comes a moment when the imbalance in resources reverses the relationship between government and cartels .
Government officials , seeing the futility of resistance , effectively become tools of the cartels .
Since there are multiple cartels , the area of competition ceases to be solely the border towns , shifting to the corridors of power in Mexico City .
Government officials begin giving their primary loyalty not to the government but to one of the cartels .
The government thus becomes both an arena for competition among the cartels and an instrument used by one cartel against another .
That is the prescription for what is called a " failed state " — a state that no longer can function as a state .
Lebanon in the 1980s is one such example .
There are examples in American history as well .
Chicago in the 1920s was overwhelmed by a similar process .
Smuggling alcohol created huge pools of money on the U.S. side of the border , controlled by criminals both by definition ( bootlegging was illegal ) and by inclination ( people who engage in one sort of illegality are prepared to be criminals , more broadly understood ) .
The smuggling laws gave these criminals huge amounts of power , which they used to intimidate and effectively absorb the city government .
Facing a choice between being killed or being enriched , city officials chose the latter .
City government shifted from controlling the criminals to being an arm of criminal power .
In the meantime , various criminal gangs competed with each other for power .
Chicago had a failed city government .
The resources available to the Chicago gangs were limited , however , and it was not possible for them to carry out the same function in Washington .
Ultimately , Washington deployed resources in Chicago and destroyed one of the main gangs .
But if Al Capone had been able to carry out the same operation in Washington as he did in Chicago , the United States could have become a failed state .
It is important to point out that we are not speaking here of corruption , which exists in all governments everywhere .
Instead , we are talking about a systematic breakdown of the state , in which government is not simply influenced by criminals , but becomes an instrument of criminals — either simply an arena for battling among groups or under the control of a particular group .
The state no longer can carry out its primary function of imposing peace , and it becomes helpless , or itself a direct perpetrator of crime .
Corruption has been seen in Washington — some triggered by organized crime , but never state failure .
The Mexican state has not yet failed .
If the activities of the last week have become a pattern , however , we must begin thinking about the potential for state failure .
The killing of Millan Gomez transmitted a critical message :
No one is safe , no matter how high his rank or how well protected , if he works against cartel interests .
The killing of El Chapo ’s son transmitted the message that no one in the leading cartel is safe from competing gangs , no matter how high his rank or how well protected .
The killing of senior state police officials causes other officials to recalculate their attitudes .
The state is no longer seen as a competent protector , and being a state official is seen as a liability — potentially a fatal liability — unless protection is sought from a cartel , a protection that can be very lucrative indeed for the protector .
The killing of senior cartel members intensifies conflict among cartels , making it even more difficult for the government to control the situation and intensifying the movement toward failure .
It is important to remember that Mexico has a tradition of failed governments , particularly in the 19th and early 20th century .
In those periods , Mexico City became an arena for struggle among army officers and regional groups straddling the line between criminal and political .
The Mexican army became an instrument in this struggle and its control a prize .
The one thing missing was the vast amounts of money at stake .
So there is a tradition of state failure in Mexico , and there are higher stakes today than before .
To benchmark the amount at stake , assume that the total amount of drug trafficking is $ 40 billion , a frequently used figure , but hardly an exact one by any means .
In 2007 , Mexico exported about $ 210 billion worth of goods to the United States and imported about $ 136 billion from the United States .
If the drug trade is $ 40 billion dollars , it represents almost 20 percent of all exports to the United States .
That in itself is huge , but what makes it more important is that while the $ 210 billion is divided among many businesses and individuals , the $ 40 billion is concentrated in the hands of a few , fairly tightly controlled cartels .
Sinaloa and Gulf , currently the strongest , have vast resources at their disposal ; a substantial part of the economy can be controlled through this money .
This creates tremendous instability as other cartels vie for the top spot , with the state lacking the resources to control the situation and having its officials seduced and intimidated by the cartels .
We have seen failed states elsewhere .
Colombia in the 1980s failed over the same issue — drug money .
Lebanon failed in the 1970s and 1980s .
The Democratic Republic of the Congo was a failed state .
Mexico ’s potential failure is important for three reasons .
First , Mexico is a huge country , with a population of more than 100 million .
Second , it has a large economy — the 14th - largest in the world .
And third , it shares an extended border with the world ’s only global power , one that has assumed for most of the 20th century that its domination of North America and control of its borders is a foregone conclusion .
If Mexico fails , there are serious geopolitical repercussions .
This is not simply a criminal matter .
The amount of money accumulated in Mexico derives from smuggling operations in the United States .
Drugs go one way , money another .
But all the money does n’t have to return to Mexico or to third - party countries .
If Mexico fails , the leading cartels will compete in the United States , and that competition will extend to the source of the money as well .
We have already seen cartel violence in the border areas of the United States , but this risk is not limited to that .
The same process that we see under way in Mexico could extend to the United States ; logic dictates that it would .
The current issue is control of the source of drugs and of the supply chain that delivers drugs to retail customers in the United States .
The struggle for control of the source and the supply chain also will involve a struggle for control of markets .
The process of intimidation of government and police officials , as well as bribing them , can take place in market towns such as Los Angeles or Chicago , as well as production centers or transshipment points .
That means there are economic incentives for the cartels to extend their operations into the United States .
With those incentives comes intercartel competition , and with that competition comes pressure on U.S. local , state and , ultimately , federal government and police functions .
Were that to happen , the global implications obviously would be stunning .
Imagine an extreme case in which the Mexican scenario is acted out in the United States .
The effect on the global system economically and politically would be astounding , since U.S. failure would see the world reshaping itself in startling ways .
Failure for the United States is much harder than for Mexico , however .
The United States has a gross domestic product of about $ 14 trillion , while Mexico ’s economy is about $ 900 billion .
The impact of the cartels ’ money is vastly greater in Mexico than in the United States , where it would be dwarfed by other pools of money with a powerful interest in maintaining U.S. stability .
The idea of a failed American state is therefore far - fetched .
Less far - fetched is the extension of a Mexican failure into the borderlands of the United States .
Street - level violence already has crossed the border .
But a deeper , more - systemic corruption — particularly on the local level — could easily extend into the United States , along with paramilitary operations between cartels and between the Mexican government and cartels .
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently visited Mexico , and there are potential plans for U.S. aid in support of Mexican government operations .
But if the Mexican government became paralyzed and could n’t carry out these operations , the U.S. government would face a stark and unpleasant choice .
It could attempt to protect the United States from the violence defensively by sealing off Mexico or controlling the area north of the border more effectively .
Or , as it did in the early 20th century , the United States could adopt a forward defense by sending U.S. troops south of the border to fight the battle in Mexico .
There have been suggestions that the border be sealed .
But Mexico is the United States ' third - largest customer , and the United States is Mexico 's largest customer .
This was the case well before NAFTA , and has nothing to do with treaties and everything to do with economics and geography .
Cutting that trade would have catastrophic effects on both sides of the border , and would guarantee the failure of the Mexican state .
It is n’t going to happen .
So long as vast quantities of goods flow across the border , the border can not be sealed .
Immigration might be limited by a wall , but the goods that cross the border do so at roads and bridges , and the sheer amount of goods crossing the border makes careful inspection impossible .
The drugs will come across the border embedded in this trade as well as by other routes .
So will gunmen from the cartel and anything else needed to take control of Los Angeles ' drug market .
A purely passive defense wo n’t work unless the economic cost of blockade is absorbed .
The choices are a defensive posture to deal with the battle on American soil if it spills over , or an offensive posture to suppress the battle on the other side of the border .
Bearing in mind that Mexico is not a small country and that counterinsurgency is not the United States ' strong suit , the latter is a dangerous game .
But the first option is n't likely to work either .
One way to deal with the problem would be ending the artificial price of drugs by legalizing them .
This would rapidly lower the price of drugs and vastly reduce the money to be made in smuggling them .
Nothing hurt the American cartels more than the repeal of Prohibition , and nothing helped them more than Prohibition itself .
Nevertheless , from an objective point of view , drug legalization is n’t going to happen .
There is no visible political coalition of substantial size advocating this solution .
Therefore , U.S. drug policy will continue to raise the price of drugs artificially , effective interdiction will be impossible , and the Mexican cartels will prosper and make war on each other and on the Mexican state .
We are not yet at the worst - case scenario , and we may never get there .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon , perhaps with assistance from the United States , may devise a strategy to immunize his government from intimidation and corruption and take the war home to the cartels .
This is a serious possibility that should not be ruled out .
Nevertheless , the events of last week raise the serious possibility of a failed state in Mexico .
That should not be taken lightly , as it could change far more than Mexico .
Duncan Davidson ( who I still think of as James ) asked on Twitter :
Color Temp works on the Blue / Yellow axis .
Tint on the Green / Magenta .
No need to tweak Red / Cyan ?
I responded there but decided to here as well as I 've talked about colour theory before .
The basic answer is that you only need two axes because colour ( disregarding brightness / luminance ) is two - dimensional .
Red , Green and Blue form a triangle in that two - dimensional space ( with Cyan , Magenta and Yellow being on the opposite edges respectively ) .
Basic linear algebra tells us that , in an n-dimensional space , you only need n vectors to form a basis ( actually , that 's the definition of dimensionality ) so you can adjust any point in two - dimensional colour space by translating it by a linear combination of any two , non-parallel vectors .
Incidentally , Hue and Saturation would be almost polar coordinates on this space .
Because one form of colour modification is colour temperature , it makes sense to roughly make one of the axes the yellow - blue direction .
I think the magenta - green axes is largely arbitrary .
Any other axis would have done fine .
Note I say " roughly " the first time in that previous paragraph because the black - body colours are n't a straight line in standard colour models .
Hmm , that makes me wonder if colour correction sliders represent rectilinear bases at all .
UPDATE ( 2008-05-04 ) : According to a reply in the Reddit thread , the slides are n't rectilinear but are based on the black - body colours .
The so - called " tint " is presumably then orthogonal to black - body line ( the Planckian locus )
I have to address a few common misconceptions about the Federal Reserve .
1 . The Fed is * not* giving “ handouts ” to banks .
What ’s happening is that banks are holding all these junk bonds that they can’t sell , because they ’re junk .
The Fed ca n’t use those as collateral because , well , they ’re junk .
What the Fed * is * doing is taking those bonds and trading them for Treasury bonds , then having these banks use the Treasury bonds as collateral on loans ( which the Fed just extended to 90 days ) .
These loans are paid back .
It is not a handout , the Fed is simply loaning money under conditions that it usually would n’t .
2 . The Fed is not backed by taxpayer money .
When the Fed loans out money to banks as described above , there is no taxpayer money involved .
Essentially what happens is that the Fed takes some money out of its reserves and puts it in circulation .
It ’s basically increasing the money supply and putting new money out there .
Again , let me reiterate - The Fed does * not* take your money .
3 . Yes , the Fed increasing the money supply causes inflation ( theoretically ) , which decreases the value of your money .
There are two types of inflation .
Demand - pull inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods .
This is what cutting the federal funds rate ( increasing the money supply ) creates .
This is what the Fed tries to control .
On the other hand , cost - push inflaiton is caused by a sharp , sudden increase in the price of a cornerstone good to the economy .
This is what happened to the U.S. in the 1970s during the oil crisis , and this is what is currently happening to China because of rising food prices .
The U.S. is also sucesseptible to cost - push inflation , especially with rising oil and food prices .
Not everything can be attributed to the Fed .
4 . The Fed ’s increasing willingness to help out financial institutions is neither socioeconomic favoritism nor self - interested manipulation .
If the Fed failed to help major banks , these banks would fail , causing the entire financial infrastructure of the U.S. to fail .
This is what happened during the Depression .
5 . Ben Bernanke does , in fact , know what is happening .
Before he was Chairman of the Federal Reserve , he was a very involved scholar of the Great Depression .
A collection of his essays can be purchased from here or can be found online with a bit of searching
I hope this puts an end to at least * some * of the irrational anti-Fed sentiment that ’s been circulating the internet .
I ’m looking at you , Reddit .
In the first experiment of its kind conducted in nature , a University of British Columbia evolutionary biologist has come up with strong evidence for one of Charles Darwin 's cornerstone ideas -- adaptation to the environment accelerates the creation of new species .
" A single adaptive trait such as color could move a population towards the process of forming a new species , but adaptation in many traits may be required to actually complete the formation of an entirely new species , " says UBC post - doctoral fellow Patrik Nosil , whose study is just published . *
" The more ways a population can adapt to its unique surroundings , the more likely it will ultimately diverge into a separate species . "
Nosil studied walking - stick insects in the Santa Barbara Chaparral in southern California .
Stick insects cannot fly and live and feed on their host plants .
Different " eco-types " of walking - stick insects are found on different plants and exhibit different color patterns that match the features of their host plants .
For example , insects of the cristinae eco-type , which feed on plants with needle - like leaves , have a white line along their green bodies .
By displacing some eco - types away from their customary host plants and protecting others from their natural predators , Nosil found that color pattern alone could initiate speciation , while natural selection on additional adaptive traits such as the ability to detoxify different host - plant chemicals are required to " seal the deal , " or complete the speciation process initiated by differences in color pattern .
" Natural selection has been widely regarded as the cause of adaptation within existing species while genetics and geography have been the focus of most current research on the driving force of speciation , " says Nosil .
" As far as advancing Darwin 's theory that natural selection is a key driver of speciation , this is the first experiment of its kind done outside of a lab setting .
The findings are exciting , " says Nosil .
* The article " Ecological Niche Dimensionality and the Evolutionary Diversification of Stick Insects " was recently published by PLoS One .

During the past 2,500 years , the Parthenon — the apotheosis of ancient Greek architecture — has been rocked by earthquakes , set on fire , shattered by exploding gunpowder , looted for its stunning sculptures and defaced by misguided preservation efforts .
Amazingly , the ancient Athenians built the Parthenon in just eight or nine years .
Repairing it is taking a bit longer .
A restoration project funded by the Greek government and the European Union is now entering its 34th year , as archaeologists , architects , civil engineers and craftsmen strive not simply to imitate the workmanship ofthe ancient Greeks but to recreate it .
They have had to become forensic architects , reconstructing long - lost techniques to answer questions that archaeologists and classical scholars have debated for centuries .
How did the Athenians construct their mighty temple , an icon of Western civilization , in less than a decade — apparently without an overall building plan ?
How did they manage to incorporate subtle visual elements into the Parthenon ’s layout and achieve such faultless proportions and balance ?
And how were the Parthenon ’s builders able to work at a level of precision ( in some cases accurate to within a fraction of a millimeter ) without the benefit of modern tools ?
“ We ’re not as good as they were , ” Lena Lambrinou , an architect on the restoration project , observes with a sigh .
If the Parthenon represents “ the supreme effort of genius in pursuit of beauty , ” as the 19th - century French engineer and architectural historian Auguste Choisy declared , lately it has been looking more like a construction site .
Ancient masonry hides behind thickets of scaffolding , planks and steel poles .
Miniature rail tracks connect sheds that house lathes , marble cutters and other power equipment .
In the Parthenon ’s innermost sanctuary , once the home of a massive ivory - and - gold statue of Athena , a gigantic collapsible crane turns on a concrete platform .
Though heavy equipment dominated the hilltop , I also found restorers working with the delicacy of diamond cutters .
In one shed , I watched a mason toiling on a fresh block of marble .
He was one of some 70 craftsmen recruited for the project from Greece ’s sole remaining traditional marble school , located on the island of Tinos .
His technique was exacting .
To make the new block exactly match an old , broken one , the mason used a simple pointing device — the three - dimensional equivalent of a pantograph , which is a drafting instrument for precisely copying a sketch or blueprint — to mark and transfer every bump and hollow from the ancient stone to its counterpart surface on the fresh block .
On some of the largest Parthenon blocks , which exceed ten tons , the masons use a mechanized version of the pointing device , but repairing a single block can still take more than three months .
The ancient workers were no less painstaking ; in many cases , the joints between the blocks are all but invisible , even under a magnifying glass .
The Parthenon was part of an ambitious building campaign on the Acropolis that began around 450 b.c .
A generation before , the Athenians , as part of an alliance of Greek city - states , had led heroic victories against Persian invaders .
This alliance would evolve into a de facto empire under Athenian rule , and some 150 to 200 cities across the Aegean began paying Athens huge sums of what amounted to protection money .
Basking in glory , the Athenians planned their new temple complex on a lavish , unprecedented scale — with the Parthenon as the centerpiece .
Surviving fragments of the financial accounts , which were inscribed in stone for public scrutiny , have prompted estimates of the construction budget that range from around 340 to 800 silver talents — a considerable sum in an age when a single talent could pay a month ’s wages for 170 oarsmen on a Greek warship .
The Parthenon ’s base was 23,028 square feet ( about half the size of a football field ) and its 46 outer columns were some 34 feet high .
A 525 - foot frieze wrapped around the top of the exterior wall of the building ’s inner chamber .
Several scholars have argued that the frieze shows a procession related to the quadrennial Great Panathenaia , or the festival “ of all the Athenians . ”
By incorporating this scene of civic celebration , the scholars suggest , the Parthenon served not merely as an imperial propaganda statement but also as an expression of Athens ’ burgeoning democracy — the will of the citizens who had voted to fund this exceptional monument .
When the current restoration effort began in 1975 , backed by $ 23 million from the Greek government , the project ’s directors believed they could finish in ten years .
But unforeseen problems arose as soon as workers started disassembling the temples .
For example , the ancient Greek builders had secured the marble blocks together with iron clamps fitted in carefully carved grooves .
They then poured molten lead over the joints to cushion them from seismic shocks and protect the clamps from corrosion .
But when a Greek architect , Nikolas Balanos , launched an enthusiastic campaign of restorations in 1898 , he installed crude iron clamps , indiscriminately fastening one block to another and neglecting to add the lead coating .
Rain soon began to play havoc with the new clamps , swelling the iron and cracking the marble .
Less than a century later , it wasclear that parts of the Parthenon were in imminent danger of collapse .
Until September 2005 , the restoration ’s coordinator was Manolis Korres , associate professor of architecture at the National Technical University of Athens and a leading Parthenon scholar who had spent decades poringover every detail of the temple ’s construction .
In a set of vivid drawings , he depicted how the ancient builders extracted some 100,000 tons of marble from a quarry 11 miles northeast of central Athens , roughly shaped the blocks , then transported them on wagons and finally hauled them up the steep slopes of the Acropolis .
Yet all that grueling labor , Kor­res contends , was dwarfed by the time and energy lavished on fine - tuning the temple ’s finished appearance .
Carving the long vertical grooves , or flutes , that run down each of the Parthenon ’s main columns was probably as costly as all the quarrying , hauling and assembly combined .
Today ’s restorers have been replacing damaged column segments with fresh marble .
To speed up the job , engineers built a flute - carving machine .
The device , however , is not precise enough for the final detailing , which must be done by hand .
This smoothing of the flutes calls for an expert eye and a sensitive touch .
To get the elliptical profile of the flute just right , a mason looks at the shadow cast inside the groove , thenchips and rubs the stone until the outline of the shadow is a perfectly even and regular curve .
The ancients spent a lot of time on another finishing touch .
After the Parthenon ’s exposed marble surfaces had been smoothed and polished , they added a final , subtle texture — a stippling pattern — that Korres says dulled the shine on the marble and masked its flaws .
With hundreds of thousands of chisel blows , they executed this pattern in precisely ordered rows covering the base , floors , columns and most other surfaces .
“ This was surely one of the most demanding tasks , ” Korres says .
“ It may have taken as much as a quarter of the total construction time expended on the monument . ”
With such fanatical attention to detail , how could the Parthenon ’s architects have finished the job in a mere eight or nine years , ending somewhere between 438 and 437 b.c.?
( The dates come from the inscribed financial accounts . )
One key factor may have been naval technology .
Since the Athenians were the greatest naval power in the Aegean , they likely had unrivaled mastery of ropes , pulleys and wooden cranes .
Such equipment would have facilitated the hauling and lifting of the marble blocks .
Another , counterintuitive possibility is that ancient hand tools were superior to their modern counterparts .
After analyzing marks left on the marble surfaces , Korres is convinced that centuries of metallurgical experimentation enabled the ancient Athenians to create chisels and axes that were sharper and more durable than those available today .
( The idea is not unprecedented .
Modern metallurgists have only recently figuredout the secrets of the traditional samurai sword , which Japanese swordsmiths endowed with unrivaled sharpness and strength by regulating the amount of carbon in the steel and the temperature during forging and cooling . )
Korres concludes that the ancient masons , with their superior tools , could carve marble at more than double the rate of today ’s craftsmen .
And the Parthenon ’s original laborers had the benefit of experience , drawing on a century and a half of temple - building know - how .
Moreover , the restoration team has confronted problems that their ancient Greek counterparts could never have contemplated .
During the Great Turkish War in the late 17th century — when the Ottoman Empire was battling several European countries — Greece was an occupied nation .
The Turks turned the Parthenon into an ammunition dump .
During a Venetian attack on Athens in 1687 , a cannonball set off the Turkish munitions , blowing apartthe long walls of the Parthenon ’s inner chamber .
More than 700 blocks from those walls — eroded over time — now lay strewn around the Acropolis .
For five years , beginning in 1997 , Cathy Paraschi , a Greek - American architect on the restoration project , struggled to fit the pieces together , hunting for clues such as the shape and depth of the cuttings in the blocks that once held the ancient clamps .
Eventually , she abandoned her computer database , which proved inadequate for capturing the full complexity of the puzzle .
“ Some days were exhilarating , ” she told me , “ when we finally got one piece to fit another .
Other days I felt like jumping off the Acropolis . ”
In the end , she and her co-workers managed to identify the original positions of some 500 of the blocks .
Looming over each restoration challenge is the delicate question of how far to go .
Every time the workers dismantle one of Balanos ’ crude fixes , it is a reminder of how destructive an overzealous restorer can be .
Asthe director of the Acropolis Restoration Project , Maria Ioannidou , explains , “ we ’ve adopted an approach of trying to restore the maximum amount of ancient masonry while applying the minimum amount of new material .
” That means using clamps and rods made of titanium — which wo n’t corrode and crack the marble — and soluble white cement , so that repairs can be easily undone should future generations of restorers discover a better way .
There have been some bravura feats of engineering .
The 1687 explosion knocked one of the massive columns out of position and badly damaged its bottom segment .
A serious earthquake in 1981 damaged it further , and theentire column appeared at risk of toppling .
The obvious procedure was to dismantle the column , one segment after another , and replace the crumbling section .
Korres , hoping , he said , to avoid “ even the smallest departure from the column ’s perfection and authenticity of construction , ” designed a metal collar that exerts precisely controlled forces to grasp a column securely without harming the stone .
In the early 1990s , after the careful removal of the overhead blocks and lintels , the collar was suspended by turnbuckles ( adjustable connectors ) inside a mounted , rectangular steel frame .
By tightening the turnbuckles , the team raisedthe 55 - ton column less than an inch .
They then removed the bottom segment — which they repaired with fresh marble to an accuracy of one - twentieth of a millimeter — and slid it back into position .
Finally , they lowered the rest of the column into place on top of the repaired segment .
“ It was a bold decision to do it this way , ” Korres says .
“ But we were young and daring then . ”
Perhaps none of the Parthenon ’s mysteries stirs more debate than the gentle curves and inclinations engineered throughout much of its design .
There is hardly a straight line to be found in the temple .
Experts argue over whether these refinements were added to counter optical illusions .
The eye can be tricked , for instance , into seeing an unsightly sag in flat floors built under a perched roof like the Parthenon’s .
Possibly to correct this effect , the Athenians laid out the Parthenon ’s base so that the 228 - by - 101 - foot floor bulges slightly toward the middle , curving gradually upward between 4 and 4 1 / 2 inches on its left and right sides , and 2 1 / 2 inches on its front and back .
One theory holds that this slight upward bulge was built simply to drain rainwater away from the temple ’s interior .
But that fails to explain why the same curvingprofile is repeated not only in the floor but in the entablature above the columns and in the ( invisible ) buried foundations .
This graceful curve was clearly fundamental to the overall appearance and planning of the Parthenon .
And then there are the columns , which the Athenians built so that they bulged slightly outward at the center .
This swelling was termed entasis , or tension , by Greek writers , perhaps because it makes the columns seemas if they are clenching , like a human muscle , under the weight of their load .
Again , some scholars have long speculated that this design might compensate for another trick of the eye , since a row of tall , perfectlystraight - sided pillars can appear thinner at the middle than at the ends .
No matter the motivation for these refinements , many early scholars assumed that crafting such visual elements imposed tremendous extra demands on the Parthenon ’s architects and masons .
( One wrote of the “ terrifyingcomplications ” involved . )
No architectural manuals survive from the Classical Greek era , but today ’s experts suspect the temple builders could add curves and inclined angles with a few relatively simple surveying tricks .
“ If you ’re building without mortar , every block ... must be trimmed by hand , ” notes Jim Coulton , professor emeritus of classical archaeology at Oxford University .
“ Although tilts and curvatures would require careful supervision by the architect , they do n’t add a lot to the workload . ”
Still , how could each column segment be measured so that all would fit together in a single , smoothly curving profile ?
The likely answer was found not in Athens but nearly 200 miles away in southwestern Turkey .
In the town of Didyma rises one of the most impressive relics of the ancient world , the Temple of Apollo .
Three of its 120 colossal columns still stand , each nearly twice the height of the Parthenon’s .
The wealthy trading city of Miletus commissioned the temple in the age of Alexander the Great , around 150 years after completion of the Parthenon .
The gigantic ruins testify to a project of grandiose ambition : it was never finished despite 600 years of construction efforts .
But thanks to its unfinished state , crucial evidence was preserved on temple walls that had not yet undergone their final polishing .
A few years after the Parthenon restoration began , University of Pennsylvania scholar Lothar Haselberger was on a field trip exploring the Temple of Apollo ’s innermost sanctuary .
He noticed what seemed to be patterns of faint scratches on the marble walls .
In the blinding morning sunlight the scratches are all but invisible , as I discovered to my initial frustration when I searched for them .
After the sun had swung around and began grazing the surface , however , a delicate web of finely engraved lines started to emerge .
Haselberger recalls , “ All of a sudden I spotted a series of circles that corresponded precisely to the shape of a column base , the very one at the front of the temple . ”
He realized he had discovered the ancient equivalent of an architect ’s blueprint .
Then , just above the outline of the column base , Haselberger noticed a pattern of horizontal lines with a sweeping curve inscribed along one side .
Could this be related to entasis , also evident in the towering Didyma columns ?
After carefully plotting the pattern , the answer became clear : it was a profile view of a column with the vertical dimension — the height of the column — reduced by a factor of 16 .
This scale drawing must have been a key reference for the masons as they carved out one column segment after another .
By measuring along the horizontal lines to the edge of the curve , they would know exactly how wide each segment would have to be to create the smooth , bulging profile .
Manolis Korres believes that the ancient Athenians probably relied on a carved scale drawing similar to the one at Didyma in building the columns of the Parthenon .
Haselberger also traced a labyrinth of faint scratches covering most of the temple ’s unfinished surfaces .
The lines proved to be reference drawings for everything from the very slight inward lean of the walls to details of the lintel structure supported by the columns .
There were even floor plans , drafted conveniently right on the floor .
As the temple ’s stepped platform rose , each floor plan was copied from one layer to thenext .
On the topmost floor , the builders marked out the positions of columns , walls and doorways .
The discoveries at Didyma suggest that the temple builders operated on a “ plan - as - you - go ” basis .
“ Clearly , a lot of advance planning went into a building like the Parthenon , ” Coulton says .
“ But it was n’t planning inthe sense that we ’d recognize today .
There ’s no evidence they relied on a single set of plans and elevations drawn to scale as a modern architect would . ”
Still , the Parthenon remains something of a miracle .
The builders were steered by tradition , yet free to experiment .
They worked to extreme precision , yet the final result was anything but rigid .
A commanding building , with supple and fluid lines , emerged from a blend of improvised solutions .
But the miracle was short - lived .
Only seven years after the construction of the Parthenon was completed , war broke out with Sparta .
Within a generation , Athens suffered a humiliating defeat and a devastating plague .
The story of the Parthenon resembles an ancient Greek tragedy , in which an exceptional figure suffers a devastating reversal of fortune .
And from Korres ’ perspective , that calamity is all the more reason to restore the greatest remnant of Athens ’ golden age .
“ We wanted to preserve the beauty of what has survived these past 2,500 years , ” he says .
“ A reminder of man ’s power to create , as well as to destroy . ”
Eleven elderly people accused of being witches have been burned to death by a mob in the west of Kenya , police say .
A security operation has been launched to hunt down villagers suspected of killing them in Kisii District .
The BBC's Muliro Telewa in the region says the gang had a list of the victims and picked them out individually .
The area has witnessed similar attacks in the past when people suspected of engaging in witchcraft have been killed or ostracised .
But our reporter says that this is a surprisingly large number of people to be attacked at the same time .
' Witches meeting '
Anthony Kibunguchy , the provincial police officer , told the BBC that the eight women and three men were all aged between 80 and 96 years old .

The mob dragged them out of their houses and burned them individually and then set their homes alight , our correspondent says .
Residents have been ambivalent about condemning the attacks because belief in witchcraft is widespread in the area , he says .
But local official Mwangi Ngunyi spoke out against the murders .
" People must not take the law into their own hands simply because they suspect someone , " he told AFP news agency .
Villagers told reporters that they had evidence that the victims were witches .
They say they found an exercise book at a local primary school that contained the minutes of a " witches ' meeting " which detailed who was going to be bewitched next .
The victim 's families have gone into hiding , fearing for their lives .
At a small gathering at the residence of the Italian ambassador Tuesday , Republican Senator Chuck Hagel took serious issue with some of the things John McCain has been saying lately about " appeasement , " urging him to elevate the level of discourse in the campaign .
" We know from past campaigns that presidential candidates will say many things .
But once they have the responsibility to govern the country and lead the world , that difference between what they said and what responsibilities they have to fulfill are vastly different .
I 'm very upset with John with some of the things he 's been saying .
And I can't get into the psychoanalysis of it .
But I believe that John is smarter than some of the things he is saying . "
Hagel also warned that he would not hesitate to seek the impeachment of President Bush if he unilaterally attacked Iran .
When asked to respond to rumors circulating within political circles that the Bush administration was ginning up the possibility of war with Iran , the Senator even raised the specter of impeachment .
" You 've got the power of impeachment , now that is a very defined measure if you are willing to bring charges against the president at all .
You ca n't just say I disagree with him , let 's impeach him , " said Hagel .
An attack on Iran without Congress ' consent , he added , " would bring with it ... outstanding political consequences , including for the Republican Party . "
I appreciate that Hagel is n't pulling any punches given that he 's retiring this year .

DFL Senate candidate Al Franken raised nearly $ 2.2 million in campaign contributions during the first quarter of 2008 , his campaign announced today .
That amount surpasses the $ 2 million that Sen .
Norm Coleman 's campaign this week reported raising in the same period , and tops the $ 1.9 million that Franken pulled in during the last three months of 2007 .
But Franken 's campaign also reported having nearly $ 3.5 million in the bank , about half of the $ 7 million that Coleman 's campaign said it had on hand this week .
Coleman has raised about $ 12.4 million for the campaign , compared with more than $ 9.2 million reported by Franken .
Campaign officials with Jack Nelson - Pallmeyer , who is running against Franken for the DFL endorsement , said they will release his fundraising numbers next week .
However , they said that the St. Thomas professor had raised more than $ 250,000 in the last quarter and had about $ 200,000 on hand .
More than 95,000 people have contributed to the Franken campaign , officials said , of whom more than 16,000 were Minnesotans -- about 17 percent .
Nearly 5,000 Minnesotans contributed to the Franken campaign in the first quarter , they said .
Chris McNellis , Nelson - Pallmeyer 's campaign manager , said that their Minnesota donor base is about 95 percent .
In other fundraising reports :
• The campaign of U.S. Rep. Tim Walz , the DFLer who represents Minnesota 's First District , said that it raised $ 352,000 in the first quarter this year .
That makes a total of $ 1.5 million raised for the congressman 's first reelection effort , officials said .
Walz has more than $ 1 million in the bank .
About 5,300 people have contributed to the 2008 Walz campaign , including more than 1,200 new donors in the first quarter , the campaign said .
• Democrat Steve Sarvi , who hopes to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. John Kline in the Second District race , raised $ 61,108 in the first three months this year and now has a total of $ 38,672 in cash on hand .
Sarvi , an Iraq veteran , has announced that he 's resigning as Victoria city administrator on May 9 to be a full - time candidate .
" We 're feeling optimistic that when he has six or seven more hours a day to devote to fundraising , that things are going to improve substantially , " campaign spokeswoman Bridget Cusick said .
Businessman Peter Idusogie , who is also seeking the DFL nomination in the Second District race , said Thursday that he does n't plan to raise enough money to report until he receives the nomination .
He said he 's using campaign signs from his 2004 run for the party nomination , which he lost to Teresa Daly .
Kline , a three - term congressman , raised $ 194,106 in the first quarter , leaving him with $ 510,000 in the bank .

Did Hillary 's Senate run cost Gore the White House ?
Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 1 , 2007

Print This Email This As Bill Clinton 's second term as president came to a close , his attentions were divided between the political ambitions of his vice president and his wife .
A new book exposes how the former president appeared to favor Hillary Clinton 's run for Senate in New York over Al Gore 's campaign to become the Oval Office 's next occupant .
The dueling 2000 campaigns exemplified a rivalry between Hillary and Gore that dated back to Bill Clinton 's first term in office , writes Sally Bedell Smith , author of the new book For Love of Politics -- Bill and Hillary Clinton : The White House Years .
" Hillary always had an undercurrent of competition with Al Gore that burst into the open from time to time , " Smith writes in a book excerpt published in the newest issue of Vanity Fair .
Once Hillary decided she would run for Senate in New York , following the resignation of Daniel Patrick Moynihan , Bill Clinton divided his substantial fundraising prowess and White House clout between her campaign and Gore's .
Some advisers to the former vice president saw Clinton as diverting attention and resources from Gore for his wife .
" As a sitting president , Bill was in a unique position to boost his vice president 's candidacy by scheduling White House events to highlight his achievements , " Smith writes .
" But in 1999 those resources were diverted from Gore to Hillary ' in a big way , ' said one member of the Gore team .
' The Clintons come first .
That was their basic framework . ' "
In the last half of that year , according to Smith , Bill and Hillary appeared at 20 White House events , compared to just one for Gore , a mental health conference that also included his wife along with the president and first lady .
Also in 1999 , Hillary had 86 speeches posted on the White House Web site , up from 31 two years earlier and four times as many as the president and vice president combined .
" With the Hillary and Gore campaigns revving up at the same time , the three - way tensions evident in the White House since 1993 became a more serious problem , " Smith writes .
" Now Gore 's campaign advisers began to worry that Hillary 's candidacy would actually have an adverse effect on their candidate .
...
Not only was Hillary unavailable as a campaigner , she was poaching top Democratic fund - raisers and donors who would normally concentrate on the vice president . "
Although neither Hillary nor Gore appeared much in public with Bill Clinton , the then - president worked vigorously behind the scenes at private fundraisers raising money for both candidates -- " considerably more for Hillary than for Gore , " Smith writes .
Appearing at 34 events tied to Hillary 's Senate run , Bill Clinton brought in more than $ 5 million for her campaign .
He even solicited donations for her at events for other candidates , telling a fundraiser for southern California congressional candidates , " A lot of you have given to Hillary .
If you have n't , I hope you will . "
" The president so immersed himself in Hillary 's campaign that it became an extension of himself , " Smith writes .
" In some ways , their relationship had come to resemble a co-dependency more than a co-presidency . "
To be sure , there were plenty of factors that led to Gore 's defeat , from Ralph Nader 's siphoning support from liberal voters , to the vice president 's widely panned debate performances to confusing ballots handed to Florida voters .
But , Smith writes , Gore 's election loss fostered animosity between him and Clinton .
" A veneer of public graciousness between the president and vice president concealed their intensifying private anger over each other 's role in the electoral outcome , " Smith writes .
" At Gore 's request , they met in the Oval Office on Thursday , December 21 , to air their differences .
It was an unpleasant encounter , as Gore forthrightly blamed Bill 's scandals , while Bill rebuked Gore for failing to make the most of their successful record .
Afterward , Bill told Sidney Blumenthal they had parted after ' patching everything up , ' but in fact the mutual resentments among the Clintons and Gores persisted . "
DETROIT 
The General Motors Corporation said on Thursday that about 19,000 factory workers  just over a quarter of its American blue - collar work force  had taken buyouts to leave the automaker .
G.M. ’s announcement of the latest job reductions comes as the company is under increasing pressure to cut costs in the face of weak American sales and high gasoline prices .
All of G.M. ’s roughly 74,000 U.S. factory workers had been eligible for early retirement packages and buyouts intended to clear the way for hires of lower - wage workers under a deal negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers union .
G.M. said most of the U.A.W. workers taking buyouts and early retirement offers , which ranged up to $ 140,000 in one - time payouts , would leave by July 1 .

Commentators and candidates have drawn many parallels from today ’s Democratic candidates to historical figures and elections .
[ via reddit ]
[ digg - reddit - me ] Hillary Clinton has been described as Nixon and LBJ , including the latter by herself .
John Edwards has been described as a FDR ( mainly by himself ) , William Jennings Bryan and a Bobby Kennedy .
Barack Obama ’s historical analogues have been far - ranging .
Ken Burns has compared Obama to Lincoln .
David Horsey of the Seattle Post - Intelligencer has as well , as seen above .
JFK ’s top speechwriter has compared Obama to President Kennedy .
Before his Iowa win , intelligent pundits saw parallels to failed liberal candidates : Adlai Stevenson , Bill Bradley , and Gene McCarthy .
But it was n’t until Hillary took a swipe at Obama that the parallels to Barack to Martin Luther King , Jr. became evident .
The main theme of the 2008 is , and will be , change .
Americans know that we need to tackle many long - term issues :
global climate change ;
radical islamism ;
the erosion of civil liberties ;
executive overreach ;
the instability of the American economy ;
globalization , the entitlement crises ;
health care reform ;
the inequality of opportunity and the rising gap between the rich and the poor .
Our current politics – based on tears and smears , on the Bushes and the Clintons , on money and more money – is unable to produce meaningful or lasting change .
To vote for Clinton or Giuliani or Romney or Thompson or Huckabee ( and to a lesser extent McCain ) – is to vote to continue the politics of the past decades , producing gridlock and negligible progress , even as Cassandras continually point out our impending doom .
There are three candidates who embody three very different approaches to change : Ron Paul , Barack Obama , and John Edwards .
Ron Paul is quite clearly a reactionary – and in this case , I do not mean it to be derogatory .
He wants to trim government to a radical extent – back to the period before the Civil War .
I doubt the change he desires is possible – and , although I agree with his positions on many contemporary issues , I believe he goes too far in rejecting the American tradition after 1860 .
I believe there is much to criticize in the American tradition after the Civil War – but also great progress .
Ron Paul ’s opinions are a valued addition to the public debate .
It is easier to compare Barack Obama and John Edwards to each other , rather than to Paul .
They agree on many policies and in their general themes .
Their differences are about how they would lead us to the future – how they would accomplish change .
When Hillary said that Barack was not Martin Luther King – it occurred to me that the movement he represents , and the figure he projects , recalls the relationship of Martin Luther King to John Edwards ’s Malcolm X .
In many ways , the success of Obama is due to Edwards ’s harassment of Clinton .
Obama is trying to bring together people of varying political persuasions and to reach consensus on the major issues America faces .
Edwards believes we must fight for them – by extreme measures if necessary .
Obama calls on Americans to look past their race , gender , class , religion , and other social groupings to the values we share – to build on this consensus to achieve lasting change .
Edwards calls on middle and lower class Americans to look to their self - interest , and to their children ’s self - interest , and to be forceful in taking what they believe is their birthright .
Obama focuses on community organizing , bringing new people into the process and the party , and convincing skeptics ; Edwards focuses on rallying the base .
Anyone can see the relationship between Martin Luther King , Jr. and Malcolm X can see the parallels .
( Which makes Clinton , unfortunately for her , LBJ again . )
Martin Luther King and Malcolm X ’s disagreements about how to accomplish change were more fundamental than the current divide between Obama and Edwards ; but both King and Malcolm X recognized in the other the same desire for change , and respected each other as individuals and as leaders .
When I saw John Edwards defend Barack Obama against Clinton – this is what I thought of – not that the boys were ganging up on her as she suggested .
Martin Luther King succeeded where Malcolm X did not because King bet that he could bring achieve more by appealing to all Americans , rather than a select group .
Barack has made a similar bet .
While in King ’s day , the Jim Crow laws divided Americans into blacks and whites , our politics today has divided America into Red States and Blue States , liberals and conservatives , Republicans and Democrats .
We have been divided into two teams – we on our respective team , often without a clear rationale , adopt positions and defend our teams against all opposition .
Many others are turned off from politics by the partisanship entirely .
Yet polls show that agreement exists among working majorities on how to tackle some of our major long - term problems ; and even larger portions of Americans agree that something must be done to attempt to deal with the major problems we will soon face .
Obama ’s bet , like Martin Luther King , Jr. ’s , is that with a respectful and intelligent dialogue , he can change our politics ; and by changing politics , we can change America ’s path together .
It is supremely unlikely that he , or we , can accomplish this .
But we owe it to ourselves to try .

In 2004 , when Andrew Golder and Lincoln Hiatt first proposed Solitary , a reality TV show about solitary confinement , they were met with the sort of polite humoring one might reserve for a delusional person .
“ The basic response , ” Golder recalls , “ was ‘ No , that ’s too crazy . ' ”
Indeed , the initial idea was a far cry from the show they ultimately produced , in which an omniscient computer - voiced host named Val prods isolated contestants through a series of mental and physical challenges .
In the beginning , Golder and Hiatt had wanted to put contestants in underground cells — with no books , music , television , phones , or stimulation of any kind — and keep them there until they chose to quit .
This was to be true isolation , a purely psychological challenge observed through hidden cameras .
Even the producers were n’t convinced it would play .
“ How do you drive story ? ” Hiatt asks .
And then , what if players managed to hold out for a long time ?
“ We ca n’t afford to shoot for 365 days and put people in the ground and just sort of let them quit one at a time .
We do n’t have the budget for it . ”
But if the past is any indication , contestants would n’t have lasted a month .
When the late Donald O. Hebb , a psychologist at Montreal ’s McGill University , secured a grant from the Canadian Defence Research Board in 1951 to study how sensory isolation affects the human mind , he found that depriving a person of stimulation can break him in days .
Peter Milner , then Hebb ’s graduate student and now a professor emeritus at McGill , was working on another project at the time but remembers seeing the sensory - deprivation rooms and watching subjects in frosted - white goggles being led to the bathroom .
His mentor had offered male graduate students $ 20 a day — excellent pay for the ’50s — to stay in small chambers with little more than a bed .
In addition to the goggles , they wore gloves and cardboard tubes over the arms to limit their sense of touch .
A U - shaped pillow and the hum of an air conditioner masked outside noises .
“ According to his theory , the brain would deteriorate if it did n’t have a continuous stream of sensory input , ” Milner says .
Despite adequate sleep and meals and bathroom breaks , the majority of the young men lasted no more than a few days in isolation , and none more than a week .
“ Most of the subjects had planned to think about their work : Some intended to review their studies , some to plan term papers , and one thought he would organize a lecture he had to deliver , ” wrote Woodburn Heron , one of Hebb ’s collaborators , in “ The Pathology of Boredom , ” a 1957 Scientific American article describing the experiment .
“ Nearly all of them reported that the most striking thing about the experience was that they were unable to think clearly about anything for any length of time and that their thought processes seemed to be affected in other ways . ”
A series of tests showed that the volunteers ’ mental faculties were , in fact , temporarily impaired .
The students proved uncharacteristically responsive to arguments that supernatural phenomena , including ghosts and poltergeists , were real .
They performed poorly on tests involving simple arithmetic , word associations , and pattern recognition .
They also experienced extreme restlessness , childish emotional responses , and vivid hallucinations .
“ The subjects had little control over the content ” of their visions , Heron wrote .
“ One man could see nothing but dogs , another nothing but eyeglasses of various types , and so on . ”
Nor were these hallucinations merely visual :
One volunteer repeatedly heard a music box playing , another a full choir to accompany his vision of a sun rising over a church .
“ One , ” Heron wrote , “ had a feeling of being hit in the arm by pellets fired from a miniature rocket ship he saw ; another reaching out to touch a doorknob in his vision felt an electric shock . ”
D. Ewen Cameron , head of McGill ’s psychiatry department in the 1950s , soon began employing sensory deprivation as part of his “ psychic driving ” technique , an unsuccessful attempt to reprogram the minds of mentally ill patients , some of whom later filed suit .
Milner calls this “ torture , ” because unlike Hebb ’s volunteer subjects , Cameron ’s were under his control .
“ They were sick people , ” Milner says .
“ They came to him because they had a mental illness and his job was to cure them …
If they had been day patients they would have not bothered to come back .
But because they were hospitalized there was n’t much the patient could do .
“ Hebb thought it was not only stupid , but rather wicked , ” Milner adds , “ and he was right . ”
Although the CIA and other agencies may have appropriated Hebb ’s results — some of which the Canadian government forbade him from publishing — for their own purposes , the professor and his collaborators had n’t set out to perfect an interrogation or torture technique .
To the contrary , there was concern at the time that the Soviets were using sensory deprivation to brainwash Canadian POWs in Korea , and the researchers viewed their work as an attempt to understand the technique so that some sort of defense might be devised against it .
It ’s unclear exactly when the Agency caught wind of Hebb ’s work .
But in The Search for the Manchurian Candidate , a 1979 book based on thousands of pages of declassified CIA documents , author John Marks cited a 1955 contact between an Agency operative named Morse Allen and Maitland Baldwin , a neurologist at the National Institutes of Health who had received a master ’s degree from McGill in 1951 .
Baldwin , Marks wrote , had conducted “ a rather gruesome experiment in which an Army volunteer had stayed in the ‘ box ’ for 40 hours until he kicked his way out after , in Baldwin ’s words , ‘ an hour of crying loudly and sobbing in a most heartrending fashion . ’
The experiment convinced Baldwin that the isolation technique could break any man , no matter how intelligent or strong - willed . ”
Continued Marks ,
“ After numerous meetings inside the CIA on how and where to fund Baldwin , an Agency medical officer finally shot down the project as being ‘ immoral and inhuman , ’ suggesting that those pushing the experiments might want to ‘ volunteer their heads for use in Dr. Baldwin ’s ‘ noble project . ' ”
Whether participation in a particular experiment is voluntary or coerced , of course , makes all the difference when parsing psychological cruelty from reality television .
Certainly that ’s the view of Solitary coproducer Golder .
“ What makes torture so difficult is that you are out of control of your situation — a captive . ”
On his show , he counters , “ you control your fate . ”
Based on the description of Solitary I provided , Milner agrees with that distinction .
“ People are torturing themselves when they ’re running a race , a marathon or something like that , ” he says .
“ They ’re just about dead by the time they ’re finished , but they still go on .
So I do n’t think this is any more torture than any other rather extreme competition . ”
In any case , Golder and Hiatt were more interested in how to achieve the best television experience on a limited budget than in any philosophical torture debate .
When the Fox Reality Channel showed interest in their original underground crypts idea , the producers concluded that utter isolation simply was n’t interesting enough to watch .
“ You ca n’t have a hero that exists in isolation , ” Hiatt says .
“ You can do that fine in a novel , but you ca n’t do it on the screen , because your hero needs a dog to talk to .
And sometimes literally they give the hero a dog , and the hero walks along and he talks to the dog , or Clint Eastwood talks to the orangutan …
That was part of the birth of Val , because they ’ve got to talk to somebody . ”
As a fully paid - up monster of the deep , it should have swatted aside any angler with the temerity to try to catch it with a mere rod and line .
But this record - breaking Atlantic halibut bit off more than it could chew when it took on heroic Soren Beck .
As it fought to escape , Mr Beck 's small boat had to chase it across the Arctic waters off Norway to prevent either rod or line snapping .
Once the energy - sapping fight was over it took three men to haul the 30 - stoner aboard .
Back on land , they found it measured 8ft 1in in length , 6ft 4in around the middle and weighed in at 443lb , 24lb more than the previous record for a line - caught halibut .
And if Mr Beck had managed to get it to a British market it would have made around £ 2,200 .
The Dane , who was on holiday , was angling in waters which have given up some giant halibut in recent years .
The biggest , caught by a commercial fisherman , was 63st .
Halibut typically reach maturity at ten years and average 3ft 4in in length .
A halibut big enough for Jehovah ?
Proud angler Soren Beck stands next to the enormous 8ft 1in Halibut he caught after a titanic struggle off the Norwegian coast
When the fight was over , it took three men to haul the whopping flatfish on board their boat with the use of a hook on the end of a pole .
The giant fish then fought for his life for an amazing half an hour after he was pulled out of the Arctic circle waters .
The 31st monster smashed the line as it was pulled in by three fishermen and weighed a record 24 lbs
Cato Bekkevold , an expert from the region , said : ' The area where he caught it is famed for cod and coalfish , but last year the Wildwater Camps brought up 80 halibut .
' These halibut can be caught by a variety of methods , but drifting with coalfish or big shad - jigs [ a type of hook ] baited with a worm have caught the majority .
' There have been some monsters caught by commercial fishermen , with one recently off Norway weighing 314.5kg .
Soren would have made £ 2,200 if he had sold the fish at a market in the UK
' The biggest in recent times was 329 kg caught in the late 90s , and the biggest ever recorded is around 400 kg .
' It is painted in full size at the Halibut museum on the island of Senja . '
Halibut do n't recover from over - fishing as fell as other flatfish , and Atlantic halibut are often tagged then released when caught .
· Fall in users since Blunkett declassified drug in 2004 · Study finds no evidence of link with schizophrenia
Gordon Brown intends to tighten the penalties for cannabis possession despite a clear recommendation by the government 's own drug experts that it should remain a class C drug .
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs took its decision in private on Tuesday after presentations of research confirming the increased potency of most cannabis available on the street , but dispelling fears the drug has led to a growth in mental health problems .
Downing Street made it clear last night that the prime minister will press ahead with the reclassification of cannabis to a class B drug , with a maximum five - year prison sentence for possession , whatever the scientific advice from the experts when they deliver their report on April 28 .
Chief constables said they would back a decision to change the law .
Experts who attended the private meeting have confirmed to the Guardian that they have decided to recommend it remains a class C drug .
The advisory council was asked by the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , last July to look again at the legal classification of cannabis because of public concern over the impact on mental health of stronger forms of the drug known as skunk .
She acknowledged cannabis use had fallen significantly since the decision was taken in 2004 by David Blunkett to relax the penalties on the drug by downgrading it .
The Guardian has learned that a Home Office research paper presented to the meeting on Tuesday confirms that a more potent homegrown herbal cannabis has overtaken imported Moroccan resin and now accounts for 85 % of seizures by police from individuals on the street .
The Guardian understands that at the ACMD meeting , the 23 medical and drug experts heard a personal presentation on the possible mental health impacts of higher potency cannabis from psychologist Dr Martin Frisher , of Keele University pharmacy school .
The presentation used unpublished data from a confidential report he has drawn up for the Home Office .
He and his colleague Professor Illana Crome , of Keele 's academic psychiatry unit , used data from 183 GP practices across Britain between 1996 and 2005 to work out whether schizophrenia is on the rise , and whether it can be linked to the increase in cannabis use since the 1970s .
Their confidential paper found that between 1996 and 2005 there had been significant reductions in the incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia .
From 2000 onwards there were also significant reductions in the prevalence of psychoses .
The authors say this data is " not consistent with the hypothesis that increasing cannabis use in earlier decades is associated with increasing schizophrenia or psychoses from the mid-1990s onwards . "
The research was designed to test the predictions of a previous study , published last year by Dr Matthew Hickman and colleagues at Bristol University , which suggested that changes in cannabis use since the 1970s would lead to expectations that the prevalence of schizophrenia cases would increase by 10 % to 20 % over the next few years .
The results show that not only has there been no increase but the number of new cases has dropped .
Scientists stress that the vexed question of whether cannabis causes schizophrenia remains unclear .
They currently think that 8 % to 10 % of patients who suffer schizophrenia - like illnesses would not have had the condition had they not used cannabis .
These figures are debated and the role of genetic factors is still poorly understood .
Last night the Prime Minister 's spokesman said the ACMD decision appeared to be based on a single presentation , and the committee had yet to reach any final conclusions .
But he confirmed that the prime minister stood by his comments before the meeting on Tuesday that the government needed to send out a signal that cannabis use was not just illegal but also unacceptable .
Backstory
1970 Special class B category , halfway between " hard " and " soft " drugs , created for cannabis as a compromise between Labour home secretary James Callaghan , who believed it was as dangerous as heroin , and a " student faction " in cabinet who did not .
1978 Advisory council on misuse of drugs ( ACMD ) recommends downgrading cannabis from class B to class C to put it on a par with tranquillisers .
Labour home secretary Merlyn Rees rejects advice .
2002 ACMD looks again at legal status of cannabis at request of home secretary David Blunkett , and again recommends downgrading it from B to C , saying it was less harmful than other class B drugs such as amphetamines .
2004 Blunkett downgrades cannabis .
It is still illegal but police adopt a policy of " confiscate and warn " .
Maximum prison sentence for possession cut from five to two years .
2005 Charles Clarke asks ACMD to review evidence on effects of strong cannabis on mental health .
The council decides to confirms its status as a class C drug but issues a reminder of its harmfulness .
2007 Home secretary Jacqui Smith requests further review amid anxiety about more potent strains and impact on mental health .
Last month Anil Dash commented on recent announcements about Microsoft 's strategy around Web protocols in a post entitled Atom Wins : The Unified Cloud Database API where he wrote
AtomPub has become the standard for accessing cloud - based data storage .
From Google 's GData implementation to Microsoft 's unified storage platform that includes SQL Server , Atom is now a consistent interface to build applications that can talk to remote databases , regardless of who provides them .
And this milestone has come to pass with almost no notice from the press that covers web APIs and technology .
I do n't think the Atom publishing protocol can be considered the universal protocol for talking to remote databases given that cloud storage vendors like Amazon and database vendors like Oracle do n't support it yet .
That said , this is definitely a positive trend .
Back in the RSS vs .
Atom days I used to get frustrated that people were spending so much time reinventing the wheel with an RSS clone when the real gaping hole in the infrastructure was a standard editing protocol .
It took a little longer than I expected ( Sam Ruby started talking about in 2003 ) but the effort has succeeded way beyond my wildest dreams .
All I wanted was a standard editing protocol for blogs and content management systems and we 've gotten so much more .
Microsoft is using AtomPub as the interface to a wide breadth of services and products as George Moore points out in his post A Unified Standards - Based Protocols and Tooling Platform for Storage from Microsoft which states
For the first time ever we have a unified protocol and developer tooling story across most of our major storage products from Microsoft :
On - premises structured storage : SQL Server
Cloud - based structured services : SQL Server Data Services
Cloud - based Live storage services : Spaces Photos and Application Data storage
The unified on - the - wire format is Atom , with the unified protocol being AtomPub across all of the above storage products and services .
For on - premises access to SQL Server , placing an AtomPub interface on top of your data + business logic is ideal so that you can easily expose that end point to everybody that wants to consume it , whether they are inside or outside your corporate network .
And a few weeks after George 's post even more was revealed in posts such as this one about FeedSync and Live Mesh where we find out
Congratulations to the Live Mesh team , who announced their Live Mesh Technology Preview release earlier this evening !
Amit Mital gives a detailed overview in this post on http://dev.live.com.
You can read all about it in the usual places ... so why do I mention it here ?
FeedSync is one of the core parts of the Live Mesh platform .
One of the key values of Live Mesh is that your data flows to all of your devices .
And rather than being hidden away in a single service , any properly authenticated user has full bidirectional sync capability .
As I discussed in the Introduction to FeedSync , this really makes " your stuff yours " .
Okay , FeedSync is n't really AtomPub but it does use the Atom syndication format so I count that as a win for Atom +APP as well .
As time goes on , I hope we 'll see even more products and services that support Atom and AtomPub from Microsoft .
Standardization at the protocol layer means we can move innovation up the stack .
We 've seen this happen with HTTP and XML , now hopefully we 'll see it happen with Atom + AtomPub .
Finally , I think it 's been especially cool that members of the AtomPub community are seeing positive participation from Microsoft , thanks to the folks on the Astoria team who are building ADO .
NET Data Services ( AtomPub interfaces for interacting with on - site and cloud based SQL Server databases ) .
Kudos to Pablo , Mike Flasko , Andy Conrad and the rest of the Astoria crew .

On the Alex Jones Show today , a bible student at a large Christian college in Mount Vernon , Texas , related a story of intimidation as Department of Homeland Security goons dressed in black accused him of engaging in terrorism for teaching a group of Boy Scouts about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
The student and interim pastor , going by the name “ Jeff , ” told Alex Jones he was assigned last September the task of talking to a group of Boy Scouts , specifically concerning “ Americanism ” in higher education .
Jeff told the boys they need to “ reorient ” themselves to the Constitution because such knowledge will “ make or break the country . ”
After tutoring the boys , Jeff was called into the university president ’s office .
There he was confronted by a “ man in black ” wearing sunglasses from the Department of Homeland Security who was accompanied by another federal official in a gray suit .
In addition , state police were present during the interrogation and Jeff was told the FBI were also involved .
Jeff was informed “ every word ” of his conversation with the Boy Scouts was recorded and he had a transcript of the conversation .
Jeff ’s talk was , the DHS official in a gray suit declared , “ terror and espionage ” and if he continued to engage in such behavior he would be arrested and “ we can have your head on a silver platter . ”
Moreover , the feds threatened to intervene in the process of the college ’s accreditation , a threat that apparently disturbed a “ high level university official , ” who was so “ agitated ” he was shaking .
Alex referenced a Phoenix Federal Bureau of Investigation flyer , created during Clinton ’s reign , “ asking the recipients to help them fight domestic terrorism , ” according to Angel Shamaya , writing for the Keep and Bear Arms website .
The putatively “ anti- terrorism ” flyer was created by the FBI and the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office as part of “ a disinformation campaign to paint at least a few groups of Real Americans as domestic terrorists . ”
According to the flyer , if recipients encounter “ defenders of the US Constitution against [ the ] federal government and the UN , ” they are to contact the FBI ’s the Joint Terrorism Task Force immediately .
Apparently , people who make “ numerous references to the US Constitution ” and attempt “ to police the police ” are to be considered terrorists , according to the FBI .
“ According to Terry Chapman of the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office — whose name is on the flyer as the MCSO contact — the FBI created the flyer and printed the MCSO [ Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office ] and Attorney ’s Office before the text was approved .
He said it was created as a full color brochure to hand out to officers , not for the general public — and that as soon as he saw it , he urged them not to use it , knowing it had some problems , ” writes Shamaya .
As an example of how the police are now trained to consider constitutionalists dangerous terrorists or at least common criminals , consider the case of Abby Newman , a Virginia woman who refused to show her driver ’s license to a state trooper at an illegal traffic checkpoint .
Newman did not give the police permission to search her car and thus violate her Fourth Amendment right and when they did the cops discovered a pocket Constitution .
So brainwashed an ignorant were the cops , they had a discussion on the legality of the pocket Constitution , labeling it “ contraband , ” and unsure if they should arrest Newman for possessing the book .
“ Abby Newman was arrested for not showing ID in August 2000 and fell victim to an illegal vehicle search in which police found items of subversive literature , including a ‘ pocket Constitution , ' ” write Aaron Dykes and Alex Jones .
“ One officer asked the other ‘ Is this legal ? , ” an “ [ e ] gregious misinterpretation and abuse perpetrated by the very members of society supposedly in place to guarantee our freedoms . ”
Of course , these “ members of society supposedly in place to guarantee our freedoms ” are in place to do the bidding of the ruling elite , a gaggle of one - world globalists determined to not only decimate the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , eradicate the national sovereignty of the United States , but also inculcate and brainwash the public to believe such “ quaint ” freedoms and the very prospect of liberty are dangerous , the treasonous vocabulary of “ lone wolves ” and “ Super Patriots . ”
Considering the reaction of the “ high level university official ” mentioned above , agitated because a student dared teach Boy Scouts about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , it may be too late .

My last two laptops have both been Dell .
I had always loved the fact that I could customize my laptop fairly specifically at the same time as getting a great price .
At the time , other companies generally could only offer one of those options : a prepackaged bundle with a good price or customization with a premium .
During that same time , however , Dell was not without its faults .
Its computers often were n’t as aesthetically pleasing ( more utilitarian and clunky looking than some of its competitors more slick and glossy offerings ) .
And the phone support system was ( and still is , to a certain degree ) a nightmare of touch tone loops which felt like its sole purpose was to make sure you never spoke to a human .
But those disadvantages never bothered me specifically .
My laptops ’ boring looks were good enough for me .
And I went years at a time without ever needing tech support ( though I had plenty of friends with Dells that had serious issues ) .
Bottom line : I need a shopping model that provides me the best price on the exact configuration I specify .
This past month I decided it was time ( it ’s been almost three years ) once again to get a new laptop .
So I , of course , started at Dell ’s website .
But it did n’t take long before I was confused and annoyed .
Any of the consumer models with a decent price also has pretty obvious limitations in their customization options ( i.e. , no option for a dedicated , rather than built - in , video card ) .
I could , of course , customize to my heart ’s content if I were to select the appropriate higher - end model .
But then the price seemed especially inflated when the only reason I was looking at the particular model was because it has one or two more features available when compared to a perfectly acceptable lower model .
So that ’s when I began exploring alternative brands ( including HP , Lenovo , Toshiba , and Acer ) .
And that ’s also when I discovered just how well HP has taken the Dell model and made it work better than Dell itself ( all while keeping its existing model of selling through retail ) .
I got exactly what I wanted for a price hundreds of dollars less than the Dell equivalent .
I ’m sure Dell could offer me a similar competitively priced laptop .
But it chose instead to gamble with my loyalty by focusing more on the upsell than on the specific customization I needed .
So for me , at least , HP is the new Dell .
I should note that I ’ve kept details intentionally vague because in a matter of weeks hardware configurations will change .
What I wanted to capture here is a principle that wo n’t go out of date as quickly as the hardware used to illustrate it .
( This is an introduction to the user interface of Sublime Text , it 's the first in a series )
My background is in building tools for games .
I 've encountered some beautifully designed tools for artists , such as Modo , ArtRage and Silo .
At the time I was using Vim in its 16 colour , 80 column glory , and the very colourful Visual Studio .
It occurred to me : why could n't the humble text editor get some of this love ?
I 've tried to put some of this user interface craftsmanship into Sublime Text .
There are three principles I felt would be required :
Unobtrusive , minimal chrome .
The focus should be on the text , not fourteen different toolbars .
Do n't obscure the text with dialogs .
Use the pixels you 've got .
Full screen , multi monitor and editing files side by side should all be possible .
Below is a short tour showing how I 've applied these rules in building Sublime Text .
First , here 's the basic day - to - day level of chrome you are presented with :
There 's not much there , and it 's certainly not yelling at you .
Functionality like find and replace , that would generally be implemented via dialogs , is instead presented as a panel at the bottom of the screen .
The crown jewel , however , is how it works when you start to get serious .
The full screen mode does away with a maximum amount of chrome , and works seamlessly with multiple monitor setups .
Here you can see Sublime Text running on two monitors , full screen on each , with five files being edited side - by side .
Here 's a screenshot of the large monitor in the above photo , editing three files side by side in full screen .
( Warning : 2560x1600 pixels ahead ! )
Have I missed any principles ?
Have I adhered to the ones I set ?
I 'd love your thoughts and feedback .

According to the recently released Vertex Sales Tax Rate Report , 485 U.S. cities increased their sales tax rate in 2007 , representing the largest annual expansion in the number of cities that either increased their existing rates or initiated sales taxes in the past four years .
Last year , 178 cities nationwide initiated new city tax rates , while 307 cities increased their pre-existing sales tax rates .
Of these , North Courtland , Ala. , had the largest increase , to a four percent sales tax rate from one percent .
Seldovia , Alaska experienced the second largest increase to 4.5 percent from two percent .
Fredonia , Ariz . and Watts , Okla .
followed , doubling to four percent from two percent .
Several large U.S. cities also raised their sales tax rates in 2007 — Boulder , Colo . ; Phoenix , Ariz . ; St. Louis , Mo. ; Denver , Colo . and Seattle , Wash . — all increased rates between 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent .
The report also found that :
Colorado , Missouri , Texas and Washington experienced the highest number of city rate increases .
Only one state , South Carolina , raised its state - wide sales tax rate .
Catawba Indian Reservation , South Carolina and Wrangell , Alaska have the highest city sales tax rate at 7.0 percent .
Overall , the report found that 2007 sales tax rates remained higher than any previous year among those cities increasing an existing rate , illustrating an overall steady growth in the combined state , county and city average rates since 1981 ( the year in which Vertex first began tracking data ) .
However , the average U.S. sales tax rate among all taxing cities decreased slightly , from 8.579 percent in 2006 to 8.573 percent in 2007 , the result of cities initiating lower rates on first - time taxes .
With more than 450 cities raising sales tax rates last year many local governments see sales tax revenue as a viable part of the solution in addressing revenue shortfalls .
It is especially critical for corporate taxpayers to stay abreast of these sales tax rate adjustments and keep close records of all their transactions in order to remain in compliance and be prepared for potential state audits .

John Minassian is Vice President of Tax Research , Vertex , Inc .
Over the last 30 years Minassian has held various jobs in the management of the accounting , finance and tax functions of large multinational companies including E.I. DuPont de Nemours , ICI Americas and AMP Inc. ( now Tyco Electronics ) .
He did his undergraduate work at the University of Pennsylvania , earned an MBA from Drexel University and his Masters in Taxation from Villanova University .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - U.S. - based Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N , the world 's biggest electronics retailer , is to pay $ 2.1 billion for half of Britain 's Carphone Warehouse Group Plc 's CPW.L retail business to take on the European consumer electricals market .
The deal creates a joint venture that will compete with DSG International Plc DSGI.L , formerly called Dixons , and Kesa KESA.L which owns the French group Darty .
Carphone , Europe ’s biggest independent mobile phone retailer , and Best Buy , estimate the size of the European market for consumer electronics to be around 89 billion pounds ( $ 174 billion ) .
The pair said the 50 - 50 owned company would target a growing appetite for consumer electronics , but analysts said the pair are entering a tough market where incumbents are struggling .
“ European consumers are facing some of the same pressures that U.S. consumers are , ” Carphone Chief Executive Charles Dunstone said during a conference call .
But even so , there were now opportunities to obtain high - quality retail space .
“ The current environment I certainly hope is n’t going to last forever , ” Dunstone said .
Carphone ’s 2,400 existing stores will continue to operate under the Carphone Warehouse and Phone House brands in its nine European markets , and from 2009 the new company will roll out larger stores under the Best Buy name .
The deal “ provides us with the other giant consumer electronics marketplace in the world where Best Buy currently has very little offering , ” Best Buy Chief Executive Brad Anderson said .
Anderson added that the tie - up gives Best Buy , which is facing a soft spending environment at home as the U.S. economy slows , “ a long - term growth horizon that we think is extraordinary . ”
Analysts said Best Buy would bring its understanding of the consumer electronics market to Europe , a region it has long wanted to enter , but cautioned it could take some time to roll out the stores and secure a strong presence .
“ We would expect substantial investment to build out the business , ” U.S. - based Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said in a research note .
Best Buy sells consumer electronics , home - office products and entertainment software in the United States , Canada and China .
The new company will open Best Buy stores in Britain and other European countries but officials of both companies were n’t specific on numbers .
Best Buy said the venture was expected to be funded through a combination of cash on hand , existing bank lines and other borrowing .
It also said it now did not expect to repurchase shares under its existing repurchase program in fiscal 2009 .

Best Buy said it expected the deal to add around $ 5 billion to fiscal 2009 revenue , and boost earnings by five to seven cents a share in the current year .
The announcement follows months of speculation about a tie - up between the two companies after Best Buy took a small stake in the British company last year .
The two companies also operate mobile phone stores in the United States .
Best Buy is the world ’s largest listed consumer electronics retailer by market value , according to index data compiled by Reuters .
Carphone will use proceeds of the sale to pay down debt , and for investment in its other businesses -- broadband and fixed - line telecoms .
Carphone has already said it will consider making a bid for Italian broadband operator Tiscali TIS .
MI .
Shares in Carphone Warehouse were down 3.4 percent in London on Thursday after they rose over 6 percent on Wednesday on bid speculation .
Best Buy shares were off 1.9 percent to $ 42.62 in noon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
CARPHONE DIVERSIFIES
British - based analysts said broadening Carphone ’s product portfolio beyond mobile phones to other electrical goods arguably reduced risk , although they noted that consumer electronics was a tough market .
“ We believe this is a positive move , ” Landsbanki analyst Dan Gardiner said in a note to clients about Carphone .
“ We saw the distribution business as facing significant challenges and the value , once working capital outflow is factored in , at significantly below this current price .
“ Whilst this does not eliminate these problems , and we believe that the move into consumer electronics is unlikely to offer the same returns as the existing handset distribution business , this does effectively reduce the downside valuation risk , ” said Gardiner .
The sale is subject to approval by Carphone shareholders .
Bob Willett , the chief executive of Best Buy International , is expected to be chairman of the new venture , and Carphone Finance Director Roger Taylor will become chief executive in addition to retaining his existing duties .
The business will be overseen by a board comprising equal numbers of Best Buy and Carphone executives .
As everyone knows , America is experiencing an epidemic of identity theft .
In the last five years alone , complaints to the Federal Trade Commission from U.S. residents who have had their identity stolen have skyrocketed 60 percent , to 258,427 in 2007 — one - third of all consumer fraud complaints that the commission receives .
What ’s less well understood , however , is how illegal immigration is helping to fuel this rash of crime .
Seeking access to jobs , credit , and driver ’s licenses , many undocumented aliens are using the personal data of real Americans on forged documents .
The immigrants ’ identity theft has become so pervasive that the need to combat it is “ a disturbing front in the war against illegal immigration , ” according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
The FTC ’s latest statistics help show why .
The top five states in terms of reported identity theft in 2007 all have large immigrant populations — the border states of Arizona , California , and Texas , as well as Florida and Nevada .
People who pilfer legitimate identities in these states are much more likely than in other parts of the country to use them to gain employment unlawfully — the most common reason that illegal aliens steal personal information .
In Arizona , for instance , 36 percent of all identity theft is for employment purposes , compared with only 5 percent in Maine , a state with far fewer illegal aliens .
“ To many law enforcement leaders in Arizona , this suggests that Arizona ’s identity - theft epidemic is directly linked to the problem of illegal immigration , ” says a recent report by Identity Theft 911 , an Arizona company that helps businesses and individuals protect themselves .
Government investigations have only begun to uncover the extent of the crime wave .
When ICE agents raided six Swift meat - processing plants in December 2006 , they found widespread evidence of fraud involving the use of real people ’s identities ; the feds eventually charged 148 illegal aliens in the case with crimes related to identity theft .
In the first year and a half after Arizona created a special unit to deal with identity theft , investigators said that they were able to purchase more than 1,000 phony documents that made use of real people ’s identities .
A so - called three - pack — a Social Security card , a driver ’s license , and a permanent - resident card — costs on average just $ 160 in the state .
Government statistics probably grossly underestimate the size of the problem .
Many local police departments do n’t track identity theft accurately , and the FTC only reports complaints that it receives .
By combining data on complaints with FTC consumer surveys — which show that far more people have had their identity stolen than report it — Identity Theft 911 estimates that in Arizona alone , some 1.57 million people , or a quarter of the state ’s population , have been victims over the last six years .
About one - fifth are children — whose Social Security numbers are especially valuable targets , since the kids usually are n’t employed , making discovery of the fraud less likely .
“ We just do n’t know how they ’re getting all this information on minors , ” says Maryann McKessy , bureau chief for fraud and identity - theft enforcement in the Maricopa County attorney general ’s office .
One disturbing theory : health - care employees with access to children ’s files are working for organized gangs that trade in illegal documents and are willing to pay richly for the data .
“ We have a major problem with workers in medical offices stealing patients ’ identities , selling them and making a direct profit , ” Sergeant James Bracke of the Phoenix Police Department told authors of the Arizona report .
The gangs can afford these bribes because identity theft has become such a big business .
In Phoenix , “ coyotes , ” the smugglers who lead illegal immigrants over our borders , have created a network of phony - document producers and safe houses where undocumented workers can wait until they get their fraudulent papers .
Americans who have their identity stolen by these gangs are in for major headaches .
Among the complaints filed with the FTC is that of a Texas man arrested for a crime committed by an illegal alien who had filched his identity .
In another case , highlighted by Nevada senator John Ensign in last year ’s immigration - reform debate in Congress , the Internal Revenue Service hit a woman with a $ 1 million back - tax bill , even though she was a stay - at - home mom .
An investigation later found that 218 illegal aliens were using her Social Security number .
A Los Angeles police detective — who , ironically , worked in the department ’s fraud bureau — was unable to buy a home because of bills piled up by an illegal immigrant who stole his Social Security number to gain employment at a processing plant .
Then the IRS served the cop with a bill for $ 40,000 in back taxes ; when he protested , the agency threatened to send his case to collection .
Other legal residents have had their unemployment claims or workers ’ compensation cases rejected after government records showed that someone with their Social Security number was working .
Despite all this , efforts to crack down on identity theft have proved controversial .
Ensign offered an amendment to last year ’s immigration - reform bill that would have barred illegals from Social Security benefits if they obtained work using stolen identities , but the amendment went down to defeat after critics complained that it was unfair to refuse benefit payments to those who had contributed to the Social Security system , even if they did so under a false identity .
Ultimately , the immigration bill itself was defeated , in part because of controversy over its provisions to offer amnesty to illegal aliens , including those who might have stolen identities .
Frustrated by what some see as a tepid federal response , local officials in the hardest - hit areas have stepped up antitheft efforts .
In Arizona , a new law makes it a felony to use the identity of another person to obtain a job .
Local law enforcement agencies , like the Maricopa County attorney general ’s office and the Phoenix Police Department , have expanded their fraud units .
Even private businesses have gotten into the fight .
Last year , the Arizona offices of A. G. Edwards , the national brokerage firm , held “ community shred - a - thons ” to give people a chance to destroy outdated financial records and other documents that might provide information to identity - theft gangs .
But many local law enforcement agencies still do n’t treat the theft as a serious crime .
Until they do , Americans who have had their identity stolen will pay the price in time , stress , and expensive legal bills .

For $ 1,000 and up , several new companies will scan an individual ’s entire genome for clues about ancestry , potential health limitations and the inheritance of traits such as lactose intolerance .
Clients can compare their DNA with a celebrity ’s or invite friends and family members to share genetic profiles .
Despite the comprehensive reports and background data these Web - based services deliver , some observers believe the information is more recreational than relevant .
Direct - to - consumer genetic tests have existed for at least a decade , and in recent years the number of choices has exploded .
Whereas most of these offerings probe for only a small number of gene variants , advances in genome chips now allow a quick , inexpensive search for a wide range of targets all at once .
Navigenics in Redwood Shores , Calif. , 23andMe in Mountain View , Calif. , and deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik , Iceland , recently began scanning for markers associated with as many as two dozen conditions and traits .
And for upward of $ 350,000 , Knome in Cambridge , Mass . , enables customers to join J. Craig Venter and James D. Watson in the elite cadre of humans who have had their entire genome sequenced , analyzed and interpreted .
With new tools , reference sequences and big study populations in hand , geneticists have found increasingly robust associations between DNA variations and disease susceptibility .
But the data are still incomplete and sometimes conflicting , cautions Muin Khoury , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s public health genomics office .
For now , he says , sequencing one ’s genome or scanning for susceptibility markers offers “ no useful information . ”
Except in the case of rare disorders caused by a single gene variant , having a genetic susceptibility is far from a guarantee of falling ill .
Multiple genes interact within a complex biological system that includes many other important players , among them RNA and chemicals in the environment .
Complex conditions such as diabetes or heart disease have myriad behavioral and environmental components working in concert with an unknown number of genes .
With so much still to learn , it is too early to use results from gene association studies for health - planning purposes , according to Khoury .
Besides , he points out , it is unclear in the medical literature whether news about genetic susceptibility to particular conditions has any power to change people ’s habits .
Moreover , physicians are unsure how to apply the drug metabolism information from pharmacogenomics tests in their prescribing decisions .
And in some cases , the tests offered online seem altogether disconnected from genetic medicine .
A July 2006 U.S. Government Accountability
Office study of services provided by nutrigenetics companies questioned whether , in some cases , any DNA was analyzed at all .
The agency concluded that the firms “ mislead consumers by making predictions that are medically unproven . ”
The new genotyping companies claim to cut through the confusion by delivering high - quality , responsible science .
They stop short of offering medical services and instead promote their scans as an innovative means to provide health information and empower consumers to act on it .
While genetics research moves forward , the companies say , people can start working now with their doctors or take steps to change their diet or other behaviors .
“ It ’s better to start than to wait an indefinite period of time until the science is perfect , ” insists Mari Baker , chief executive of Navigenics .
Not all of the 1.8 million points her company scans on the genome are informative today , she says , but customers will be able to access ongoing findings as they come in .
Eventually Navigenics plans to incorporate other health data , such as family history and medication use .
Some experts worry that the rollout strategy could backfire .
Because the relevance of whole - genome scans is so limited , warns Sharon Terry , president and chief executive of the advocacy group Genetic Alliance , “ the average person may lose interest before there is enough information to have utility . ”
Along with creating tools such as an online guide to family health history and a WikiGenetics Web site , Genetic Alliance is pressing for regulations that would protect against discrimination , safeguard privacy , and require quality and validity testing .
So far efforts to extend laws into these areas have failed .
Navigenics , 23andMe and deCODE specify that customers own their personal data .
But executives keep the door open to use their growing databases for research with commercial or nonprofit partners .
Such studies should take place under research protocols , not as an outgrowth of consumer marketing , the CDC ’s Khoury argues .
For now , he says , the best tool available to personalize medicine is low tech and low cost : family health history .
It captures the effects of multiple genes , shared environment and common behavior .
But less than one third of the population has actively collected such information .
Genotyping is a wonderful research technology , Khoury remarks , but “ it ’s going to take a long time to translate gene discovery into action . ”
Editor 's Note :
This story was originally printed with the title " Taking Genomes Personally "
If you ’re going to read any analysis of the state of play for Democrats , today ’s NY Times piece is actually pretty good .
It has substance — something you will find sorely lacking from most of the breathlessly panting pundits on any of the cable shows ( with the exception of Chuck Todd ) .
Anyone paying attention has heard this made up spin from the Clinton operation :
In recent weeks , Clinton advisers have been challenging Mr. Obama ’s electability in a general election , and her victories in Ohio and Pennsylvania are perhaps her best evidence yet to argue that she is better suited to build a coalition across income , education and racial lines in closely contested states .
If that ’s her “ best evidence , ” the Clinton campaign is in big trouble .
Because , like so much of what comes out of the Clinton operation , it ’s just not true :
But the Pennsylvania exit polls , conducted by Edison / Mitofsky for five television networks and The Associated Press , underscore a point that political analysts made on Wednesday : that state primary results do not necessarily translate into general election victories .
“ I think it differs state to state , and I think either Democrat will have a good chance of appealing to many Democrats who did n’t vote for them the first time , ” said Peter Hart , a Democratic pollster not affiliated with either campaign .
“ Take Michigan .
It has a Democratic governor , two Democratic senators , and many Democratic congressmen , so it ’s probably going to be a pretty good state for the Democrats in a recession year . ”
Mr. Hart , as well as Obama advisers , also say that Mr. Obama appears better poised than Mrs. Clinton to pick up states that Democrats struggle to carry , or rarely do , in a general election , like Colorado , Iowa , Missouri and Virginia , all of which he carried in the primaries .
Obama advisers say their polling indicates he is more popular with independents , and far less divisive than Mrs. Clinton , in those states .
“ Hillary goes deeper and stronger in the Democratic base than Obama , but her challenge is that she does n’t go as wide , ” Mr. Hart said .
“ Obama goes much further reaching into the independent and Republican vote , and has a greater chance of creating a new electoral map for the Democrats . ”
Indeed , if Mr. Obama does become the first African - American nominee of a major party , the electoral landscape of the South could be transformed with the likelihood of strong turnout of black voters in Republican - leaning states like Georgia and Louisiana , which Mr. Obama carried this winter .
( Mrs. Clinton has also argued that , given the Clinton roots , she could put at least Arkansas in play in the fall . )
So , that talking point from Team Clinton has pretty much been proven false .
Wo n’t stop them from pushing it , but any pundit or superdelegate with a modicum of sense , will know they ’re being played on this one .
" a hand - scrawled list of 22 officers , 5 of whom had already been gunned down in the street . "
" A turf war among drug cartels has claimed more than 210 lives in the first three months of this year . "
" The number of homicides this year is more than twice the total number of homicides for the same period last year . "
" Several mass graves hiding 36 bodies in all have been discovered in the backyards of two houses owned by drug dealers . "
" At the height of the violence , around Easter , bodies were turning up every morning , at a rate of almost 12 a week . "
" ' Neither the municipal government , nor the state government , is capable of taking on organized crime , ' Mayor José Reyes Ferriz said in an interview . "
" The local police are outgunned , underpaid , prone to corruption and lack the authority to investigate drug dealers … "
" The first batch of 150 new recruits came out of the academy in January , but they entered a force where most officers either feared drug dealers too much to move against them or lived on their payroll . "
Location :
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has drawn praise from U.S. drug warriors for his commitment to fighting back against the drug cartels .
Unfortunately , current strategies for reducing drug trade violence tend to have the opposite of their intended effect .
Via New York Times , this is what you get when you really crack down on the drug traffickers :
After decades of full - scale international drug war , the central fronts in this great crusade appear before us today literally smoldering , littered with shell - casings and stained in blood .
That is drug prohibition 's legacy and it will not change or improve .
Violence will fluctuate between frequent and perpetual .
Illicit drug markets will fluctuate between high availability and totally saturation .
That is just the way it is and the way it will always be so long as the people currently in charge of addressing the drug problem are permitted to continue trying their ideas .
Thus , any realistic debate over our drug laws should n't be spiked with fictitious references to future victories or meaningful progress .
An honest defense of the drug war , if such a thing could exist , would have to defend our current conditions and claim that it would be best if things stayed this way forever .
Disparities of Thousands of Votes , Faulty Flash Cards , At Least One Race Overturned After Tabulation Failures Discovered ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/22/2008 , 1:40 pm PT
Arkansas had huge problems with their ES&S voting systems during local elections last Tuesday .
Malfunctioning machines at multiple sites , and thousands of vote disparities , led to recounts , changed outcomes and at least one race was overturned in the bargain .
It 's hardly he first time they 've had problems with their ES&S voting systems in the state .
Arkansas uses ES&S for almost everything with regards to elections and the vendor has a record of terrible work there , as we saw in 2006 .
( See bottom of article for links to scores of previous examples . )
" No voting machines functioned properly at any of the 32 White County voting sites on Tuesday , " according to the Daily Citizen .
That problem , most likely related to failures in the Ballot Definition Files as we 'd warned about on Monday , seems to have led to a 3,954 vote disparity in two different races .
That discovery then led to a " recount " of all the races on the ballot , which subsequently changed all results , and even overturned one of the races .
In Crawford County , it was " faulty " flash cards , reportedly , which initially led to the inability of the central tabulator computer to read the voting results from the county 's 43 electronic voting machines .
From the Daily Citizen : " Winner rejoices , then deflated " ...
A 3,954 - vote disparity was reported for ballots cast in the circuit judge 's race ( 11,567 ) compared to the number of ballots cast in the district judge 's race ( 7,613 ) concerning only White County voters .
When Hudgins brought the discrepancy to the attention of the White County Election Commission , a recount of votes was announced for 7 p.m. Wednesday .
The results of the recount completely changed the totals of every race in the county and changed the outcome of one - the circuit judge 's race .
" What happened last night was there was a procedural error in the reading of the PEBs [ Programmable Electronic Ballots ] , " said Thomas .
" Last night we read early votes from the PEB 's and it doubled it . "
And more from the Daily Citizen ...
Primary election results were delayed and disputed Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning after no voting machines functioned properly at any of the 32 White County voting sites Tuesday .
By late Wednesday night , a set of revised unofficial vote totals revealed Mark Derrick - deemed the winner earlier Wednesday - had actually lost to Tom Hughes in the race for circuit judge , district 17 .
A programming error with time settings caused a domino effect of further complications , names were left off ballots and a vote - counting machine failed .
Candidates , citizens and supporters waited in the second floor courtroom of the White County courthouse until 1 a.m. to get a hard copy of the unofficial results .
No preliminary results were announced during the night and little if any explanations were provided as to the delay .
White County was n't the only one with problems on Tuesday .
Crawford County had similar problems with their ES&S iVotronics as well ...
City clerk officials said they had 43 electronic voting machines located throughout the county .
When the votes were taken back to the courthouse to be counted , machines software suffered from a glitch and officials were unable to pull the results from the machines , officials said .
The Times Record offers a few more details on the problem ...
A spokesman in the county clerk ’s office said a number of the flash cards installed in the county ’s voting machines apparently were faulty , delaying the tabulation of results by the county ’s reading equipment .
County Clerk Sammie
Page had reported during the election that turnout was light and no polling sites had complained of any machine malfunctions .
It was only after 7:30 p.m. , when tabulation of the results began , that problems arose .
The paper goes on to add that this election was " an improvement over Crawford County ’s November 2006 general election , " when a " failure of ES&S equipment that night resulted in the hand counting of many paper ballots . "
Though it 's not clear which " ballots " they are referring to , since the county uses iVotronic touch - screens .
They do n't produce " paper ballots , " but rather paper - trails which voters may , or may not , have been able to verify as accurately reflecting their votes .
Either way , there is no way to prove after such an election that any such " paper trail " was printed accurately to the voters intent .

An abrupt release of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , about 635 million years ago from ice sheets that then extended to Earth 's low latitudes caused a dramatic shift in climate , triggering a series of events that resulted in global warming and effectively ended the last " snowball " ice age , a UC Riverside - led study reports .
The researchers posit that the methane was released gradually at first and then in abundance from clathrates -- methane ice that forms and stabilizes beneath ice sheets under specific temperatures and pressures .
When the ice sheets became unstable , they collapsed , releasing pressure on the clathrates which began to degas .
" Our findings document an abrupt and catastrophic means of global warming that abruptly led from a very cold , seemingly stable climate state to a very warm also stable climate state with no pause in between , " said Martin Kennedy , a professor of geology in the Department of Earth Sciences , who led the research team .
" This tells us about the mechanism , which exists , but is dormant today , as well as the rate of change , " he added .
" What we now need to know is the sensitivity of the trigger : how much forcing does it take to move from one stable state to the other , and are we approaching something like that today with current carbon dioxide warming . "
Study results appear in the May 29 issue of Nature .
According to the study , methane clathrate destabilization acted as a runaway feedback to increased warming , and was the tipping point that ended the last snowball Earth .
( The snowball Earth hypothesis posits that the Earth was covered from pole to pole in a thick sheet of ice for millions of years at a time . )
" Once methane was released at low latitudes from destabilization in front of ice sheets , warming caused other clathrates to destabilize because clathrates are held in a temperature - pressure balance of a few degrees , " Kennedy said .
" But not all the Earth 's methane has been released as yet .
These same methane clathrates are present today in the Arctic permafrost as well as below sea level at the continental margins of the ocean , and remain dormant until triggered by warming .
advertisement
" This is a major concern because it 's possible that only a little warming can unleash this trapped methane .
Unzippering the methane reservoir could potentially warm the Earth tens of degrees , and the mechanism could be geologically very rapid .
Such a violent , zipper - like opening of the clathrates could have triggered a catastrophic climate and biogeochemical reorganization of the ocean and atmosphere around 635 million years ago . "
Today , the Earth 's permafrost extends from the poles to approximately 60 degrees latitude .
But during the last snowball Earth , which lasted from 790 to 635 million years ago , conditions were cold enough to allow clathrates to extend all the way to the equator .
According to Kennedy , the abruptness of the glacial termination , changes in ancient ocean - chemistry , and unusual chemical deposits in the oceans that occurred during the snowball Earth ice age have been a curiosity and a challenge to climate scientists for many decades .
" The geologic deposits of this period are quite different from what we find in subsequent deglaciation , " he said .
" Moreover , they immediately precede the first appearance of animals on earth , suggesting some kind of environmental link .
Our methane hypothesis is capable also of accounting for this odd geological , geochemical and paleooceanographic record . "
Also called marsh gas , methane is a colorless , odorless gas .
As a greenhouse gas , it is about 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide , and has largely been held responsible for a warming event that occurred about 55 million years ago , when average global temperatures rose by 4 - 8 degrees Celsius .
advertisement
When released into the ocean - atmosphere system , methane reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and can cause marine dysoxia , which kills oxygen - using animals , and has been proposed as an explanation for major oceanic extinctions .
" One way to look at the present human influence on global warming is that we are conducting a global - scale experiment with Earth 's climate system , " Kennedy said .
" We are witnessing an unprecedented rate of warming , with little or no knowledge of what instabilities lurk in the climate system and how they can influence life on Earth .
But much the same experiment has already been conducted 635 million years ago , and the outcome is preserved in the geologic record .
We see that strong forcing on the climate , not unlike the current carbon dioxide forcing , results in the activation of latent controls in the climate system that , once initiated , change the climate to a wholly different state . "
As part of their research , Kennedy and his colleagues collected hundreds of marine sediment samples in South Australia for stable isotope analysis , an important tool used in climate reconstruction .
At UCR , the researchers analyzed the samples and found the broadest range of oxygen isotopic variation ever reported from marine sediments that they attribute to melting waters in ice sheets as well as destabilization of clathrates by glacial meltwater .
Next in their research , Kennedy and his colleagues will work on estimating how much of the temperature change that occurred 635 million years ago was due solely to methane .
Kennedy , who directs the Global Climate and Environmental Change Graduate Program in UCR 's Department of Earth Sciences , was joined in the study by UCR's David Mrofka ; and Chris von der Borch of Flinders University , Australia .
The study was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and NASA Exobiology .

It has n’t been made official yet , but it looks like the Bush Administration and Congress have reached a deal on an economic stimulus package , the major component of which will include tax rebates of up to $ 600 per person :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) — American taxpayers would get checks of several hundred dollars from the federal government under a plan to stimulate the economy , sources said Thursday .
Congressional leaders of both parties were talking with their membership to sell the plan , sources said .
Sources on Capitol Hill and at the Treasury Department said congressional and White House negotiators agreed upon checks of $ 600 per individual and $ 1,200 per couple who paid income tax and who filed jointly .
People who did not pay federal income taxes but who had earned income of more than $ 3,000 would get checks of $ 300 per individual or $ 600 per couple .
A Democratic aide and Republican aide said there will be an additional amount per child , which could be in the neighborhood of $ 300 .
Concidentally , Don Boureaux points out in today ’s Christian Science Monitor why such “ tax rebate ” plans wo n’t do anything to stimulate the economy :
Government cannot create genuine spending power ; the most it can do is to transfer it from Smith to Jones .
If the Treasury sends a stimulus check to Jones , the money comes from taxes , from borrowing , or is newly created .
If it comes from taxes , the value of Jones ’s stimulus check is offset by the greater taxes paid by Smith , who will then have fewer dollars to spend or invest .
If Uncle Sam borrows to pay for the stimulus checks , this borrowing takes money out of the private sector .
Any dollars borrowed – whether from foreigners or fellow Americans – for purposes of stimulus would have been spent or invested in other ways were they not loaned to the government .
The only other means of paying for such stimulus is for the Federal Reserve to create new money .
Unfortunately , this option leads inevitably to inflation .
All Americans wind up with more dollars in their wallets but also paying higher prices in the stores .
Prosperity is not created by raining down upon the populace more monochrome pictures of dead statesmen .
Stimulus funded with newly created money is especially harmful .
Most obviously , the inflation it causes prompts investors to flee the dollar .
But because inflation can take time to show up , injecting new money into the economy can create a temporary sense that consumers and investors are wealthier than they really are .
Such a false sense dangerously delays the necessary pruning of unfruitful investments .
A bad economy is prolonged .
Creating a “ temporary sense ” that the economy is n’t really that bad is , of course , exactly what the politicians are aiming for here .
They ’re not aiming to actually fix what ’s wrong , they ’re aiming to make it seem like they fixed it in time for the upcoming elections .
Which is why both political parties , Republican and Democrat , are behind the idea and why it ’s taken less than a week from when President Bush first spoke about a stimulus package for Congress and the White House to reach an agreement .
It ’s in both their interests to make people think that they ’re doing something that will help , even if it wo n’t .
Instead of the temporary fixes that Washington is concentrating on , Boudreaux says that politicians should focus on fixing the fundamentals and stop engaging in policies that discourage investment and growth :
First , Mr. Bush should call for a substantial and permanent cut in both capital - gains and personal - income tax rates .
Next , he should insist on a large reduction in federal spending , including elimination of all agricultural subsidies .
While he ’s showing such courage , he might as well unconditionally endorse free trade .
Cutting taxes is , of course , a good thing , but it ’s important to know why .
The goal would not be to increase consumer spending .
Instead , it would be to raise the returns on investment and work .
By letting investors and workers keep more of the fruits of their risk - taking , creativity , and efforts , the economy will enjoy more risk - taking , creativity , and effort .
Businesses that would otherwise not be started would be created .
Likewise with machinery and training that increases worker productivity .
Investors worldwide would flock to take advantage of these lower tax rates , further increasing productive investments .
(…)
Finally , Bush should assure the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve that he neither expects nor wants them to use monetary policy politically .
Reminding them of the wisdom of Milton Friedman , he should strongly urge them to keep a tight rein on the money supply .
Of course , as Boudreaux notes , none of these policies will have the immediate impact that politicians desire , and none of them will be as readily apparent to voters as a $ 1,200 check in their mailbox , which is exactly why thery wo n’t be adopted .
Administration officials say the risk of angering the new government in Pakistan and stirring increased anti-American sentiment in the tribal areas outweighs the benefits of dismantling militant networks in the region .
“ It ’s certainly something we want to get to , but not yet , ” said one Bush administration official .
“ If you do it now , you can expect to do it without Pakistani approval , and you can expect to do it only once because the Pakistanis will never help us again . ”
Spokesmen for the White House and State Department declined to comment , as did a spokeswoman for Ambassador Patterson in Pakistan .
Intelligence officials say they believe that leaders of the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups have in recent months forged closer ties to the cadre of Qaeda leaders in the tribal areas .
Officials have said that they thought the leader of the Taliban there , Jalaluddin Haqqani , may have died last year .
But Mr. Haqqani recently released a video denying those reports and made reference to a military attack in eastern Afghanistan that happened this March .
Mr. Haqqani ’s son , Sirajuddin , has also made aggressive efforts to recruit foreign fighters from the Persian Gulf and elsewhere in Central Asia .
“ The relationship between the Taliban and Al Qaeda , and Al Qaeda and other groups such as the Haqqani network , are stronger today than they were , and they ’re primarily based on the Pakistani side of the border , ” said Seth Jones , an analyst with the RAND Corporation , in Congressional testimony this month after his trip to Afghanistan .
The Haqqanis are suspected of organizing a suicide attack on March 3 that killed two American soldiers at an Afghan government office .
Sirajuddin Haqqani is also suspected of orchestrating a suicide bomb attack in January at the Serena Hotel in Kabul that killed six people .
The discussions over how to combat Al Qaeda and Pakistani militant networks in the tribal areas have been going on for nearly two years , as American policy makers have weighed the growing militant threat in the border area against unilateral American action that could politically weaken President Pervez Musharraf , a close ally in the global counterterrorism campaign .
Ubuntu spreads its wings
Ubuntu 8.04 , codenamed Hardy Heron , spread its wings and flew out of the nest last month .
This is the second Ubuntu release to offer long - term support , which means that critical updates will be available on the desktop for three years and on the server for five years .
The extended lifespan makes this release an important one for Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu , because it is a key part of the company 's strategy to bring its Linux distribution into enterprise environments .
We tested Ubuntu 8.04 extensively on the desktop throughout the entire development cycle and watched the functionality evolve in the various alpha and beta releases ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) .
The final release is an incremental improvement over Ubuntu 7.10 , with lots of added polish and some significant new features .
Although Ubuntu 8.04 has a lot to offer , there are some flaws that significantly detract from the quality of the user experience .
After spending some time living with Hardy Heron , we have plenty of thoughts to share with you .
Installing Ubuntu 8.04
The Ubuntu installer runs from a complete Ubuntu Linux environment that boots from a CD and includes an assortment of useful applications and utilities , including a web browser , instant messaging program , and office suite .
The installer , which has changed little since the 7.10 release , walks the user through the partitioning process and several other configuration tasks before installation .
The LiveCD environment seems to provide slightly better hardware detection in this release than it did in the previous version .
For instance , it properly configured my network hardware so that I could surf the web without having to manually specify which ethernet device to use .
Display detection is also slightly better in 8.04 , but still works poorly on systems with multiple monitors .
Ubuntu 8.04 is the first version to include Wubi , a new installation system that allows Windows and Ubuntu to share a partition .
The Wubi installer runs from within Windows and installs Ubuntu into a folder on the Windows filesystem .
It sets up a boot menu so that users can choose which operating system to run when the computer starts .
Wubi users can uninstall Ubuntu with the Add / Remove Programs utility in Windows .
Wubi eliminates the challenges typically associated with partitioning and makes it possible for prospective users to try Ubuntu without any risks .
It makes the entire Ubuntu installation process just as easy as installing a regular Windows program .
Wubi is a big game - changer because it facilitates a commitment - free approach that could make the transition to Linux a lot more palatable for many users .
The Wubi installer is included in the regular Ubuntu LiveCD image , so you can do Wubi installations and full Ubuntu installations from the same media .
Users can also download just the Wubi installer and use it without having to burn a CD at all .
It is now compatible with several versions of Windows , including 98 , 2000 , XP , and Vista .
We have tested it extensively on Windows XP .
Although there are many advantages to using Wubi for dual - boot environments , there are still some trade - offs that make a regular installation more desirable for long - term use .
The Wubi approach incurs a slight performance penalty and does not yet support suspend and hibernate features .
Yes , Hillary Rodham Clinton may still have a chance of winning the Democratic nomination .
But it ’s probably smaller than the chance that a continued slugfest will hand the White House to John McCain .
Consider what it would take for Senator Clinton to win .
For starters , she would have to pull ahead in the popular vote , to balance her second - place spot in number of states won and in pledged delegates .
As Bill Clinton put it on March 17 : “ If Senator Obama wins the popular vote then the choice will be easier .
But if Hillary wins the popular vote but ca n’t quite catch up with the delegate votes , then you have to just ask yourself which is more important and who is more likely to win in November . ”
Even Mr. Clinton seemed to concede the nomination to Mr. Obama unless Mrs. Clinton wins the popular vote ; without that , she does n’t even have an argument .
Unfortunately for the Clintons , almost nobody who has done the math thinks that she can win the popular vote without re-votes in Florida and Michigan .
Mrs. Clinton is more than 700,000 votes behind in the popular vote .
With 10 states and territories still to vote , perhaps another six million votes could be cast if turnout is very high , by the count of Ben Smith at Politico.com .
Landslides caused by the Sichuan earthquake have blocked rivers and formed new , possibly unstable , lakes .
Satellite images taken by the Taiwan 's National Space Organisation ( NSPO ) show one such lake forming in Beichuan County , one of the areas worst hit by the quake .
The top image was taken in 2006 , showing the river in its normal state .
The second and third images were taken after the quake .

What are these ?
Er war so müde , dass er mit einem Kauen im Mund einschlief
Based on the book " The Demon Haunted World : Science as a candle in the dark " published by Headline 1996 .
The following are suggested as tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent arguments :
Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the facts
Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view .
Arguments from authority carry little weight ( in science there are no " authorities " ) .
Spin more than one hypothesis - do n't simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy .
Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it 's yours .
Quantify , wherever possible .
If there is a chain of argument every link in the chain must work .
" Occam 's razor " - if there are two hypothesis that explain the data equally well choose the simpler .
Ask whether the hypothesis can , at least in principle , be falsified ( shown to be false by some unambiguous test ) .
In other words , is it testable ?
Can others duplicate the experiment and get the same result ?
Additional issues are
Conduct control experiments - especially " double blind " experiments where the person taking measurements is not aware of the test and control subjects .
Check for confounding factors - separate the variables .
Common fallacies of logic and rhetoric
Ad hominem - attacking the arguer and not the argument .
- attacking the arguer and not the argument .
Argument from " authority " .
Argument from adverse consequences ( putting pressure on the decision maker by pointing out dire consequences of an " unfavourable " decision ) .
Appeal to ignorance ( absence of evidence is not evidence of absence ) .
Special pleading ( typically referring to god's will ) .
Begging the question ( assuming an answer in the way the question is phrased ) .
Observational selection ( counting the hits and forgetting the misses ) .
Statistics of small numbers ( such as drawing conclusions from inadequate sample sizes ) .
Misunderstanding the nature of statistics ( President Eisenhower expressing astonishment and alarm on discovering that fully half of all Americans have below average intelligence ! )
) Inconsistency ( e.g. military expenditures based on worst case scenarios but scientific projections on environmental dangers thriftily ignored because they are not " proved " ) .
Non sequitur - " it does not follow " - the logic falls down .
- " it does not follow " - the logic falls down .
Post hoc , ergo propter hoc - " it happened after so it was caused by " - confusion of cause and effect .
- " it happened after so it was caused by " - confusion of cause and effect .
Meaningless question ( " what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object ? ) .
Excluded middle - considering only the two extremes in a range of possibilities ( making the " other side " look worse than it really is ) .
Short - term v. long - term - a subset of excluded middle ( " why pursue fundamental science when we have so huge a budget deficit ? " ) .
Slippery slope - a subset of excluded middle - unwarranted extrapolation of the effects ( give an inch and they will take a mile ) .
Confusion of correlation and causation .
Straw man - caricaturing ( or stereotyping ) a position to make it easier to attack ..
Suppressed evidence or half - truths .
Weasel words - for example , use of euphemisms for war such as " police action " to get around limitations on Presidential powers .
" An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public "
Above all - read the book !

Q : How can you tell when politicians are lying ?
A : When they say they are n’t .
As we wade deeper into the silly swamp that is Electoral Trainwreck ’08 I realize that most nights I wind up giggling myself to sleep .
My old friend Disraeli famously observed that people tend to get the government they deserve , and as I ’ve noted before , the average US citizen is barely smart enough to come in out of the rain , and under no circumstances should be entrusted with something as important as the franchise .
Stupid is as stupid votes .
A significant part of the problem has to do with the nation ’s obsessive fixation on the individual .
If a candidate lies , he ’s a liar !
If an office holder commits some act of malfeasance , she ’s dishonest !
If all politicians ( or a distressingly high majority ) prove themselves unreliable , then – and here ’s where it gets good – all politicans are crooks !
However , an American can make that kind of sweeping statement without , remarkably , ever lifting the focus above the level of the individual .
All individuals together are seen as a collection of individuals and never in terms of the system .
It ’s as though America does n’t believe it possible that individual people can be consistently shaped by collective forces .
There is no system .
Every single person is unique from the moment of conception and is immune to the influences of nurture .
Now I ’ve done it – I ’ll be up giggling half the night again .
Yes , this is all leading somewhere .
Specifically , it ’s leading to the plush lounging car on the Straight Talk Express .
Sort of .
Republican nominee John McCain has styled himself as a straight - shooting maverick , a man who ’s by god going to tell you the by god truth whether you by god like it or do n’t , by god .
Which , my friends in the world of marketing tell me is a great brand position , the silliness of the proposition notwithstanding .
That McCain has a fleeting and malleable relationship with the facts , the truth and what he said yesterday ( or , for that matter , 15 seconds ago ) is a point hardly worth arguing .
However – what about that “ system ” issue I was ranting about a moment ago ?
Let me see if I can state my thesis clearly here – and I ’ll use boldface to make sure my American readers do n’t miss it :
When we say that a politician is lying , and further note the details that prove it , we are making a point that is at once accurate and wholly irrelevant .
We are , in the process , wasting productive energy that ought to be applied to the actual problem – the system of politics and power that guarantees ubiquitous corruption forever and ever amen .
I ’m tempted to devote a few hundred paragraphs here to the notion that power and money tend to attract those who are intoxicated by power and money , and of all the people on Earth those are the ones least to be trusted with power and money .
Instead , though , I want to address the abject futility of straight talk .
That is , what would happen to a politician who was genuinely committed to telling the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
( If you have an IQ above around 80 , now you ’re the one doing the giggling , but indulge me . )
In short , there ’s simply no way that John McCain could ever be a straight shooting maverick .
Not that this excuses him – or Clinton or Obama or any other high - profile “ public servant ” – it just shifts the focus from the individual fish onto the larger pond .
The ecosystem of equivocation , if you will .
Consider .
Take the issue of abortion .
If our mythical candidate is pro-choice and says so , there go millions of votes that are n’t coming back .
If he or she is anti-abortion and says so , there go all those other votes , and they ’re not coming back , either .
What if the candidate has a more nuanced perspective , something deeper than what would fit on your average bumper sticker ?
Well , now there ’s a position that needs a little explaining , and after about four seconds the audience is either asleep , drooling or convinced that the cadidate is dangerously intellectual .
Hmmm .
What if somebody close to the candidate says or does something embarrassing .
If you defend the associate , you ’re aligning yourself with the forces of evil , terror , communism , Satanism and / or liberalism .
If not , you ’re disloyal .
If you suck up to a special interest group , you get poleaxed for pandering .
If you do n’t … uhhh , is this your first trip to America , Mr. Also - Ran ?
What if you once believed X , but have , after long consideration realized that you were wrong ?
( That is , what if you ’re a thinking human being bent on personal growth and actualization ? )
Well , if you ’re a real straight shooter you change your position and explain why in an attempt to draw others to your wisdom .
Which makes you a … come on , let ’s all say it together … flip - flopper !
But , you say , new information emerged that changed the complexion of the issue entirely .
Yeah , I ’m sure your opponent will accept that argument and we know that voters are sophisticated enough to parse those kinds of complexities .
Maybe you believe that the people ca n’t be trusted with power , that power rightfully belongs in the hands of a narrow , hyper - wealthy elite .
Hmmm .
Shoot as straight as you want , but ai n’t nobody voting for that .
And if you believe that the corporatist elite is destroying the nation ’s liberties ?
Sure , fire away , but do n’t blame me if you ca n’t win the White House on the strength of a few $ 5 donations from the non-wealthy non-elite .
Live in a nice house ?
That disqualifies you from being concerned about poverty .
Told the truth about a corrupt war ?
Why do n’t you support the troops ?
Get the idea ?
God himself could drop down out of Heaven and run for president , and if he did , one of two things would happen .
Either he ’d stick to his guns and tell the truth until the ends of the world or he ’d cave and tell people what they wanted to hear .
If the former he ’d never make it past New Hampshire and if the latter , well , I think my point is proven already .
That McCain is shooting straight is a simply laughable idea , and the same goes for Clinton and Obama .
But ultimately , it ’s not really their fault that they ’re unrelenting liars .
It ’s yours .
You spread their clever viral videos , you substitute cheap slogans for actual analysis of policy positions , you watch the gotcha !
press that propagates the system of deception , you buy the products of the companies that sponsor the whole circus .
You .
You do n’t like the idea that it ’s your fault ?
Hmmm .
But you do all the things I accuse you of , right ?
If it is n’t your fault , whose is it ?
Ah – the system .
Okay , so now that we ’ve realized I ’m right , what to do about it ?
I can hardly put it better than did one of your greatest social commentators , Walt Kelly , author of the famous comic strip Pogo : “ We have met the enemy , and he is us . ”
3 - D images are very useful in medicine and now they 're gaining ground in physics .
Researchers from Hahn - Meitner - Institute ( HMI ) and the University of Applied Science in Berlin have succeeded in creating a direct , three - dimensional visualization of magnetic fields inside solid , non-transparent materials for the first time .
This could prove invaluable because to understand high temperature superconductivity it is vital to understand how magnetic flux lines are distributed and how these flux lines can be established in materials .
With this new experimental setup , it is now possible to visualize magnetic domains in magnetic crystals three - dimensionally .
The researchers in the imaging group used neutrons , subatomic particles that have zero net charge , but do have a magnetic moment , making them ideal for investigating magnetic phenomena in magnetic materials .
When in an external magnetic field , the neutrons behave like compass needles , all aligning to point on the direction of the field .
Neutrons also have an internal angular momentum , often referred to by physicists as spin , a property that causes the needle to rotate around the magnetic field , similar to the way in which the Earth rotates on its axis .
When all of the magnetic moments point in the same direction then the neutrons are said to be spin-polarised .
If a magnetic sample is irradiated with such neutrons , the magnetic moments of the neutrons will begin to rotate around the magnetic fields they encounter in the sample and the direction of their spin changes .
Nikolay Kardjilov 's group used this phenomenon as a measurement parameter for tomography experiments using two spin polarisers ( which only allow the passage of neutrons whose spin points in a specific direction ) to polarise and then analyse the neutrons .
By detecting changes in the spins , it is possible to “ see ” the magnetic fields within the sample .
Kardjilov explains this by comparison with a medical CT scan ; when a specimen is irradiated with x rays the density of the materials present alters the intensity of the light .
" It 's the same with our magnetic specimen , which changes the spin rotation of the neutrons " , says Nikolay Kardjilov .
" The equipment only allows passage of neutrons with a specific spin rotation , and this generates the contrast according to how the magnetic properties are distributed within the specimen .
By rotating the specimen we can reconstruct a three - dimensional image . "
Since 2005 , Kardjilov has built up the neutron tomography section at HMI and now his group is the first to use spin rotation as a measurement signal for three - dimensional imaging .
Normally , neutron imaging relies on the different levels of absorption of radiation by different materials to produce contrast .
The measurement of magnetic signals is a novel concept and its success lies partly in the polarisers and analysers , and the detector system , which have been developed and built by the HMI researchers .

Ron Paul Tea Party 2007 : Contributions betting odds released
The odds on the Dec. 16th Ron Paul Tea Party 2007 have been published by the online odds makers .
Those who have kept with the Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul are already well aware about the upcoming " Ron Paul Tea Party 2007 " , but for those of you who just tune in - another massive money - raising campaign has been planed by the Ron Paul supporters with a goal in mind of reaching $ 10 million in donations on December 16th .
The date corresponds with the famous 1773 Boston Tea Party and in 2007 Ron Paul supporters will be urged to donate as a form to " protest the oppressive and unconstitutional inflation tax " .
It will be a one - day event aiming to beat the previous " Ron Paul money bomb " by a large margin .
Could it happen ?
Well , the online odds maker Bodog Sports say yes , and it backs it up with odds of -900 .
If the Ron Paul supporters fail to match the previous $ 4.3 million record , the bookie will payout on odds of +500 ( i.e. 500 for every 100 bet ) .
But the odds makers do n't feel confident that Ron Paul will hit the $ 10 million mark at the 2007 Ron Paul Tea Party , on the betting prop will the Ron Paul Tea Party 2007 meet its goal of raising $ 10 million or more in donations , failure to do so is currently favored with odds - 400 and " yes " pays underdog odds of +250 .
The bookie is even more skeptical of the Ron Paul Tea Party 2007 receiving more than 100,000 pledges by the end of December 16th - odds on getting the 100 K pledges are sitting at +500 and the odds on not getting them at - 900 .
At press time the total number of Ron Paul Tea Party 2007 pledges were 22,855 .
At least the Ron Paul supporters are getting a little break - Bodog is confident that Ron Paul will be able to reach his goal of $ 12 million in contributions by the end of the year with the whopping odds of - 1750 , otherwise the odds are +650 .
At press time the total Ron Paul contributions were posted at $ 10,409,799.98 at his official website .
With nine of its colleges and universities boasting endowments above $ 1 billion , Massachusetts is now center stage in the emerging national debate over whether wealthy schools are doing enough to justify their tax - exempt status .
The reason for the spotlight : a first - of - its - kind proposal to tax those large endowments in the Bay State .
It has caught the attention of some members of the US Congress because it goes well beyond discussions there that have so far focused on increasing transparency and pushing well - endowed schools to spend more to offset costs .
" Two things are on a collision course :
The public anxiety about the cost and affordability of college is very , very high , while [ wealthy institutions ] ... are sitting on what appears to be huge pots of money , " says Patrick Callan , president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education in San Jose , Calif .
The Massachusetts proposal would impose a 2.5 percent tax on the portion of endowments above $ 1 billion .
" There is an exorbitant amount of wealth that has been generated with these endowments , especially in the case of Harvard and MIT , " about $ 35 billion and $ 10 billion , respectively , says state Rep. Paul Kujawski ( D ) , who proposed the tax plan in part because the state is facing a $ 1.3 billion budget gap .
" When is a nonprofit considered not a nonprofit ? " he asks .
The precedent it could set worries college officials .
" It 's terrible tax policy and it 's terrible public policy , " says Richard Doherty , president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts .
" It to some extent ignores the tremendous contributions to the Massachusetts economy that the private colleges already generate . "
The nine schools with endowments over $ 1 billion employ nearly 27,000 people in Massachusetts , who collectively earn $ 4.5 billion , Mr. Doherty says .
He adds that the state has to spend less of its budget on higher education than other comparable states because of the abundance of private colleges here .
Faculty and students also offer voluntary services worth millions of dollars .
Boston College spokesman Jack Dunn says the tax " would hurt the very individuals that the legislators presumably are trying to help : the people in their districts who need financial aid to attend these schools . "
He characterizes the nearly $ 1.7 billion endowment as " modest " but says that BC admits students without regard for their ability to pay – and then meets their full need for financial aid .
The tax would make that need - blind policy unaffordable , he says .
Another concern is that donations would decline , Doherty says , " because people would understand that their donation could well be subject to a 2.5 percent tax . "
" The notion that education is a charitable not - for - profit activity has deep roots in our country , " says Matt Hamill , senior vice president of the National Association of College and University Business Officers ( NACUBO ) in Washington .
Representative Kujawski says he values the contributions of these colleges .
But he 's heard from donors to places like Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who have encouraged him to stand his ground .
" They feel that these schools , with the amount of wealth they have , could enhance the areas [ in which they reside ] , " he says .
The Massachusetts House passed an amendment in its recent budget deliberations that would require the Department of Revenue to study the 2.5 percent tax idea .
Kujawski says he believes there will be support for the study on the Senate side as well , and that would inform future legislation .
A college could legally challenge such a tax based on a provision in the Massachusetts constitution that prohibits arbitrary distinction between similar taxpayers , Doherty says .
But because the distinction is based on asset levels , it would n't be arbitrary but legitimate , counters Dean Zerbe , national managing director of alliantgroup , a Houston tax - services firm .
He is also a former counsel to the US Senate Finance Committee , which has been investigating college - endowment issues .
The Senate Finance Committee recently requested , for the first time , detailed endowment data from 136 schools that have amassed at least $ 500 million .
Staffers are analyzing the responses before deciding whether to introduce legislation .
One idea gaining ground in congressional discussions would be to require colleges to spend at least 5 percent of their endowments each year , which private foundations already must do .
Lynne Munson favors that idea .
She is studying endowments as an adjunct fellow at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington , and she says that higher - education officials sometimes exaggerate how much endowments are restricted by specific requests from donors .
At private colleges , an average of 45 percent of endowment funds are unrestricted , she says .
Aggressive investment has led to high returns on endowments for the past 10 years , Ms. Munson adds .
" Colleges and universities have had at least a decade to come up with a strategy for ... putting those monies to work for students , families , and taxpayers , yet they 've neglected to do so , " she says .
Congress 's scrutiny of higher - education costs appears to have already prompted some good news on affordability .
Harvard and at least two dozen other schools have created policies in recent months to increase grant aid for students or to cut tuition .
Those moves have pleased Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee , says press secretary Jill Gerber , but they " are likely just a drop in the bucket . "
Hundreds of schools have large endowments , and " even schools with smaller endowments should still look at whether they can do more to help with affordability , " she says .
The Massachusetts tax proposal has " changed this debate quite a bit " in Washington , says Mr. Zerbe .
" If the universities are n't forthcoming , there will be a rising frustration level , " and more members of Congress might think about looking at a tax , he says .
But the relationship between tuition and endowments is n't so clear - cut , says Mr. Hamill of the college business officers association .
" There 's been a tendency to think of an endowment as like a giant checkbook ... and the reality of managing an endowment is significantly different , " he says .
" The government is not going to be a good regulator of this issue . "

Rick�s Picks Friday , May 23 , 2008 � Phenomenally accurate forecasts �
The brazenly fraudulent economic data the U.S. government puts out each month would have us believe that inflation and unemployment are both pretty tame right now .
Would that it were true !
In reality , �underemployment � is rampant , and , according to John Williams , a speaker at the recent meeting in New York of the Committee for Monetary Research and Education ( CMRE ) , consumer inflation would be running at closer to 12 percent than the currently alleged 4 percent if it were calculated using the 1980s formula .
Instead , we now get �seasonally adjusted � unemployment figures , and a �core� inflation rate , ex-food and - energy , that are about as believable as 1930s Kremlin data intended to validate Stalin�s Five Year Plan .
Productivity Hoax
By egregiously manipulating the inflation number each month , the government has produced another statistical fiction � i.e. �productivity growth� a number used by � Easy Al� Greenspan to persuade us that the economy was on the right track during his tenure .
If this were true , though , and Americans were indeed as wealthy as the Fed chairman always liked to tell us we were , then why are so there so many working wives ?
And why , even with all those wives working , do Americans have no savings ?
Oh , that �s right :
Our savings , and most of our wealth , are vested in the homes that we live in ( but which are mostly owned by mortgage lenders ) -- the same homes that , on average , lost 15 percent of their value in the last year .
Regarding inflation , it doesn�t take a genius to figure out that the monthly CPI number is bogus .
Anyone who has been to the grocery store or the gas station , or who has sent a check to a college bursar , or had a prescription filled , knows that consumer prices have been rising very steeply � more steeply , in fact , than at any other time since the 1970s .
But what about those mellow unemployment figures � statistics that would deign to suggest that joblessness is hovering around 5.6 % even though the U.S. economy is in a state of near - collapse .
Anecdotal evidence that the economy has nosedived is overwhelming at this point , even if the government�s numbers crunchers have miraculously kept us out of statistical recession .
Talk to some retailers at the local mall if you don�t believe us -- or to friends who are realtors , consultants or lawyers .
Realty Business � Off �
We have more than a dozen friends who are realtors , and perhaps another dozen who are self - employed consultants of one kind or another , and although nearly all of them would tell you that business has fallen off significantly in the last six to twelve months , not a single one has turned up as an unemployment statistic ; for in fact , self - employed workers cannot even file for jobless benefits .
That means that if the income of a highly paid service worker were to fall by 50 percent , we would never hear about it from the Bureau of Labor statistics .
The only evidence we'd have would come indirectly : Sales at pricier stores would start to dry up .
Caribbean cruisers would sail half - full .
Tax revenues in upper middle - class enclaves like Boulder , Colorado , would drop sharply .
Casinos would start opening up more tables for $ 5 blackjack players , even on Saturday nights .
Pricy restaurants would either close or cheapen their menus .
As far as we can tell , all of these things have been happening , and the changes seem , at least anecdotally , to be waxing rather than waning .
This suggests that although unemployment has climbed only somewhat , the free - spending , highest - income workers who have long stoked the U.S. economy , and who are invisible to the government 's statisticians , are hurting .
There are probably millions of such under - employed workers now , given America�s extremely heavy skew toward service - sector jobs .
And , by and large , they have been among the top earners in the work force .
But literally tens of millions of them could be reduced to subsistence wages and they still would n't show up as unemployed .
Keep that in mind the next time some bozo on CNBC points to �low� joblessness as evidence that this deepening recession is n�t so bad .

I used to be into BMX bikes .
I was obsessed .
Every little thing about it was interesting .
The brakes , the handlebars , the different types of mags–all of it .
One day –I do n’t remember when –I got off my last BMX bike .
I wish I would have realized it when it happened .
Later in life I got into skateboarding .
My favorite board was a John Lucero .
Again , I was into it .
Independent trucks , bulletball wheels , rails , skid plates and copers .
I could rail slide like the board was part of me , and I could ollie a solid two feet .
At some point –I do n’t remember when –I ollied up my last curb .
I wish I could have realized it when it happened .
Do you remember the last time you climbed a tree ?
Do you remember how much you used to love it ?
I do .
If you ’re like me you never planned on the last time you did it being your last time doing it .
In fact , you never planned on there being a last time .
And it ’s the same for a million things that are precious in life that we may never do again .
Playing a role - playing game with your friends , burning a leaf with a magnifying glass , or eating a meal with your grandfather .
It ’s possible to dwell on this to the point of it becoming morbid , but we do n’t have to .
Instead , just remember a simple , very old concept : appreciate everything you do — no matter how normal it seems — as you are doing it .
Living in the moment is n’t some distant Zen concept ; it ’s no less than how to fully appreciate life . ::
How to Avoid a Bad Bargain : Do n’t Threaten
An award - winning social psychology experiment reveals why we often fail to bargain effectively with each other .
Bargaining is one of those activities we often engage in without quite realising it .
It does n’t just happen in the boardroom , or when we ask our boss for a raise or down at the market , it happens every time we want to reach an agreement with someone .
This agreement could be as simple as choosing a restaurant with a friend , or deciding which TV channel to watch .
At the other end of the scale , bargaining can affect the fate of nations .
Big - scale or small - scale , bargaining is a central part of our lives .
Understanding the psychological processes involved in bargaining can provide us with huge benefits in our everyday lives .
In a classic , award - winning series of studies , Morgan Deutsch and Robert Krauss investigated two central factors in bargaining : how we communicate with each other and how we use threats ( Deutsch & Krauss , 1962 ) .
To do this , they used a game which forces two people to bargain with each other .
Although Deutsch and Krauss used a series of different conditions – nine in fact – once you understand the basic game , all the conditions are only slight variations .
So , imagine you were a clerical worker at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in the late 1950s and you ’ve been asked to take part in a psychology study .
Every psychology study has a story , and this one revolves around two trucking companies …
Experiment 1 : Keep on trucking
Before the experiment proper starts , the researcher explains that you ’ll be playing a game against another participant .
In the game you will run a trucking company .
The object of the game is the same as a real trucking company : to make as much money as possible .
Like the real - life trucking company you have to deliver as many of your goods as possible to their destination in the shortest possible time .
But in this game you only have one starting point , one destination and one competitor .
It looks like a pretty simple game .
Here ’s the catch .
The road map your one truck has to travel across presents you with a dilemma .
You are the ‘ Acme ’ trucking company and your fellow participant is the ‘ Bolt ’ trucking company , although both of you have an identical problem .
Have a look below .
[ Deutsch & Krauss , 1962 , p. 55 ]
As you ’ll see there are two possible routes you can take from the start to your destination : the short and the long .
Remember , time is money , so the longer it takes you to get to your destination , the less profit you make , which is the aim of the game .
Unfortunately the short route has a major shortcoming : it is one - way .
Only one of you can travel down it at a time towards your destination .
It seems you ’ll be forced to work out some agreement with your unknown rival to share this one - way route so that you can both make money .
How you ’ll do this is another mystery , though , as there is going to be no communication between the two of you during the experiment .
You are to be seated in a cubicle from where you ’ll only be able to see the control box for your ‘ truck ’ and the experimenter .
Threatening gates
You are to be given one method of communication with your rival , albeit indirect communication .
Each of you controls a gate at your own end of the one - way road .
Your gate can be opened or closed whenever you pass through it .
This will be your threat .
It is reinforced by the experimenter that you are out to make as much money as you can for yourself – the other person ’s profit is not a concern .
Once the experimenter sets you off , it soon becomes clear you ’re not going to make much money at all .
In the first of 20 trials , both you and your rival shut your gates , forcing both trucks onto the alternative route .
This is 50 % longer and means you make a loss on the trip as a whole .
In the second trial your trucks meet head - on travelling up the one - way road .
You both have to reverse , costing you time and money .
The rest of the trials are n’t much better .
Occasionally you make a profit on a trip but more often than not it ’s a bust .
You spend more time on the long route or reversing than you do chugging happily along the main route making money .
At the end of the experiment , the researcher announces how much profit you made .
None .
In fact you made a crippling loss .
Perhaps trucking companies are n’t so easy to run .
Comparing threats
You find out later that you were in one of three experimental conditions .
The only differences in the other two conditions were that in one there were no gates at either end of the one - way road .
In the other there was only one active gate controlled by one player .
Before I tell you the results of the other two conditions , try to guess .
One condition , which you ’ve taken part in , contained bilateral threat – you could both threaten each other .
One condition had unilateral threat – only one could threaten the other .
And the final condition had no threat at all .
What was the order of profit ?
In fact it turns out that your condition , of bilateral threat , made the least profit when both participant ’s scores were added up .
The next most profitable was the unilateral threat condition , while the most profitable overall was the no-threat condition .
Here ’s the first rather curious result .
While the person who had the threat – control of the gate – in the unilateral condition did better than the person who did n’t , they were still better off , individually and collectively , than if they both had threats .
What this experiment is showing is that the availability of threats leads to worse outcomes to the extent that unilateral threat is preferable to bilateral threat to both parties .
Experiment 2 : Lines of communication
But surely a little communication goes a long way ?
You were n’t allowed to talk to the other participant in this experiment , so your trucks had to do the talking for you .
Bargaining is all about reaching a compromise through negotiation – surely this should help ?
To test the effect of communication Deutsch and Krauss ( 1962 ) set up a second experiment which was identical in all respects to the first except participants were given headphones to talk to each other .
Here ’s the next curious result : allowing the two participants to communicate with each other made no significant difference to the amount of money each trucking company made .
In fact the experimenters found no relationship between words spoken and money made .
In other words those who communicated more did not manage to reach a better understanding with each other .
Like the experimenters themselves , I find this result surprising .
Surely allowing people to communicate let ’s them work out a way for them both to make money ?
And yet this is n’t what happened in the experiment at all .
Instead it seems that people ’s competitive orientation was stronger than their motivation to communicate .
On the other hand , perhaps something specific to the situation in this experiment is stopping people talking ?
Participants in the second study reported that it was difficult to start talking to the other person , who was effectively a stranger .
As a result they were considerably less talkative than normal .
Could it be that it was this situational constraint that meant little talking , and therefore little bargaining was going on ?
Experiment 3 : Forced communication
Deutsch and Krauss decided to test the effect of forced communication in their third experiment .
Again the procedure is the same as last time but now participants are instructed that on each of the 20 trials they have to say something .
If they do n’t talk on one of the trials they are gently reminded by the experimenter to do so .
They are told they can talk about whatever they like , as long as they say something .
The results finally showed some success for communication .
Performance in the one - gate ( unilateral threat ) condition came close to that achieved in the ‘ no - threat ’ condition ( remember the no-threat condition has the best outcomes ) .
Forced communication did n’t have much effect on the ‘ no - threat ’ condition when compared with no communication , and neither did it improve the bilateral threat condition much .
It still seems that people are so competitive when they both have threats it ’s very difficult to avoid both sides losing out .
Threat causes resentment
The most surprising finding of this study is how badly people do under conditions of bilateral threat .
In this experiment not even forcing communication can overcome people ’s competitive streaks .
Deutsch and Krauss provide a fascinating explanation for this .
Imagine your neighbour asks you to water their plants while they ’re on holiday Socially , it looks good for you if you agree to do it .
On the other hand if they ask you to water their plants otherwise they ’ll set their TV on full blast while they ’re on holiday , it immediately gets your hackles up .
Suddenly you resent them .
Giving in when there is no threat is seen by other people as pro-social .
Duress , however , seems to make people dig in their heels .
Applying the brakes
Before drawing some general conclusions from these studies , we should acknowledge the particular circumstances of this research .
Deutsch and Krauss ’s experiment covers a situation in which bargaining is carried out under time pressure .
Recall that the longer participants take to negotiate , the less money they make .
In real life , time is n’t always of the essence .
The present game also has a relatively simple solution : participants make the most profit if they share the one - way road .
In reality , solutions are rarely that clear - cut .
Finally , our participants were not professional negotiators , they were clerical and supervisory workers without special training .
Real - life implications
Despite these problems the trucking game has the advantage of being what game theorists call a non - zero - sum game .
In other words if you win , it does n’t automatically mean the other person loses .
When you total the final results , as you sometimes can in a financial sense , they do n’t add to zero .
In real life many of the situations in which we find ourselves are of this nature .
Cooperation can open the way to more profit , in financial or other form , for both parties .
As a result the trucking game has clear implications for real life :
Cooperative relationships are likely to be much more beneficial overall than competitive relationships .
Before you go ‘ duh !’ , remember that increasing proportions of the world ’s societies are capitalist .
Deutsch and Krauss ’s experiment clearly shows the friction caused by competitive relationships , such as those encouraged by capitalism .
I ’m not saying capitalism is bad , I ’m just saying competition is n’t always good .
This simple fact is often forgotten .
Just because people can communicate , does n’t mean they will – even if it is to their advantage .
Forcing parties to communicate , even if they already have the means to communicate , encourages mutually beneficial outcomes .
In competitive relationships , communication should be aimed at increasing cooperation .
Other methods will probably create more heat than light .
Threats are dangerous , not only to other ’s interests , but also to our own .
Remember all these the next time you are bargaining with your partner over a night out , about to shout a threat at a motorist blocking your path on a one - way road , or even involved in high - level political negotiations between warring factions with nuclear capabilities .
It could save you , and the other side , a lot of trouble .

Jimmy Carter knew what he was getting into when he launched his one - man Middle East diplomacy tour .
After emerging as the most prominent American critic of Israeli policy , the former president was n't expecting to be received here with open arms .
But as the Nobel Peace Prize - winner returned to Jerusalem after meeting with Hamas leaders in Damascus , his aides said they were amazed that not a single Israeli government minister was willing to meet with him during the several days he was here last week .
" We expected a cold reception but not to be treated like this , " said one Carter advisor .
Carter hailed the public acceptance by Hamas of a two - state solution on pre-1967 borders , provided the proposed peace deal was approved in a Palestinian referendum .
The development , Carter said , proved Israel and the U.S. were " making a very serious mistake " in refusing to meet with the militant group , which won parliamentary elections in 2006 and now controls the Gaza Strip .
Carter laughed when asked if he thought his actions would spark debate back home about the United States ' foreign policy and its approach to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Struggling computer maker Dell Inc. DELL , +1.61 % will close its desktop manufacturing plant in Austin , Texas , and consider selling its Dell Financial Services unit , valued at about $ 1 billion , all in an effort to save $ 3 billion a year .
Dell reaffirmed its plans to reduce its global work force by at least 8,800 and said it had cut 3,200 jobs in the last nine months of its fiscal 2008 , excluding acquisitions .
The Austin - American Statesman reported earlier Monday that Dell will close its Topfer Manufacturing Center in North Austin by Jan. 1 , cutting 800 to 900 jobs .
Dell has about 17,500 employees in the Austin area , the paper said , and about 85,000 workers worldwide .
In after - hours trading , Dell shares recently traded at $ 20.11 , up nearly 1 % from its regular session close of $ 19.92 .
The stock , down more than a third from its
October high , hit a six - year low of $ 18.87 in January .
The company 's announcement Monday comes two days before its analyst meeting , which starts Wednesday .
Dell expects to save $ 3 billion a year in the next three years by cutting costs in all areas , including design , manufacturing and logistics , materials and operating expenses .
Savings will begin in the second half of this fiscal year .
Dell plans a strategic review of its consumer and small / medium business revolving credit financing receivables and operations in the U.S. and may also include commercial leasing .
The company expects to finish the review in the third quarter .
" We plan to look at alternatives that will strengthen the product offerings , enhance customer experience and improve DFS ' overall financial services capabilities in the most efficient way , " Chief Financial Officer Don Carty said .
In December , CIT Group Inc. CIT , - 3.03 % , a commercial - finance company , and Dell announced that the computer maker would purchase CIT 's 30 % interest in their U.S. - based Dell Financial Services joint venture Dec. 31 for $ 306 million .
DFS was formed in 1997 by CIT and Dell to serve as a full - service financial - services provider that offers a broad range of customer financing solutions for Dell customers throughout the U.S .
Dell has been trying to turn itself around after losing market share to rival Hewlett - Packard Co. HPQ , +0.31 % in the past few years and seeing its revenue and profit growth slow .
Under Chief Executive Michael Dell , who returned to the post in early 2007 , the company has expanded its offerings through several acquisitions and invested in higher - end design for its consumer PCs .
The company also began selling computers in retail stores , a costly new initiative that is a departure from its past strategy of selling directly online and over the phone .

Compost is basically the equivalent of the good stuff in soil ( humus ) that sustains plant life .
It helps the soil retain moisture , assists with the formation of good soil structure and provides nutrients .
So much of what we send to landfill consists of materials that could be used in our garden .
Around 200 pounds of vegetable waste is thrown out by each family , each year .
Multiple that by millions of families and that ’s a lot of garbage that has to be transported .
By setting up your own compost pile you ’ll not only be helping your garden , you ’ll be helping the planet in other ways .
Composting seems to be such a simple concept – throw stuff in a pile , it breaks down thanks to bacteria and other critters – but nature works some amazing and complex magic for this to happen .
Nature never ceases to leave me in awe ; even when it comes how it deals with its own garbage .
When we hear the term “ bacteria ” , we often associate it with nasty stuff , but bacteria are essential to our health and the well - being of our planet .
For example , without certain bacteria in our digestive system , we would n’t be able to process food properly and would become quite ill .
There are three different groups of bacteria that are involved in the composting process and each successive group relies upon the prior in order to do their work most effectively .
Psychrophilic bacteria
These are the “ starter bacteria ” that go to work on cold compost .
They are most active in temperatures of 55 °F , but will also work down to an incredible 0 °F ( - 17°C ) .
As these bacteria chomp on organic materials they also generate a small amount of heat , creating an environment suitable for the next group .
Mesophilic bacteria
These work in temperatures from 70° – 90 °F ( approx . 15°–40 °C ) , decomposing both vegetable and animal matter .
Their exertions produce enough heat to for the next type of bacteria .
Thermophilic bacteria
These are the powerhouses of the bacteria world ; working fast , in a temperature range of 104 °F to 170°F , but some will also still thrive past the boiling point of water !
These are the guys that can cause a compost pile to spontaneously combust if the pile is too high or too dry .
These three groups join forces to turn our trash into rich humus capable of sustaining plant life ; but they are also assisted by other organisms such as fungi , various insects and worms ( see my article on vermicomposting ) .
Quick composting tips
By providing the best conditions possible , the composting process can be made to happen much faster than it does in normal natural conditions .
Whereas everything just chucked in a pile may take a year or two to break down and sometimes with undesirable results ; intensive composting can be completed in just a couple of months .
Here are some simple things you can do for more effective composting .
– Experts say it ’s important to get the right mix of carbon and nitrogen materials in a compost heap .
The carbon based stuff is mainly dry ; things like newspaper , straw and dry cuttings .
The items rich in nitrogen will mostly be wet – vegetable scraps and lawn clippings .
Ideal conditions are said to be 1 part wet / green to 25 parts dry / brown .
If you wo n’t have this sort of balance , do n’t be overly concerned – I have a compost pile that is almost exclusively paper and cardboard and in the case of many households , much of their compost pile will be vegetable scraps .
Just bear in mind an overly dry compost heap will take ages to break down ( been there ) and one too “ green ” and wet will start to smell ( been there too ) .
– Care needs to be taken when adding lawn clippings .
These are usually very moist and rich in nitrogen .
As they are so wet , they ’ll clump together , dispelling the oxygen needed by the aerobic bacteria and the pile will get quite smelly – a strong ammonia type whiff due to anaerobic decomposition .
It ’s best to mix clippings in thoroughly with the pile , or spread the lawn clippings out for a few days to dry a little and then add them .
– Select a well drained area to establish your pile ; preferably over soil so that worms can access it .
The compost pile should be in a sunny position in colder climates or a shady area in warm climates
– A three sided pen will help to keep your pile tidy .
This can be made from star droppers and strong mesh or pallets nailed together
– To speed up composting , break down materials into smaller pieces or shred
- It ’s really important to turn the pile regularly if you ’re not going to be bothered with layering wet and dry waste and you ’ll just be chucking stuff into your compost pile as it comes to hand – particularly if much of it will be “ green ” ; such as vegetable waste .
Turning compost introduces more oxygen into the pile so the bacteria can do their work and brings more material into contact with the bacteria .
It can help speed up the composting process and prevent nasty odors .
Turning a pile within a small barrel can be awkward , so I use a purpose - made compost turner , which consists of a spiral of steel with a T - bar at the top for turning .
The spiral digs down into the compost and when you pull it up , a plug of materials comes with it .
It ’s a very inexpensive , simple yet effective tool that you can purchase at many hardware and garden stores .
– The pile should always be quite warm – if you dig a small hole into the pile and put your hand near it , you should feel it being warmer than the air temperature .
If it ’s cold , you need to add more green stuff .
– The pile should always be moist , but not dripping .
If it ’s dry , spray water on the pile and then work it through .
If you ’re thinking of getting into composting in a big way ; there ’s all sorts of tools available such as bins set in frames with a handle for turning .
A multiple bin / pile system is also useful so you can stop with one pile at a certain point and let that totally decompose while adding fresh stuff to a new pile .
Things you can add to compost piles
Newspaper , cardboard , eggshells , vegetable scraps , law clippings , cuttings , hair , manure from herbivores , leaves , sawdust , coffee grounds and filters , tea leaves – basically any plant material that that ’s not too thick .
Things to avoid
Dog and cat droppings , fish , meat and dairy products , weeds , grease and oil .
The reason for avoiding most of these is that there is a disease risk and rodents and other animals may be attracted .
I have composted dog droppings before , but basically in a bin of their own with lawn clippings .
It does n’t smell all that good during the early stages :) .
If you do compost pet droppings , do n’t apply the resulting compost to a veggie garden ; just to be safe .
This has just been a primer on the topic of composting and I ’m certainly no expert .
For some people , composting is an absolute passion and they go about it in a very scientific way , so there ’s a stack of information around the web about various approaches and equipment .
By the way , if your home does n’t have a yard , you can compost small amounts of materials indoors without an mess or odor using a Bokashi composting system .
As George W. Bush winds down his presidency , Republicans are now on the verge of going six years without an African - American governor , senator or House member .
GOP fails to recruit minorities
Just a few years after the Republican Party launched a highly publicized diversity effort , the GOP is heading into the 2008 election without a single minority candidate with a plausible chance of winning a campaign for the House , the Senate or governor .
At a time when Democrats are poised to knock down a historic racial barrier with their presidential nominee , the GOP is fielding only a handful of minority candidates for Congress or statehouses — none of whom seem to have a prayer of victory .

At the start of the Bush years , the Republican National Committee — in tandem with the White House — vowed to usher in a new era of GOP minority outreach .
As George W. Bush winds down his presidency , Republicans are now on the verge of going six — and probably more — years without an African - American governor , senator or House member .
That ’s the longest such streak since the 1980s .
Republicans will have only one minority governor , Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , an Indian - American , when the dust settles on the ’08 elections .
Democrats have three minority governors and 43 African - American members of Congress , including one — Illinois Sen. Barack Obama — who is their likely presidential nominee .
Democrats also have several challengers in winnable House races who are either black or Hispanic .
Despite having a Spanish - speaking “ compassionate conservative ” in the White House , Republicans ’ diversity deficit seems to have only widened .
“ In 1994 , when I first ran , we had 14 African - American Republicans running for Congress .
... I was the only one that won that year , but we had 14 , and we had some good candidates , ” said former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts , one of the party ’s most recognized African - American voices .
“ I am grateful for what Ken Mehlman did when he was RNC chairman , but I knew that would n’t last — that was one person .
I ’ve never gotten the impression that it was institutionalized . ”
So who ’s to blame for this diversity deficit ?
Jack Kemp , the former Republican congressman and vice presidential nominee , says the culprit is clear : a “ pitiful ” recruitment effort by his party .
“ I do n’t see much of an outreach , ” he said .
“ I do n’t see much of a reason to run . ”
A former black GOP candidate who declined to be identified by name offered a slightly more charitable explanation .
He said the party is so broke and distracted that wooing strong minority candidates is a luxury it simply cannot afford right now .
Congressional staffers contacted for reaction on this issue did not want to comment but were clearly uneasy with the party ’s all - white slate of viable candidates .
In all fairness , Republicans have never been very good at attracting strong minority candidates , especially African - Americans .
Only four black Republicans — Watts , former Massachusetts Sen. Edward Brooke , former Connecticut Rep. Gary Franks and the late Illinois Rep. Oscar Stanton De Priest — have been elected to Congress since Reconstruction .
The party has done slightly better with Cuban - Americans and Hispanics in recent years — Cuban - American Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida recently served as RNC chairman .
But the GOP remains a white - dominated party elected overwhelmingly by white voters .
Another mitigating factor for the party is that this has been a terrible year overall for GOP recruitment , as exemplified in the 0 - for - 3 Republican streak in special elections in recent weeks .
The dilemma is simple :
Who wants to run when the Republican brand is so unpopular and money is so scarce ?
Still , the recruitment failure is striking when you consider the recent history of the GOP on this issue .
It was not long ago — 2005 , to be precise — that Mehlman , then the RNC chairman , grabbed headlines with a major speech on diversity before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
“ Republicans are committed to inclusion , ” he told the group ’s national convention .
“ I ’m here four years before the next presidential election asking for your help .
Inclusion means you work together to recruit candidates , not surrogates to speak on their behalf . ”
Mehlman was far from alone .
President Bush dedicated significant time in the early years of his presidency to reaching out to African - Americans with countless speeches on education and faith - based initiatives directed at minority communities .
He aggressively appointed prominent blacks to his Cabinet , including two secretaries of state : Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice .
Bush sometimes broke into Spanish as he called for immigration laws providing illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship , a hot topic in Hispanic communities .
The efforts , of course , were designed to attract voters — not just candidates — into the GOP fold .
And the moral of the story is that the party clearly failed .
Some party insiders point to 2006 as the specific proof that diversity efforts may sound great but are still impractical and electorally unrewarding for the GOP .
During that cycle , Mehlman and GOP leaders talked a number of attractive black candidates into running for important seats : Michael Steele of Maryland , for the Senate ; and Lynn Swann of Pennsylvania and Ken Blackwell of Ohio , for governor .
Scores of stories were written about the Republicans ’ new plan to win tough seats with well - funded minority candidates .
Then they all lost badly .
The election results in their respective states showed that they hardly made any inroads — even in the heavily African - American parts of the states they were running in .
Swann was later asked to run for the House , and he declined .
Suddenly , the argument for minority outreach seemed to lack the underpinning of any successful political strategy : the ability to produce more votes .
The exit polling data for House races in 2006 showed the depth of the GOP ’s outreach crisis .
Republican candidates won 11 percent of the black vote and 30 percent of the Hispanic vote .
However , Watts , for one , rejects the argument that Republicans can’t compete for minority votes or successfully recruit minority candidates .
He argues that the party simply has n’t tried hard enough .
“ Unless you have an infrastructure to build off of , it ’s all throwing mud at the wall and hoping that some of it sticks , ” said Watts .
“ There ’s an entire infrastructure that needs to be thought through , and it seems to me no one is interested in building that . ”

Politics
And the Nintendo Wii can tell us why .
First , let ’s back up a bit and describe how the market for gasoline works .
Gasoline is a commodity ( gasoline from Shell is effectively the same as gasoline from Exxon ) , and everyone knows the price ( due to those giant signs on the side of the road ) .
This means that we can model the gasoline market using basic economics and we should be able to draw some reasonable conclusions .
Ready ?
Supply and Demand Curves
Let ’s talk about supply and demand .
We all know that the “ law of supply and demand ” somehow determines prices apparently – but what exactly is happening ?
Well , let ’s start with a “ demand curve ” .
This describes how much consumers would want ( demand ) for a certain price .
A typical gasoline demand curve can be seen on the right – if the price is really high ( Point A ) , we ’ll only use a car for essential trips ( low demand ) .
If the price goes down ( Point B ) , we ’ll use more and more until we ’re driving everywhere .
Sound reasonable ?
Now let ’s look at supply curves .
These curves describe the behaviour of the other side – the guys that produce gasoline .
If the price of gasoline is really low ( Point C ) , you ’ll only sell it if you can cover your costs ( generally ) .
As the price of gasoline increases ( Point D ) , more and more supply is available .
This is a result of higher prices allowing higher cost methods to be effective .
If a new extraction method costs 50 bucks a barrel , you better be able to sell it for more than 50 bucks or else there ’s no point .
An example supply curve is on the left .
Market Price
So we have a supply curve , and a demand curve – so what ?
Well , now we know what the price of gas is !
How exactly ?
Well , let ’s put the supply curve and the demand curve overtop of each other .
We can see this on the right – any ideas of what the price of gas is ?
If you guessed where the two curves cross , good work !
Where the two curves cross gives us :
the price of gas the amount of gas sold
It ’s the single point where consumers demand the exact same amount that producers want to provide .
If the price was lower , consumers would want too much and producers would n’t produce enough ( scarcity ) .
If it was higher , consumers would n’t want as much gas and producers would produce too much ( surplus ) .
Now we know how to determine market price .
Now ask yourself – what happens if someone ( perhaps the government creates a law ) says “ Nope !
That price is wrong !
Change it ! ” .
Price Ceilings
There are a few different terms for this , but we ’ll limit ourselves to an enforced maximum price – called a price ceiling .
There are two different ways a price ceiling can be implemented .
The first is rather boring – called a nonbinding price ceiling .
For example , if gas was currently selling at 3 $ and a law was made saying the maximum price is 4 $ , what do you think would happen ?
Well , not much is right .
It would really only come into effect if prices continued to rise .
So what ’s the other type ?
It ’s called a binding price ceiling .
Suppose gas was currently selling at 3 $ and a law was made saying the maximum price is 2 $ – clearly something is going to happen .
From our previous discussion about supply and demand curves we know two things happen when price decreases :
consumers can afford more , so demand goes up producers make less money , so supply goes down
Wait a second … that does n’t seem to make sense .
We have more demand , and less supply ?
That seems to mean that prices would go up .
But they ca n’t because the law says they can ’t .
So what happens ?
Excess Demand
Well , not much can happen .
It ’s the law after all .
Prices will stay at the price ceiling , but look at the graph on the right .
The quantity demanded by consumers used to be the same as that provided by producers – but now consumers want far more and consumers provide far less .
This difference is called “ excess demand ” .
So what happens if you have excess demand in a market ?
Well , let ’s ask the Nintendo Wii .
Nintendo Wii
First off , the situation with the Nintendo Wii is n’t purely a result of a price ceiling .
It ’s very similar however ( limited production capacity combined with a price ceiling ) .
Let ’s create the supply curve for Nintendo Wiis .
Assume we sell at a constant price ( suggested retail price ) , and the factory can produce up to a certain number of units – but no more .
Now let ’s put a consumer demand curve over that ( right ) – we can see that the curves cross and an equilibrium price is produced .
Consumer demand at equilibrium is less than the factory capacity , the suggested retail price is appropriate and everything works out wonderfully .
Now suppose that your executives completely underestimated consumer demand , and are now so far behind that they cannot possibly build a factory in time to satisfy this demand .
The demand curve shifts to the right significantly ( for a given price there is now much more demand ) .
The Nintendo Wii factory can only produce so much however , and we can see excess demand in the graph on the left .
Now we have a problem – if you ’re going to make something cheap , there better be a lot of it !
Why you do n’t want the gasoline market to act like the Wii market
Both situations involve excess demand .
And the problems that occur are effectively identical .
For instance :
If you ’re first in line , you ’re golden !
No problems , you get your ( Wii / gasoline ) for a cheap price .
Unfortunately , if you ’re at the end of the line , no ( Wii / gasoline ) for you !
The market chooses based not on willingness to pay , but on willingness to screw around and hunt for a scarce item .
People try to play the system .
If they ’re at the front of the line , people will buy ( a Wii / gasoline ) , and then try to sell it for a higher price to those at the end of the line .
The excess demand still has n’t gone away .
Everyone still wants ( a Wii/ gasoline ) .
Now it ’s just a huge pain to find .
For instance , you could be working a 9 - 5 job , which requires gas to drive to .
You do n’t have time to figure out what stations have gas – so you end up buying gas on the black market at a ridiculous price from a seedy guy who spends his entire day wandering around finding gas stations that actually have gas .
Not exactly a shining example of capitalism .
So what has the Nintendo Wii taught us in regards to gasoline pricing ?
Lessons
Price caps on markets like gasoline do n’t solve a damn thing .
They sound like a good idea at the start – but the very act of regulation changes the way the market works , and causes an unintended result , shortages .
These shortages then tend to reward speculation instead of real investment and progress .
In short , gasoline is expensive because we can’t live without it , and continue to pay whatever price is demanded .
Real solutions for transportation and infrastructure are n’t as simple as saying “ gas should be cheap , always ! ” .

The by - election takes place on Thursday The Information Commissioner is launching an investigation after the Conservatives accidentally sent details of 8,000 people to a radio station .
The e-mail sent contained the names , addresses , telephone numbers and intentions of voters in the Crewe and Nantwich by - election .
Deputy Information Commissioner David Smith said the disclosure , to Manx Radio , raised " serious concern " .
The Conservatives admitted a " mistake " had been made .
Files deleted
The information , which had been gathered by the Tories during the campaign for Thursday 's by - election , was contained in three Excel files , and was sent in an e-mail to Manx Radio by accident , potentially breaching data protection laws .
The e-mail was received by the radio station at lunchtime on Wednesday .
It sent it on to the local newspaper in Crewe , although it is understood that both emails have now been deleted .
Mr Smith said : " It is a serious concern if people 's personal details and voting intentions have got into the public domain .
" Voting information is particularly sensitive .
We will be launching an investigation to establish the full facts and see where responsibility lies . "
Following the revelation that the email had been sent to the media , Cabinet Office Minister Ed Miliband wrote to Conservative leader David Cameron .
In his letter he said : " I would hope you are treating this as a serious matter and you are contacting the people concerned and apologising for this breach of their personal privacy .
I 'm sure they would wish this to happen before the polls close tomorrow [ on Thursday ] . "
' Undertaking ' A Conservative spokesman said : " The email should n't have been sent but we have done all that we can to ensure that it remains confidential .
" The email - which was based on information from the electoral register - was sent in error to a journalist .
" Within two and half hours the recipient was informed .
Both he and the local newspaper he sent it on to have now given undertakings that the information on the email has been destroyed .
" A third media outlet was also forwarded the email .
It is unclear by whom .
They too have given an undertaking that the contents will not be published .
" An internal investigation has already discovered that it was due to human error but an internal inquiry has begun to ensure that it does not happen again . "
Polling stations in Crewe and Nantwich open at 0700 BST and close at 2200 BST on Thursday .
The result is expected at about 0230 BST on Friday .
The by - election follows the death of long - serving MP Gwyneth Dunwoody last month .

What are these ?
Every January , Zurich airport plays host to a peculiar migration when around 150 Gulfstream private jets touch down .
The superclass is arriving for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos .
If there were only a handful of rich who travelled this way a generation ago , now there are some 1,500 Gulfstreams in service , a symbol of the growth of this new international class of the powerful and rich .
A Gulfstream carries a mere eight passengers in extraordinary opulence ; reclining leather armchairs , polished wood panelling and the latest high definition TV .
They cost $ 45 m each and $ 1.25 m to service for each 500 hours in the air , so their buyers are , by definition , very rich .
Over the past 20 years , Gulfstream sales have followed the booming fortunes of the superclass .
As former US deputy under-secretary of commerce for international trade David Rothkopf writes in his extraordinary new book Superclass , what matters most for these products of globalisation , who declare they have more in common with each other than the mortals 50,000 feet below , is time .
They cannot afford , nor wish , to spend valuable hours in airport queues or planes held up by traffic control .
The Gulfstream is the indispensable aid to moving around the world effortlessly and that movement , and the global access and influence that comes with it , is one of the characteristics of the members of the superclass .
Rothkopf counts 6,000 of them - CEOs of major corporations , partners in hedge fund and private equity companies , national and religious leaders , a sprinkling of global public intellectuals , military leaders and cultural figures .
They control oil , money , intellectual property , technology and the media .
Rupert Murdoch is a member , so is Edward Johnson who runs Fidelity Investments , the world 's largest mutual fund , as is Lakshmi Mittal who owns the world 's largest steel company .
The superclass is overwhelmingly a private affair and most of its members go to extraordinary lengths to keep out of the limelight .
Lloyd Blankfein , chief executive of Goldman Sachs , aborted the purchase of a $ 41 m , 10 - acre estate on Long Island when the news got out he was the buyer ; he wanted his address to be anonymous .
But for all their privacy , they are enormously interconnected .
A third went to just 20 universities .
The directors of the world 's top five companies sit on the boards of another 147 leading companies .
It is not just that they can pick up the phone to each other , they have ready access to government , partly because of their power and partly because they know the people personally .
Goldman Sachs is the quintessential example .
Of Blankfein 's four predecessors , two have been secretaries of the US Treasury ( Hank Paulson and Bob Rubin ) , two were head of the US National Economic Council ( Rubin and Steve Friedman ) and one is the governor of New Jersey ( Joe Corzine ) Another alumnus , Robert Zoellick , is head of the World Bank .
Gordon Brown has been careful to surround himself with former employees of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs .
Jonathan Powell , Tony Blair 's chief of staff , now advises Morgan Stanley .
And so it goes on .
The financial dimension is key .
The superclass can only make the scale of money it does because of its capacity to do what it will with cash - borrow it , leverage it , move it across borders , take over companies with it and shelter it from taxation .
Rothkopf says there were 21 financial institutions in 2007 managing assets of at least $ 1 trillion each and that the top 50 have assets in excess of $ 48.5 trillion .
Their extraordinary freedoms are not natural , or economically efficient , as is now obvious post the credit crunch .
They are the consequence of a 20 - year - long lobbying campaign to win finance freedoms from national regulation and which are now used against governments to keep them in their place .
Brown and Alistair Darling are having urgent discussions , for example , to reshape Britain 's corporate tax laws as companies start to move to Ireland to pay less taxation , a classic way the superclass exercises its power ( and a classic government response in giving way ) .
The superclass is super - rich - the top 1,000 are billionaires - is super - influential and super - confident .
There has not been a gap between the rich and poor on the current scale ever in history , warns Rothkopf .
It is unstable .
Sooner or later , there will be popular outrage and a political response .
For the moment , though , it seems that a spell has been cast over the political process , at least in Britain .
The two frontbenches outdo each other in their anxiety to appease the superclass ; Secretary of State for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform John Hutton spoke for both main political parties when he insisted we should praise great wealth .
It fell to Mervyn King , governor of the Bank of England , to point out that City salaries distort the economy by distorting the pattern of reward for talent and to Richard Lambert , director - general of the CBI , to argue that City salaries encourage recklessness .
The difficulty is that to do anything effective requires action at international level .
It is not hard to think of a cluster of measures that would limit superclass wealth and sky - high financial market salaries along with constraining the capacity of companies and their superclass directors to avoid tax .
You would move at EU level then strike a deal with the US and G8 .
But although such measures would be an effective countervailing power , members of the superclass tell us they would undermine UK sovereignty and bring dreaded Brussels regulation into Britain .
Euroscepticism is the superclass 's best friend , as is undermining all forms of multilateral collaboration .
But if there is not an effective response , sooner or later countries will go it alone .
Who is n't spooked by the renaissance of Italian fascism ?
Challenging times require courageous responses .
None is in prospect .
Mr. Obama was using his fund - raising advantage to pay for a multimillion - dollar campaign that included sophisticated demographic targeting to find supporters in smaller cities across the state , particularly ones with pockets of black voters .

Yet his team was also relying on old - fashioned tools , including sending supporters door - to - door , renting sound trucks to drive through urban neighborhoods and having volunteers serve as “ town criers ” to pass out literature on city buses .
In their final drives , both candidates barnstormed Pennsylvania with their eye on two different maps : one for the popular vote , the other for delegates .
Mrs. Clinton desperately needs to win both to narrow the Obama campaign ’s edge on both fronts .
Mr. Obama is also focused on winning delegates to maintain his lead , but he also wants to show he can draw support among the white , working - class voters who have gravitated to Mrs. Clinton .
In an atmosphere where both sides are hedging their expectations , Clinton aides have refused to say what margin of the popular vote she needs to win to stay in the race .
The contest for delegates , who are awarded proportionally based on how well the candidates perform in each Congressional district , is likely to be close , but the pressure is on Mrs. Clinton to get at least 50 percent of the delegates .
“ The fact that Hillary is crisscrossing a lot of Congressional districts , and Bill is , too , is proof that while everyone is focused on the vote percentages statewide , there is a war for delegates , ” said Tony Podesta , who has run several statewide races in Pennsylvania and supports Mrs. Clinton , referring to former President Bill Clinton .
“ She needs to find ways of closing the delegate gap ; she ca n’t go through all these contests and split the delegates 50 - 50 . ”
The intensity of Mr. Obama ’s campaign and his willingness to air negative attacks in recent days suggest he harbored hope of ending the Clinton campaign here or avoiding a major loss that would keep the race alive .
An expensive product in an unproven market
New peripherals always have an uphill battle in the market ; those on both the PC and the gaming consoles that have managed to take off always have strong games attached .
Dance mats are inseparable from Dance Dance Revolution , the guitars and drums for Rock Band had one of the most hyped rhythm games and a proven track record to bank on , while expensive flight sticks bring the promise of a more realistic experience with a variety of different flight simulations .
So what do you do when your main product is a $ 190 + haptic device ?
The first step is getting people to try it , and the second step is making enough great games available for it to get people to bite .
The best peripheral is worthless without a solid software library .
Tom Anderson , CEO of Novint
Novint was aware that this was the challenge with the Falcon ; as we pointed out in our review of the product , the hardware and effects were amazing , but outside of one or two games , there just was n't much worth your time to play on the hardware .
We spoke to Tom Anderson , the CEO of Novint , and he was blunt about this issue .
" When you look at reviews , and you guys did a really great , really fair [ job ] , I thought it was [ a ] really well done review of the Falcon , " Anderson told me .
" We get that type of review a lot ; we get a lot of really positive reviews , but towards the end of the review , typically it says ' But how is Novint going to do without game support ? ' "
He also points out that he reads the comments on various message boards , where consumers are interested in the product , but simply do n't see the game support being worth the investment .
When you kill the whale , the fish look easy
The company 's response ?
Sign up EA for Falcon support .
Novint will soon be selling some of the EA 's largest franchises through its online store , complete with the high - end haptics effects that Falcon integration brings .
Games like Tiger Woods PGA Tour ' 08 , Madden ' 08 , NBA Live ' 08 , Battlefield 2 , Battlefield 2142 , and Need For Street ProStreet will be coming to the NVeNT front end .
This is a huge step up from the somewhat generic golf and racing games available for the hardware now , and it shows the caliber of support Falcon owners can expect in the future .
So how does a small company like Novint convince one of the biggest publishers to give its PC peripheral so much support ?
The answer lies in an innovative business idea called 3D Touch Rights .
A variety of EA titles will be coming to the Falcon ; a huge boost to the software support of the peripheral
" Typically what we do is we license from a publisher or developer the rights to a game , and we license it in a field of use , meaning we can only use it in a specific area , " Anderson explained .
" The area we work out with them is the 3D Touch field of use .
So when we see we have the tough right , we saying we 're licensing the 3D Touch field of use .
What that means is we 're licensing the ability to use touch in an existing game . "
This is why Novint may become one of the most powerful players in the field of gaming haptics .
The company has created a brand - new way for developers and publishers to monetize their franchises , and it costs the companies nothing to give it a try .
Novint is offering publishers like EA a brand new way to promote their products , a new audience in Falcon users that may be hungry for triple - A content , and porting the games to the Falcon as a platform will cost them nothing .
Imagine someone offering you a nice check for something you did n't know you could sell , and you start to see how intriguing this idea had to have seemed for EA .
" We 're buying the sleeves off their vests , " Tom tells me , and I laugh , but it 's an apt image .
Novint will sell the games through its web site for $ 29.95 , but if you already own the title , you can pay $ 9.95 for the haptics update .
" We go to a company that owns a game , and we say we want to acquire the 3D touch rights to the game .
Sometimes the first reaction we get is ' You want to buy what now ? '
We 're buying something from people they did n't even know they had , " Anderson said .
" We say we 'll pay an upfront fee for the touch rights , so Novint is the one taking all the risk , and we tell them that we 'll do the integration with the touch ; there is no cost for [ them ] . "
Novint also does the work right after the game is released , so the process does n't even affect the development schedule of the game .
" We 're putting together a deal where it 's incremental revenue for the publisher , and so publishers have been really excited about this concept . "
Madden will now feature full - on haptic feedback with the Falcon
Anderson concedes that we 're not talking about huge piles of money , but that the deal was worth it for EA because of the number of titles that will be coming to the Falcon .
" Going back about three months , we did n't know if this model would work with the big publishers .
The amount that we pay for one title might not move the needle for them , but when you multiply that by six , seven , eight or nine titles , and you 're talking about amounts that are almost all profit to them , this is money they might not otherwise be making — without any risk , without any cost , and then maybe we make their quarter .
Even with the big publishers , we 've found that they really love this model . "
Who would n't ?
Publishers like EA are always looking for quick ways to pad their profits for the next earnings announcements , and 3D touch rights are one of the rare times in business where everyone gets what they wants .
EA and publishers who sign deals with Novint will get income from something they had no plans on using themselves .
Novint gets the cache of having EA 's roster of games on their platform , being sold directly through their store .
In the eyes of consumers gun -shy about spending on new hardware , EA 's involvement must look like a seal of approval .
And where EA goes , others follow .
Fox analyst : Americans not above torture , and should n't be David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday December 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Americans are n't above resorting to torture to gain intelligence from suspected terrorists -- and it would be a mistake if they were , according to Fox News military analyst Col.
David Hunt .
Hunt , who appeared on the Fox and Friends morning program to discuss the CIA 's admission that it destroyed at least two videotapes depicting severe interrogation techniques , described waterboarding as a devastatingly painful tactic that was a necessary evil of intelligence gathering .
" There are instances where it works .
I 've had it done to me in training , " said Hunt .
" It 's torture .
It is an extremely dangerous thing .
Your system shuts down . "
Asked by Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade if Americans were " better " than resorting to such practices , Hunt said he did n't think so .
" First of all , I do n't think we are , " he said .
" I think if we are , we should n't be .
We 're in a war with people who are n't ... good men have to know how to do bad things to do good . "
Hunt , who says that he withstood his own waterboarding experience for a little over a minute and a half , described the practice as as intensely painful , but effective .
" You are drowning .
Not gonna .
You are .
You 're gonna die , " he said .
" My point is we should have a discussion ... if we as a nation want to do this , it has worked .
But torture does not work all the time . "
Earlier in the segment , the colonel described the CIA 's elimination of the interrogation tapes as a a mistake .
" Stupid . Idiotic , " he said of the decision .
" How about number one , we do n't tape stuff ?
I thought we learned that lesson a long time ago .
I think its a reaction to Abu Ghraib , but it 's wrong , they should n't have done it . "
This video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on December 13 , 2007 .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - U.S. television news network CNN said it did not mean to cause offence when one of its commentators said the Chinese were “ goons ” and that their products were “ junk ” .
Jack Cafferty made the comments earlier this month on CNN ’s political program , The Situation Room , prompting an angry demand from China for an apology .
“ It was not Mr. Cafferty ’s nor CNN ’s intent to cause offence to the Chinese people , and ( CNN ) would apologize to anyone who has interpreted the comments in this way , ” CNN said in a statement .
CNN said Cafferty was offering his “ strongly held ” opinion of the Chinese government , not China ’s people , adding that he clarified the point on Monday .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu condemned the “ evil attack ” by CNN on the Chinese people .
“ Cafferty used the microphone in his hand to slander China and the Chinese people , and seriously violated reporting ethics , ” she said .
Cafferty had said the United States imported Chinese - made “ junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food ” , adding : “ They ’re basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they ’ve been for the last 50 years . ”
China came under international scrutiny following a series of food and product health scares last year .
It says the vast majority of its products are safe and has accused Western media of over - hyping the problem .
China has lashed out at Western media organizations , including CNN in recent weeks following unrest in Tibet , accusing them of running distorted reports , siding with pro-Tibet independence groups and of demonizing China .
New Democrat Movement
GROUP
The right wing current of the Democratic party , characterized by its neoliberal economic policies , support of Israel , desire to increase defense spending , and links to heavy donors and fundraisers .
Believes that " left - wing " positions are not politically viable .
Describes itself as " moderate and pro-growth " .
Probably responsible for erosion of the Democratic Party 's historical labor and minority base due to support of treaties like NAFTA , lack of support for affirmative action and poverty programs , and their siphoning away of campaign funds from minority groups .
At the national level , the movement was founded by the Democratic Leadership Council ( 501c4 educational non-profit , founded 1984 ) and includes the House New Democrat Coalition ( founded 1997 ) , the Senate New Democrat Coalition ( founded 2000 ) , the New Democrat Network PAC ( founded 1996 ) , the misnamed Progressive Policy Institute ( 501c4 think tank , " Bill Clinton 's idea mill " , founded 1989 ) , and the umbrella funding group The Third Way Foundation ( 501c3 non-profit , founded 1996 ) .
Since coming to power within the Democratic Party with Bill Clinton 's presidency , the New Democrats / DLC have worked towards " essentially the same purpose as the Christian Coalition ... to pull a broad political party dramatically to the right " according to John Nichols of The Progressive .
DLC operatives actively worked to sabotage Howard Dean 's candidacy for the US Presidency in 2004 , claiming that the " far - left " Democrat was wrong to attack George W. Bush 's tax cuts and national security policies .
Corporate contributors to the DLC and New Democratic Network include Bank One , Citigroup , Dow Chemical , DuPont , General Electric , Health Insurance Corporation of America , Merrill Lynch , Microsoft , Philip Morris , RJR Nabisco , Chevron , Prudential Foundation , Amoco Foundation , AT&T , Morgan Stanley , Occidental Petroleum , Raytheon , and many other Fortune 500 companies .
" [ Democrats should ] shift the primary focus from racism , the traditional enemy without , to self - defeating patterns of behavior [ among blacks ] " -- Chuck Robb , 2nd DLC Chairman , Governor & Senator of the Great State of Virginia , White Man , 1986 .
" I'm from the democratic wing of the Democrat Party " -- Paul Wellstone , progressive Democrat , criticizing the New Democrat Movement .
" Democrats for the Leadership Class " -- Jesse Jackson , progressive black Democrat , describing the DLC .

Religion is good ( broadly speaking ) Religion is good ( broadly speaking )
Via
The science of religion -
Where angels no longer fear to tread :
It is an ambitious shopping list .
Fortunately , other researchers have blazed a trail .
Patrick McNamara , for example , is the head of the Evolutionary Neurobehaviour Laboratory at Boston University 's School of Medicine .
He works with people who suffer from Parkinson 's disease .
This illness is caused by low levels of a messenger molecule called dopamine in certain parts of the brain .
In a preliminary study , Dr McNamara discovered that those with Parkinson 's had lower levels of religiosity than healthy individuals , and that the difference seemed to correlate with the disease 's severity .
He therefore suspects a link with dopamine levels and is now conducting a follow - up involving some patients who are taking dopamine - boosting medicine and some of whom are not .
Any bets on what 's causing this ?
I suspect low dopamine individuals are less likely to be socially conforming , so the effect on religiosity might be weaker in a society where religion is less important than the United States .
But nice to see some neurochemical work on this .
In the future perhaps neuroscientists will be able to advise parents on the optimal mixture of the " soup " in their offsprings ' brains to increase the chances of religiosity , or decrease it ? (
But probably the most interesting reported research in the piece has to do with group selection & functionalism :
To test whether religion might have emerged as a way of improving group co-operation while reducing the need to keep an eye out for free - riders , Dr Sosis drew on a catalogue of 19th - century American communes published in 1988 by Yaacov Oved of Tel Aviv University .
Dr Sosis picked 200 of these for his analysis ; 88 were religious and 112 were secular .
Dr Oved 's data include the span of each commune 's existence and Dr Sosis found that communes whose ideology was secular were up to four times as likely as religious ones to dissolve in any given year .
A follow - up study that Dr Sosis conducted in collaboration with Eric Bressler of McMaster University in Canada focused on 83 of these communes ( 30 religious , 53 secular ) to see if the amount of time they survived correlated with the strictures and expectations they imposed on the behaviour of their members .
The two researchers examined things like food consumption , attitudes to material possessions , rules about communication , rituals and taboos , and rules about marriage and sexual relationships .
As they expected , they found that the more constraints a religious commune placed on its members , the longer it lasted ( one is still going , at the grand old age of 149 ) .
But the same did not hold true of secular communes , where the oldest was 40 .
Dr Sosis therefore concludes that ritual constraints are not by themselves enough to sustain co-operation in a community - what is needed in addition is a belief that those constraints are sanctified .
Dr Sosis has also studied modern secular and religious kibbutzim in Israel .
Because a kibbutz , by its nature , depends on group co-operation , the principal difference between the two is the use of religious ritual .
Within religious communities , men are expected to pray three times daily in groups of at least ten , while women are not .
It should , therefore , be possible to observe whether group rituals do improve co-operation , based on the behaviour of men and women .
To do so , Dr Sosis teamed up with Bradley Ruffle , an economist at Ben-Gurion University , in Israel .
They devised a game to be played by two members of a kibbutz .
This was a variant of what is known to economists as the common - pool - resource dilemma , which involves two people trying to divide a pot of money without knowing how much the other is asking for .
In the version of the game devised by Dr Sosis and Dr Ruffle , each participant was told that there was an envelope with 100 shekels in it ( between 1/6th and 1/8th of normal monthly income ) .
Both players could request money from the envelope , but if the sum of their requests exceeded its contents , neither got any cash .
If , however , their request equalled , or was less than , the 100 shekels , not only did they keep the money , but the amount left was increased by 50 % and split between them .
Dr Sosis and Dr Ruffle picked the common - pool - resource dilemma because the communal lives of kibbutz members mean they often face similar dilemmas over things such as communal food , power and cars .
The researchers ' hypothesis was that in religious kibbutzim men would be better collaborators ( and thus would take less ) than women , while in secular kibbutzim men and women would take about the same .
And that was exactly what happened .
These sorts of data are relatively persuave to me about the functional power of religious institutions and social dynamics .
Of course , apparent deviations from the trendline will be important to examine too .
This is the closest thing to a website I could find for the

Any bets on what 's causing this ?
I suspect low dopamine individuals are less likely to be socially conforming , so the effect on religiosity might be weaker in a society where religion is less important than the United States .
But nice to see some neurochemical work on this .
In the future perhaps neuroscientists will be able to advise parents on the optimal mixture of the " soup " in their offsprings ' brains to increase the chances of religiosity , or decrease it ?
( Randall Parker has been talking about this for years )
But probably the most interesting reported research in the piece has to do with group selection & functionalism : Labels : Religion

BAGHDAD – Many Iraqis have come to believe that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki is just as much a dictator as Saddam Hussein was .
" Al - Maliki is a dictator who must be removed by all means , " 35 - year - old Abdul - Riza Hussein , a Mahdi Army member from Sadr City in Baghdad , told IPS .
" He is a worse dictator than Saddam ; he has killed in less than two years more than Saddam killed in 10 years . "
Following the failed attempt by the U.S. - backed al - Maliki to crack down on the Mahdi Army militia of Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , the situation in Iraq has become much worse .
Iraq appears to be splintering more widely under this rule than under Saddam’s .
Fierce fighting has broken out between Sadr ’s Mahdi Army and Maliki ’s army and police forces in Baghdad , which comprise mostly the Badr Organization militia , the armed wing of a political group , the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) .
According to statistics compiled by the U.S. military in Baghdad , there has been a sharp increase in attacks against U.S. and Iraqi security forces , from 239 in February to 631 in March .
Most of these attacks are believed to have been carried out by the Mahdi Army .
The Mahdi Army is known to have substantial control of the streets of Baghdad , Basra , and many other predominantly Shia areas in southern Iraq .
But there is also considerable Shia support for Maliki ’s effort to disarm the Mahdi Army .
" Those who shout loud against Maliki and his legally elected government are all thieves and murderers and must be executed , " says Aziz Mussawi , a resident of Hilla , 60 mi. south of Baghdad , who fled for Baghdad when the clashes started there last month .
" These militias will destroy Iraq if left unleashed . "
Many Iraqis feel caught in a crossfire in what they see as a battle for power between the Shia factions .
" Over a thousand Iraqis got killed and more than that number wounded just for a game of chess between warlords , " Mohammad Alwan , a lawyer in Baghdad , told IPS .
" All of them call for dissolving militias while they keep militias of their own .
Most of those in power in the government are militia leaders . "
Sadr and his followers are calling for unity , in an attempt to bring as many Iraqis as they can , Sunni and Shia , to their side .
The rival Fadhila Party , powerful in many Shia provinces and in cities like Basra where it holds the governorship , has also called for unity .
It is widely believed in Iraq that parties who call for unity are using the issue to get public support against federalism , seen to be supported by the U.S. and Iranian backed parties such as the SIIC and Maliki ’s Da’wa Party .
Many in Iraq see federalism as the breakup of the country .
After five years of occupation and suffering , with no end in sight , many Iraqis have become skeptical of all political and religious leaders .
" Sadr is another face of the Iranian project , despite their pretending to be a national movement , " Jassam Hady , a colonel of the former Iraqi army in Baghdad , told IPS .
" All those in the Iraqi government in the so - called Green Zone have militias that have killed Iraqis under one flag or another . "
Hady , like many Iraqis , believes that the current spasm of violence will worsen as the two main Shia groups , the Sadr Movement and Maliki ’s affiliations , continue to vie for power ahead of the provincial elections slated for October .
Division has broken out also within tribes ; many have now come to back Sadr not because they like him , but because they hate the Badr militia of Hakeem ’s SIIC and Maliki ’s Da’wa Party .
" Our problem in the southern parts of Iraq and other Shia dominated areas is that all options are bad , " the chief of a major tribe in Basra who fled for Baghdad told IPS on the condition of anonymity .
" Iranian controlled militias killed so many chiefs of tribes because they refused to support these division projects concealed under the flag of federalism . "
Several tribes in the south have formed unions to fight the separation project , but some sheiks have formed counter unions to support the Badr and Da’wa agenda .
Most people seem to oppose any federalism that would separate Shia from Sunni Muslims .
" We will be weak without our Sunni brothers , " says Shamil Mahmood of Sadr City , the eastern district of 2 million in Baghdad .
" The whole of the south will be swallowed by Iran , that will humiliate us and treat us like animals . "
Vzaar provides video to eBay sellers , giving them both a video for their eBay listings and an embedable video with links to the sellers eBay page for other sites .
The London , UK based startup was founded by Ken Moss in April 2007 with “ the ambition of unleashing the power of video for enterprises large and small , all over the world . ”
To use , users record a video of their item , upload it to Vzaar , then add it to their eBay listing of choice .
The service is free for up to 30 videos per months , with up to 1GB of total video .
Videos are capped at 2 minutes max and video storage is for 90 days .
The company makes money from charging high volume users , with a particular target towards eBay Power Sellers .
Vzaar ’s
Plus service costs $ 10 per month and gives subscribers up to 300 videos a month , and the Pro service at $ 20 per month delivers up to 3000 videos a month ( max all up of 2GB ) , and video storage for one year .
At the time of writing there ’s a demo video of one video top right ( I presume this will disappear with time ) .
It ’s a decent idea , particularly with the inclusion of relevant links with the video .
I ca n’t see casual users flocking to use this en-masse ( YouTube would do the job in most cases ) but that ’s not the target audience for Vzaar , and serious eBay sellers may well find the service useful .
Our noses can quickly learn to link even subtle changes in smell with danger , claim scientists .
Volunteers who could not differentiate between two similar smells found they could do it easily after being given a mild electric shock alongside one .
Brain scans confirmed the change in the " smelling " part of the brain .
The US research , published in the journal Science , suggests our distant ancestors evolved the ability to keep us away from predators .
It warns us that it 's dangerous and we have to pay attention to it .
Dr Wen Li
Northwestern University , Chicago
The 12 volunteers were exposed to two " grassy " odours , and none of them could accurately tell the difference between them .
After they were shocked while smelling one of them , they developed the ability to discriminate between the two .
Researcher Dr Wen Li , of the Feinberg School of Medicine , Northwestern University , in Chicago , said : " It 's evolutionary .
This helps us to have a very sensitive ability to detect something that is important to our survival from an ocean of environmental information .
" It warns us that it 's dangerous and we have to pay attention to it . "
Complex organ MRI scans , which can measure brain activity , revealed clear differences in a part of the brain called the olfactory cortex before and after the shocks .
Dr Geraldine Wright , from the University of Newcastle has carried out similar work in animals - and says that fundamentally , the human smell system is designed in the same way .
She said that the sensitivity of the human nose was not vastly inferior to many other creatures .
" In terms of the number of olfactory receptors in our noses , we do pretty well compared to some other species , and we can sense a lot of different smells .
" If the brain has to remember some detail in order to avoid a bad outcome , it will do it pretty quickly . "

What are these ?
The myth that minority parliaments are inefficient
In the past week or so , I ’ve heard two people who I consider to be generally intelligent make the same argument with regards to minority parliaments .
The first was a person I just overheard while I was at school finishing up the final assignment for my degree , the second person was a commentator on this blog .
Both arguments were of the standard , prevalent format .
They both argued that in minority parliaments , there are too many political games that get in the way of governance and that , because of this , minority parliaments inefficient .
It is time now that we do away the myth that Canadians either want or should want ( or even ‘ need ’ ) majority parliaments .
Indeed it ’s not difficult to understand why some people hold such an opinion .
In fact , in the U.K. , minority parliaments are called “ hung parliaments ” thus further lending creedence to the inefficient minority parliament thesis .
Thus , it is somewhat understandable why some individuals would take this assumption about minority parliaments and wrongly then hope for what Jeffrey Simpson rightly called the “ Friendly Dictatorship ” of majority parliaments .
The only problem with this argument is that the evidence simply does not support its conclusion .
Paul E.J. Thomas has a piece out in the Canadian Parliamentary Review , wherein he examines precisely the claim that minority parliaments are inefficient .
His piece , entitled , appropriately enough , “ Measuring the Effectiveness of a Minority Parliament ” employs a thorough quantitative study of Canadian minority and majority Parliaments and utterly blows this myth out of the water .
You can access Thomas ’s piece for free online , here .
A brief excerpt from the abstract of Thomas ’s article :
“ The paper sets out the procedural context of the 38th Parliament and develops six criteria for evaluating its behaviour .
It then explores each criteria using a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the actions of the 36th , 37th , and 38th Parliaments .
This evaluation shows that the 38th Parliament was no less efficient than its predecessors , featured greater legislative deliberation , and was better able to hold the executive accountable for its actions [ emphasis added ] .
As a result the paper concludes that while minority governments are by no means perfect , the example of 38th Parliament suggests that an electoral system which produced more minority governments could increase the quality of democracy in Canada . ”
But , sadly , despite all the empirical evidence to the contrary , we ’re already starting to see the capitalist media telling Canadians that they need the anti-democratic security of a majority parliament .
And , moreover , it unfortunately appears as though Canadians are starting to swallow that lie .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp gauged Facebook ’s interest in a possible acquisition after the software giant ’s failed takeover attempt of Yahoo Inc , the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday .
The newspaper reported on its Web site that Microsoft ’s bankers put out subtle signals to Facebook , the social networking Web site , to see if it would be open to a full acquisition .
The talks were first reported by Web site All Things Digital , owned by Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones .
Facebook spokeswoman Brandee Barker declined to comment on the report .
Microsoft officials were not immediately available for comment .
In October , Microsoft took a $ 240 million stake in Facebook , which valued the start - up at $ 15 billion .
Citing an unnamed source , the report said there are no active discussions between the two companies .
The news came a few days after Microsoft dropped its unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo for $ 47.5 billion .
The aim of that proposal was to build an online advertising powerhouse to rival Google Inc .
Facebook , founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg , has become one of the hottest properties on the Internet because of its rapid growth and the loyalty of its users .
Facebook has more than 70 million active users .
In the past , Zuckerberg has resisted selling the entire company , opting to work toward an initial public offering .

Priest Bans Autistic Boy From Church
Mom told she'd be sent to jail if she brought autistic son to church .
BERTHA , Minn .
May 19 , 2008  -- A Catholic priest has filed a restraining order against the parents of a severely autistic 13 - year - old boy in an effort to keep him from attending the church in Bertha on Sundays .
The Rev. Daniel Walz alleges that Adam Race 's unruly behavior endangers others who attend the Church of St. Joseph .
Race 's parents have ignored the restraining order , calling it discriminatory , and Carol Race , Adam 's mother , was cited by police and is due to appear in court on Monday for violating the order .
" He said that we did not discipline our son .
He said that our son was physically out of control and a danger to everyone at church , " Carol Race said .
" I can't discipline him out of his autism , and I think that 's what our priest is expecting . "
Carol Race said it all started last June , when Walz and a church trustee visited the Races at their home address the behavior of Adam , who stands taller than six feet and weighs more than 225 pounds .
In an affidavit , Walz said the church " explored and offered many options for accommodations that would assist the family while protecting the safety of parishioners .
The family refused those offers of accommodation . "
Carol Race said the family of seven , which has attended St. Joseph since 1996 , typically sat in the cry room or in the back pew to keep avoid disrupting the services and did not hear a complaint from the parishioners until Walz showed up at their home in June .
Even after the restraining order was served , the family continued going to the church and would leave during the closing hymn to avoid contact with others , Carol Race said .
The Diocese of St. Cloud issued a statement saying the petition was filed " as a last resort out of a growing concern for the safety of parishioners and other community members due to disruptive and violent behavior on the part of that child . "
Walz said the boy 's behavior worsened over time , telling authorities that Adam has been " extremely disruptive and dangerous " since last summer .
According to Walz , Adam struck a child during mass , nearly knocks elderly parishioners over when he hastily exits the church , spits and sometimes urinates in church and fights when he is being restrained .
He also one time assaulted a girl by pulling her onto his lap and , during Easter mass , ran to the parking lot and got into two vehicles , starting them and revving the engine , Walz alleged .
" There were people directly in front of the car who could have been injured or killed if he had put the car in gear , " Walz wrote .
Adam 's parents have to sit on him and sometimes tie his hands and feet to get control of him , Walz wrote .
Carol Race has an answer to each complaint .
She said her son makes spitting faces but does n't spit and acknowledged he has occasional problems with incontinence .
She says that she and her husband sit on Adam because their weight calms him down , which is why he pulled the girl onto him .
She also said they do use soft straps to bind Adam 's hands and feet on occasion because it calms him , as does the revving sound of engines , which is why he started the cars .
Some disability advocates are getting behind the Races .
" It 's unfathomable and concerns me that we 've taken a situation with special needs and we 're making it into the criminal matter , " said Brad Trahan , the founder of the RT Autism Awareness Foundation in Rochester , who has asked the bishop of St. Cloud to rescind the restraining order .
Carol Race just hopes the ugly back - and - forth does n't tarnish the image of the church .
" The church is n't bad , " she said .
" But it 's what some individuals do within the church . "

TAP TO CALL US NOW ( 251 ) 220-2001
Many people asked for a transcript of Contrarian Debate : Janszen vs Mish the discussion between Eric Janszen and myself on housing , a possible recession , and the terminal state of the asset bubble cycle : inflation or deflation .
Others wondered why the " &* %@$ ! " format was streaming audio instead of MP3 .
I can not answer that question but I will pass that thought along to the person recording and we will attempt to have a different format next time if at all possible .
Finally others questioned calling what took place a " debate " .
Well it was never intended to be a debate in the classic sense but rather a discussion of ideas and topics that each of us agreed to talk about in advance .
Indeed there was far more agreement than disagreement .
In the discussion each of us presented a " What year is it ? " scenario .
Eric Janszen chose 1999 as outlined in Is it 1999 again ?
Yes and no .
I chose 1929 .
I think it is fair to say we both agree that history rhymes but does not repeat , and those looking for " fireworks " as opposed to a discussion of ideas may have been disappointed .
There is no transcript available but following are my views on the parallels between now and 1929 and why this is not a repeat of the 70's .
Let 's discuss the 70's first .
70 ’s Rerun
Similarities
War in Vietnam war then vs. the war in Iraq now Rising oil and commodity prices
Rising
Oil prices [ demand side shock vs. supply side shock ]
Spiraling wages then vs. declining wages now Wage and price controls then
Consumer Debt levels – Significant ability to take on more debt in the 70's
Housing down payments – 20 % then 0 % now
Two family incomes now vs. one family income then
The power of unions - then
Globalization & Global wage arbitrage - now
Outsourcing - now
Productivity improvements -
The internet and other innovations - now
Declining credit standards - now
Downfall of communism
Long term interest rates under 5 % - now
New creative financing ideas running rampant - now
Massive use of derivatives - now China , India , and Emerging Markets
20's Rerun
Throughout the 1920s , the Fed deliberately and unwisely stimulated the stock market by keeping the “ call rate , ” that is , the interest rate on bank loans to the stock market , artificially low .
– Margin rates were just lowered here and the FF rate which was lowered to 1 % supported a big housing boom .
In the late 1920s , bank credit propelled a massive real estate boom in New York City , in Florida , and throughout the country .
We now have the biggest housing bubble in history .
In the 1920 ’s there was a massive infusion of money ( gold ) from war torn Europe stimulating our economy .
We currently have a massive stimulus of cheap money from Japan and China via and various carry trades and cheap credit supporting our economy .
In the 20’s we intervened in foreign exchange markets to enhance or stabilize Europe ’s power to buy our exports .
We currently are involved in disputes with China over currency issues attempting to get China to buy more of our goods .
There were massive productivity improvements in the 20’s along with the industrial revolution and assembly line processing .
The 90’s – 2000 ’s productivity miracle was the internet .
Huge boom periods on account of disruptive innovation .
By contrast there was no such innovative disruptions in the 70’s .
In late 20 ’s credit was expanding at a rapid pace but there was no need for additional productive capacity .
Today GDP is rapidly falling but credit is still rising .
There is no pent up demand for homes , restaurants , retail stores , strip malls , autos , truck , etc , just as there was no need for additional assembly line production in 1929 .
Speculation replaced productive capacity just as it is today .
In 1929 leverage was extreme via stock margin .
In 2006 credit derivatives leverage is extreme to the tune of 340 trillion dollars worth with no one really understand exactly what the counterparty risk is .
A few days before leaving office in March 1929 , Coolidge called American prosperity “ absolutely sound ” and assured everyone that stocks were “ cheap at current prices . ”
Based on the “ Treasury Model ” and unsustainable earnings growth due to financing activities , we are once again told time and time again that “ the economy is sound ” and stocks are cheap at current prices .
" Keynesian Folly " , along with other massive government interventions managed to convert what would likely have been a short , sharp recession into a chronic , permanent , stagnation with an unprecedented high unemployment that only ended with World War II .
Massive government interventions between 2002 and 2005 prevented a badly needed recession and instead created the biggest asset bubble in history .
In 1933 gold coins were confiscated – now we have a threat of nickels being confiscated .
At the time , the stock market of 1929 was the biggest asset bubbles in history .
We have now vastly exceeded all previous credit bubbles .
The Smoot - Hawley Tariff was signed into law on June 17 , 1930 .
There are renewed threats of tariffs in the U.S. Congress right now .
Corporate profits are at their highest level since 1929 .
Mish :
How does inflation start and end ?
Kasriel : Inflation starts with expansion of money and credit .
Inflation ends when the central bank is no longer able or willing to extend credit and / or when consumers and businesses are no longer willing to borrow because further expansion and / or speculation no longer makes any economic sense .
Differences
The differences noted above are staggering and Eric agreed .
Oddly enough I found one more similarity just today .
In More Cream for the Fat Cats I see that " The above 12 points were the similarities I mentioned in the discussion and Eric chimed in with an additional one : Buying goods on credit .
Buying on credit first became widely practiced in the 20's .
It was done to " make things affordable " .
Now nearly everything is made affordable by stretching payments to lengths that certainly never would have been allowed in the 70's but are commonplace today .
That is where we parted ways .
While agreeing on the similarities Eric also cautioned there were parallels to 1937 and presented his " Ka-Poom Theory " which you can also see in Is it 1999 again ?
Yes and no .
On the other hand I am sticking to a simple " It ’s not different this time " approach and that all asset bubbles collapse in a deflationary credit bust .
Previous credit busting deflationary collapses include Japan , the Great Depression , the railroad bust of the 1880's , the South Sea Trading Bubble , the John Law Mississippi Bubble , and the Tulip Mania Bubble In an Interview with Paul Kasriel we had the following discussion on how inflation starts and ends .
It is pure speculation now ( corporate buybacks , leveraged buyouts , collapsing volatilities ) along with foreign central bank asset buying that is driving stocks higher .
None of it is getting into the average guy 's pocket and none of it has anything to do with the real economy .
Meanwhile real wages are falling , home prices are collapsing , and if I am correct job growth is about ready to fall off the cliff in a second wave down of reduced corporate spending .
That combination will increase foreclosures , defaults , and bankruptcies ( the latter of which obviously destroys credit ) .
There is little central banks can do about it either , just as they could not do much when all of the other massive bubbles throughout history collapsed .
Nonetheless , “ Keynesian Folly " will likely be attempted once again .
The last execution by Greenspan produced the housing bubble and with it jobs .
If the next attempt does not put money into consumers pockets and have them spend it on increased consumption ( as opposed to paying off debts ) , the party is over regardless of what year this is .
Mike Shedlock / Mishhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/
As oil prices soared to record levels in recent years , basic economics suggested that consumption would fall and supply would rise as producers opened the taps to pump more .
But as prices flirt with $ 120 a barrel , many energy specialists are becoming worried that neither seems to be happening .
Higher prices have done little to attract new production or to suppress global demand , and the resulting mismatch has sent oil prices spiraling upward .
“ According to normal economic theory , and the history of oil , rising prices have two major effects , ” said Fatih Birol , the chief economist at the International Energy Agency , which advises industrialized countries .
“ They reduce demand and they induce oil supplies .
Not this time . ”
A key reason that supply is not rising to meet demand is that producers outside of the OPEC cartel  countries like Russia , Mexico and Norway  have been showing troubling signs of sluggishness .
Unlike the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , whose explicit goal is to regulate supply to keep prices up , the other countries are the free traders of the international market , with every incentive to produce flat - out at a time of high prices .
Biases in Estimating Probabilities
In making rough probability judgments , people commonly depend upon one of several simplified rules of thumb that greatly ease the burden of decision .
Using the " availability " rule , people judge the probability of an event by the ease with which they can imagine relevant instances of similar events or the number of such events that they can easily remember .
With the " anchoring " strategy , people pick some natural starting point for a first approximation and then adjust this figure based on the results of additional information or analysis .
Typically , they do not adjust the initial judgment enough .
Expressions of probability , such as possible and probable , are a common source of ambiguity that make it easier for a reader to interpret a report as consistent with the reader 's own preconceptions .
The probability of a scenario is often miscalculated .
Data on " prior probabilities " are commonly ignored unless they illuminate causal relationships .
*******************
Availability Rule
One simplified rule of thumb commonly used in making probability estimates is known as the availability rule .
In this context , " availability " refers to imaginability or retrievability from memory .
Psychologists have shown that two cues people use unconsciously in judging the probability of an event are the ease with which they can imagine relevant instances of the event and the number or frequency of such events that they can easily remember .
133 People are using the availability rule of thumb whenever they estimate frequency or probability on the basis of how easily they can recall or imagine instances of whatever it is they are trying to estimate .
Normally this works quite well .
If one thing actually occurs more frequently than another and is therefore more probable , we probably can recall more instances of it .
Events that are likely to occur usually are easier to imagine than unlikely events .
People are constantly making inferences based on these assumptions .
For example , we estimate our chances for promotion by recalling instances of promotion among our colleagues in similar positions and with similar experience .
We estimate the probability that a politician will lose an election by imagining ways in which he may lose popular support .
Although this often works well , people are frequently led astray when the ease with which things come to mind is influenced by factors unrelated to their probability .
The ability to recall instances of an event is influenced by how recently the event occurred , whether we were personally involved , whether there were vivid and memorable details associated with the event , and how important it seemed at the time .
These and other factors that influence judgment are unrelated to the true probability of an event .
Consider two people who are smokers .
One had a father who died of lung cancer , whereas the other does not know anyone who ever had lung cancer .
The one whose father died of lung cancer will normally perceive a greater probability of adverse health consequences associated with smoking , even though one more case of lung cancer is statistically insignificant when weighing such risk .
How about two CIA officers , one of whom knew Aldrich Ames and the other who did not personally know anyone who had ever turned out to be a traitor ?
Which one is likely to perceive the greatest risk of insider betrayal ?
It was difficult to imagine the breakup of the Soviet Union because such an event was so foreign to our experience of the previous 50 years .
How difficult is it now to imagine a return to a Communist regime in Russia ?
Not so difficult , in part because we still have vivid memories of the old Soviet Union .
But is that a sound basis for estimating the likelihood of its happening ?
When analysts make quick , gut judgments without really analyzing the situation , they are likely to be influenced by the availability bias .
The more a prospective scenario accords with one 's experience , the easier it is to imagine and the more likely it seems .
Intelligence analysts may be less influenced than others by the availability bias .
Analysts are evaluating all available information , not making quick and easy inferences .
On the other hand , policymakers and journalists who lack the time or access to evidence to go into details must necessarily take shortcuts .
The obvious shortcut is to use the availability rule of thumb for making inferences about probability .
Many events of concern to intelligence analysts
... are perceived as so unique that past history does not seem relevant to the evaluation of their likelihood .
In thinking of such events we often construct scenarios , i.e. , stories that lead from the present situation to the target event .
The plausibility of the scenarios that come to mind , or the difficulty of producing them , serve as clues to the likelihood of the event .
If no reasonable scenario comes to mind , the event is deemed impossible or highly unlikely .
If several scenarios come easily to mind , or if one scenario is particularly compelling , the event in question appears probable .
134
US policymakers in the early years of our involvement in Vietnam had to imagine scenarios for what might happen if they did or did not commit US troops to the defense of South Vietnam .
In judging the probability of alternative outcomes , our senior leaders were strongly influenced by the ready availability of two seemingly comparable scenarios -- the failure of appeasement prior to World War II and the successful intervention in Korea .
Many extraneous factors influence the imaginability of scenarios for future events , just as they influence the retrievability of events from memory .
Curiously , one of these is the act of analysis itself .
The act of constructing a detailed scenario for a possible future event makes that event more readily imaginable and , therefore , increases its perceived probability .
This is the experience of CIA analysts who have used various tradecraft tools that require , or are especially suited to , the analysis of unlikely but nonetheless possible and important hypotheses .
( Such techniques were discussed in Chapter 6 , " Keeping an Open Mind " and Chapter 8 , " Analysis of Competing Hypotheses . " )
The analysis usually results in the " unlikely " scenario being taken a little more seriously .
This phenomenon has also been demonstrated in psychological experiments .
135
In sum , the availability rule of thumb is often used to make judgments about likelihood or frequency .
People would be hard put to do otherwise , inasmuch as it is such a timesaver in the many instances when more detailed analysis is not warranted or not feasible .
Intelligence analysts , however , need to be aware when they are taking shortcuts .
They must know the strengths and weaknesses of these procedures , and be able to identify when they are most likely to be led astray .
For intelligence analysts , recognition that they are employing the availability rule should raise a caution flag .
Serious analysis of probability requires identification and assessment of the strength and interaction of the many variables that will determine the outcome of a situation .
Anchoring
Another strategy people seem to use intuitively and unconsciously to simplify the task of making judgments is called anchoring .
Some natural starting point , perhaps from a previous analysis of the same subject or from some partial calculation , is used as a first approximation to the desired judgment .
This starting point is then adjusted , based on the results of additional information or analysis .
Typically , however , the starting point serves as an anchor or drag that reduces the amount of adjustment , so the final estimate remains closer to the starting point than it ought to be .
Anchoring can be demonstrated very simply in a classroom exercise by asking a group of students to estimate one or more known quantities , such as the percentage of member countries in the United Nations that are located in Africa .
Give half the students a low - percentage number and half a high - percentage number .
Ask them to start with this number as an estimated answer , then , as they think about the problem , to adjust this number until they get as close as possible to what they believe is the correct answer .
When this was done in one experiment that used this question , those starting with an anchor of 10 percent produced adjusted estimates that averaged 25 percent .
Those who started with an anchor of 65 percent produced adjusted estimates that averaged 45 percent .
136
Because of insufficient adjustment , those who started out with an estimate that was too high ended with significantly higher estimates than those who began with an estimate that was too low .
Even the totally arbitrary starting points acted as anchors , causing drag or inertia that inhibited fulladjustment of estimates .
Whenever analysts move into a new analytical area and take over responsibility for updating a series of judgments or estimates made by their predecessors , the previous judgments may have such an anchoring effect .
Even when analysts make their own initial judgment , and then attempt to revise this judgment on the basis of new information or further analysis , there is much evidence to suggest that they usually do not change the judgment enough .
Anchoring provides a partial explanation of experiments showing that analysts tend to be overly sure of themselves in setting confidence ranges .
A military analyst who estimates future missile or tank production is often unable to give a specific figure as a point estimate .
The analyst may , therefore , set a range from high to low , and estimate that there is , say , a 75 - percent chance that the actual production figure will fall within this range .
If a number of such estimates are made that reflect an appropriate degree of confidence , the true figure should fall within the estimated range 75 percent of the time and outside this range 25 percent of the time .
In experimental situations , however , most participants are overconfident .
The true figure falls outside the estimated range a much larger percentage of the time .
137
If the estimated range is based on relatively hard information concerning the upper and lower limits , the estimate is likely to be accurate .
If , however , the range is determined by starting with a single best estimate that is simply adjusted up and down to arrive at estimated maximum and minimum values , then anchoring comes into play , and the adjustment is likely to be insufficient .
Reasons for the anchoring phenomenon are not well understood .
The initial estimate serves as a hook on which people hang their first impressions or the results of earlier calculations .
In recalculating , they take this as a starting point rather than starting over from scratch , but why this should limit the range of subsequent reasoning is not clear .
There is some evidence that awareness of the anchoring problem is not an adequate antidote .
138 This is a common finding in experiments dealing with cognitive biases .
The biases persist even after test subjects are informed of them and instructed to try to avoid them or compensate for them .
One technique for avoiding the anchoring bias , to weigh anchor so to speak , may be to ignore one 's own or others ' earlier judgments and rethink a problem from scratch .
In other words , consciously avoid any prior judgment as a starting point .
There is no experimental evidence to show that this is possible or that it will work , but it seems worth trying .
Alternatively , it is sometimes possible to avoid human error by employing formal statistical procedures .
Bayesian statistical analysis , for example , can be used to revise prior judgments on the basis of new information in a way that avoids anchoring bias .
139
Expression of Uncertainty
Probabilities may be expressed in two ways .
Statistical probabilities are based on empirical evidence concerning relative frequencies .
Most intelligence judgments deal with one - of - a - kind situations for which it is impossible to assign a statistical probability .
Another approach commonly used in intelligence analysis is to make a " subjective probability " or " personal probability " judgment .
Such a judgment is an expression of the analyst 's personal belief that a certain explanation or estimate is correct .
It is comparable to a judgment that a horse has a three - to - one chance of winning a race .
Verbal expressions of uncertainty -- such as " possible , " " probable , " " unlikely , " " may , " and " could " -- are a form of subjective probability judgment , but they have long been recognized as sources of ambiguity and misunderstanding .
To say that something could happen or is possible may refer to anything from a 1 - percent to a 99 - percent probability .
To express themselves clearly , analysts must learn to routinely communicate uncertainty using the language of numerical probability or odds ratios .
As explained in Chapter 2 on " Perception , " people tend to see what they expect to see , and new information is typically assimilated to existing beliefs .
This is especially true when dealing with verbal expressions of uncertainty .
By themselves , these expressions have no clear meaning .
They are empty shells .
The reader or listener fills them with meaning through the context in which they are used and what is already in the reader 's or listener 's mind about that context .
When intelligence conclusions are couched in ambiguous terms , a reader 's interpretation of the conclusions will be biased in favor of consistency with what the reader already believes .
This may be one reason why many intelligence consumers say they do not learn much from intelligence reports .
140
It is easy to demonstrate this phenomenon in training courses for analysts .
Give students a short intelligence report , have them underline all expressions of uncertainty , then have them express their understanding of the report by writing above each expression of uncertainty the numerical probability they believe was intended by the writer of the report .
This is an excellent learning experience , as the differences among students in how they understand the report are typically so great as to be quite memorable .
In one experiment , an intelligence analyst was asked to substitute numerical probability estimates for the verbal qualifiers in one of his own earlier articles .
The first statement was : " The cease - fire is holding but could be broken within a week . "
The analyst said he meant there was about a 30 - percent chance the cease - fire would be broken within a week .
Another analyst who had helped this analyst prepare the article said she thought there was about an 80 - percent chance that the cease - fire would be broken .
Yet , when working together on the report , both analysts had believed they were in agreement about what could happen .
141 Obviously , the analysts had not even communicated effectively with each other , let alone with the readers of their report .
Sherman Kent , the first director of CIA 's Office of National Estimates , was one of the first to recognize problems of communication caused by imprecise statements of uncertainty .
Unfortunately , several decades after Kent was first jolted by how policymakers interpreted the term " serious possibility " in a national estimate , this miscommunication between analysts and policymakers , and between analysts , is still a common occurrence .
142
I personally recall an ongoing debate with a colleague over the bona fides of a very important source .
I argued he was probably bona fide .
My colleague contended that the source was probably under hostile control .
After several months of periodic disagreement , I finally asked my colleague to put a number on it .
He said there was at least a 51 - percent chance of the source being under hostile control .
I said there was at least a 51 - percent chance of his being bona fide .
Obviously , we agreed that there was a great deal of uncertainty .
That stopped our disagreement .
The problem was not a major difference of opinion , but the ambiguity of the term probable .
The table in Figure 18 shows the results of an experiment with 23 NATO military officers accustomed to reading intelligence reports .
They were given a number of sentences such as : " It is highly unlikely that .... "
All the sentences were the same except that the verbal expressions of probability changed .
The officers were asked what percentage probability they would attribute to each statement if they read it in an intelligence report .
Each dot in the table represents one officer 's probability assignment .
143
While there was broad consensus about the meaning of " better than even , " there was a wide disparity in interpretation of other probability expressions .
The shaded areas in the table show the ranges proposed by Kent .
144
The main point is that an intelligence report may have no impact on the reader if it is couched in such ambiguous language that the reader can easily interpret it as consistent with his or her own preconceptions .
This ambiguity can be especially troubling when dealing with low - probability , high - impact dangers against which policymakers may wish to make contingency plans .
Figure 18 :
Measuring Perceptions of Uncertainty
Consider , for example , a report that there is little chance of a terrorist attack against the American Embassy in Cairo at this time .
If the Ambassador 's preconception is that there is no more than a one - in - a - hundred chance , he may elect to not do very much .
If the Ambassador 's preconception is that there may be as much as a one - in - four chance of an attack , he may decide to do quite a bit .
The term " little chance " is consistent with either of those interpretations , and there is no way to know what the report writer meant .
Another potential ambiguity is the phrase " at this time . "
Shortening the time frame for prediction lowers the probability , but may not decrease the need for preventive measures or contingency planning .
An event for which the timing is unpredictable may " at this time " have only a 5 - percent probability of occurring during the coming month , but a 60 - percent probability if the time frame is extended to one year ( 5 percent per month for 12 months ) .
How can analysts express uncertainty without being unclear about how certain they are ?
Putting a numerical qualifier in parentheses after the phrase expressing degree of uncertainty is an appropriate means of avoiding misinterpretation .
This may be an odds ratio ( less than a one - in - four chance ) or a percentage range ( 5 to 20 percent ) or ( less than 20 percent ) .
Odds ratios are often preferable , as most people have a better intuitive understanding of odds than of percentages .
Assessing Probability of a Scenario
Intelligence analysts sometimes present judgments in the form of a scenario - - a series of events leading to an anticipated outcome .
There is evidence that judgments concerning the probability of a scenario are influenced by amount and nature of detail in the scenario in a way that is unrelated to actual likelihood of the scenario .
A scenario consists of several events linked together in a narrative description .
To calculate mathematically the probability of a scenario , the proper procedure is to multiply the probabilities of each individual event .
Thus , for a scenario with three events , each of which will probably ( 70 percent certainty ) occur , the probability of the scenario is .70 x .70 x .70 or slightly over 34 percent .
Adding a fourth probable ( 70 percent ) event to the scenario would reduce its probability to 24 percent .
Most people do not have a good intuitive grasp of probabilistic reasoning .
One approach to simplifying such problems is to assume ( or think as though ) one or more probable events have already occurred .
This eliminates some of the uncertainty from the judgment .
Another way to simplify the problem is to base judgment on a rough average of the probabilities of each event .
In the above example , the averaging procedure gives an estimated probability of 70 percent for the entire scenario .
Thus , the scenario appears far more likely than is in fact the case .
When the averaging strategy is employed , highly probable events in the scenario tend to offset less probable events .
This violates the principle that a chain cannot be stronger than its weakest link .
Mathematically , the least probable event in a scenario sets the upper limit on the probability of the scenario as a whole .
If the averaging strategy is employed , additional details may be added to the scenario that are so plausible they increase the perceived probability of the scenario , while , mathematically , additional events must necessarily reduce its probability .
145
Base - Rate Fallacy
In assessing a situation , an analyst sometimes has two kinds of evidence available -- specific evidence about the individual case at hand , and numerical data that summarize information about many similar cases .
This type of numerical information is called a base rate or prior probability .
The base - rate fallacy is that the numerical data are commonly ignored unless they illuminate a causal relationship .
This is illustrated by the following experiment .
During the Vietnam War , a fighter plane made a non-fatal strafing attack on a US aerial reconnaissance mission at twilight .
Both Cambodian and Vietnamese jets operate in the area .
You know the following facts :
( a) Specific case information : The US pilot identified the fighter as Cambodian .
The pilot 's aircraft recognition capabilities were tested under appropriate visibility and flight conditions .
When presented with a sample of fighters ( half with Vietnamese markings and half with Cambodian ) the pilot made correct identifications 80 percent of the time and erred 20 percent of the time .
( b) Base rate data : 85 percent of the jet fighters in that area are Vietnamese ; 15 percent are Cambodian .
Question :
What is the probability that the fighter was Cambodian rather than Vietnamese ?
A common procedure in answering this question is to reason as follows :
We know the pilot identified the aircraft as Cambodian .
We also know the pilot 's identifications are correct 80 percent of the time ; therefore , there is an 80 percent probability the fighter was Cambodian .
This reasoning appears plausible but is incorrect .
It ignores the base rate -- that 85 percent of the fighters in that area are Vietnamese .
The base rate , or prior probability , is what you can say about any hostile fighter in that area before you learn anything about the specific sighting .
It is actually more likely that the plane was Vietnamese than Cambodian despite the pilot 's " probably correct " identification .
Readers who are unfamiliar with probabilistic reasoning and do not grasp this point should imagine 100 cases in which the pilot has a similar encounter .
Based on paragraph ( a ) , we know that 80 percent or 68 of the 85 Vietnamese aircraft will be correctly identified as Vietnamese , while 20 percent or 17 will be incorrectly identified as Cambodian .
Based on paragraph ( b ) , we know that 85 of these encounters will be with Vietnamese aircraft , 15 with Cambodian .
Similarly , 80 percent or 12 of the 15 Cambodian aircraft will be correctly identified as Cambodian , while 20 percent or three will be incorrectly identified as Vietnamese .
This makes a total of 71 Vietnamese and 29 Cambodian sightings , of which only 12 of the 29 Cambodian sightings are correct ; the other 17 are incorrect sightings of Vietnamese aircraft .
Therefore , when the pilot claims the attack was by a Cambodian fighter , the probability that the craft was actually Cambodian is only 12/29ths or 41 percent , despite the fact that the pilot 's identifications are correct 80 percent of the time .
This may seem like a mathematical trick , but it is not .
The difference stems from the strong prior probability of the pilot observing a Vietnamese aircraft .
The difficulty in understanding this arises because untrained intuitive judgment does not incorporate some of the basic statistical principles of probabilistic reasoning .
Most people do not incorporate the prior probability into their reasoning because it does not seem relevant .
It does not seem relevant because there is no causal relationship between the background information on the percentages of jet fighters in the area and the pilot 's observation .
147
The fact that 85 percent of the fighters in the area were Vietnamese and 15 percent Cambodian did not cause the attack to be made by a Cambodian rather than a Vietnamese .
To appreciate the different impact made by causally relevant background information , consider this alternative formulation of the same problem .
In paragraph ( b ) of the problem , substitute the following :
( b) Although the fighter forces of the two countries are roughly equal in number in this area , 85 percent of all harassment incidents involve Vietnamese fighters , while 15 percent involve Cambodian fighters .
The problem remains mathematically and structurally the same .
Experiments with many test subjects , however , show it is quite different psychologically because it readily elicits a causal explanation relating the prior probabilities to the pilot 's observation .
If the Vietnamese have a propensity to harass and the Cambodians do not , the prior probability that Vietnamese harassment is more likely than Cambodian is no longer ignored .
Linking the prior probability to a cause and effect relationship immediately raises the possibility that the pilot 's observation was in error .
With this revised formulation of the problem , most people are likely to reason as follows :
We know from past experience in cases such as this that the harassment is usually done by Vietnamese aircraft .
Yet , we have a fairly reliable report from our pilot that it was a Cambodian fighter .
These two conflicting pieces of evidence cancel each other out .
Therefore , we do not know -- it is roughly 50 - 50 whether it was Cambodian or Vietnamese .
In employing this reasoning , we use the prior probability information , integrate it with the case - specific information , and arrive at a conclusion that is about as close to the optimal answer ( still 41 percent ) as one is going to get without doing a mathematical calculation .
There are , of course , few problems in which base rates are given as explicitly as in the Vietnamese / Cambodian aircraft example .
When base rates are not well known but must be inferred or researched , they are even less likely to be used .
148
The so - called planning fallacy , to which I personally plead guilty , is an example of a problem in which base rates are not given in numerical terms but must be abstracted from experience .
In planning a research project , I may estimate being able to complete it in four weeks .
This estimate is based on relevant case - specific evidence : desired length of report , availability of source materials , difficulty of the subject matter , allowance for both predictable and unforeseeable interruptions , and so on .
I also possess a body of experience with similar estimates I have made in the past .
Like many others , I almost never complete a research project within the initially estimated time frame !
But I am seduced by the immediacy and persuasiveness of the case - specific evidence .
All the causally relevant evidence about the project indicates I should be able to complete the work in the time allotted for it .
Even though I know from experience that this never happens , I do not learn from this experience .
I continue to ignore the non-causal , probabilistic evidence based on many similar projects in the past , and to estimate completion dates that I hardly ever meet .
( Preparation of this book took twice as long as I had anticipated .
These biases are , indeed , difficult to avoid ! )

Introduction
Indifference to things not under our control ( wealth , health , reputation , and the like ) .
Elimination of the passions or emotions .
These general ideas about the Stoics are partially correct :
The Stoics place things like wealth and health , along with their opposites , poverty , illness , low status , etc. , in the category of indifferent things .
And they consider what they call the emotions ( pathê ) all bad .
Happiness for them is apatheia , which we can translate as " freedom from the emotions . "
It 's not difficult to imagine plausible late 20th - century objections to these notions .
OBJECTION 1 . Stoics say we should be indifferent about life and health .
How , we are tempted to ask , can a good person , who is , say , a parent , be indifferent about the life or health of her child ?
And is n't it a bit extreme , we want to say , not to care about one 's own life or health ?
OBJECTION 2 . Stoics say we should eliminate the emotions .
But psychological counselors today tell us to get in touch with our feelings .
Dr. Bill DeFoore , for example , is author of a recent popular psychology paperback entitled Anger : Deal with It , Heal with it , Stop It from Killing You .
He tells his readers to say to themselves " All of my feelings are OK with me " ( 77 ) .
DeFoore holds that at the core of each of us is an " inner child , " which is either identical to , or " associated with [ , ] the more vulnerable emotions of fear , pain , and the need for love . "
We are supposed to affirm this inner child and to protect it ( DeFoore , 67 )
OBJECTION 3 . Without passion , nothing creative or progressive ever gets done .
People are sometimes described as apathetic by other people who would have liked to see them more concerned about racism , peace , the environment , or other social problems .
If that 's what Stoic apatheia recommends for everyone , well , we do n't need it , we 've got enough .
The Stoics can reply to these objections , but first we have to understand their perspective better .
A good place to start is the Stoic conception of moral development .
Moral Development
The young child naturally wants to preserve itself ; it should learn how , and it normally does .
As we become older , we become aware that we operate in various roles : son or daughter , brother or sister , friend , student , apprentice , etc .
And this goes on into adulthood : we learn what it means to be a citizen , a mayor , a client , a professional , a teacher , a craftsperson , a husband , a wife , a parent , etc .
Corresponding to each of these roles is a set of appropriate actions ( roughly duties ) , and there 's no particular mystery concerning what they are .
Generally speaking , what should be going on at these two stages is the promotion of the " primary things according to nature " -- things like life , health , technical knowledge , possessions , beauty , etc .
A child 's choices for self - preservation and a person 's selection of actions appropriate to his or her roles are all called appropriate actions ( AA's ) .
The child 's AA is to try to stay alive , the doctor 's AA is to assist that process if the child is injured or gets ill ; the apprentice 's AA is to learn technical knowledge , his master 's job is to teach it well .
And so on .
The final stage , which is fully reached only rarely , is the goal which Stoics seek to reach .
The person who has reached it , they say , is living consistently according to nature .
This person , the sophos or wise person , lives virtuously as well as happily .
Such a person is able to observe in practice , not merely in words , the distinctions on the " Stoic Values " chart .
She can distinguish between goods , evils and indifferents , but within the indifferents , she distinguishes between the preferred and rejected indifferents .
From this perspective , only the virtues , actions that express the virtues , and feelings inseparable from virtue are good .
By contrast , and that phrase cannot be overstressed -- by contrast , by comparison , things like life , health , possessions , good reputation , etc. are not good but indifferent .
The term " indifferent " does not imply that we should not care about these things ; only that we should not care about them when they conflict with right living and lead us into temptation or towards evil .
Now , the opposites of these indifferent things , bodily and external conditions like death , disease , poverty , and disgrace are in a similar position ; compared with wickedness or evil , things like acting unjustly , in a cowardly manner , etc. , these bodily and external conditions too are indifferent .
Preferred and Rejected Indifferents
Stoics do not altogether ignore the usual distinctions between life and death , health and disease , possessions and poverty .
They call things like life and wealth " preferred , " things like death and disease " rejected . "
The preferred things are preferred over the rejected ones .
But their value is virtually zero whenever they have to be compared with good things , such as virtuous action .
A person who becomes wise and virtuous will undergo a shift of perspective .
Much of what was once called good or bad will be reinterpreted .
Wealth , for example , is now understood as a " preferred " thing , no longer a good on the same scale with virtue ; in comparison with goodness or virtue , wealth is essentially neutral .
Can we be more specific about virtue ?
It includes character traits like courage , fidelity , fairness , and honesty , plus the mental ability to make wise moral choices .
For the Stoics , virtue is an art that governs selection among the preferred and rejected indifferents .
It is an art of living .
AN EXAMPLE .
Consider a parent 's relationship with her child .
Naturally , the parent would like the child 's good will , but virtue demands that the parent discipline the child when the child does something very wrong .
Now , the " good will " of another person is not really a good , but a preferred thing ; losing the good will of another person , by contrast , is a rejected thing .
If the parent selects the preferred thing on this occasion , retaining the child 's good will in the short run , she will neglect virtue and act in an inferior way .
In this case , acting virtuously means overriding the attraction of the preferred thing .
The wise person chooses virtue over what is merely preferred and will not be torn over the issue .
The key to virtue for the Stoics is its consistency -- courage , wisdom , justice , proper loyalty , proper generosity , proper friendliness -- are all consistent with one another .
And what is just in one circumstance is consistent with what is just in another circumstance .
By contrast , pursuit of preferred things is not always consistent : one person 's pursuit of power or fame or money or erotic pleasure may clash with someone else 's .
The Emotions One 's position on the so - called indifferent things is inseparable from her position on the emotions .
Emotions , say the Stoics , are excessive attachments to preferred things .
When we lust for the pleasures associated with fame , high social status , possessions , money , etc. , we are regarding these things as good .
Yet they are ultimately indifferent .
If we fear losing or not getting these things , we are regarding their opposites -- low social status , poverty , etc. -- as bad or evil .
Yet these too are ultimately indifferent .
Thus fear and lust are wrong because they involve a false belief .
And likewise with distress ( including grief ) and delight .
We feel distress when we get what we fear ( a rejected thing falsely believed evil ) .
We feel delight when we get what we lust for ( a preferred thing falsely believed good ) .
These terms " fear , " " lust , " " distress " and " delight " should not be understood in the ordinary way , but need to be understood in relation to the other Stoic ideas to which you have been introduced .
Just as " energy " in ordinary life means one thing , and in modern physical theory something a bit different , so " lust " in ordinary English is not quite the same thing as " lust " in Stoicism .
You can lust after longevity , possessions , the praise of others , and even health as well as after another human being .
The Stoics say that emotions are excessive impulses disobedient to reason , that emotions are movements in the soul contrary to nature .
( " Disobedient to reason " and " contrary to nature " mean about the same thing ; the term " nature " sometimes means the ideal - -" contrary to nature " here means contrary to reason . )
The Stoics say that emotions are upsets or disorders in the soul .
They are physical events , but they are also mental events .
As a mental event , each emotion involves a compound belief , one part of which is " fresh . "
Here 's an example : Suppose someone whom I know passes me on the street and seems to ignore me .
I might feel hurt or angry over this .
In this case , there is a background belief ( BB ) :
( BB ) So-and so ignored me .
BB is presupposed by this emotion but not part of it .
The emotion itself is composed of two beliefs :
(1) So -and so 's ignoring me was a bad thing .
(2) I ought to be distressed over So - and so 's ignoring me .
Note that for the Stoics ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are both false .
( 1 ) , however , is the main problem since ( 2 ) is largely based on ( 1 ) .
According to the Stoics every belief can be analyzed into two components ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) :
(a) The thought itself , without endorsement .
( b) Assent , endorsement , of the thought .
( 1a ) " So - and - so 's ignoring me appears to be a bad thing . "
( 1 b ) " Yes , it is . "
Answers to Objections
WILL A STOIC PARENT BE INDIFFERENT REGARDING THE LIFE OR HEALTH OF HER CHILD ?
Strictly speaking , and in comparison with virtue , the life or health of every person is indifferent .
But a Stoic parent chooses her acts because they are the right thing to do , and the right thing for a person to do normally coincides with the role - related appropriate action .
The main difference is the spirit in which the action is done -- the non-Stoic does it so as to promote his own or somebody else 's preferred values ; the Stoic does it because it is right to do it .
And doing the right thing is not indifferent at all .
The right thing lies in the striving , not in the external success .
You can only do what is in your power .
If , having strived rightly , you fail to save life or health , you have no reason for grief , which is a kind of distress .
NOW LET US CONSIDER THE OBJECTIONS CONCERNING THE STOIC IDEAL OF FREEDOM FROM THE EMOTIONS .
To some extent , the Stoic term " apatheia " is misleading , even in the ancient Stoics ' own cultural context .
In fact , the Stoic view is that the wise and virtuous person will have some feelings .
The wise person experiences not delight but joy ( at living a wise life ) ; not fear but caution ( which prevents her from agreeing with false appearances ) ; not lust for preferred things but wish ( that one choose well and not badly ) .
So , Stoic happiness is not altogether devoid of feeling .
Another important point is that the Stoics recognize what they call pre-emotions ; these are physical twinges that are sometimes but not always followed by an emotion .
Even a virtuous person may feel a pre-emotion ( say , a twinge of desire ) when he sees an attractive individual of the appropriate gender .
But this is not the emotion of lust ; lust is not present unless the first person endorses the false appearance that having intimate relations with that attractive person would be a good , instead of the preferred thing that it might be .
Earlier I mentioned an apparent conflict between the Stoic view that the emotions are bad and modern therapy .
But when we examine more closely the views of modern therapists , we do not find such a big conflict .
When the therapist whose book I cited ( Dr. Bill DeFoore ) says that anger can be a good thing , it turns out that he is really talking about emotional energy behind anger , which he reasonably claims can be diverted into nondestructive uses .
When psychologists today tell us to affirm our feelings , they do not mean that our emotional selves are just fine the way they are -- people do n't usually end up in psychologists ' offices if they believe that , and psychologists are not going to put themselves out of business .
What they mean is that we should not hide our emotional selves from ourselves ; that it is better to be aware of our present feelings than not to be aware .
But this awareness is also a starting point for change .
None of this is in conflict with what the Stoics say .
Even the goals of contemporary psychological therapy are largely compatible with Stoic practice .
Bill DeFoore says that the emotional energy which fuels rage can be redirected - - towards acquiring skills that enable one to take responsibility for oneself .
Now the Stoics do not have our modern notion of emotional energy , which after all is loosely borrowed from the notion of modern energy that physicists use .
But they had an idea they called impulse , the inner power behind action , and talked about directing this impulse , when it takes the form of desire ( orexis ) , away from preferred things and towards the good .
The results would be similar to what DeFoore has in mind .
If one carries out the mental exercises that DeFoore recommends , he says , an inner peace will emerge .
Vulnerability and anger will be gradually reduced .
The Stoics say that if a person can be successful in eliminating the emotions ( all of which are irrational and violent movements in the soul ) , that person too will enjoy tranquillity .
This is another way of understanding apatheia , the elimination of all the excessive movements of the soul .
Thus , the Stoic ideal is psychological invulnerability .
In fact , with this in mind , the Roman Stoic Seneca will compare the wise person to a god .
By contrast , Dr. DeFoore says that the vulnerable " inner child " never disappears entirely -- the vulnerability never entirely goes away .
Yet of those who professed Stoicism and tried to live it , to the best of their ability , few claimed that they had reached the goal themselves , and many frankly admitted that they had not .
The difference between the Stoics and psychologists like DeFoore seems to be one of emphasis .
The Stoic view , in my opinion , has at least one advantage .
Because the Stoics do n't strictly rule out reaching a stable goal , they spend more time thinking about what it would be like to live that way .
And it does not seem to be a bad idea to have a clear target where one 's own happiness is concerned .

A minority of analysts say oil 's way too high and prices could tumble abruptly -- but will they ?
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) -
With the price of oil hitting records nearly every day , a handful of analysts think the market is starting look awfully bubbly , and that the price could correct quickly .
Thursday brought yet another record in the price of a barrel of crude oil , which fetched about $ 48 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
It was only a couple of weeks ago that analysts were making bold projections of $ 50 oil .
Now there 's talk of it breaking $ 60 .
Oil has skyrocketed some 55 percent in the past year , and a small number of analysts believe that most , if not all , of that gain has been unjustified .
" We continue to believe oil prices will fall hard , " Bear Stearns analyst Frederick Leuffer wrote in a note to clients this week .
" We forecast an average ... oil price of $ 25 per barrel in 2005 . "
Not long ago , that was a consensus forecast .
Now it 's in the distinct minority .
Most analysts now believe higher prices are justified , citing higher - than expected demand for oil in the world , tight supplies , a higher risk of terror attacks and a growing difficulty in sucking a dwindling supply of oil out of the ground .
Leuffer is n't buying it .
In his note , he makes a step - by - step case about why he believes the consensus is wrong .
Yes , global demand is high , he wrote , but it 's being exceeded by supply .
The evidence is in inventories , which continue to grow around the world , including the United States .
The current level of global inventory , about 300 million barrels , is consistent with oil at about $ 25 per barrel , according to Bear Stearns ' research .
" Since January 2004 , the correlation between crude oil prices and inventory levels has broken down , " Leuffer wrote .
Fear about tight production capacity is also unjustified , he wrote .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , which accounts for about 40 percent of the world 's oil output , has some 2.1 million barrels per day of excess production capacity , according to Leuffer 's estimates , on top of the 2.7 million per day it 's already generating in excess of demand .
What 's more , non-OPEC supply is higher than ever , and he thinks oil companies are having an easier time getting oil out of the ground than is widely believed .
Leuffer also said that terror attacks and sabotage likely wo n't cause much of a disruption of the world 's oil supply ; they have n't in the past .
The troubles of Yukos , Russia 's largest oil company , wo n't affect supply because the Russian government wo n't allow it , he said -- Russia needs the cash that Yukos ' oil generates .
A few other analysts agree with his view that the oil market has begun to bear a striking resemblance to the bubbly tech - stock market of the late 1990s .
" Rumors and speculation have taken over the market , " Oppenheimer analyst Fadel Gheit told CNN / Money this week .
Not so sanguine
But most analysts do not .
They agree that there is a hefty " fear premium " built into the price of oil , keeping the price perhaps $ 10 or more higher than where supply and demand would indicate .

Terror attacks and sabotage could cause significant disruption , depending on where they take place , and traders have to get some insurance for that possibility .
" In a perfect world , you 'd take the premium out , and you 're looking at an oil price in the lower - to mid-30s , " said Bruce Lanni , an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons .
" But it is not a perfect world . "
Most analysts are n't as certain as Leuffer is about OPEC 's ability to pump much more oil , or the ease of finding new oil supplies .
Nor do they believe that world inventories are high enough to keep up with skyrocketing demand , particularly in fast - growing markets such as China and India .
" If you take a look at the supply - demand fundamentals in the world , there 's not a lot of excess supply available or much coming on line , " said Jacques Rousseau , an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey .

What is this ?
Oil prices , adjusted for inflation , are n't as high as they were in , say , the late 1970s and early 1980s , when they rose to the equivalent of $ 80 , in today 's dollars , after the Iranian revolution and subsequent Iran - Iraq war .
Partly for that reason , most economists doubt a global recession will result from the recent spike .
But this is a mixed blessing -- the limited damage being done to the world 's biggest economies means demand is not suffering much , OPEC said this week -- which in turn means that oil prices have some support .
Meanwhile , after ratcheting up their capacity to suck more oil out of the ground in the 1970s and 1980s , oil companies have n't kept accelerating their capacity growth in recent years , according to George Gaspar , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co . " I do n't think the industry has the capacity to expand much beyond the rate at which it 's expanding now , " Gaspar said .
" When you match a relatively constrained capacity to expand against the increasing growth rate of demand for crude oil , it sets the potential course for oil to ultimately go beyond $ 50 a barrel . "
Each individual will embark on a unique journey to recovery , but specific similarities may exist before treatment , after treatment , and throughout the continuous effort to stay clean .
Initially , individuals may experience an emotional feeling of reaching “ rock bottom . ”
Making a commitment to overcome his / her addiction by admitting into rehab is the first step to recovery .
Throughout recovery , each individual will need to recognize the existing problems or triggers that led to drug abuse .
Recognizing and learning to fix those problems or resist those triggers will greatly strengthen one ’s character and positively affect one ’s future .
In the early stages after treatment , both mental and physical adaptations will occur in order to begin a life - long recovery without drugs .
Below are six steps that individuals may experience on the road to recovery .
