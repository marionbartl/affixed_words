In the 1971 George Lucas film THX 1138 , there is a scene showing schoolchildren with intravenous drips delivering mind control drugs into their arms .
At the time , almost everyone thought such a dystopian vision of the future would never come true .
Well , unfortunately , now it is beginning to come true .
In some classrooms in the United States , five percent of the six - year - olds are on Ritalin ( methylphenidate hydrochloride ) .
They have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , and thus have been prescribed Ritalin as a medication for the treatment of their behavioral syndrome .
But how can one in twenty children in a classroom have ADHD ?
Forty years ago , very few children were diagnosed with hyperactivity or minimal brain dysfunction ( MBD ) , a disorder which was later renamed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and even fewer were prescribed psychostimulants as a treatment .
Either there has been a sharp rise in this psychological problem , due to environmental , biological , chemical , or social factors , or most of these children are being given a wrong diagnosis .
However , the site of the United States ’ National Institute on Drug Abuse ( www.nida.nih.gov) states : “ It has been estimated that 3 – 7 percent of school - age children have ADHD . ” Barry Turner , a lecturer in medical ethics at Britain ’s Lincoln University , has expressed concern about treating ADHD with drugs .
“ There are undoubtedly large numbers of unruly and disruptive children -- that ’s a child ’s job .
“ The medicalizing of the problem is the issue -- whether these children have a condition that requires medication -- I do n’t believe they do , ” he told the BBC in February 2005 .
He still has the same view .
“ There is no empirical scientific evidence that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder exists and no evidence to support the use of powerful psychostimulant medications in children , some of whom are too young to be able to metabolize these products , ” Turner told the Tehran Times last week .
Methylphenidate is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that was invented in the 1940s and hit the market in the 1950s .
In the 1960s , it was prescribed to treat children with hyperactivity or minimal brain dysfunction , and after that disorder was renamed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , it was prescribed to treat children with ADHD .
It is said that it has a therapeutic effect for children with ADHD because it increases dopamine in the striatum and prefrontal cortex of the brain , but some medical experts believe it works by affecting the action of serotonin in the brain .
Ritalin is a stimulant but it acts like a depressant when given to children .
Some scientists say this is because it stimulates the self - discipline areas of their brains .
In the 1990s , there was a significant rise in the number of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , especially in the United States , methylphenidate became the medication most commonly prescribed to treat ADHD , and consequently production and prescription of methylphenidate rose dramatically .
Ritalin can cause psychosis , mood swings , anorexia , depression , anxiety , irritability , headaches , and insomnia .
It can also cause severe depression upon withdrawal .
The site of the U.S. National Library of Medicine ( www.nlm.nih.gov) states : “ Methylphenidate may cause sudden death in children and teenagers with heart defects or serious heart problems . ” “ Methylphenidate may slow children ’s growth or weight gain .
” In addition , it has been reported that Ritalin shrinks the brain .
Studies show that the posterior inferior vermis , which is the small part of the cerebellum , is smaller by about 12 percent and the caudate is about 6 percent smaller in children who are using methylphenidate .
However , some experts believe it is a preexisting condition .
They say these sections of the brains of children with ADHD are naturally smaller before they start taking methylphenidate .
It has also been said that Ritalin demotivates children and puts their minds in a hypnotic trance state , which makes them highly susceptible to mind control techniques .
Of course , some children may really have ADHD -- if such a disorder exists -- and perhaps Ritalin is the best drug to prescribe for their treatment .
But what is happening to the children who have been given a wrong diagnosis ?
Well , they are being sedated unnecessarily and this will definitely have an adverse effect on their intellectual development .
When they become young adults in their late teens , many of these youth are diagnosed with severe depression or bipolar disorder and prescribed the antidepressant Prozac ( fluoxetine hydrochloride ) .
So they graduate from Ritalin to Prozac .
Of course , some people may really have bipolar disorder -- if such a disorder exists -- and perhaps Prozac is the best drug to prescribe for their treatment , but again , what about the people who have been given a wrong diagnosis ?
In August 2004 , the BBC , The Observer , and other major news outlets reported that Britain ’s Environment Agency had discovered that Prozac was accumulating in rivers and groundwater used for drinking supplies .
Shortly afterwards , the Environment Agency announced that it had never issued such a report and said that Britain ’s drinking water supplies were safe and contained no Prozac .
There are also reports that trace amounts of Ritalin and Prozac have been found in the water supplies of cities in the United States because the sewage treatment plants are not equipped to filter out these psychoactive drugs .
One report ( http://lists.dep.state.fl.us/pipermail/pharmwaste /2006 -September/000618.html ) states that scientists “ have documented that Las Vegas ’ treated sewage plant discharges carry traces of codeine , Prozac , Valium , common antibiotics , insect repellents and a host of chemicals termed endocrine disruptors into the Lake Mead reservoir .
” In 2002 , the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a study ( http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20040810/pro zac - in-drinking-water-likely-so) which reported : “ Pharmaceuticals , hormones , and other organic wastewater - related chemicals have been detected at very low concentrations in streams across the U.S. ” “ Among the chemicals detected were : human and veterinary drugs ( including antibiotics ) , natural and synthetic hormones , detergents , plasticizers , insecticides , and fire retardants .
” In view of all this , it could be said that the United States is becoming a totally sedated Ritalin Nation and a Prozac Nation .
As a result , U.S. citizens are becoming complacent automatons who are highly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion and brainwashing .
They are being turned into obedient sheeple in a form of modern - day slavery , mental slavery .
Children naturally have a lot of energy .
If a child is a little bit hyperactive or has some trouble focusing , it does n’t mean he or she has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
The situation has reached crisis proportions in the United States , and some countries in Europe are also beginning to prescribe Ritalin to large numbers of children .
And many of these children will also graduate to Prozac when they grow up .
Are Ritalin and Prozac being used as mind control drugs ?
Many people would say no .
But many people would also say yes , citing the fact that so many people are being unnecessarily prescribed these drugs .
It is clear that this issue requires further examination because far too many people are on these drugs .
Children should never be given drugs they do n’t need which affect their minds .
Will we all become zombies hooked on psychotropic drugs ?
Yes , definitely , if we do nothing .
Clearly , something must be done before this dystopian vision of the future comes true and there is no turning back .
Touchdown at Technical Museum Russian Space Shuttle Navigates Rhine River
A Soviet spacecraft is making an unusual journey down the Rhine River this week .
The historic Buran vehicle is on its way from the shipyards in Rotterdam to its new home at a technical museum in Speyer , Germany .
Pre-twentieth century music all exists in the public domain , but that does n't mean it 's easy to get access either to recordings or sheet music .
Want to include a Beethoven sonata as background music in your wedding video , documentary , or indie feature film ?
You 'll need to pay unless you can dig up an ancient recorded copy from the early 1900s ( and can live with the sound quality ) .
Want to pass out sheet music of that same sonata to your high school band ?
Again , you will need to pay unless you can track down an ancient , out - of - copyright score .
One web site has the ambitious goal of doing away with such restrictions , putting both classical recordings and sheet music into the public domain for use by anyone in the world .
Musopen has been around for a couple of years but has recently rolled out a new version of its web site , added freely - downloadable sheet music , and raised enough cash to professionally record the entire set of 32 Beethoven piano sonatas and place them in the public domain .
One of the site 's innovative features is its bidding system , in which users can pledge contributions toward specific pieces .
When the necessary amount is raised , a professional musician is hired to perform , say , Bach 's Goldberg Variations ( currently the top request ) .
Most of the money used to fund the Beethoven Sonatas was also raised from users in small increments , with a $ 5 average contribution .
While individuals can spend that same money purchasing their own copies of such works , a donation to Musopen helps fund a musical commons that makes the pieces available worldwide and for any application .
Aaron Dunn , who started the project while in college , tells
Ars that big projects are in the works for the site , including deals with the Internet Archive and the OLPC project .
The bidding system
The sheet music appears to be dug up from old books and then scanned .
It 's embedded in the site thanks to Scribd 's iPaper functionality , and Musopen even thoughtfully provides a way to play a track and view the score on the same page in order to follow along .
The site also plans to sell printed copies of scores at cost .
The site is still a developing resource , offering only about 100 pieces at the moment , but the implications of its future success would be tremendous .
While most music from the last hundred years remains locked up under copyright , projects like Musopen promise to provide access to the huge body of musical work that predates the 1920s .
This is n't likely to do much for true classical music buffs , who will seek out and pay for the best recordings by the best artists , but the versions available at the site generally seem to be of good quality and are well suited for education and film scores , as well as private practice and performance .
Like Wikipedia , the site hopes to tap its user base to create a powerful communal resource that makes cultural knowledge and expression available to anyone without restriction .
In addition to cash donations , the site also welcomes the donation of scores and public domain recordings .
If you 're a musician or conductor with a passion for musical education , you could certainly do worse than to contribute pieces to a resource like Musopen .

Compassion often eludes feral cats ; groups out to save them
Feral cats — nearly invisible and often reviled — have prowled into the spotlight .
The free - roamers with an aversion to humans have grabbed headlines this spring because of a bounty on their heads in Iowa , a threatened roundup and disposal in Fairfax County , Va. , and other elimination plans across the country .
But the cats also are receiving attention of a different sort .
Grass - roots groups and animal - welfare organizations are directing money and energy toward helping the tens of millions of feral cats that skulk about college campuses , cluster around back - alley trash bins , swarm among the rocks at beach communities and colonize the nether - reaches of suburban parks , military installations and abandoned barns and fields :
• PetSmart Charities will announce in July a $ 13 million spay - neuter program in Los Angeles .
A clinic in Burbank , which Best Friends Animal Society in Utah also is helping fund , will sterilize 20,000 feral cats a year .
PetSmart Charities has committed $ 862,000 to feral cat programs in Austin and Dallas as part of a $ 5.5 million five - year grant to Texas cities .
• The Humane Society of the United States has just completed a CD / DVD .
Effectively Managing Feral Cats will be free to 6,000 shelters , communities and feral - cat advocates through a PETCO Foundation grant .
The Humane Society also holds workshops and has given thousands of dollars to a few small groups launching initiatives to protect feral cats .
• Alley Cat Allies , which advises individuals and groups on feral - colony management , is embarking on major research to collect data about ferals and the people who help them .
The non -profit group also will launch a year - long educational campaign beginning Oct. 16 , National Feral Cat Day , and will push for public disclosure on how many feral cats shelters take in and euthanize to " make more transparent " every community 's " animal - control practices applied to feral cats , which most often rely on lethal control methods , " president Becky Robinson says .
• No More Homeless Pets in Utah runs a sterilization program and works with city , county and animal control officials to develop alternatives to trapping nuisance homeless cats and depositing them at shelters — " a practice which almost guarantees euthanasia , " says the group 's Gregory Castle .
A decrease in the number of cats in colonies and concurrent lower euthanasia rates have been " dramatic " in some locations , he says .
All major efforts involve trapping , neutering and returning the cats to their colonies .
This method thwarts future litters and reduces the yowling , spraying and fighting that annoy humans .
In the process , the cats usually are vaccinated , treated for minor problems and given a notch in the ear to identify they are sterile .
Over time , the colony will grow smaller through attrition .
" TNR is not only the most humane , it is the most practical way of stabilizing the populations and … reducing them , " Castle says .
" Some New York neighborhoods no longer have feral colonies , or the colonies are much smaller , " says the ASPCA 's Aimee Hartmann , which holds workshops throughout the city , performs hundreds of sterilizations and loans traps to groups employing the method .
Scores of other groups participating in the practice report similar results .
Opponents speak out
The TNR method is not without detractors .
Many veterinarians refuse to do such sterilizations because they say cats should n't live outdoors because they become victims of the elements , predators and vehicles .
And some bird and conservation groups say feral cats can decimate bird and small - mammal populations and spread disease .
Advocates counter that ferals exist because house pets were set loose or escaped , they adapted to survive , had litters , and now , a generation or more removed from being house cats , they can't be tamed .
And refusing to deal with that reality leads to more litters and more cats killed once they become public nuisances , are captured , taken to shelters and euthanized because no one will adopt them , advocates say .
Moreover , most ferals do n't live short , hideously deprived lives but are quite healthy and less apt to harm wildlife than toxins and development that overtakes habitats , says Julie Levy of the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine , an expert in infectious disease and feral cats .
When neutered and vaccinated , such animals live many years .
A right to roam free
" For a long time , the prevailing feeling was that these animals are n't deserving of help , " Robinson says .
But attitudes are changing .
" There are people who have been taking care of these colonies for years , getting up before dawn , leaving food and water . "
Once regarded as odd , they 're increasingly regarded as " unsung heroes . "
Today , a live - and - let - live attitude is taking root , she says .
A 2007 Harris survey found that 81 % believe feral cats should be allowed to live out their lives roaming free .
Still , many people have never seen a feral colony and are unaware of their numbers , which , combined with strays , could be as high as 80 million , Levy says , so these animals occupy a lower rung on the public 's concern - about - creatures hierarchy .
Advocates insist the separate - and - unequal distinction is specious .
" A good proportion of these free - roaming cats were once owned , or they are one generation removed from house pets , " says Susana Della Maddalena of PetSmart Charities .
" We do n't think it 's fair to exclude them from help . "

Quantum Mechanics
by Richard P. Feynman
Electrons , when they were first discovered , behaved exactly like particles or bullets , very simply .
Further research showed , from electron diffraction experiments for example , that they behaved like waves .
As time went on there was a growing confusion about how these things really behaved ---- waves or particles , particles or waves ?
Everything looked like both .
This growing confusion was resolved in 1925 or 1926 with the advent of the correct equations for quantum mechanics .
Now we know how the electrons and light behave .
But what can I call it ?
If I say they behave like particles I give the wrong impression ; also if I say they behave like waves .
They behave in their own inimitable way , which technically could be called a quantum mechanical way .
They behave in a way that is like nothing that you have seen before .
Your experience with things that you have seen before is incomplete .
The behavior of things on a very tiny scale is simply different .
An atom does not behave like a weight hanging on a spring and oscillating .
Nor does it behave like a miniature representation of the solar system with little planets going around in orbits .
Nor does it appear to be somewhat like a cloud or fog of some sort surrounding the nucleus .
It behaves like nothing you have seen before .
There is one simplication at least .
Electrons behave in this respect in exactly the same way as photons ; they are both screwy , but in exactly in the same way .
The difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself , " But how can it be like that ? " which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar .
I will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar ; I will simply describe it .
There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity .
I do not believe there ever was such a time .
There might have been a time when only one man did , because he was the only guy who caught on , before he wrote his paper .
But after people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other , certainly more than twelve .
On the other hand , I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics .
So do not take the lecture too seriously , feeling that you really have to understand in terms of some model what I am going to describe , but just relax and enjoy it .
I am going to tell you what nature behaves like .
If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this , you will find her a delightful , entrancing thing .
Do not keep saying to yourself , if you can possible avoid it , " But how can it be like that ? " because you will get ' down the drain ' , into a blind alley from which nobody has escaped .
Nobody knows how it can be like that .

Wall Street is bracing itself for another week of roller - coaster trading after more than $ 300 bn ( £ 150bn ) was wiped off the US equity markets on Friday following the emergency funding package put together by the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase to rescue Bear Stearns .
One UK economist warned that the world is now close to a 1930s - like Great Depression , while New York traders said they had never experienced such fear .
The Fed 's emergency funding procedure was first used in the Depression and has rarely been used since .
A Goldman Sachs trader in New York said : " Everyone is in a total state of shock , aghast at what is happening .
No one wants to talk , let alone deal ; we 're just standing by waiting .
Everyone is nervous about what is going to emerge when trading starts tomorrow . "

In the UK , Michael Taylor , a senior market strategist at Lombard , the economics consultancy , said on Friday night : " We have all been talking about a 1970s - style crisis but as each day goes by this looks more like the 1930s .
No one has any clue as to where this is going to end ; it 's a self - feeding disaster . "
Mr Taylor , who had been relatively optimistic , has turned bearish : " It really does look as though the UK is now heading for a recession .
The credit - crunch means that even if the Bank of England cuts rates again , the banks are in such a bad way they are unlikely to pass cuts on . "
Mr Taylor added that he expects a sharp downturn in the real UK economy as the public and companies stop borrowing .
" We have never seen anything like this before .
This is new territory for us .
Liquidity is being pumped into the system but the banks are not taking any notice .
This is all about confidence .
The more the central banks do , the more the banks seem to ignore what 's going on . "
Mr Taylor added that the problems unravelling at Bear Stearns are just the beginning : " There will be more banks and hedge funds heading for collapse . "
One of the problems facing the markets is that , despite the Fed 's move last week to feed them another $ 200bn , the banks are still not lending to each other .
" This crisis is one of faith .
We are going to see even more problems in the hedge funds as they face margin calls , " said Mark O'Sullivan , director of dealing at Currencies Direct in London .
" What we are waiting for now is for the Fed to cut interest rates again this week .
But that 's already been discounted by the market and is unlikely to help restore confidence . "
Mr O'Sullivan added that the dollar 's free - fall is set to continue and may need cuts in European interest rates to trim the euro 's recent strength against the dollar .
" But the ECB does n't like cutting rates , " he said .
On Europe , Mr Taylor said that while the German economy remains strong , others such as Italy 's and Spain 's are weakening .
" You could see a scenario where the eurozone breaks up if economies continue to be so worried about inflation . "
European financial markets were relatively unscathed by Wall Street 's crisis but traders expect there to be a backlash when stock markets open tomorrow .
The Fed 's plan will give 28 days of secured funding to Bear Stearns , which saw its value slashed over the week by more than a half to $ 3.7 bn .
JP Morgan will provide the funding , but the Fed will bear the risk if the loan is not repaid .
Fed chairman , Ben Bernanke , who pumped $ 200bn of loans to cash - strapped institutions last week , said more would be available to help others in distress .
When the kitchen sink is n’t enough , do negative ads .
That ’s the Clinton campaign ’s Pennsylvania strategy based on what Greg Sargent ’s hearing :
In most of Pennsylvania ’s markets , the only TV ad Hillary is running right now is a negative one — the spot hitting Obama over his “ small town ” comments , a political ad buyer who tracks buys in Pennsylvania tells me .
The buyer says that as of this morning , that ad — and no positive spots — are running in the Pittsburgh , Erie , Johnstown / Altoona , and Wilkes - Barre / Scranton markets .
This should make all the Clinton staffers , consultants and supporters very , very proud .
They ca n’t win the nomination , but they are willing to participate in the effort to destroy the Democratic nominee .
Thirty - five years of public service and experience , yet all she can come up with is an ad twisting Obama ’s remarks , which are remarkably similar to things her own husband said .
Wow .
It ’s not only destructive , it ’s sad and pathetic .
And , again , it must make all those Clinton staffers so proud .
So proud .
This madness has to end .
In late March 1988 three economists from the University of Iowa were nursing beers at a local hangout in Iowa City , when conversation turned to the news of the day .
Jesse Jackson had captured 55 percent of the votes in the Michigan Democratic caucuses , an outcome that the polls had failed to intimate .
The ensuing grumbling about the unreliability of polls sparked the germ of an idea .
At the time , experimental economics — in which economic theory is tested by observing the behavior of groups , usually in a classroom setting — had just come into vogue , which prompted the three drinking partners to deliberate about whether a market might do better than the polls .

Earth hums while making ' Love ' waves
A subtle and mysterious global hum has been detected by seismologists studying records from earth 's most boring seismic stations .
The newfound vibration is made of two - minute to five - minute , side - to - side surface seismic waves , called Love waves .
They are named after the UK mathematician Professor Augustus Edward Hough Love , who created the mathematical model of such waves in 1911 .
The discovery comes 10 years after seismologists first identified louder global oscillations that resemble the ringing of a gigantic bell .
All of the planet 's natural oscillations have signatures , or modes of vibration , depending on where and how they are created by earthquakes , ocean waves or other forces .
Among the suspects for making the Love wave hum are winds , ocean waves or even the sun .
The Love wave is a mode that essentially torques the earth 's north and south hemispheres against each other .
It 's as if the planet is dancing the twist , says Dr Rudolf Widmer - Schnidrig of the Black Forest Observatory in Wolfach , Germany , and the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Stuttgart .
This gentle , faint twisting is called the toroidal mode .
" Standing on the surface of the earth , you would only experience a horizontal motion left - right - left , " if you were sensitive enough to feel it , Widmer - Schnidrig says .
" To picture this you imagine holding a metal or maybe rubber rod in your hands .
Now twist the two ends of the rod in opposite sense and let go .
" The two halves of the rod will perform small oscillatory twisting motions in opposite directions .
That 's what the two hemispheres of the earth would also do . "
Widmer - Schnidrig and Dieter Kurrle report their discovery in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
Raucous earth
This newfound mode is entirely different from the rowdy spheroidal mode , which is a far more powerful oscillation that warps the shape of the planet like waves on a water surface .
" At the surface you would experience an up - down motion together with a forward - backward motion , " says Widmer - Schnidrig of the spheroidal mode , " something to get seasick about . "
" You can simply picture a pumpkin and an American football , " he says .
" Let a sphere [ the earth at rest ] deform itself into a pumpkin , then a sphere , then an American football , then a sphere , then a pumpkin ... and you have the fundamental spheroidal mode of the earth . "
The most dramatic spheroidal mode vibration detected by science to date was near the Galapagos Islands soon after the Great Sumatra - Andaman Earthquake of 26 December 2004 .
The Galapagos are almost exactly on the opposite side of the earth from the site of the 9.3 magnitude rupture , and the earth pulsed there with such power that the surface moved up and down with the vibration about 2 centimetres every few seconds , says seismologist Professor Rick Aster of New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology .
Horizontal waves too
Interestingly , that same mega-quake also produced some horizontal waves , says seismologist Professor Jeffrey Park of Yale University .
" We were pretty interested in those modes because they were not what we expected , " Park says .
Even the subsequent tsunamis were heard making landfall by seismometers in islands around the Indian Ocean , he says .
The waves actually tilted the islands a tiny bit , which was detected .
" It 's pretty neat . "
All this is what happens when you have a large , loud rupture setting things off , like striking a bell with a 9 kilogram sledge hammer .
It 's noisy and messy when the seismic waves are sped up and played as audio , says Aster .
" It kind of sounds like hitting a trash can , " he says .
Mystery of the 10 light bulbs
Far , far away from that global cacophony , at the extreme other end of the power scale , is the newfound toroidal Love wave hum , Widmer - Schnidrig explains .
This mode moves the earth 's surface a mere millionth of a metre every 5 minutes and dissipates less than 500 watts of energy .
" In other words , with the power needed by 10 light bulbs you could keep up the hum worldwide , " says Widmer - Schnidrig .
" This is unbelievable , I know .
But maybe it lets you appreciate the minuscule amplitude of this oscillation . "
It also explains why it has taken 10 years after the detection of earth 's roaring spheroidal ring to capture earth 's whispering twist , he says .
The trick to the discovery was locating four extremely quiet seismic stations and then merging the data from their most quiet periods to tease out the tiny signal .
The stations are the German Black Forest Observatory , Baijiatuan in China , and the Japanese Matsushiro and Takato stations .
" It was only by finding the horizontal hum in the data of stations far from our own which enabled us to conclusively demonstrate that the observed signal is a global phenomenon and not just a local artefact , " says Widmer - Schnidrig .
Making Love waves
As for what creates the 500 watt undulations , that 's a bit of a mystery .
" Perhaps winds exert shearing forces on the solid earth ... when an air mass hits a mountain range , for instance , or perhaps long - period ocean waves hitting the undersea walls at continental shelves are generating horizontal forces , " says geophysicist Professor Toshiro Tanimoto of the University of California , Santa Barbara in a recent commentary in the journal Nature .
It could even be caused by the sun , says Park .
Oscillations in the sun may be picked up by earth 's geomagnetic field and cause earth to hum a solar tune .
Finding the source will take work , Widmer - Schnidrig says .
The first step is to find the Love wave signals at other stations , which might help point researchers in the direction of the source .
New theories are also needed to explain precisely how wind , water or the sun can produce the Love wave hum .

Mr. Obama , on his first trip to Oregon before the state ’s primary on May 20 , did not address the comments from Mr. Clinton .
He stood a few feet away from the retired general as he made his remarks before a crowd of more than 1,500 people in a Medford community center .
“ I ’m saddened to see a president employ this kind of tactics , ” said General McPeak , who served as Air Force chief of staff in the early years of the Clinton administration .
“ He of all people should know better because he was the target of exactly the same kind of tactic when he first ran 16 years ago . ”
Howard Wolfson , a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton , on Saturday called the retired general ’s comments a “ deliberately pathetic misreading of what the president said . ”
Wolfson said the remarks had nothing to do with Obama and were merely meant to underscore the need to keep the presidential race focused on issues .
“ I think it would be a great thing if we had an election year where you had two people who loved this country and were devoted to the interest of this country , ” Mr. Clinton told the group in Charlotte , N.C. , according to a report by NBC News .
“ And people could actually ask themselves who is right on these issues , instead of all this other stuff that always seems to intrude itself on our politics . ”
In response to reporters in Oregon on Friday , General McPeak compared Mr. Clinton to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , who aggressively pursued those he believed to be communists in the 1950s .
“ I was going to college when Joe McCarthy was accusing good Americans of being traitors , so I ’ve had enough of it , ” General McPeak said .
The stupid , it burns !
The telephone call that spelled the end of Jim Piculas ’ career as a substitute teacher in Pasco came on a January day about a week after he performed the disappearing - toothpick trick for a group of rapt middle school students .
Pat Sinclair , who oversees substitute teachers in the Pasco County School District , was on the phone .
She told Piculas there had been a complaint about his performance at Rushe Middle School in Land O’ Lakes .
He asked what she meant .
“ She said , ‘ You ’ve been accused of wizardry , ’ ” Piculas said .
He said the statement seemed bizarre to him , like something out of Harry Potter .
Piculas said he replied , “ I have no idea what you ’re talking about . ”
He said he also told Sinclair , “ It ’s not black magic .
It ’s a toothpick . ”

I occasionally write longer articles whenever I feel there is anything important I want to write about .
Thanks , and on to the Sonic 2 HD goodness -
This right here is why bedroom development is such a good thing .
A while back , there was an artists impression of what an HD remake of the Mega Drive classic Sonic 2 would look like doing the rounds , you may have seen it -
Hot , no ?
Well , a bunch of highly talented people from the ' sonic community ' have decided that they want to make this artists impression a reality .
The team consists of TheSonicRetard ( author of the NeedleMouse Engine , and responsible for the graphics engine of Sonic 2 HD ) , Tweaker ( the creator of Sonic Megamix ) , BlazeHedgehog and Cinossu ( who have already put together the remixed soundtrack ) , Jman2050 , the lead game engine programmer and Vincent who is contributing a lot of the art .
Work so far is in early stages , but still looking incredible so far .
This will be using TheSonicRetard 's NeedleMouse engine .
The engine is going to be using a colour palette system with 256 simultaneous colours on screen at once , and all the spites are going to be based on the original games colours , but with four levels of lighting .
No plans for how it 's going to be distributed as of yet , they are n't looking that far ahead .
They really are just doing it out of love for the game .
Sega have a history for looking at fan - made projects like this and hiring teams based on it .
Really , this type of thing would sell bucketloads on the various digital distribution platforms , it would be crazy to not give these guys jobs in this humble bloggers opinion .
The end goal is to remake the entire game , and with the passion and talent shown so far , I can not wait to see the end result .
Head to SonicRetro forums for more .
Here 's a bunch more WIP art -

A controversial new " right to die " card is being offered to the public that allows anyone to refuse treatment in a medical emergency .
Who carries it , and why ?
It 's a morbid question , but one that many of us have pondered at least once .
The card that can say ' no '
If I had n't just escaped that dreadful accident , where would I be now ?
Would I rather be dead than depend on others to keep me alive ?
A new card seeks to address that very question .
Available in pubs , banks , libraries , GP surgeries , even some churches , the Advanced Decision to Refuse Treatment ( ADRT ) card sits snugly in a wallet or purse and tells doctors their patient has made a decision about treatment they do not want should they lose the capacity to make decisions , because of an accident or illness .
Dubbed the " right - to - die card " , it 's being seen by some as a short - cut to euthanasia .
But its backers say it is a practical way of implementing the Mental Capacity Act , which came into force in 2007 .
The act allows adults to draw up " advance decisions " stating what sort of treatment they do n't want should they lose capacity .
They build on the principle of " living wills " but , crucially , mean that doctors are legally bound to abide by a patient 's wish to refuse life - sustaining treatment .
Taken in haste Carrying the card alerts anyone who finds it that the patient has made decisions about treatment , and there is a detailed statement to be found with named relatives or friends and , ideally , their GP .
I 'm terrified of the prospect of having a terminal illness or accident that left me medically alive but not able to live my life
Jo Cartwright , 23 Salford City Council , which is behind the card , says it is merely putting the information out there in public places , for people to make their own choice .
It stresses advance decisions are not only about death but can also include preferences about treatment and care patients do want .
But so - called pro-life campaigners say they could be snapped up in haste by people who have n't fully understood the complexity of the issues involved .
Given the ferocity of the debate between the pro-choice and pro-life movements , it is somewhat surprising to hear that Salford 's card scheme was dreamed up by just one person .
The woman - who has asked not to be named - is involved with social care services in Salford because she has a son with mental health problems .
" She was thinking of the idea of advance decisions both as a retired woman , and as a carer , and thought this would be useful , " says Judd Skelton , a Salford council officer who looks after user and carer issues .
However , pro-life campaigners such as Dr Andrew Fergusson , from the Christian Medical Fellowship , say such important decisions should not be committed to paper in this way .
Agreeing that patients should have more autonomy than in previous generations , Dr Fergusson wants people to appoint a proxy to speak for them if they become incapacitated .
" One of our concerns is that the things people want when they are well are very different to those they want when they are unwell .
Their values change , " he says .
Slow down treatment
The former GP and hospital doctor , whose organisation is also part of the Care Not Killing alliance , says advance decisions may be forcing medics to work " with one hand tied behind their backs " - although the legislation does leave room to challenge the patient 's statement .
And he is worried that a card saying " stop " to a doctor could lead to a " change of gear " in emergency situations that would affect decision - making .
The Salford cards certainly seem to be stirring passions locally .
Reports that they have been snapped up enthusiastically by locals appear to be partly countered by the comments of one person contributing to a local newspaper messageboard .
" I 'm appalled by these cards , " it reads , " and I removed as many as I could from Swinton Library yesterday . "
But such cards are not entirely new .
While Salford believes it is the first council to offer them , the " pro-choice " group Dignity in Dying provides a similar card for people who buy their advance decision documents from it .
One carrier is 23 - year - old Jo Cartwright , who says she started thinking seriously about her rights some years ago , while working as a nursing assistant .
Having watched a young woman go through a slow and painful death from Huntington 's disease and cancer , she knew she would never want a similar experience .
" She had seen her father go through it and knew what was coming , " says Ms Cartwright .
" She said she did n't want to die like he had .
But she had n't written anything down and her mother and carers had to watch her go through exactly the same thing .
It made me think about my options and my rights .
Would I be able to make decisions if I knew what might be coming ? "
She worked for a spell with Dying in Dignity and last year wrote an advanced directive .
' I 'm terrified '
Any medic who finds it while she is incapacitated will know that if there is little prospect of a full recovery , Ms Cartwright does not want medication that will prolong her life .
" I do n't want to be kept alive and I think that is my choice . "
Despite her youth , for Ms Cartwright there is already a real chance she could face a medical emergency .
Last year she was rushed to hospital with pancreatitis - acute attacks of which are fatal in about a quarter of cases - and it could happen again .
Living with the chronic disease has impaired her life , although she insists she would have made an advance statement whether or not she had developed an illness .
" I 'm terrified of the prospect of having a terminal illness or accident that left me medically alive but not able to live my life independently , to a quality I find acceptable . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
Having watched my mother dying from self - imposed starvation because euthanasia could not be offered , I think that simply withholding treatment and sustenance is an utterly cruel way to end a person 's life .
The family all knew ( she had told us often enough ) that she did not want to continue if incapacitated , but she had not written it down .
I found it incomprehensible that it was OK to starve her to death over a period of six weeks , but not OK to use morphine .
It seemed like an absolute abandonment of care , and traumatising for her husband and family .
It is hard to remember her as the bright person she was , instead of the gaunt and unrecognisable skeleton she became .
JC , Margate , UK I would n't carry a card with such a simple message on it because life is not usually that black and white .
I agree with the idea of appointing a proxy to be able to make decisions , plus back it up with something in writing .
I have discussed it with my family and we are all in general agreement that we 'd probably wait a week to make sure and then pull the switch .
Dave , Cambridge , UK Brilliant idea , and saves me having ' do not resuscitate ' tattooed to my ankle .
If I was in an accident that left me in a vegetative state , I do not wish to be a burden to anyone due to nostalgia of the person I was .
Matthew Brooks , Bristol Fantastic idea - are any other groups offering these cards ?
I worked in a nursing home and I know I do n't want to die like that .
Why should I be forced to live and die in appalling pain for the one - in - a- million ( or lower ) chance of survival ?
Phil B , Lytham , UK
It does n't matter if you agree or disagree , you have to be thankful you have the right to make a choice ... let 's hope the national government takes notice .
Richard , London
" It 's a morbid question , but one that many of us have pondered at least once . "
The opening line alone shows how out of touch with reality our society is about death .
It 's " morbid " to think about it ?
It 's actually very healthy to think about death and plan for it .
Once again pro-lifers need to enforce their beliefs on others in an attempt to assuage their own fear .
Rob Thompson , Toronto
The real danger here is that these cards could easily become a youth fashion statement .
Particularly in various subcultures such as goth , emo etc , death is very much a subject in vogue .
It is seen as dramatic and even romantic to allude to death in conversation or expression .
Black Right - To - Die cards with flames and bat wings , anyone ?
Luke , Aberdeen
So if I run one of these card carriers over in my car , who could have been saved had they received treatment , and they die , do I go down for manslaughter ?
Benji Poulton , Bangor I do n't think a card can hold enough information to cover all the possibilities .
There are some situations that I would find difficult to cope with and others I may not .
It may be better to have a card that informs the doctor that you have a living will and who to contact to get it .
The Will could contain much more detail and could even be stored in your medical records held by your GP .
Chris , Romford I am a qualified nurse and have nursed hundreds if not thousands of people who are on life support - why ?!
It 's not because they have any quality of life but because the family can't let go .
I would definitely carry a card , even though I also have a living will .
It is similar to a donor card .
Just because you carry one does n't mean your family can't object , it 's not legally binding as far as I am aware .
Liz , Suffolk
My mum was on the Do Not Resuscitate list - something which I was not aware of at the time , but looking back I 'm pleased she made the decision for me .
It 's as much a decision to die as to allow those who care about you the most not to have to watch you suffer anymore .
Jen , Newcastle I am a doctor specialising in accident and emergency medicine and I have no intention of following any such instructions .
I will continue to strive to save the lives of all my patients so long as I feel that there is a reasonable chance of recovery .
That decision will be made on clinical grounds and I will not be influenced by any " right to die " card .
It is my right to treat my patients as I see fit in accordance with Hippocratic principles , and the GMC would have to strike me off the Medical Register to stop me following my conscience in these matters .
Andrew , Suffolk , UK Andrew in Suffolk :
You obviously have no respect for other people and their values but think your opinions and value system trump everyone else 's .
If you are not willing to abide by a patient 's wishes regarding their own treatment then you should be struck off .
This is a case of an individual 's right to live their own life .
You are saying you know better and will run it for them .
We patients are not your children Andrew .
Nigel Mawhinney , Belfast , UK Andrew the hospital doctor from Suffolk obviously believes like a lot of his profession that he is God .
Well I am a doctor as well Andrew and I believe in respecting my patient 's wishes .
Mortality is still 100 % I am afraid and to make death an unpleasant and painful experience because of the " ethics " of the doctor 's weird values is cruel and crazy .
Rick , Exeter , UK Andrew , Suffolk : " It is my right to treat my patients as I see fit . "
Excuse me , your right ?
How is it your right to do whatever you want to others but not their right to do what they want to themselves ?
Does this mean a hairdresser has the right to approach someone in the street and cut their hair if they do n't like it even when that person has n't asked ?
And perhaps a dentist has the right to force braces on someone if he dislikes the alignment of their teeth .
What exactly gives your rights as a doctor priority over the person who actually owns that body ?!
Alexandra Sjoberg - Weekes , Nottingham , UK Hopefully I would be treated by someone like Andrew or W B if the worst should ever happen , God forbid .
I take the opinion of a medical professional who has a level of ethical training and has taken a Hippocratic style oath , rather than a lay - person with their wishy - washy subjectiveness .
Optimist , Southampton
Having worked in many intensive care units , I have often seen fruitless treatment being carried out only because no one knew what a given patient wanted .
I certainly would not want to be in such a position and would welcome the use of advance directives .
Prasanna , London , UK
What 's to stop some scheming relative ' slipping ' one of these cards into their elderly parent 's wallet ?
Emma , Wolverhampton
I have seen both my parents die within the last year from diseases from ageing , I have thought long and hard about this issue and do feel very strongly that , if my quality of life were impaired to the extent that I was just existing , then the right to ask someone close to me to , while not assisting my demise should , knowing my wishes pass them on to the powers that be , so ensuring that I die with dignity .
Ian Ross , Aberdeen , Scotland My cousin had a car accident .
We thought he would die .
He was left paralysed from the neck down .
Terrible future ...
Three years down the line he is married to very nice girl and they are living in Amsterdam .
Who knows ??
Celina , Argentina
My grandfather turns 94 tomorrow , but his life is a sad shell of what it was .
He nearly died six years ago , and the decision taken by his nearest and dearest to keep him alive might not have been the best one .
It 's a tragedy that we " value life " rather than value having a life .
It 's not love that keeps people alive in many cases , it 's selfishness and fear .
Ben Smith , Ipswich
It is entirely the individual 's decision .
They own their body not the doctor or the state or their relatives .
I had to make this decision on behalf of my late stepfather who suffered a number of strokes in 1999 and had lost so much cognitive ability he could not decide for himself .
Out of love and compassion for him I elected that he should be allowed to die with dignity .
My wife and I have made living wills so that neither the other nor our son should have to make such a painful decision .
Brian Archer , Killingworth , Tyne and Wear
There are far too many do - gooders out there who want to make decisions for everyone else .
Personal choice is the key , and to make someone endure their life , rather than live it because another person ' do - gooder ' , thinks that 's the right thing to do , is cruel - end of !
Live and let live , and let die too !
Sensible , Hull , East Yorkshire " I 'm appalled by these cards , " it reads , " and I removed as many as I could from Swinton Library yesterday . "
Where would we be without such narrow - minded dictators ruling all our decisions with their personal hang - ups and out - dated superstitions ?
Oh , yes - better off than we are today .
My apologies for the sneer , but such attitudes as this - when they move from interesting opinion to inappropriate action - deserve nothing but my contempt .
Craig , Swindon , UK
There 's no way I would carry one of these .
Just imagine , one has a serious accident that leaves one paralysed from the neck down .
I admit it 's hard to imagine how one would feel in that situation .
Possibly suicidal .
However , what if a cure was just round the corner ?
So no , for me the glass is always half full , and I would never terminate my life under any circumstances .
Life 's too precious to throw away .
Leonard Day , Cardiff , UK Although I support someone 's right to choose , how is this practical ?
Is an emergency medic supposed to search through someone 's possessions to check if the card is present before giving aid ?
As a non-card carrier I would be most upset to think I was being withheld emergency treatment while a paramedic , worried about being sued if they get it wrong , looks for a little bit of card .
Rob , Reading
There 's no mention of who is issuing these cards and what their legal status is .
I was also wondering about the security side of this - I can imagine a situation where someone slips a card into someone else 's wallet " for a laugh " and that person gets hit by a bus on the way home .
Or even just bringing one home for a relative .
How can anyone be sure that the person holding the card is the consenting owner of that card ?
Tim , Leeds The Mental Capacity
Act allows people to make an advance decision to refused specific treatment in specific circumstances .
It must be signed and witnessed .
These quick and easy cards are not legally valid advances decisions and will cause confusion to patients and professionals .
This initiative falls short of best practice .
David Jones , London Simply carrying a card because , for example you have inherited Huntington 's or some other degenerative condition is very well , but if you are hit by a bus and need urgent transfusions , CPR etc doctors may be delayed in providing this treatment when in fact you would have had no objection .
By the time the holder of the statement has been contacted , it may already be too late ...
Dr W B Chellam , Liverpool I work as a care assistant .
Some of the people I care for say they wish their suffering could be ' ended ' and that they ' pray for death ' .
It 's heartbreaking to see people bed - ridden , in pain and deeply unhappy .
Each individual should have the right to choose what they are prepared to endure in order to remain alive .
Paula , Lincoln
We have a choice about everything else in our lives so there is no reason why we should not have a choice about this too .
Vicky , Oxford
The controversy over these cards highlights the usual double standard .
' We ' are happy to make ' quality of life ' decisions for animals with a view to ' ending their suffering ' , but when a human wishes to make the same decision for themselves , this is somehow wrong .
Alastair Alexander , Watford Having a card in your wallet really is n't saying much about your mental capacity !
You might simply forget to take it out after you 've changed your mind .
It may delay treatment that could potentially restore your mental capacity !
Alex , Cambridge I think these cards should be available nation - wide .
Jehovah 's Witnesses have been refusing blood transfusions & other treatments for years due to their beliefs so why can't the rest of us enjoy this right ?
Ben , Liverpool Dr Fergusson belongs to the Christian Medical Fellowship - no surprise that he opposes the idea , yet who is he to decide ?
It 's also an insult to people 's intelligence to suggest they do n't understand the complexity of the issue .
The choice is that you either want to live independently or you want to live knowing that you will need to rely on others - seems a perfectly straightforward decision to me .
Gemma , London I wonder if it will be necessary to advise your insurers that you carry such a card and if so , would your life insurance premium increase .
Have Salford City Council investigated this properly ?
Where someone carrying this card dies , are Salford City Council exposed to legal redress from a life insurance company .
Jonathan Hall , Magor Wrong to put them in pubs .
Had 10 pints of snakebite , pick up a card , walk out , get run over ... oh dear .
John , Pontypridd , Wales I am tired of reading about people fighting for the rights of unwanted children ( ie abortion ) or people who do n't want to live .
Why do we want a society full of people who either are n't wanted or loved , or who do n't want to be here ?
Let 's put our energy into something with a more positive outcome for all .
Cindy , London , UK
My late mother suffered from a condition , known to be irreversible and ultimately fatal , that led to her being kept alive , in an induced coma , for over two weeks before she died .
I remember feeling at the time that " there is no chance of recovery , but we will try everything we can " - as a consultant put it - was an odd concept ( performing complex treatment which was known to be futile ) and difficult for the doctors , never mind anyone else .
I know that , if she had had the choice , she would have declared previously that she would not want to be kept alive in such a situation .
Alastair Scott , London , United Kingdom
I recently had cancer and previously would have though that I would hate any form of cancer treatment .
Being extremely frightened of needles and passed out on blood tests .
Without the decision of my consultants I probably would have chosen not to go ahead .
Saying that though I had really good chances .
But now I have had the treatment and am well I am glad the decision was in my doctor 's hands .
As stated above , your opinions change when you end up in that situation .
David Brady , Liverpool
This is possibly the most dangerous application of euthanasia I can imagine , and I am absolutely pro-euthanasia .
A system should exist where , once the accident has happened and an individual assessment has been made , the victim 's family / guardian / doctors make a joint and informed decision about whether or not euthanasia is the road to take , which could possibly be cross- referenced and second opinioned by an independent doctor , and I 'm completely staggered that a solution this simple has n't been reached and probably wo n't be in this country .

BEIJING  China faced rare criticism of its human rights record from the head of the International Olympic Committee on Thursday , even as calls for a boycott of the opening ceremony of the Games grew louder in Europe and the United States .
The president of the Olympic committee , Jacques Rogge , called on the authorities in Beijing to respect their “ moral engagement ” to improve human rights in the months leading up to the Games and to provide the news media with greater access to the country .
He also described the protests that have dogged the international Olympics torch relay as a “ crisis ” for the organization .
Though Mr. Rogge predicted the Games would still be a success , his comments were a sharp departure from previous statements in which he avoided any mention of politics .
Beijing quickly rejected his remarks and said they amounted to meddling in its internal affairs .
Meanwhile , pressure increased on world leaders to signal their opposition to China ’s policies in Tibet and its close relations with the government of Sudan by skipping the opening ceremony of the Games .
The European Parliament urged leaders of its 27 member nations to consider a boycott of the ceremony unless China opens a dialogue with the Dalai Lama , the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet .
The ranking chosen for this top is based on how cool these concepts are but also on how realistic their design is , because in our view it is more important that such a machine to be functional and reliable , rather than just futuristic looking .
10 .
On the last position we decided to place the Anna Lopez ’s concept , a notebook designed with the focus on car drivers ’ needs , for which would be helpful a mobile device easy attachable to the rudder .
As the use of this lightweight laptop is limited , because of its special design dedicated to mobile workers , with a full screen keyboard and a transparent display , capable to work in your car with the possibility to catch your attention from driving , we had to leave it at the end of the list of the top 10 coolest laptop concepts .
9 . Again a very futuristic system that Hewlett Packard liked a lot and exposed it at the HP Invent event last year .
The company did n’t talk much about this notebook but it wanted us to have a view about how the future HP notebooks would look like .
8. V12 Design , an industrial and engineering studio from Italy presented the Canova Dual Touch Screen Laptop to show us all how a futuristic 2 - displays system would look like , and indeed it is interesting , but not that close to the near future ’s reality to deserve a better position in our top .
This notebook would have 2 touch - sensitive displays and more than that they would support the multi - touch technology .
The concept would be helpful for those that work with graphic editors - one of the 2 displays would be the monitor while the other one would transform into a keyboard – but it ’d also provide sketch pad , graph paper , music score , the electronic pen and a special hardware configuration to meet the smooth functioning requirements .
7 . On the 7th position we have the concept coming from Fujitsu , exposed at CEATEC , designed with the focus on one large sector as you would see .
It is equipped with touch keypad , backlit display , a 5.1 surround sound system , music keys , and second display for showing detailed information about the song playing .
In conclusion it would be the perfect mobile digital player .
Fujitsu DJ laptop , as it was called , has a 20 - inch primary LCD display easily folded closed to enable the turntable function , which can be accessed via a touch - sensitive screen on the outside .
This concept is focused on the music sector but has other impressive capabilities so we decided to leave it on this place in our top , and to search for something with more functionalities and dedicated to all domains .
6 . Now comes the Flexi PDA concept which is very cool but not for those that prefer something stylish or neutral .
What ’s unique here is the flexible display that would allow us to open the system and change its form , as Daniel Alexander , its designer describes it .
According to him , this laptop would fold base on the flexible screen technology , allowing us to use it as a mobile phone even outside because it is also waterproof .
It occupies place number 6 because its look would not be on everyone ’s taste .
5 . The green concept here is called Gelfrog and was conceived by the Frog Design team that made it so lightweight and thin so anyone could carry it as a news paper .
It ’s made from a super - pliable rubberized material that would act like a mobile mirror , picture slide show and even a video projector .
And now the unrealistic part :
Gelfrog uses something like a cloning algorithm that scans people ’s outfits to project a matching pattern on its own surface , allowing people to scan images from around and then study different subjects using the same interface .
Too futuristic but cool enough to be on the 5th position .
4. Closer to reality is Fujitsu Fab PC laptop concept that has an electronic paper display type , e-ink , with tissue covering , which makes it very flexible and lightweight .
It would look like an office folder when opened .
3 . Intel had a great idea too , after collaborating with Ziba Design , and came up with this 0.7 inches thick laptop having a width of 17.7 inches and a weight of 2.25 pounds ( 1Kg ) .
Again we encounter the e-ink material for an external display that would show a photo , the calendar , or your daily schedule .
The Intel Mobile Metro notebook meets the following requirements : it is modern , supports all wireless network types and the latest mobile computing capabilities .
According to Roger Kay , the president of consultancy Endpoint Technologies Associates , for this concept , Intel used high quality resistant materials such as champagne - colored magnesium and decorated it with gold accents .
In Ziba ’s view , this notebook is like a jewelry .
Intel Mobile Metro has a diary - like folder attached to it via magnets , capable of wireless charging .
2. Compenion prototype is on the 2nd place because of its two OLED touch - sensitive displays from which one would be used as keyboard , while the other one as an additional display .
Felix Schhmidberger wanted it to have a slider design and to serve as a series of docking stations .
The home dock would have a projector for viewing videos , and the office would have an ergonomic keyboard for example .
The multi - touch screen would be accessed with both fingers and a senstylus .
This notebook could have many different functionalities and has a great look too but we had to put it in the same balance with the Vaio Zoom concept , and you will see why Compenion remained on this position .
1 . For this beautiful glass display that becomes completely transparent when the laptop is not in use , the touch - sensitive keyboard that becomes opaque when not in use , and it ’s extremely thin shell , the Vaio Zoom Holographic Concept notebook deserves the first position in top 10 coolest laptop concepts of all times .
We think that this concept is showing us how future laptops would look like , while the designer wanted to create something that satisfies the requests of people for a perfect designed notebook .
Such a system would be extremely thin , the lightest , and would look exactly like in these pictures .
Eno Setiawan designed it after he gathered the latest statistics about how people would want their laptop to look like .
The whole world has been run on unlimited credit for years and years .
It 's great when everything is going along swimmingly ; wages are rising ; inflation is under control ; productivity is up , etc .
But unfortunately , since 2000 , certainly here , and probably in the UK as well , we 've had a situation that is inherently barmy : namely , corporations making huge and excessive profits by " outsourcing " jobs , first manufacturing , then services ( call centres ) , and then the middle class backbones like accounting , stock and bond analysis , legal editing and legal paperwork , etc. , and at the same time cutting the pay of the remaining employees , or at least not increasing them in line with increased profits or productivity gains , whilst at the same time enriching the CEOs and other top executives with crazy rewards for increasing the " value " of the stock of the corporation , with the profits gained from paying Indians and Philippinos $ 12,000 a year for doing jobs that used to cost $ 120,000 for Americans to do in the US !
All this was fine , as long as cheap and easy loans were given to the masses to buy houses they could n't afford , and when people were encouraged to borrow against the ever - increasing value of their houses ( and even given tax - breaks to do so , since the interest on borrowing against your appreciating home asset is tax - deductible ) , so that instead of being paid a serious wage ( instead of the real wage stagnation ) , people could feel " rich " by being given " access " to borrowed money from the make - believe appreciation of the bricks and mortar that they called their " home . "
When this virtual " Ponzi Scheme " finally came tumbling down , because the merry - go - round of leveraged asset inflation stopped , all the banks , who should have known better than to listen to smooth - tongued Wall Street types , who came up with yet one more of their con-job ideas to make money out of nothing ( remember " junk bonds " ? ) , and bundle hundreds of loans into small pieces , and sell the whole " pig 's ear " as " highly desirable derivative bonds " all backed by the " never - to - go - down " property boom in the US , " Hey , what can go wrong , right ? " suddenly had " assets " with no value at all !
Worse still , nobody knew ( because of the nature of the " chopped up " and " sliced - and - diced " assets in each bond ) what they actually had , and if indeed they had either valuable property , or worthless property !
Worse still , nobody knew ( because of the nature of the " chopped up " and " sliced - and - diced " assets in each bond ) what they actually had , and if indeed they had either valuable property , or worthless property !
Then , all those poor people who had been conned into buying houses for crazy sums of money which they could " afford " because they were paying interest - only loans of 2 - 3 % , which results in negative amortization on the asset , but which they were told did n't matter , because the asset inflation ( sorry , appreciation ) would cover the difference in 2 - 3 years time , when they could re-finance easily at a lower fixed rate because their home ( asset ) would be worth 20 - 30 % more than they paid , and so they would then have built - in equity , suddenly discovered that the merry - go - round stopped , as it inevitably would , and always has done throughout history ( I 've lived through at least four property booms and busts in my 50 + years , but then when you have a whole society that ignores history , even just 10 - 20 year - old history , it may not be surprising after all ) and woke up to find their asset to be declining ; the new " interest - meter " about to restart at a much higher rate , based on the older inflated asset price , which was now worth less than what they purchased it for .
The whole thing reminds me of that immortal saying of PT Barnum in the 19th Century , " Nobody ever went broke underestimating the stupidity of the American public ! "
But in this case , it seems all the bankers , including the Brits , Irish , Germans , Swiss , French and Japanese all fell into the stupidity category this time as well !
Next stop ?
Who knows ?
But it would be a good bet that it will be a Great Depression .
The last time everyone , including the bankers , got universally conned , and we had worldwide inflation in food and fuel costs at the same time as a shrinking economy , we had the Great Depression , the rise of Fascism and the ultimate catastrophe of World War II .
History tends to repeat itself , sadly .
As Harry Truman once said , " The only thing new is the history you do n't know ! "
On 10 October 1957 , at the age of 39 , Thomas Tuohy was deputy to the general manager at the Windscale and Calder works of the Ministry of Supply ( now known as Sellafield ) when one of the " piles " – primitive nuclear reactors – making plutonium for Britain 's first atomic bombs overheated .
His boss phoned him at home where he was nursing a family sick with flu : " Come at once .
Pile number one is on fire . "
Tuohy told his wife and two children , living about a mile from the works , to stay indoors and keep all the windows closed .
At the factory he flouted standing orders by discarding his radiation recording badge , so that no one could tell him that he had exceeded permitted radiation dose limits and lay him off work .
He went immediately to the top of the 80ft pile and peered down vertical inspection holes in the concrete pile cap into the graphite core .
He could see the bright glow from the fire near the pile 's discharge face .
Over the next few hours , he repeated his inspections , watching the fire grow .
He reckoned that about 120 of the horizontal fuel channels filled with uranium slugs being transmuted into plutonium were ablaze .
His workers were sweating away with steel rods , trying to shove the burning fuel cartridges , distorted by heat , out of the conflagration .

From the colour of the flames , Tom Tuohy estimated that the fire must be approaching the melting point of steel .
He continued his inspections throughout the night .
Around dawn , he had all the available carbon dioxide gas pumped into the core to try to quell the inferno , but to no dramatic effect .
There were signs , however , that the fire was abating .
Then a new fear arose .
The thick concrete biological shield that was protecting Tuohy and the rest of the world from the core 's intense radiation might begin to collapse under the heat .
Earlier , Tuohy had agreed with his peers on site that if it came to the worst , water must be used to drown the fire .
It raised serious risks of exacerbating the damage – for example , by creating an explosive mixture of water , gas and air that might blow the pile apart .
But time was running out .
Tuohy told his fire chief where to position the hoses , two feet above the fire .
He remained in the pile while the water began to flow , gently at first .
Initially , nothing happened , so Tuohy switched off the blowers that were blasting gale - force cooling air through the pile , keeping the temperature tolerable for the fire - fighters but also fanning the flames .
It did the trick and they watched the fire die .
Five hours later , Tuohy was reporting to his boss , at home with flu , that the fire had been extinguished .
Nevertheless they kept water flowing for another 30 hours .
The pile structure , so sternly tested , survives to this day .
Tuohy returned to his own sick family at Beckermet , within sight of the pile .
Half - a- century later , shortly before he emigrated to Australia , Tuohy helped make a BBC documentary on the nuclear accident ( Windscale : Britain 's biggest nuclear disaster ) .
The Windscale fire was to have a profound influence on Britain 's approach to nuclear health and safety , inspiring the creation of a nuclear health and safety executive headed by a Chief Nuclear Inspector .
Born in England of Irish parents , Tuohy obtained his BSc from Reading University and spent the Second World War years as a chemist in Royal Ordnance factories , before joining the new nuclear project in 1946 , as manager of health physics at the Springfields factory near Preston , where fuel for the piles was made .
In 1949 he moved to Windscale in Cumbria to do the same job .

In 1951 Tuohy led the team that poured Windscale 's first billet of pure plutonium metal .
He had distinguished himself the previous year when pile number one was nearing completion and Harwell calculated that its productivity would be much lower than previously thought .
One last - minute modification was to trim fins on the 70,000 fuel cans that enclosed the uranium slugs .
It would have taken too long to unload the pile and take the slugs back to the workshop .
So Tuohy set up a facility on the discharge hoist of the pile itself .
Cartridges emerged at one point , went down a line that clipped 1/16 of an inch off each of the fins , and returned them to the pile .
Tuohy 's system clipped about one million fins in about three weeks .
Tuohy took charge of operations when the first billet of home - made plutonium was poured at Windscale in March 1951 .
It was not the first pure plutonium to be seen in Britain – that had been at Harwell three months earlier , using Canadian material .
Tuohy recalled how the lid of the crucible in which Windscale 's newly minted metal was melted had stuck , so he swiped it with a steel rod .
All operations involving plutonium were carried out in glove boxes to protect operators from alpha radiation .
It greatly complicated operations but Tuohy once commented that the metal was nothing like so difficult to work with as polonium - 210 , also made at Windscale in the early years of atom bombs .
In February 1964 the Windscale factory received a severe shock .
A new defence white paper asserted that Britain now had adequate stockpiles of fissile materials for its foreseeable bomb - making needs .
The nation was collaborating once more with the Americans and using some US designs .
Production of weapons - grade plutonium at Windscale was to cease .
Con Allday , who later would become chairman of British Nuclear Fuels , was to carry the message to Tuohy , by now Windscale 's general manager .
Henceforth his annual budget would be a mere £ 2 m .
Tuohy faced up to the new challenge with customary vigour .
While top management sought new civilian markets for its nuclear expertise , he embarked on a rigorous programme of cost-cutting .
His undoubted success in this activity would have unfortunate repercussions in the 1970s .
In 1970 the government created British Nuclear Fuels ( BNFL ) with Sir John Hill as chairman and a trio of managing directors .
It was not a comfortable arrangement .
Tuohy was made managing director responsible for production , running factories at Windscale , Springfields and Capenhurst .
In 1971 BNFL became the UK shareholder in an ambitious tripartite project with Holland and West Germany , called Urenco .
Urenco was to develop and exploit a new technology for enriching the fissile uranium content of nuclear fuel for reactors .
It was called the lightweight ultracentrifuge and had been under development secretly in all three countries .
The idea was that by pooling ideas the three could make a big advance in a novel technology , in competition with the current US domination of the enrichment market .
Collaboration was not easy , however , for each nation saw itself in pole position .
Tuohy represented the UK in various part - time capacities until 1973 , when he was appointed Urenco 's managing director .
His appointment solved problems at BNFL but was inappropriate for a situation that called for patient diplomacy .
From the outset he left no one in doubt that he was going to bang heads together and force through radical changes .
He enlivened Urenco 's staff Christmas dinner that year with his own summary – in verse – of the project 's hapless history so far .
Even so , he managed to persuade the partners to agree to construct two ( not three ) demonstration plants , in England and Holland , to kick - start the venture .
But they were still far from pooling their technical effort .
Nevertheless , in 1974 Urenco produced its first business plan , looking 10 years ahead .
But the forthright , decisive style of Tuohy 's direction was ill - accepted by the fledgling company .
While his ideas were forcing the partners to face up to their own weaknesses , Tuohy 's bluntness was alienating him from his shareholders .
They proposed a new corporate structure which he saw as completely unacceptable because of the power it gave the shareholders over his decision - making .
He resigned in October 1974 , still only 54 .
It would be the end of his career in nuclear energy .

La Nina caused some of the coldest temperatures in memory in China Global temperatures for 2008 will be slightly cooler than last year as a result of the cold La Nina current in the Pacific , UN meteorologists have said .
The World Meteorological Organization 's secretary - general , Michel Jarraud , told the BBC it was likely that La Nina would continue into the summer .
But this year 's temperatures would still be way above the average - and we would soon exceed the record year of 1998 because of global warming induced by greenhouse gases .
The WMO points out that the decade from 1998 to 2007 was the warmest on record .
Since the beginning of the 20th Century , the global average surface temperature has risen by 0.74C .
While Nasa , the US space agency , cites 2005 as the warmest year , the UK's Hadley Centre lists it as second to 1998 .
Researchers say the uncertainty in the observed value for any particular year is larger than these small temperature differences .
What matters , they say , is the long - term upward trend .
Rises ' stalled ' LA NINA KEY FACTS La Nina translates from the Spanish as " The Child Girl " Refers to the extensive cooling of the central and eastern Pacific Increased sea temperatures on the western side of the Pacific mean the atmosphere has more energy and frequency of heavy rain and thunderstorms is increased Typically lasts for up to 12 months and generally less damaging event than the stronger El Nino La Nina and El Nino are two great natural Pacific currents whose effects are so huge they resonate round the world .
El Nino warms the planet when it happens ; La Nina cools it .
This year , the Pacific is in the grip of a powerful La Nina .
It has contributed to torrential rains in Australia and to some of the coldest temperatures in memory in snow - bound parts of China .
Mr Jarraud told the BBC that the effect was likely to continue into the summer , depressing temperatures globally by a fraction of a degree .
This would mean that temperatures have not risen globally since 1998 when El Nino warmed the world .
Watching trends A minority of scientists question whether this means global warming has peaked and argue the Earth has proved more resilient to greenhouse gases than predicted .

" When you look at climate change you should not look at any particular year , " he said .
" You should look at trends over a pretty long period and the trend of temperature globally is still very much indicative of warming .
" La Nina is part of what we call ' variability ' .
There has always been and there will always be cooler and warmer years , but what is important for climate change is that the trend is up ; the climate on average is warming even if there is a temporary cooling because of La Nina . "

Advertisement Adam Scaife , lead scientist for modelling climate variability at the Hadley Centre in Exeter , UK , said their best estimate for 2008 was about 0.4C above the 1961 - 1990 average , and higher than this if you compared it with further back in the 20th Century .
Mr Scaife told the BBC : " What 's happened now is that La Nina has come along and depressed temperatures slightly but these changes are very small compared to the long - term climate change signal , and in a few years time we are confident that the current record temperature of 1998 will be beaten when the La Nina has ended .

WASHINGTON  The Treasury Department will propose on Monday that Congress give the Federal Reserve broad new authority to oversee financial market stability , in effect allowing it to send SWAT teams into any corner of the industry or any institution that might pose a risk to the overall system .
The proposal is part of a sweeping blueprint to overhaul the nation ’s hodgepodge of financial regulatory agencies , which many experts say failed to recognize rampant excesses in mortgage lending until after they set off what is now the worst financial calamity in decades .
Democratic lawmakers are all but certain to say the proposal does not go far enough in restricting the kinds of practices that caused the financial crisis .
Many of the proposals , like those that would consolidate regulatory agencies , have nothing to do with the turmoil in financial markets .
And some of the proposals could actually reduce regulation .
According to a summary provided by the administration , the plan would consolidate an alphabet soup of banking and securities regulators into a powerful trio of overseers responsible for everything from banks and brokerage firms to hedge funds and private equity firms .
Worst .
Moderators .
Ever ?
While political observers are understandably divided about who “ won ” last night ’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas , it seems everyone who watched can come together in agreement on one underlying point : the moderators were truly awful .
About a half - hour into the debate , an angry man started shouting , interrupting the event while security personnel intervened .
Usually , these protestors are easy to dismiss as random nuts , but in this case , the heckler had a legitimate beef .
About 22 minutes into the Nevada Democratic debate , a heckler in the audience interrupted the proceedings , saying “ these are f**cking race - based questions coming from you two , these are race - based questions … ”
There was silence from the candidates and the moderators for about eight seconds with no mention of the heckler .
Tim Russert , continued with his question for Sen.
Hillary Clinton which focused on her characterization that Sen. Obama “ is raising false hopes . ”
I ’ve seen debates in which hecklers jeer candidates , and I ’ve seen debates in which hecklers take a stand for one issue or another , but this was the first debate I ’ve seen in which a heckler went after a moderator .
Worse , I think the guy was probably right .
Within a few minutes of the interruption , Ezra said , “ It ’s almost impossible for me to convey the damage Tim Russert and Brian Williams are doing to the republic this evening … .
It ’s literally the worst moderation I ’ve yet seen .
It ’s not moderation .
It ’s trivialization .
28 minutes in , there ’s not been a question about any issue , any cause , any problem . ”
I ’m not sure if I ’m prepared to say it was literally the worst I ’ve seen — the CNN debate in November was pretty offensive — but by any reasonable measure , last night was breathtakingly bad .
The first question of any substance came 40 minutes into the event .
40 .
The entire debate was two hours long , which means Tim Russert , Brian Williams , and NBC ’s Natalie Morales ( who was relegated to reading emails to the candidates ) spent the first third of the debate covering nothing but process , politics , and horserace .
Russert , in particular , wanted to explore the race - based dispute between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in extraordinary detail .
I ’ve seen some suggestions that Obama and Clinton looked tired last night .
My take was entirely different — they were bored by questions about an issue they were prepared to forget .
At one point , Morales asked John Edwards , “ [ W ] hat is a white male to do running against these historic candidacies ? ”
People laughed , and if you listened closely , you could Clinton say , “ Poor John . ”
I agreed wholeheartedly , except I was also thinking , “ Poor us . ”
On and on it went .
Robert Johnson .
“ Buddy system . ”
The black vote .
The woman vote .
“ Likable enough . ” Russert added : “ I want to ask each of you quickly , your greatest strength , your greatest weakness . ”
I half - expected him to ask each of them to explain what kind of tree they ’d be .
When the debate finally got to the substance , the moderators were hardly any better .
Russert screwed up the Iraq / 2013 point badly .
The ROTC question was silly .
Russert inexplicably suggested Edwards should n’t talk to Musharraf in Pakistan .
The last question of the night asked when the candidates decided to run for president — as if that were important .
The candidates keep getting better in these debates .
The moderators keep getting worse .
HARARE ( Reuters ) - Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe ’s presidential election , winning 47 percent of the vote against the president ’s 43 percent , senior government sources said on Wednesday .
Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai addresses supporters at an election rally south of Harare , March 16 , 2008 .
Tsvangirai beat Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe 's presidential election , winning 47 percent of the vote against the president 's 43 percent , senior government sources said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Philimon Bulawayo / Files
One source , declining to be named like the others , told Reuters a run-off would be needed because Tsvangirai did not win enough votes for an outright victory .
Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) has said he won the March 29 vote outright and accuses Mugabe -- in power for 28 years -- of delaying results to rig victory .
The standoff over the election has raised fears of widespread bloodshed in a country already battling to cope with economic meltdown .
The MDC said on Wednesday 20 of its members had been killed by pro-government militias in post-election violence and that soldiers had taken part in the attacks .
“ Only over the past two days five MDC activists have been killed , ” it said .
The government has denied waging a violent campaign against the opposition and accuses the MDC of carrying out attacks .
Tsvangirai has said there is no need for a second round because he won outright but has also suggested he could take part if there were international observers led by the U.N. .
If Tsvangirai refused to take part in a run-off , Mugabe would be declared the winner , according to election rules .
The MDC leader , who has been touring Africa seeking support , says he is a prime target for Mugabe ’s security forces but would return home when conditions were right .
POLICE ACCUSATION
The state - run Herald newspaper reported police wanted to question MDC Secretary - General Tendai Biti for illegally declaring results and were concerned he was “ urging and abetting political violence ” .
Biti is believed to be outside Zimbabwe .
Police have arrested 10 MDC activists on allegations of violence , kidnapping , attempted murder , the Herald reported .
There was no immediate comment from the Electoral Commission or opposition officials on the leaked result .
The commission has invited candidates to start verifying the count from Thursday .
A top official in Mugabe ’s ZANU - PF party said : “ Those figures are in line with the official figures and the MDC knows that the official tally is more or less around that but they have been inflating their numbers to claim a false victory . ”
Zimbabweans had hoped the election would ease economic turmoil .
Instead , severe food , fuel and foreign currency shortages are worsening and there are no signs an inflation rate of 165,000 percent -- the world ’s highest -- will decrease .
The MDC and human rights groups allege ZANU - PF has embarked on a violent campaign to scare Zimbabweans into voting for Mugabe in a run-off , accusations the government denies .
Earlier , Mugabe ’s government dismissed the United Nations ’ first session on Zimbabwe ’s election crisis as “ sinister , racist and colonial ” and said it would have no impact on the country .
At the U.N. Security Council meeting on Tuesday , Western powers pressed for a U.N. mission or envoy to visit Zimbabwe .
“ For us , this ( U.N. session ) is a sign of desperation by the British and their MDC puppets , ” Zimbabwe ’s Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga told Reuters .
European countries , Latin American U.N. members and the United States supported sending an envoy , diplomats said , but South Africa , which currently holds the council presidency , said such a move was not a matter for the council .
South African President Thabo Mbeki has come under attack at home and abroad for his “ softly , softly ” approach to Zimbabwe .
Former colonial ruler Britain has been at the forefront of international pressure on Mugabe .
It is seeking an arms embargo on Zimbabwe , an investigation into post-election violence , and has called for the election results to be issued immediately .

Clinton tells
Obama he 's ready to bring it ... to the dance floor Michael Roston

Print This Email This Former President Bill Clinton has faced a lot of challenges in his life , but that does n't mean he is n't ready to face the latest power struggle confronting him : proving once and for all who the best Democratic dancer is on the campaign trail .
Clinton overcame a broken home , losing re-election after his first term as Arkansas Governor , and skepticism about his presidential ambitions in the 1990s .
And according to the New York Times ' Katharine Q. Seeleye , he is n't afraid to prove his dancing skills to Senator Barack Obama either , any time , any place .
" I would be willing to engage in a dancing competition with [ Obama ] , even though heï¿½s much thinner and younger than I am , but only if I got an age allowance , ï¿½ the Times ' Caucus Blog reported the former President saying in a Greenville , South Carolina town hall meeting .
Clinton 's humorous remark was prompted by one of the many strange moments in Monday night 's Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina .
CNN's Joe Johns asked Obama if he agreed with poet Toni Morrison that Clinton was America 's " first black president . "
" I would have to investigate more Bill 's dancing abilities , and some of this other stuff before I accurately judge whether he was actually a brother , " the senator answered .
On a more serious note , Clinton reflecting on the transformation that could be caused by electing a woman or a black man as president .
" I think it would be just as much a change , and some people think more , to have the first woman president as to have the first African - American president .ï¿½ he declared in the meeting .
Seeleye 's report can be accessed at this link .
Stocks also priced in a second stimulus today I mentioned last month that the stock market had already priced in an economic recovery that has n't happened yet .
There 's been a little bit of a correction since then , but today it looks like there 's an urge to go back to the mania of overvaluation .
Based on the rumor that some non-elected members of the administration would like more stimulus , the NASDAQ soared just shy of 2 % :
What are the actual odds of a second stimulus getting passed , right now ?
Probably pretty close to zero .

— Maggie Miller ( @magmill95 ) September 22 , 2020 Everything remains unstable
While job losses have slowed somewhat and new hiring has started picking up again , we 're still facing huge output reductions from this time last year .
Many have exhausted both traditional state unemployment as well as the additional federal assistance that was provided both as universal stimulus and as a supplement to those state insurance programs .
And although Trump announced more help was on the way , those promises were predictably hollow .
Without funding to back up the declaration , very few states were able to find any additional resources to increase unemployment checks .
The few that did - mostly red states - raided cash from the state 's FEMA emergency balance .
As such , the money did not last long , and now represents additional funding the government will have to come up with to handle the next environment disaster .
Oh did I mention environmental disasters ?
Because there are also hurricanes and fires and a pandemic that will probably have to be dealt with at some point .
But about those stocks ...
I suppose things brings me back around to the original topic here : stocks .
Yeah , I would n't suggest investing in these current prices .
Even if we ignore the obvious economic and ecological problems , getting in at this price level is a bet on the fact that Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell are suddenly going to agree on how to fix the current mess we call a country .
Beyond that , prices are still too high and the rally has gone well past the actual economic recovery .
While the most stubborn bulls might insist that profits can be separated from the overall health of the labor markets and widespread prosperity , it would be wise for them to check the history books for examples of that lasting very long .
Too early to celebrate Trump ’s unemployment orders While Congress has been deadlocked and unable to reach an agreement regarding an extension of pandemic assistance , President Trump has decided to take unilateral action with a series of executive orders .
Early morning futures are mixed , so while some unemployed individuals are celebrating , the markets have been more cautious - and probably for good reason .
Let 's take a little look at the orders and see what we can expect .
Memorandum on Continued Student Loan Payment Relief During the COVID - 19 Pandemic
The first order extends the duration of student loan payment relief through December 31 .
This does n't forgive any debts , but it does allow borrowers to defer payments without penalty or additional interest accrual .
The Secretary of Education is also instructed to facilitate deferments and waivers , while also redefining economic hardship in such a way that recognizes the current economic situation .
So far , there 's no major problems here .
Trump 's student loan order does n't change the amount owed so much as it merely restructures those debts and provides a more flexible payment arrangement .
It does n't require any funds to be disbursed , and it 's basically in line with the president 's constitutional authority to determine executive priorities .
Executive Order on Fighting the Spread of COVID - 19 by Providing Assistance to Renters and Homeowners
In the next order , Trump promises to help renters and homeowners ... but this is where things start to get questionable .
Section 2 declares the intent of minimizing evictions and foreclosures , but Section 3 provides a very murky enforcement mechanism .
The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall identify any and all available Federal funds to provide temporary financial assistance to renters and homeowners who , as a result of the financial hardships caused by COVID - 19 , are struggling to meet their monthly rental or mortgage obligations .
The obvious problem here is that Congress has not appropriated money for this action , so Trump is asking his executive staff to " find it . "
What the president does n't seem to understand is that the government was not designed to run like a business .
The CEO can't just decide to take money out of one account and transfer it to another , because those funds are allocated by Congress for a specific purpose .
Put simply : the president can't unilaterally spend public dollars .
While the language of this order is encouraging to those who are at risk of foreclosure or eviction , the reality of it wo n't do much to help them .
Memorandum on Deferring Payroll Tax Obligations in Light of the Ongoing COVID - 19 Disaster
In the third order , things start to get really weird .
The order specifies that employers can defer all payments on Social Security taxes through the end of the year .
There are a few exceptions , and the order does n't cover payroll taxes due on individuals earning more than $ 2,000 per week .
Like the student loan executive order , this does n't eliminate the amount that 's due and it does n't require Trump 's executive staff to redirect funds that were allocated elsewhere .
In that sense , it is theoretically enforceable .
But is it a good idea ?
Maybe not .
A payroll tax holiday might increase the consumption rate of those who are currently employed , but the economic crisis right now relates primarily to a historic lack of employment opportunities .
The bill also leaves companies with a large liability at the end of the year , so it increases short term liquidity at increased risk of long term default .
The order also instructs the Treasury to " pursue " a total forgiveness of this tax over the specified time frame , but that would require the very legislation Trump is trying to avoid by fiat .
Memorandum on Authorizing the Other Needs Assistance Program for Major Disaster Declarations Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019
And here 's what the headlines are celebrating : Trump extends the unemployment benefit subsidy !
Except , well , much like his other orders there is no funding to back this up .
Since Congress could n't achieve a deal and since there is no budget for this extension , Trump has ordered FEMA to find the cash .
He 's also promising to raid the remaining $ 80 billion in the Coronavirus Relief Fund ( CRF ) that was supposed to be paid directly to the tribes , states , and local governments most impacted by the pandemic .
Again : the idea here is fine .
People on unemployment need better job options and a stronger safety net while they look for work .
The political reality is that this is exactly the type of government action that requires Congressional approval and funding .
$ 80 billion plus FEMA 's balance sheet wo n't add up to the $ 1 trillion that we 've already spent on pandemic - related unemployment assistance , and it will leave our emergency responders underfunded right in the middle of hurricane season .
Unemployment must still be reckoned with
While it 's great that the executive has allowed individuals and businesses to defer as many payments and debts as possible , these actions wo n't be sufficient to curb the massive economic crisis that is brewing in the shadow of the pandemic .
It 's also way too soon for the unemployed to start celebrating .
While the order to extend payments might signal an increased willingness to compromise , it will not provide substantial assistance on its own .
Congress must act to provide the requisite funding , and the longer they wait , the worse the economic effect will be - both at the individual and at the macro level .
Markets are pricing in a recovery that has n’t happened Today 's unemployment report was hailed as a victory , but the only way it looks good is in comparison to the few months preceding it .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 1.184 million Americans lost jobs this last week .
august - unemployment - data
Now , this number is down from the peak of 6 million jobs lost in late March and early May , but it 's still one of the worst weeks for unemployment in American economic history .
Prior to the coronavirus crash , the largest disruptions in the U.S. economy typically cost 2 or 2.5 million jobs lost - per month !
The 2009 crash , referred to often as the " Great Recession , " peaked with 2.6 million jobs lost in a one - month stretch .
We 're currently closer to 6 million in the last month , and this month has dramatically improved from the one before it .
Markets react positively Despite the 16 million currently unemployed Americans and despite the massive revenue and profit losses reported over the last two weeks , the stock market is doing just fine .
In fact , the S&P500 is approaching a record high while the Nasdaq just hit its 31st record high close this year .
To an extent , this makes some sense .
Tech stocks have generally done better than shares in companies that require physical interaction .
But the price earnings ratio is back in to extreme bubble territory .
While the average P/E of the last few decades is around 15 or 16 , the current NASDAQ number is closer to 40 .
That 's right : if you bought $ X worth of NASDAQ shares right now , it would take about 40 years for those companies to earn back the money you 've invested .
Of course , if they continue to grow , it will be a bit quicker than that , but what space are they expected to grow in to ?
Federal benefits expiring
This week is also the end of the additional $ 600 unemployment supplement provided by the federal government .
Up until now , those 16 million unemployed Americans had an additional benefit padding the loss of their job - and the lack of alternative employment opportunities .
The additional funding has been a major boost to state unemployment programs that provide very little .
Florida 's unemployment payments , for example , are capped at $ 275 per week - regardless of how much the employee was originally making .
With average weekly wages in the state around $ 600 to $ 800 per week , that benefit is just a small drop in the bucket compared to the bills and obligations those people have .
The music keeps playing Imagine a game of musical chairs where 16 million seats were suddenly removed .
But the song has n't stopped yet , so no one is crying .
Now imagine everyone has concluded that because the song has n't stopped yet , it will probably never end .
Never mind that Congress just put their hand on the plug , and they 're about to pull it .
The Irreverent Guide to U.S. Monetary History
What is this " the market " you speak of , if not a series of government grants and privileges ?
Without the Treasury honoring the Federal Reserve 's obligations , there is no " the market . "
You want competing currencies ?
Get a time machine and go west .
We tried it .
It sucked .
Every other day another bank went bust , and took a whole bunch of worthless currency and overhyped bullion promises with it .
Turns out private sector currency manipulation makes Keynesian governments look like boyscouts .
So we tried to print all our own public currency at the Federal level , and that did n't work so well either .
Well .. a big part of the problem was that we ended up in the middle of a crazy civil war , so maybe we should also remember that two governments operating with purely public and purely fiat currencies were able to raise the largest industrial - era armies the world had ever seen .
Just imagine if they had skipped the war and gone straight to building railroads ?
But alas , the public currency died at the demands of the British financiers who made loans to our shattered republic in the aftermath of destruction .
They insisted we abandon our current corporate regulations to adopt their concepts of limited liability and government sponsored cartels that evolved directly from the hereditary privileges of those aristocrats chartered to do the crown 's royal business .
Upon securing favorable loan and regulatory terms with the U.S. Congress , they funneled huge sums of cash to Rockefeller , Morgan , and other would - be " barons " who could successfully corner and monopolize essential industries .
The restoration of the financial nobility 's control over America was set to be codified in 1913 , but there was just one fatal flaw in the Federal Reserve System :
It was too effective .
By 1929 , consolidation of the nation 's wealth and inequality had reached such a peak that it made 1850 's slave plantations look like a bunch of egalitarian hippy communes .
But a strong economy can't exist unless a lot of people have discretionary income :
When you consolidate all of the country 's capital , no one has anything left to spend .
Sure , you can build an incredible palace here or there , but the rest of the economy collapses and you end up with pissed off peasants at Blair Mountain or something .
So we came up with one more solution in the 1940s .
It was incredible .
It put every other innovation to shame .
We kept the effectiveness and price stability of the Federal Reserve System , but we stripped it of the rich - right wing WASP conspiracy to " get as fucking rich as possible and fuck everyone else " by recovering a large part of the profits of those who were most able to manipulate it for their own benefit .
We took that money and we built transportation networks and schools that were the envy of the world !
And you know what happened next ?
Those kids growing up in those schools grew up to know a lot of stuff about how to build stuff and make even more money !
The economy boomed !
We went to the goddamn * moon *!
Since then ?
Well , a lot of the banks attached to those old names , Chase - Rockefeller , JP Morgan , Goldman Sachs ... well , they own everything again .
The economy 's shit .
The peasants are getting pissed off , and they 'll probably only continue blaming the Muslims for so long ...
Fixing the Economy Fast Best case : Everyone defaults .
Then , when the banks fail ( again ) we DON'T bail them out .
Reform Federal Reserve so that money creation is done through public , member owned , and not - for - profit banks : eliminate private banking representation on the board .
If we 're going to subsidize banking as if it were a public good , we should operate it as a public utility .
Institute simple yet gradually progressive tax system to pay for remaining public obligations .
Eliminate deductions / exemptions / incentives / payroll taxes .
There ya go .
All debt - related problem are solved !
Worst Case :
Get ready for 30 years of austerity and a violent awakening that gives way to the unraveling of empire and an even more violent crisis that shakes the very foundations of our government & corporate economy .
What do you want the next 70 years to look like ?
A Tale of Two Markets Increasingly , it is " the market " that shapes our social destiny and financial choices , but what is a market and more specifically , what is our market ?
An ever present concept
The freest market is the one that exists conceptually in relation to every voluntary human transaction or exchange .
When the neighbor kid offers to mow your yard for $ 30 or $ 40 and you agree - you 've created a market for exchanging cash and services .
By publishing this website , I 've provided an info - tainment product offered at no fee to you .
In the broader online market , the price for content is typically set around " free . "
So whether the exchange is one on one or part of a larger clearing house like the internet is for information , all voluntary trades can be classified as market activities .
In theory , the aggregate of these voluntary choices is " The Free Market , " but in reality many exchanges and economic choices are not entirely consensual or free to fail .
The Market in Practice
In more common terms , " The Market " is a series of political and private institutions designed to rapidly make economic choices on an international scale .
While Wall Street is the center of activity , it is actually the Treasury and the Federal Reserve that operate as the origin point for this market .
As money is created , it flows from the public institutions into private banks that in turn lend the money out for a profit .
As the bailouts have demonstrated , these loans will be allowed to fail - although there are plenty of other ways for money to enter society at large , none of them would be quite so profitable for the entrenched interests who already have enough wealth and influence to insure that they get what they want .
Typically , the majority of a bank 's loans are issued to state and local governments , large corporations , or for residential mortgages .
From there , smaller businesses can acquire currency by providing products & services to those entities , and labor can acquire currency by working directly for someone else who is in the loop .
In short , this is how money trickles down from the rich and occasionally makes it in to the hands of the working poor .
State of the Market
The biggest banks not only have the most influence over the Federal Reserve , they also have an infinitely implicit guarantee of profitability .
While they are theoretically paid to make large economic choices in a market - like way , the removal of their risk distorts the choices they 'll ultimately make .
This moral hazard is the status quo and its hard to believe it is an accident or an honest attempt at maximizing efficiency .
When the markets go down as they have over the last few weeks , what is actually happening is that those who are voluntarily invested in the system are walking away and looking for something a little less rigged .
Inevitably , when the next emergency bailout or " market support " is announced , the " markets " will appear to do better but only in that they are even less functional as markets .
This is a crisis of legitimacy , and the cure is part of the cycle that devalues our market 's market - like functions .
A few patches and bandaids is not " reform , " rebuilding from the ashes of a failed system will be the only true reform .
Until then , good luck ...
Gold is Surging Again
Was it the crazy drop in trading last week ?
Was it all of the talk about defaults in Europe or the actual bail out itself ?
Whatever it is , it is driving up the price of gold - every survivalists ' favorite commodity and the investment that only really makes sense when you 're bearish on absolutely everything else .
At the moment I 'm writing this ( noon on May 12 ) , gold is trading at about $ 1,245 per ounce .
The last big purchase I remember hearing about was India 's 200 ton acquisition back in November at or around $ 1,050 an ounce .
That was six months ago - and now gold is trading for almost 20 % more than it was .
No one is saying that India was buying at the top of the bubble any more - in fact they just pulled a huge , quick profit simply because they did n't need to print up a money to stay solvent & investing in the economy .
Now every bailout of crisis that strikes a western economy is just going to amplify the value of that investment .
The problem is largely inflation beyond wages - but people do n't really feel this until they 're already on the edge of bankruptcy or foreclosure .
So many costs are fixed - car payments , mortgage payments , student loans , etc ... - that consumers are n't really feeling the deflationary effects in autos & real estate in any kind of positive way .
Meanwhile , milk and gas are back near $ 3 a gallon , most meat is up 20 - 25 % over the last year or so , and insurance rates , local taxes , & communications fees are on the rise .
The only parts of the economy experiencing inflation are the ones that are n't fixed for consumers - the parts experiencing deflation are fixed at the old , higher rate .
Wages have n't really gone anywhere , so the result is that people near the edge are going to have to constantly cut back until they simply can't anymore .
At that point , default becomes logical as its the only way to really take advantage of the deflation in other sectors that brings the total CPI down .
So the markets are speaking up , and this is what I hear : Walk away from your debts , and / or buy up physical gold because the government is just going to keep printing to make those banks whole for the debt losses .
SEC has some crazy theory about Goldman Sachs
The SEC has released this crazy theory about a conspiracy at Goldman Sachs to defraud investors .
Although technically , if they have enough evidence to win at trial , it wo n't really be a conspiracy theory any more .
Isolated or Systemic Fraud ?
The big question here is whether we 're looking at a one time event or a pattern of behavior .
If the SEC only has this one complaint lined up , this might not end up as much of a story at all .
The total value of the Abacus transaction is only about $ 1 billion and Goldman 's stake is even smaller .
Bloomberg is saying they only made about $ 15 million in fees for this particular deal , so the charges here are really , really insignificant for a company that made a thousand times that much profit in just last year .
On the other hand , if this turns out to be the kind of deals that Goldman routinely uses to collect fees and bring profits to their favorite hedge funds and investment firms ...
Well , then we could be looking at a price fixing scheme big enough to make huge profits in the event of a crisis situation .
Hell - let 's just be honest and admit that it would be a big incentive to create a financial crisis .
On Timing the Announcement A lot of the analysis surrounding the SEC 's complaint relates to the timing of its release .
There are definitely a few interesting " coincidences " to be considered when trying to determine what we can really expect out of this :
No one got " blindsided " - Goldman had knowledge of the charges months ago and they did n't take the opportunity to come out and announce the pending suit on their own terms .
They kept quiet about the SEC accusations and got their PR machine working to promote a general brand image .
- Goldman had knowledge of the charges months ago and they did n't take the opportunity to come out and announce the pending suit on their own terms .

The " other " SEC Report -
Oh yeah , by the way , the SEC also published its explanation of why it took 12 years to actually bring any charges against a suspected ponzi scheme that is turning out to be one of the biggest direct investment scams of the bubble era .
Its probably a good thing for the SEC 's own public image that everyone is busy talking and thinking about how they 're " cracking down " on Goldman and not about how they 're mostly turning a blind eye to all of the other scams going on .
If you want to see the whole report and tell us what it says , its down at the bottom of the page .
Thanks !

Options Friday - April options contracts expired Saturday , so anyone who was bearish on Goldman in the options market could have made some serious cash .
While most of these common derivatives generally expire without being exercised , a huge sudden price move triggered huge volume in the options market .
With 300,000 contracts leveraging up to 30 million shares at a $ 5 or $ 20 profit each , way more money was earned on the options market than the actual value of Goldman 's participation in the fraud they 're alleged to have committed .
Based the major sell off and next month 's options activity , traders are expecting Goldman to continue falling over the near future .
International Investigation(s )
And it might not be up to just the SEC to prove a case for systemic fraud .
In fact , they might already have help from German authorities who are in the process of bringing their own legal actions against the investment firm .
A German bank was among the buyers of the intentionally doomed mortgage securities , so one of the most influential governments in the European Union has a reason to take this scam personally .
If there is more dirt to be found on Goldman , I 'm sure they 'd like to help expose it .
Of course we also already knew that Goldman had a hand in the Greece 's deceptive debt accounting and the Federal Reserve claims to be taking care of that investigation , but how long will it be before Greece or France or the U.K. sets up their own investigations in the interest of keeping the EU financially stable ?
I can't give you a date , but EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn promises it will be " profound and thorough . "
Of course , the United Kingdom is the home turf of big banking , so you know when London is talking about sanctions there must be something seriously rotten going on .
Then again , maybe Gordon Brown is just trying to win some election points with tough talk .
The craziest theory With May options investors seeming to expect declines that far exceed the value of the SEC 's entire case , it seems like the craziest conspiracy of all might now be coming to light .
Not only did Goldman Sachs intentionally misrepresent the securities they sold , but this is starting to be perceived as a standard course of action rather than any kind of isolated incident .
With prior executives and directors staffing some of the most influential political positions around the world , they were widely presumed to be immune from this kind of scrutiny and seen as safe a bet as any aggressive growth stock could be .
Instead , whether this was intended as a public relations move or a slap on the wrist , it could have serious implications for Goldman 's ability to acquire clients in the future - or even operate inside certain legal jurisdictions .
As promised , here is the SEC's " other report " from Friday .
No one 's really talking about it so I have n't bothered to read it .
I 'm sure though , that its a great reminder of why the SEC can't ( or wo n't ) actually take on a powerful company on its own until they 're absolutely certain they can win a case .
Inspector General 's Report on S.E.C.'s Stanford Inquiry
Christmas Jobs Hide Decline
Anyone watching the employment reports for the signs of a recovery may have found a bit of happy news this week .
It was reported that only 10,000 jobs were lost in November , and this actually sounds like a pretty good number when its compared to the hundreds of thousands of lost jobs that had become the norm .
Despite this " recovery , " the unemployment rate remains right at 10 % ( although the fact that any total decline in jobs results in an improved unemployment rate is suspect in itself . )
Inside the details of this latest jobs report are some true gems to help us truly understand what is going on with the labor markets in America :
In November , employment fell in construction , manufacturing , and information , while temporary help services and health care added jobs .
Not only are we employing fewer people to build and make stuff , we 're also losing jobs in technology and information services .
The latest trend toward outsourcing is high - tech - and online jobs are increasingly headed to Asia .
Month over month , the absolute number continues decline , and the depth of our current economic troubles becomes clear :
So the only employment " gains " in November are temporary jobs for Christmas - this means ringing cash registers at minimum wage or sitting in a fake beard and asking someone 's kids what they want for Christmas .
At least the department store Santa wo n't have to tell the little ones that they probably wo n't be getting what they want this year ...
Meanwhile , the health industry also continues to grow - a necessary cost but one that is having a disproportionate drain on America 's spending capacity .
Where most nations contain health costs to under 10 % of GDP , we have almost doubled those averages and we 're headed toward a situation where 1 in 5 dollars spent in our economy is for some kind of medicine or medical attention .
Of course that 's great news for anyone in med school , but its bad news for employers or anyone who is paying for insurance out of their own pockets .

There is certainly no shortage of trucking companies in the U.S. right now .
According to the American Trucking Associations , there are almost one million of them scattered throughout the country at the moment .
But there ’s always room for one more .
With about $ 800 billion in revenue generated by the trucking industry every year , there is plenty of trucking work to go around .
Would you like to jumpstart your very own trucking business ?
You should begin by figuring out how to open a trucking company before you break ground on it .
Here are ten simple steps you ’ll want to take to get your new trucking company up and running in no time .
1. Decide Where You ’re Going to Open Your Trucking Company
Are you going to open up a trucking company in your city ?
Or would you be better off going to a different location to open it up ?
You should do your research on the local trucking market and see what kind of shape it ’s in .
If there ’s a real need for trucking companies in your immediate area , you can open your company there .
If not , you may want to look elsewhere .
You should also consider how accessible your location will be for your truckers .
You want to position your company in an area where truckers will have no problem jumping on major highways .
2. Think About What Your Trucking Company Is Going to Haul
Your trucking company can haul any number of things for companies that need trucking services .
From electronics to food , you ’ll be able to choose what you want your trucking company to haul .
It ’s a good idea to do this ahead of time so that you invest in the right trucking equipment for your company ( more on this later ! ) .
If , for example , you ’re going to specialize in picking up and delivering perishable items , you ’ll need to buy or lease at least one refrigerated truck .
3. Come Up With a Great Name for Your Trucking Company
When you ’re in the process of figuring out how to open a trucking company , you ’ll want to brainstorm some ideas for it .
The name should be something catchy that also explains what exactly your company provides .
For some trucking company owners , the name comes organically right away .
Others have to spend more time kicking around ideas before settling on a name they like best .
4. Create an Airtight Business Plan for Your Trucking Company
Once you know where you ’re going to open a trucking company , what it ’s going to haul , and what it ’s going to be called , you can create a business plan for it .
Your business plan should include things like :
Executive summary
Market analysis
Marketing strategies
Revenue projections
Your business plan will set your company up for success .
It ’ll also make it easier for you to obtain funding from investors and lenders if you need money to get your business started .
5. Obtain the Right Licenses and Insurance for Your Trucking Company
There are a number of licenses that trucking company owners need to get to start making pickups and deliveries .
A commercial driver ’s license , better known as a CDL , is one of the necessary licenses , but it ’s far from the only one .
You ’ll also need to get a USDOT number , an MC number , and potentially even an International Registration Plan , depending on whether or not you ’re planning to make trips across state lines .
Additionally , there are many types of insurance that trucking companies should have .
You should consider signing up for liability insurance , cargo insurance , and passenger accident insurance for your business .
6. Purchase or Lease Trucks for Your Trucking Company
It wo n’t be possible to learn how to open a trucking company without trucks .
So make sure you ’re in a position to buy or lease at least one truck for your business .
That truck should be , as we mentioned before , capable of carrying the type of cargo that you plan on hauling .
It does n’t have to be the fanciest truck in the world .
But it should be something that ’s safe and reliable .
Over time , you can add more trucks to your fleet , including one that can carry specialized cargo .
7. Hire Truckers to Work for Your Trucking Company
Outside of investing in trucks for your trucking company , you ’ll need to hire truckers to work for you as well .
Ideally , you should look for experienced truckers with a great driving history .
You may have to pay a little bit extra to attract the best drivers in the business .
It ’ll be well worth it for you to pony up some extra cash to get truckers who will represent your company well .
8. Set Up an Accounting System for Your Trucking Company
You ’re probably not setting up a trucking company because it ’s fun .
You ’re doing it to make money .
Make sure you ’re able to make as much money as you can by creating an accounting system for your business .
Your system should allow you to keep track of all the money coming in and out of your business .
You should also use your accounting system to prevent trucking fraud .
You do n’t want to give fraud a chance to hurt the way your company does business .
9. Market Your Trucking Company ’s Services to Companies in Your Area
You can spend months learning how to open a trucking company , but if you do n’t learn how to market it right once it ’s open , it ’ll all be for naught .
Marketing your trucking company ’s services might involve cold - calling companies in your area that could benefit from them .
It might also involve using social media to your advantage .
Regardless of which approach you take , you should make marketing a top priority .
It ’s what ’s going to bring in business and turn your company into a success story .
10 . Grow Your Trucking Company Slowly
From the start , you ’re going to want to see your company grow by leaps and bounds .
But it ’s important to have realistic expectations for it .
If your company grows too fast , it could actually hurt your business in the long term .
Slow and steady growth will be better for you and will allow you to provide great trucking services to your customers at all times .
Now That You Know How to Open a Trucking Company , Go Get Started
Learning how to open a trucking company is the first step you should take when doing it .
Now that you know the steps you ’ll need to take , get out there and begin taking them .
You can make your trucking company profitable within just a year or two when you approach it right .
You ’ll be amazed by just how lucrative the trucking business can be for the best companies .

Barack Obama has some boning up to do , at least according to Hillary Clinton 's chief spokesman , Howard Wolfson .
Even as Wolfson 's boss , the presidential candidate , and her husband , the ex-president , have been doing their part to fuel speculation about a potential Clinton - Obama Democratic ticket ( see here and here ) , the aide today -- making clear he was speaking for the campaign -- doused some cold water on the notion .
During a conference call with reporters , Wolfson said : “ We do not believe at this point that Sen. Obama has passed that key commander - in - chief test ” that Clinton would require for a running mate .
But the aide held out the prospect that Obama could buff up his resume and meet the threshold ( whatever it is ) between now and the party 's national convention in Denver in late August .
Perhaps he has a reading list that he can provide Obama ( who late last week sought to scotch the prospect that he would be willing to play second fiddle to Clinton ) .
More on Wolfson 's comments can by found in this Chicago Tribune post .

Barbara Bush 's younger brother Scott Pierce was a financial executive .
She attended a suburban day school , Rye Country Day , and then Ashley Hall , a Charleston , South Carolina , boarding school .
She enjoyed athletics and reading , but not so much her academic subjects .
Marriage and Family
Barbara Bush met George H. W. Bush at a dance when she was 16 and he was a student at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts .
They were engaged a year and a half later , just before he left for Naval pilot training .
He served in World War II as a bomber pilot .
Barbara , after working retail jobs , enrolled at Smith College and was captain of the soccer team .
She dropped out in the middle of her sophomore year when George returned on leave in late 1945 .
They were married two weeks later and lived on a number of naval bases in their early marriage .
After leaving the military , George H. W. Bush studied at Yale .
The couple 's first child , a future president , was born during that time .
They had six children together , including daughter Pauline Robinson , who died of leukemia at age 4 in 1953 , and two sons who went on to have political careers of their own — George Walker Bush ( born 1946 ) , who was the 43rd U.S. president , and John Ellis ( Jeb ) Bush ( b. 1953 ) , who was governor of Florida from 1999 – 2007 .
They have three other children : businessmen Neil Mallon ( born 1955 ) and Marvin Pierce ( born 1956 ) , and philanthropist Dorothy Walker LeBlond Koch ( born 1959 ) .
They moved to Texas and George went into the oil business , and then into government and politics .
Barbara busied herself with volunteer work .

She dealt with it by making speeches about her time in China and doing volunteer work .
George H.W. Bush ran in 1980 as a candidate for the Republican nomination for president .
Barbara made clear her views as pro-choice , which did n't align with President Ronald Reagan 's policies , and her support of the Equal Rights Amendment , a position increasingly at odds with the Republican establishment .
When Bush lost the nomination to Reagan , the latter asked Bush to join the ticket as vice president .
They served two terms together .

Hospitalized and near the end of her life , she refused further curative treatment for her congestive heart failure and COPD , and died shortly afterward , on April 17 , 2018 .
Her husband outlived her by only about six months .
Outspoken and sometimes criticized for her bluntness — she called then - candidate Donald Trump a " misogynist and hate monger " — Bush was very popular with the public , especially compared to her predecessor Nancy Reagan .
She also made some remarks considered insensitive about the victims of Hurricane Katrina and her husband 's invasion of Iraq .
But since 1989 , her Foundation for Family Literacy has partnered with local organizations and raised more than $ 110 million to create and expand literacy programs across the country .

LIJIAZHUANG VILLAGE , China–On a sunny afternoon on the parched plains of drought - stricken Hebei province , Fan Xiangnu , a solid , straight - talking grandmother of 63 , grits her teeth , and sums up the local environmental situation as well as any high - priced consultant .
" There 's just no water , " she says bluntly , squinting into the sunshine .
" So there 's no wheat . "
As she speaks , just 300 metres away a legion of labourers is hard at work building a broad canal to transport desperately needed water supplies .
But the canal wo n't supply her family – or those of the other parched peasants in this community .
Instead , the canal will take 300 million cubic metres of Hebei 's remaining waters and rush them some 300 kilometres north to Beijing .
It 's all part of the national effort to prepare for the Olympic Games .
The central government wants Beijing green and gleaming come August .
Green and gleaming it will be – even if it means others may have to go without .
A government slogan painted on a nearby wall trumpets the goal , urging everyone to support the project to " guarantee a secure water supply for the Olympics . "
Booming Beijing 's historic thirst – the parched capital has long depended on Hebei for its water – continues to reach ever deeper into the Chinese countryside .
The coming of the Olympics will spike that thirst with added demand – about 30 per cent during the Games .
But slaking it has come with consequences .
More than 20,000 people have been displaced by the canal ; local wells have been disrupted ; and many here have been left scrambling to scratch out a living .
Beijing may be dry , and the games are clearly important .
But Hebei is battling its own " severe drought , " a local official told reporters here this week .
For locals , the digging of the canal has compounded their problems .
The construction project has disrupted the water table .
" Look at how dry this land is , " says Kang Guomin , a 53 - year - old former wheat farmer turned part - time construction worker .
With his own well completely dried up , he now buys supplies from other peasants and has it transported by truck , he says
As Kang explains his plight , standing next to a set of cracked mud cellars made for mushroom cultivation , a knot of locals gathers .
One woman complains that her well too went dry and she had a new and deeper one dug .
" The old one was 20 metres deep , " she says .
" The new one had to go 40 metres deep before they hit water . "
The new well cost the equivalent of about $ 285 – a sizeable sum in the countryside .
Was she compensated ?
She laughs .
" I had to pay that out of my own pocket , " she says .
But to its credit , the government has paid for local land expropriated in order to build the canal .
Kang Jinghao , a 36 - year - old father of four , said he was paid about $ 4,285 for his small farm that was unfortunately located directly in the path of the canal .
" I 'm not sure if that was for one year or two years – or if it is a lifetime payment , " says Kang .
" They did n't make it clear . "
Like a few other families in the area , he has now turned to mushroom farming to survive .
" How can I possibly make enough to support a family of four growing mushrooms ? " he asks .
But the environmental troubles in drought - stricken Hebei are by no means an isolated instance .
The entire north of China has been wracked by water shortages for years and the building of the canal to bring " emergency " supplies of water to Beijing has shone a much needed light on China 's overall water troubles .
The canal is actually part of a much larger plan called the North - South Water Diversion Project .
The overall plan , which was originally championed by late leader Mao Zedong , is to try to divert water from the water - rich south to China 's water - poor north .
Earlier this year , with the Olympics approaching , government officials ordered that the portion of the project bringing water to Beijing from Hebei – originally scheduled to be completed by 2010 – was to be speeded up and completed before the Games .
" The current situation constitutes a crisis for Beijing , " says environmental engineer Wang Jian , who for years worked for the Beijing Environmental Protection Administration .
" And at this time there really is no long - term solution . "
For years Beijing 's population growth and its water supplies have been going in completely opposite directions , Wang explains .

Today the city 's water reserves are drastically drying up ; Beijing is overdrawing ground water ; and its population continues to explode .
In 1911 , Beijing was home to just 1.1 million .
By 1976 , it had grown to about 7 million .
But in the last 32 years , the city has become home to another 10 million people , with an overall population today of 17.4 million .
Meanwhile , says Wang , the city 's two main reservoirs , Guanting , completed in 1954 and Miyun , completed in 1960 , today cumulatively hold less than 15 per cent of their capacity .
In fact , of a system of 16 reservoirs around the city that can hold a total capacity of 9.6 billion cubic metres of water , current reserves now stand at just 1.2 billion – 13.5 per cent of capacity .
As a consequence , Beijing is drawing more and more ground water .
Environmentalists note Beijing should be able to safely draw ground water at a rate of 2.45 billion cubic metres per year .
But available data show it is currently drawing at a rate of between 2.65 to 2.7 billion , says Wang .
He cites as well plans for the development of a Greater Beijing that will rival Shanghai as the nation 's economic engine .
Where , he asks , will the water resources come from to support such continued expansion ?
" It 's worrying , " he says .
Zhang Junfeng , who monitors China 's rivers for the non-governmental Green Earth Volunteers , says the water scarcity in China " defies imagination . "
" I think people are putting too much hope in the South - North Water Diversion Project , " he observes , poring over a relief map in his tiny office in Beijing 's Anzhenli district .
" Because of persistent drought , reservoirs can't meet needs ... ground water is being over exploited ... people have to dig new and deeper wells .
" This is a problem that can't simply be solved by ingenuity , " he says , adding he believes Beijing may be " doomed . "
But more hopeful , is Ma Jun , arguably China 's most famous environmentalist .
His groundbreaking 1999 book , China 's Water Crisis , has been compared with Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring .
" The water brought from the south of China will not be able to solve all of our problems .
It will only fill part of the gap , " he says .
There 's nothing unusual about the diversion project , he notes .
It 's not unique to China .
In the United States , engineers are diverting the Colorado River to supply Arizona and California .
In Spain a similar project is underway .
" In Canada , of course , with such a small population and huge water resources , you do n't have to worry about such things .
But the rest of the world is n't like that .
" For us , in the long run though , it 's got to be about conservation , rather than expanding supply .
Because there just wo n't be enough supply , " he says .
" There 's a limit . "

A forklift draped in a French flag knocked over the village sign

A Swiss village has vowed to continue fighting to keep using its name - Champagne - on local wine .
In a traditional Swiss open - air vote , members of the community agreed to fight an attempt to stop them using the name by the French wine - growing area .
Under trade laws , the use of the name is limited to products from the French region famous for its sparkling wine .
Under a deal between the Swiss and the EU , the village was supposed to stop using the name in 2004 .
Loss of identity " In this village we no longer have the right to use our own name , " Thomas Bindschedler , spokesman of the village action committee , told the meeting .
" In a market where consumers are increasingly concerned with the accountability of producers , that is fatal . "
A mechanical excavator covered with a French flag dug out the sign bearing the name Champagne at the entrance of the village in a symbolic protest at the community 's loss of identity .
Mr Bindschedler said the village used to sell 110,000 bottles of wine a year , but that fell to 32,000 last year after the wine was sold in bottles that did not say where they were produced , the Reuters news agency reported .
The Swiss protest comes after a Parisian bakery was legally challenged over selling biscuits labelled " Champagne recipe " .
Villagers said the name of the settlement had been Champagne since 885 and the first records of wine being grown in the village dated back as far as 1657 , Reuters reported .
Mr Bindschedler said the village did not want to stop sparkling wine makers in France from using the Champagne moniker .

Recently , I talked about a faster , cheaper way to calculate Fibonacci numbers .
One of the optimizations I made was to remember the value of each Fibonacci number : since F ( 7 ) is always 13 , instead of recalculating it each time N=7 , we can stuff 7 -> 13 into a look - up table for future reference .
The function builds up a cheat - sheet , to avoid doing the re-work .
It remembers .
This is called memoization , and it ’s a nice way to trade memory for performance .
But it only works when the function always returns the same answer for a given set of arguments — otherwise it ’s first - in wins , forever .
This property of a function , returning the same answer for the same args , is called referential transparency .
A Sample Implementation
There are lots of ways you could memoize a function .
Hash tables are a natural choice , since they map a key to a value , just like functions map arguments to a value .
Even if you implement it differently , a hash table is a good working model for memoization .
Let ’s briefly consider factorials .
The regular version :
class Unmemoized def factorial ( n ) puts n if n < 1 1 else n * factorial ( n - 1 ) end end end unmemoized = Unmemoized.new 5.downto(1 ) { |i| puts " \t#{unmemoized.factorial ( i) } " }[/sourcecode ] ... and the memoized version : [ sourcecode language= ' ruby ' ] class Memoized attr_reader : factorial_memo def initialize @factorial_memo = {} end def factorial ( n ) puts n unless @factorial_memo.has_key ?
n if n < 1 @factorial_memo[n ] = 1 else @factorial_memo[n ] = n * factorial ( n - 1 ) end end @factorial_memo[n ] end end memoized = Memoized.new 5.downto(1 ) { |i| puts " \t#{memoized.factorial ( i) } " } puts memoized.factorial_memo.inspect[/sourcecode ]
Printing the hashtable is especially telling : < code >{5= > 120 , 0=>1 , 1= >1 , 2= >2 , 3= >6 , 4=>24}</code >
It reads like a look - up table for factorials .
< h4 > Memoization in Facets </h4 >
As relatively easy as that example is , it has its drawbacks : we need to track our previous results in a separate variable , the memoization code is mixed up with the actual calculation ( the part we care about ) , we can't easily use it with other functions , and the pattern only works for functions of one argument .
< a href = " http://facets.rubyforge.org/ "
>
Facets </a> makes memoization trivial , and removes all these issues .
require ' facets / memoize ' class FacetsMemoized def factorial ( n ) puts n if n < 1 1 else n * factorial ( n - 1 ) end end memoize : factorial # <= HINT end facets_memoized = FacetsMemoized.new 5.downto(1 ) { |i| puts " \t#{facets_memoized.factorial ( i)} " }[/sourcecode ]
In case you missed it , this is just like < code > Unmemoized < / code > above , except we added line 13 , < code > memoize : factorial </ code >... that 's it .
Just like < code > attr_reader </ code > and friends , you can pass a list of symbols to < code > memoize < / code > , and it'll work on functions with any number of arguments : require ' facets / memoize ' class Memoized Math def add(n , m ) n + m end def mult ( n , m ) n * m end memoize : add , : mult end
When You Might Use Memoization , and What to Avoid
There are a number of places where this is useful : calculating a value by successive approximation , finding the path to the root node in an immutable tree structure , finding the Nth number in a recursively - defined series , even simple derived values ( like ‘ abc’.upcase ) .
In general , a function is a good candidate if it only looks at its arguments ( no global , class , or member variables , no files or databases ) — especially if those arguments are immutable .
Relying on side - effects ( printing to standard out , writing to a database or file , or updating a variable ) in memoized methods is a bad idea : they ’ll only happen the first time your method is called with those arguments , which is probably not what you intend .
( Unless you ’re printing the arguments to illustrate how memoizing works . )
On the other hand , relying on side - effects is generally a bad idea anyway .
Even if you do n’t use a functional programming language , you can still benefit from minimizing state changes .

While using these signs to catch a liar takes extensive training and practice , it 's no longer only for authorities like Newberry .
Now , the average person can become adept at identifying dishonesty , and it 's not as hard as you might think .
Experts tell WebMD the top 10 ways to let the truth be known .
How did Newberry reach this conclusion ?
The answer is by recognizing telltale signs that a person is n't being honest , like inconsistencies in a story , behavior that 's different from a person 's norm , or too much detail in an explanation .
J.J. Newberry was a trained federal agent , skilled in the art of deception detection .
So when a witness to a shooting sat in front of him and tried to tell him that when she heard gunshots she did n't look , she just ran -- he knew she was lying .
Tip No. 1 : Inconsistencies
" When you want to know if someone is lying , look for inconsistencies in what they are saying , " says Newberry , who was a federal agent for 30 years and a police officer for five .
When the woman he was questioning said she ran and hid after hearing gunshots -- without looking -- Newberry saw the inconsistency immediately .
" There was something that just did n't fit , " says Newberry .
" She heard gunshots but she did n't look ?
I knew that was inconsistent with how a person would respond to a situation like that . "
So when she was n't paying attention , he banged on the table .
She looked right at him .
" When a person hears a noise , it 's a natural reaction to look toward it , " Newberry tells WebMD .
" I knew she heard those gunshots , looked in the direction from which they came , saw the shooter , and then ran . "
Sure enough , he was right .
" Her story was just illogical , " says Newberry .
" And that 's what you should look for when you 're talking to someone who is n't being truthful .
Are there inconsistencies that just do n't fit ? "
A federal judge has blocked a mining company from exploring for any further uranium near the grand Canyon .
Several groups had sued the U.S. Forest Service for backing the plan without full environmental reviews .
U.S. District Court Judge Mary Murguia of the U.S. [ social_buttons ]
District Court in Arizona issued a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction stopping the drilling late last week .
“ The Grand Canyon is too important for the Forest Service to give short shrift to the possible and significant negative impacts of uranium mining exploration , ” said Sandy Bahr , conservation outreach director for the Sierra Club ’s Grand Canyon Chapter .
“ The Forest Service should take a hard look at the impacts and the public should have an opportunity to review and comment on this mining exploration , ” added Bahr .
The Forest Service approved the drilling in December , using a so - called categorical exclusion , a decision which required only minimal environmental review .
In issuing the recent injunction , Judge Murguia essentially rejected the use of the categorical exclusion by the Forest Service .
The Sierra Club , along with the Center for Biological Diversity , and the Grand Canyon Trust banded together last month to sue the Forest Service for not conducting a thorough review of the environmental impacts of the uranium mining .
The groups were able to sue under the Administrative Procedure Act that governs proper bureaucratic protocol , as in cases that involve the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) [ read more about the essentials of NEPA ] .
All signs indicate that there will most likely be an appeal .

There may have been more but records are incomplete and no thorough investigation has been undertaken .
The McGraths learned about the uranium site from newspaper articles , and started their own research .
" It was a devastating shock , " said Katie McGrath , who is considering legal action .
" We 've had a pretty horrendous life as a result of both our parents dying .
We 're not living in the past but I do believe we owe it to them to find out what really happened .
It 's important for other people who may have been affected as well . "
Tests undertaken several times since the mid-1960s have confirmed that radiation levels are higher than average background levels but NSW Health has repeatedly declared the site safe .
There is no proven link between the radioactive waste under the street and cancer deaths there .
Greg McGrath , 44 , remembers his father digging vegetable patches in the large block .
He said his parents were restaurateurs and " very into food .
They used to grow their own food at home in the vegetable patch .
When we heard about the radioactivity , stomach cancer and leukaemia , suddenly it seemed to make a lot of sense . "
Tests in the 1970s concluded that eating a few sprigs of parsley a week would eventually mean a person would exceed the safe limits of radiation contamination .
But the then NSW Health Commission told residents at the time there was no need to worry .
Correspondence since found in the National Library includes a letter telling officials to " stall and be non-committal " when asked about the danger .
Fabian McGrath was also a builder , and his son recalls him excavating for additions to their home , including digging deep into the earth to construct a retaining wall .
" I 'm angry because we were n't made aware of any risk , " he said .
" Our parents obviously would n't have moved there if they had known . "
Michael Richardson , the state Liberal MP who has been campaigning for comprehensive radiation tests and a thorough clean - up , wants free medical testing for all former and current residents of the street .
" Morris Iemma must make a decision , " he said .
" This stuff is deadly and it 's becoming more deadly as time goes on . "
A radiological survey ordered in February , undertaken by personnel from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation , apparently showed little radiation danger , though the results have not been made available to the public .
NSW
Health did not say whether the tests included digging below the ground ; radiation levels increase dramatically at a depth of half a metre .
" Results of the testing undertaken at three sites have been provided to the individual property owners , " said a spokesman for NSW Health .
" An offer was made for NSW Health representatives to meet with these owners to discuss the results .
" Overall , the results indicate that people living in Nelson Parade should have no health concerns .
Exposure levels fall within ARPANSA [ Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency ] recommendations for general public exposure . "
No more tests would be undertaken , he said .
The State Government plans to dig out the radioactive waste - thousands of tonnes of processed uranium tailings , thorium and radium - and sell the site for housing .
At least three others fell victim to cancer , according to correspondence between NSW Health Department officials , dated from the 1960s - when some former residents had begun to suspect that there were too many tragedies for a normal street .
One former resident , Gerald Conlan , succumbed to lymphatic leukaemia in 1987 , after a 15 - year battle with the illness .
The house , nicknamed " Radium " , where he had lived with his wife , Joan , was bought by the then NSW Health Commission and demolished .
Next door , Andrew McClure had lived with his daughter , a Mrs Lucas .
Like Iris and Fabian McGrath , they grew vegetables in their large garden .
Mrs Lucas died of stomach cancer in 1962 , nine years after her father succumbed to leukaemia in his new home , in Gladesville .
Her brother , Archibald McClure , died in 1956 .
A former neighbour recalled that he had died of bone cancer but his death certificate attributes the cause to tuberculosis and a pulmonary infection .
Other family members reported having wounds that would not heal .
WASHINGTON  While Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama fight over who has the better health plan for the uninsured , they say little about a more immediate challenge that will confront the next administration , whether Democratic or Republican : how to tame the soaring costs of Medicare and Medicaid .
The two programs , for older Americans and low - income people , cost $ 627 billion last year and accounted for 23 percent of all federal spending .
With no change in existing law , the Congressional Budget Office says , that cost will double in 10 years and the programs will account for more than 30 percent of the budget .
Economists and health policy experts say the federal health programs are unsustainable in their current form , because they are growing much faster than the economy or the revenues used to finance them .
The Medicare program is especially endangered ; its hospital insurance trust fund is expected to run out of money in 11 years .
But the need for cutbacks is not a popular theme for political candidates wooing voters who want more care at a lower cost .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The sun is starting to grow jobs .
While interest in alternative energy is climbing across the United States , solar power especially is rising in California , the product of billions of dollars in investment and mountains of enthusiasm .
In recent months , the industry has added several thousand jobs in the production of solar energy cells and installation of solar panels on roofs .
A spate of investment has also aimed at making solar power more efficient and less costly than natural gas and coal .
Entrepreneurs , academics and policy makers say this era ’s solar industry is different from what was tried in the 1970s , when Jerry Brown , then the governor of California , invited derision for envisioning a future fueled by alternative energy .
They point to companies like SolarCity , an installer of rooftop solar cells based in Foster City .
Since its founding in 2006 , it has grown to 215 workers and $ 29 million in annual sales .
“ It is hard to find installers , ” said Lyndon Rive , the chief executive .
“ We ’re at the stage where if we continue to grow at this pace , we wo n’t be able to sustain the growth . ”

BRASILIA ( Reuters ) - Twelve South American countries founded a union on Friday aimed at boosting economic integration and political cohesion , but the region ’s bitter rivalries stymied ambitious plans on defense and trade .
Chile 's President Michelle Bachelet ( R ) , Bolivia 's President Evo Morales ( L ) and Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attend a news conference in the South American Union of Nations ( UNASUR ) summit at the Itamaraty Palace in Brasilia May 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Roberto Jayme
The heads of states signed a treaty that creates the South American Union of Nations , or Unasur , as well as plans for energy , infrastructure and financing projects .
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hailed Unasur , which aspires to become like the European Union , as a sign that South America was becoming a “ global actor ” and said the differences between governments were a sign of vitality .
“ The instability some want to see in our continent is a sign of life , especially political life , ” he said .
“ There ’s no democracy without people ( protesting ) in the streets . ”
Unasur includes a rotating presidency , biannual meetings of foreign ministers and a parliament in Bolivia , marking progress toward greater unity in a region that is enjoying a period of relative economic stability .
As the major regional power , Brazil has for years been trying to unite South America as a counterbalance to U.S. and European economic interests in the region .
But South America has been strained by political divisions pitting U.S. critics such as Bolivia and Venezuela that favor state intervention in the economy against market - friendly countries like Chile and Colombia , with closer U.S. ties .
The new group falls short of ambitious plans for economic and security integration , including the original intention to merge the South American customs union Mercosur and the Andean Community trading bloc .
Unasur members are Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Paraguay , Peru , Suriname , Uruguay and Venezuela .
‘ DEAD POINT ’
Colombia turned down the presidency because of its tensions with Venezuela and Ecuador and rejected a Brazilian proposal to create a regional defense council .
Chile will lead the group first instead .
Colombia says its problems with terrorism make military cooperation difficult , in a reference to the FARC rebel group , whose fighters it has accused Ecuador of harboring .
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said after a meeting with Lula that Unasur members should classify as terrorists all groups that violently attack democracy in the region .
Unlike Colombia , Brazil and other countries in the region do not consider the FARC a terrorist group .
“ Unfortunately our relations with the Colombian government are in a very deplorable situation , at a dead point , ” Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa told reporters .
Former Ecuadorean President Rodrigo Borja turned down the post of secretary - general , saying it lacked decision - making powers .
Despite the obvious tensions at the summit , leaders said it was an important step forward for a region that has rarely spoken with one voice .
“ Unasur means that we can be a global actor , that we have a single voice that can be heard , ” Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said .
After Colombia ’s rejection of the defense council , the other 11 members agreed to establish a task force to present a revised proposal within 3 months .
Lula met the region ’s more radical left - wing leaders of Venezuela , Ecuador and Bolivia before the summit , urging them to put aside differences with other countries in the region , a senior diplomat told Reuters .
Venezuela blamed Washington on Friday for fueling disputes through its ally Colombia .
“ The empire is counter - attacking ... Washington is rebuilding the oligarchies ” in South America , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said in a TV interview after the summit .
The United States is mobilizing oligarchies and opposition politicians in Bolivia and Argentina , he said .
Some parents do n't know when to let go
Parents are increasingly involved in their children 's university and even career choices , Liverpool University 's head of careers and employability says .
Dr Paul Redmond claims some parents even contact their sons ' or daughters ' employers to negotiate pay rises .
This can backfire as most bosses want independent - minded workers , he added .
Some are even negotiating pay rises for them - it's like having a footballer 's agent
Dr Paul Redmond
Dr Redmond said " helicopter parents " who " hover " over their offspring intervening in their lives far more than in any previous generation were increasingly being seen on university campuses .
" They 're much more involved in all aspects of their lives - they help them to get to university and even help them get jobs when they graduate . "
He added : " Employers are saying to me that parents are contacting them with regard to their sons ' or daughters ' careers .
" Some are even negotiating pay rises for them - it 's like having a footballer 's agent . "
" We have even had the phenomena of parents attending careers fairs around the country - and doing most of the talking on behalf of their son or daughter . "
He even identifies five types of meddling parents with labels like the Agent , the Bodyguard and the Banker .
" Helicopter parents " are so common among the middle classes that universities are now having to produce teams of family liaison officers to deal with them .
And some are now even producing parent packs , he said .
' Umbilical cord '
He said careers departments were now having to sit down with parents and tell them straight that , despite their best intentions , they could be doing more harm than good .
" The problem is it could potentially harm their employment prospects as employers want graduates who are self - reliant , " he said .
" We are worried about the impact .
It 's great to have parental support but sometimes it 's better to leave the parents at home . "
Students were often now tied to their parents by what is " surely the longest umbilical cord in history " - the mobile phone .
But perhaps surprisingly , Dr Redmond says , the offspring of helicopter parents tend to be completely unabashed about their ever - increasing involvement in their affairs .
Cash money
" It 's a generational thing , Generation Y - those born from the 1980s onwards - have a completely different relationship with their parents from Generation X - those born in between the mid-1960s and the 1980s . "
" Generation X would have been appalled at the idea . "
The extra involvement is also down to the marketisation of academia as a result of university fees , Dr Redmond said .
" They pay the money ; they expect to see results . "
But helicopter parents are also a product of government policies encouraging increased parental involvement at school and college .
In a blog for the Guardian website , Dr Redmond describes the five different types of " helicopter parents " that now characterise England 's higher education system .
They are :
The Agent Having an Agent helicopter parent is like having Max Clifford working for you round the clock - for free .
They operate like a footballer 's agent : fixing deals , arranging contracts , smoothing out local difficulties .
It 's the Agent 's job to represent his or her client at events which , for whatever reason , the client feels are simply too tedious to attend .
The Banker Accessible online , face - to - face or via a personal hotline , the Banker is unique in the world of financial services for charging no APR , asking few if any questions , expecting no collateral , and being psychologically inclined to say " yes " no matter how illogical or poorly articulated the request .
The Banker is also resigned to never seeing loans repaid .
The White Knight Imbued with an almost semi-mythical status , the White Knight parent appears at little to no notice to resolve awkward situations .
Once resolved , the White Knight will fade anonymously into the background .
Intervention is accomplished silently and with minimum fuss .
The Bodyguard
The primary function of the Bodyguard is to protect the client from a range of embarrassing social situations - such as cancelling appointments and soaking up complaints on behalf of their client .
Particularly skilled in constructing elaborate excuses .
When not protecting life , limb and reputation , doubles up as a chauffeur and personal assistant .
The Black Hawk Named after the military helicopter , and dreaded by teachers and educational administrators , the Black Hawk is unique among helicopter parents due to their willingness to go to any lengths - legal or illegal - to give their offspring a positional advantage over any competition .
Particularly lethal when elected to parent - teacher associations .

A hypothetical calculation of Pac - Man's , er , metabolic functions , it became one of Kotaku 's all - time humor classics .
It 's re-presented here , updated for the site 's current design , with a gallery now featuring two alternate , unpublished images .

My brother , Fletch , and I were 8 and 6 years old , respectively , when Pac - Man debuted .
As this IM conversation demonstrates , to this day we approach the game with the same wide - eyed curiosity and emotional maturity as we did in 1980 .

Owen : hey , pac-man question : how big were the dots and the energizers , in pixels
10:02:08 AM
Fletch :
You mean on the original video game screen ?
10:02:16 AM
Owen : yeah , 2x2 for dots , and roughly 8x8 for the energizers ?
10:02:20 AM
Fletch : i guess .
I do n't have bionic graphic measurement powers
10:02:37 AM
Owen : I 'm trying to figure how big a shit Pac - Man would take after one board .
( you 've been warned ... )
10:03:15 AM
Fletch : Is n't this begging the rather obvious question of the location of pac -man 's anus ?
10:03:30 AM
Owen : ...
10:04:21 AM
Fletch : I 'm betting Pac anatomy would confound human xenobiologists
10:04:24 AM
Owen : o_O

10:05:06 AM
Owen : OK now , normal digestion , how much gets metabolized , how much is dookie , rough percentages .
10:05:25 AM
Fletch : dunno , never saw pac-crap
10:06:14 AM
Owen : neither have i , stupe .
10:06:18 AM
Fletch : do we assume Pac's GI tract is reg'lar ?
Getting enuf dietery fiber ?
10:06:22 AM
Owen : this is for mature , healthy , nonsmoking male pac-adult
10:06:30 AM
Fletch : that 's the only way the word ' mature ' ever gets into this conversation
10:07:00 AM Fletch : BRB

10:10:41 AM
Fletch : OK , there are 266 dots on a screen
10:10:50 AM
Fletch : roughly 2x2 , so 4 pixels per dot
10:10:53 AM
Owen : you google that ?
10:11:00 AM
Fletch : no- found a screeencap of the whole board at wikipedia , so I counted em
10:11:05 AM
Owen : got damn you hardco
10:11:56 AM
Fletch : nowait , I miscounted - thought the board was quadrilaterally symmetrical , but its only bilateral
10:12:05 AM
Owen : O_o
10:12:30 AM
Fletch :
Ok dot count is 240 - x 4 pixels is 960
10:12:38 AM
Owen : alright , now the ghosts
10:12:47 AM
Fletch : ghosts do n't count towards crap , they ghosts .
10:13:04 AM
Owen : no , he consumes their ghost costume but not their eyeballs .
it 's roughage .
10:13:17 AM Fletch : THEY GHOSTS
10:13:30 AM
Owen : " ghost - monsters " according to teh cartoon
10:13:38 AM
Fletch : Cartoon ai n't canon
10:13:46 AM
Owen : o_O

10:13:56 AM
Owen : fine fuck the ghosts .
10:14:09 AM
Fletch : damn straight .
Now : energizers are 9x9 - minus 12 for the corners , so that 's 69 .
10:14:21 AM
Fletch : x 4 equals 276
10:14:29 AM
Owen : wat about cherries
10:15:07 AM
Owen : you get two of those per board
10:15:08 AM
Fletch : they ain't on my screengrab
10:15:16 AM
Owen : well dammit find another
10:16:50 AM
Fletch : OK 98 pixels for cherries x 2 is 196
10:17:05 AM
Owen : OK so that 's 960 pixels for the dots , 276 for the energizers , 196 for the two fruit .
i get 1432 pixels total consumed .
now , let 's say it 's one of those high speed versions like we played at the pizza hut .
so he 's burning a ton of calories , and all of this stuff is super nutritious .
and plus he reserves some that he 'll convert to mass for when he goes supersize to chase blinky at the first intermission .
so all but 25 pct is left in his intestines .
that leaves :
10:17:25 AM
Fletch : 358 pixel pac turd .
let 's say 360 .
what 's the square root of 360
10:17:34 AM
Owen : uh ...
10:22:50 AM
Owen Good went away
10:22:55 AM
Fletch : ohfercrissake
10:22:56 AM
Owen Good ( auto response ) I am away from my computer right now .
10:22:59 AM
Owen Good came back
10:23:01 AM
Owen : uhhhh ... 11 ?
10:23:22 AM
Fletch : 18.97 , Mister Maf .
10:23:28 AM
Owen : close enough

10:23:35 AM
Fletch : so let 's call it a square 19 pixels on each side
10:23:37 AM
Fletch : now how big is pac .
I 'm betting he ain't that big
10:23:52 AM
Owen : 16x16 at the max .
10:23:59 AM
Fletch : 14x14 .
plus his butthole has to be only two or three pixels wide
10:24:09 AM
Owen : owwwwwwwwwww
10:24:30 AM
Fletch : so it ai n't gonna come out square , it 's going to be a big long squirt - dookie

The Big Apple has a new logo , and Apple says : Drop dead .
At issue is the emblem for New York City 's GreeNYC campaign , which has started to appear around the city on bus shelters , hybrid gasoline - electric taxicabs and even Whole Foods shopping bags .
The GreeNYC logo shows a stylized apple with a stalk and a leaf .
It bears a resemblance to Apple 's famous logo – a resemblance Apple says infringes on its trademark .
The city has applied for a trademark on the logo , but Apple has filed a formal opposition ( .pdf ) obtained by Wired.com .
The Cupertino , California , company calls for the trademark to be denied , claiming the city 's logo will confuse people and " seriously injure the reputation which [ Apple ] has established for its goods and services . "
New York says : Getdafugoutaheya .
" The city believes that Apple 's claims have no merit and that no consumer is likely to be confused , " says Gerald Singleton , the intellectual - property lawyer representing the Big Apple .
" This well - known city is using its new design in a variety of contexts that have absolutely nothing to do with Apple Inc . "
Apple , of course , is no stranger to trademark disputes , but has typically been on the receiving end of infringement claims .
Apple Corps , holder of the Beatles ' business interests , battled the company for years over its trademark .
That legal spat was finally resolved last year , with Apple walking away with the entire brand and an apparent agreement to license certain trademarks back to Apple Corps .
Cisco Systems also filed suit over Apple 's use of the iPhone trademark last year , and both companies finally agreed to share the iPhone name .
" When you talk about trademark infringement , the key issue is likelihood of confusion , " says Beth Goldman , an attorney at Heller Ehrman and head of the firm 's San Francisco trademark group .
Trademark protection extends to sight , sound and meaning , Goldman says , and if a company can prove there 's confusion over such matters , it may very well have a case .
In the case of very famous marks or logos , there 's also the issue of dilution , she says , when someone else uses it in a manner that blurs or tarnishes the trademark .
Dilution is harder to prove with a logo , Goldman says , as it's not usually descriptive of a product .
Nevertheless , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will consider such arguments .
NYC & Company , the nonprofit responsible for the city 's official tourism website , applied for a trademark on the new logo on May 14 , 2007 .
The company and its lawyers have filed a counterclaim asking that Apple 's trademark registration for its apple logo be canceled .
Apple did not immediately respond to Wired.com 's requests for comment .
The GreeNYC campaign is intended to promote " environmentally friendly policies and practices " and " economically sustainable growth . "
The next step in the Apple - New York City trademark scuffle , according to trademark lawyers , will be to commission a series of independent surveys – what are known as mall - stop surveys – to gauge people 's reaction to the new logo , in order to see whether Apple 's opposition holds any merit .
" The ultimate arbiter is the consumer , " Goldman says .
Singleton says the dispute will play out over the next six to nine months , before a final decision is made by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the patent office .
During a recent visit to MSI here in Taiwan , we learnt of an interesting and new technology which they are working on with another Taiwanese company called Polo - Tech .
It all falls under their ECO friendly design program .
It is still very much a work in progress but from the working concept design we saw in action at the MSI HQ , it is probably not far off from becoming a reality - we hope so too .
What are we talking about here anyway ?
Since power saving is such a hotly discussed topic , MSI has employed the Stirling Engine Theory to power a cooling fan without the need of conventional electricity .
Heat is transferred from the motherboard northbridge chipset and through the Stirling Engine Theory it is able to spin the cooling fan and cool down the heatsink .
MSI commented that they would probably end up adding the world 's first powerless air cooler to an Nvidia motherboard , which everyone found rather amusing .
MSI sent us over a demonstration video of how the theory works in practice and I uploaded it to YouTube .
Good on you MSI - we 'll save this planet one PC at a time if we must !
SAMAKE BAKARY sells rice from wooden basins at Abobote market in the northern suburbs of Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire .
He points to a bowl of broken
Thai rice which , at 400 CFA francs ( roughly $ 1 ) per kilogram , is the most popular variety .
On a good day he used to sell 150 kilos .
Now he is lucky to sell half that .
“ People ask the price and go away without buying anything , ” he complains .
In early April they went away and rioted : two days of violence persuaded the government to postpone planned elections .
“ World agriculture has entered a new , unsustainable and politically risky period , ” says Joachim von Braun , the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) in Washington , DC .
To prove it , food riots have erupted in countries all along the equator .
In Haiti , protesters chanting “ We 're hungry ” forced the prime minister to resign ; 24 people were killed in riots in Cameroon ; Egypt 's president ordered the army to start baking bread ; the Philippines made hoarding rice punishable by life imprisonment .
“ It 's an explosive situation and threatens political stability , ” worries Jean - Louis Billon , president of Côte d'Ivoire 's chamber of commerce .
Last year wheat prices rose 77 % and rice 16 % ( see chart 1 ) .
These were some of the sharpest rises in food prices ever .
But this year the speed of change has accelerated .
Since January , rice prices have soared 141 % ; the price of one variety of wheat shot up 25 % in a day .
Some 40 km outside Abidjan , Mariam Kone , who grows sweet potatoes , okra and maize but feeds her family on imported rice , laments : “ Rice is very expensive , but we do n't know why . ”
The prices mainly reflect changes in demand — not problems of supply , such as harvest failure .
The changes include the gentle upward pressure from people in China and India eating more grain and meat as they grow rich and the sudden , voracious appetites of western biofuels programmes , which convert cereals into fuel .
This year the share of the maize ( corn ) crop going into ethanol in America has risen and the European Union is implementing its own biofuels targets .
To make matters worse , more febrile behaviour seems to be influencing markets : export quotas by large grain producers , rumours of panic - buying by grain importers , money from hedge funds looking for new markets .
Such shifts have not been matched by comparable changes on the farm .
This is partly because they cannot be : farmers always take a while to respond .
It is also because governments have softened the impact of price rises on domestic markets , muffling the signals that would otherwise have encouraged farmers to grow more food .
Of 58 countries whose reactions are tracked by the World Bank , 48 have imposed price controls , consumer subsidies , export restrictions or lower tariffs .
But the food scare of 2008 , severe as it is , is only a symptom of a broader problem .
The surge in food prices has ended 30 years in which food was cheap , farming was subsidised in rich countries and international food markets were wildly distorted .
Eventually , no doubt , farmers will respond to higher prices by growing more and a new equilibrium will be established .
If all goes well , food will be affordable again without the subsidies , dumping and distortions of the earlier period .
But at the moment , agriculture has been caught in limbo .
The era of cheap food is over .
The transition to a new equilibrium is proving costlier , more prolonged and much more painful than anyone had expected .
“ We are the canary in the mine , ” says Josette Sheeran , the head of the UN's World Food Programme , the largest distributor of food aid .
Usually , a food crisis is clear and localised .
The harvest fails , often because of war or strife , and the burden in the affected region falls heavily on the poorest .
This crisis is different .
It is occurring in many countries simultaneously , the first time that has happened since the early 1970s .
And it is affecting people not usually hit by famines .
“ For the middle classes , ” says Ms Sheeran , “ it means cutting out medical care .
For those on $ 2 a day , it means cutting out meat and taking the children out of school .
For those on $ 1 a day , it means cutting out meat and vegetables and eating only cereals .
And for those on 50 cents a day , it means total disaster . ”
The poorest are selling their animals , tools , the tin roof over their heads — making recovery , when it comes , much harder .
Because the problem is not yet reflected in national statistics , its scale is hard to judge .
The effect on the poor will depend on whether they are net buyers of food or net sellers ( see article ) ; for some net buyers , the price rises may be enough to turn them into sellers .
But by almost any measure , the human suffering is likely to be vast .
In El Salvador the poor are eating only half as much food as they were a year ago .
Afghans are now spending half their income on food , up from a tenth in 2006 .
On a conservative estimate , food - price rises may reduce the spending power of the urban poor and country people who buy their own food by 20 % ( in some regions , prices are rising by far more ) .
Just over 1 billion people live on $ 1 a day , the benchmark of absolute poverty ; 1.5 billion live on $ 1 to $ 2 a day .
Bob Zoellick , the president of the World Bank , reckons that food inflation could push at least 100 m people into poverty , wiping out all the gains the poorest billion have made during almost a decade of economic growth .
Small is fairly beautiful
In the short run , humanitarian aid , social - protection programmes and trade policies will determine how well the world copes with these problems .
But in the medium term the question is different : where does the world get more food from ?
If the extra supplies come mainly from large farmers in America , Europe and other big producers , then the new equilibrium may end up looking much like the old one , with world food depending on a small number of suppliers and — possibly — trade distortions and food dumping .
So far , farmers in rich countries have indeed responded .
America 's winter wheat plantings are up 4 % and the spring - sown area is likely to rise more .
The Food and Agriculture Organisation forecasts that the wheat harvest in the European Union will rise 13 % .
Ideally , a big part of the supply response would come from the world 's 450 m smallholders in developing countries , people who farm just a few acres .
There are three reasons why this would be desirable .
First , it would reduce poverty : three - quarters of those making do on $ 1 a day live in the countryside and depend on the health of smallholder farming .
Next , it might help the environment : those smallholders manage a disproportionate share of the world 's water and vegetation cover , so raising their productivity on existing land would be environmentally friendlier than cutting down the rainforest .
And it should be efficient : in terms of returns on investment , it would be easier to boost grain yields in Africa from two tonnes per hectare to four than it would be to raise yields in Europe from eight tonnes to ten .
The opportunities are greater and the law of diminishing returns has not set in .
Unfortunately , no smallholder bonanza is yet happening .
In parts of east Africa , farmers are cutting back on the area planted , mostly because they cannot afford fertilisers ( driven by oil , fertiliser prices have soared , too ) .
This reaction is not universal .
India is forecasting a record cereal harvest ; South African planting is up 8 % this year .
Still , some anecdotal evidence , plus the general increase in food prices , suggests that smallholders are not responding enough .
“ In a perfect world , ” says a recent IFPRI report , “ the response to higher prices is higher output .
In the real world , however , this is n't always the case . ”
Farming in emerging markets is riddled with market failures and does not react to price signals as other businesses do .
This is true to a certain extent of farming in general .
If you own a toy factory , or an oilfield , and the price of toys or oil rises , you run the factory night and day , or turn the taps full on .
But it always takes a season to grow more food , which is why farm prices everywhere tend to be “ sticky ” : a 10 % increase in prices leads to a 1 % increase in output .
But the food crisis of 2008 suggests farm prices in developing countries may be stickier than that .
The quickest way to increase your crop is to plant more .
But in the short run there is only a limited amount of fallow land easily available .
( The substantial unused acreage in Brazil and Russia will take a decade or so to get ready . )
For some crops — notably rice in East Asia — the amount of good , productive land is actually falling , buried under the concrete of expanding cities .
In other words , food increases now need to come mainly from higher yields .
Yields cannot be switched on and off like a tap .
Spreading extra fertiliser or buying new machinery helps .
But higher yields also need better irrigation and fancier seeds .
The time lag between dreaming up a new seed and growing it commercially in the field is ten to 15 years , says Bob Zeigler of the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) in the Philippines .
Even if a farmer wanted to plant something more productive this year , and could afford to , he could not — unless research work had been going on for years .
It has not .
Most agricultural research in developing countries is financed by governments .
In the 1980s , governments started to reduce green - revolutionary spending , either out of complacency ( believing the problem of food had been licked ) , or because they preferred to involve the private sector .
But many of the private firms brought in to replace state researchers turned out to be rent - seeking monopolists .
And in the 1980s and 1990s huge farm surpluses from the rich world were being dumped on markets , depressing prices and returns on investment .
Spending on farming as a share of total public spending in developing countries fell by half between 1980 and 2004 .
This decline has had a slow , inevitable impact .
Creating a new seed is a bit like designing a flu vaccine : you need to keep updating it , or pests and disease will negate its effectiveness .
When the rice variety IR8 was introduced in 1966 , it produced almost ten tonnes per hectare ; now it yields barely seven .
In developing countries between the 1960s and 1980s , yields of the main cereal crops increased by 3 - 6 % a year .
Now annual growth is down to 1 - 2 % , below the increase in demand ( see chart 2 ) .
“ We 're paying the price for 15 years of neglect , ” says Mr Zeigler .
Alterations in the structure of farming have exacerbated the effects of underinvestment .
Farming is just one part of a food chain that stretches from fertiliser and seed companies at one end to supermarkets at the other .
In the past , the end of the chain nearest consumers was less important .
Food policy meant improving links between farmers and suppliers .
The Green Revolution of the 1960s , for example , provided new seeds and subsidised fertilisers .
Malawi is doing something similar now .
But over the past decade , the other end of the chain has come to matter more .
The main reason why Kenyan and Ethiopian farmers planted less this year was not just that fertilisers were expensive , but that farmers could not get credit to finance purchases .
Supermarkets are also more important to farmers than they used to be , accounting for half or more of food sales , even in many developing countries .
Success in patches
In theory , the growing importance of traders and supermarkets ought to make farmers more responsive to changes in prices and consumer tastes .
In some places , that is the case .
But supermarkets need uniform quality , minimum large quantities and high standards of hygiene , which the average smallholder in a poor country is ill equipped to provide .
So traders and supermarkets may benefit commercial farmers more than smallholders .
To make matters worse , smallholdings are fragmenting in many countries .
Because of population growth and the loss of farmland , the average farm size in China and Bangladesh has fallen from about 1.5 hectares in the 1970s to barely 0.5 hectares now ; in Ethiopia and Malawi , it fell from 1.2 hectares to 0.8 in the 1990s .
By and large , the smaller the farm , the greater the burden of the cost of doing business with big retailers .
Smaller smallholders are also at a disadvantage in getting loans , new seeds and other innovations on which higher yields depend .
Reuters
A burden to afford
Such bottlenecks and market failures make it harder for smallholders to respond to higher prices , even without the multiple distortions that governments also introduce into world food markets .
They mean the transition to a new equilibrium will be prolonged and painful .
But they do not mean it will not happen .
Lennart Båge , the head of the International Fund for Agricultural Development , a UN agency in Rome , argues that if farmers can keep the higher prices , they will overcome the problems that beset them .
As he points out , India feeds 17 % of the world 's people on less than 5 % of the world 's water and 3 % of its farmland — and , along with China , is seeing its cereal crop rise this year .
Similar success stories are cropping up , in patches .
Despite East Africa 's problems , Ethiopia this week opened its own commodity exchange , a rare thing on the continent , in an attempt to improve the markets that connect farmers and traders .
The spread of mobile phones also relays market information more widely .
In landlocked Malawi , it costs almost as much to ship maize to and from world markets as it does to grow it locally , so Malawian farmers have found it hard to export their surplus even with prices high .
But partly because of the political disaster of Zimbabwe , regional markets are now springing up out of nowhere in southern Africa — and Malawi 's farmers are selling there .
Moreover , technological improvements are still pushing through the neglected soil .
Mr Zeigler reckons IRRI has enough tinkerings in the pipeline to increase yields by one or two tonnes a hectare .
And if European countries relax their hostility to genetically modified organisms , crop scientists could do things — such as redesigning photosynthesis in plants — which could boost yields 50 % or more .
Between November 2007 and February 2008 , rice exports from Thailand ( the world 's biggest exporter ) were running at 1 m tonnes a month — an unprecedented bonanza .
But for even for producers and traders , the blessing was mixed .
Some farmers sold their crop before prices soared .
Millers tried to keep supplies back , waiting for higher prices .
The government capped exports below last year 's levels .
The secretary - general of the Thai rice exporters ' association told IRRI that “ We do n't know where the 2007 harvest is . ”
Vichai Sriprasert , a big exporter , describes the Thai rice market using language that , elsewhere , is literally true .
“ This is a crucial time , ” he says .
“ It will tell the story of who will survive and who will not survive . ”
How To Fight A Speeding Ticket – 5 Ways Police Radar Can Malfunction
By Richard Gringer
Traffic tickets are extremely common and costly !
A person getting a traffic ticket happens nearly every 3 seconds around the World and 90 % of people admit guilt right when they are pulled over .
That is a HUGE mistake !
How to fight the ticket is on everyone ’s mind as soon as they are pulled over but they NEVER actually know how .
They let the state and government win without a fight which you could EASILY win !
Have you heard of traffic ticket scam ?
Well I am sure you have and that ’s what these cops are doing to you out on the road !
You must fight back against all speeding tickets especially .
Beating a traffic ticket is easy if you play your cards right and here is how .
Many police officers radar units fail and here is 5 reasons why :
1. Panning –
This happens when the hand held unit is swept across the dashboard of the car or the control unit mounted to the dash of the car .
2. Mechanical interference – the air conditioning or heating fan in the police car , alternator , ignition noises , rotating signs near the roadway , anything mechanical that
is operating in the vicinity of the roadway can throw off the readings .
3 . Shadowing – all moving radar units have this problem since the targeted speed is calculated by subtracting the speed of the police car from the closing speed of the target .
4 . Batching – this error is caused when the police car is either slowing down or accelerating when the radar unit is still calculating the speed of the targeted vehicle .
5. Radio or Microwave interference – any outside source of a frequency transmission such as a CB radio , Ham or police radio , radar from a local airport , cell phones , power lines , neon or mercury vapor lights , power sub stations , etc. , any one of these interference ’s can throw off the calculations of the radar unit .
In addition to these errors listed above , there are several ways that police officers can actually cheat on the reading .
This has come about because some smaller communities have found that traffic tickets are an extremely effective way to raise money for their budget .
These intentional errors may include the following :
1. Target one vehicle that is speeding and give out many speeding tickets to other people .
2 . Whistle into the CB on the patrol car which will give out a high frequency pitch and will alter the speed that shows up on the radar unit .
3 . Aim the unit at the ground and swing the unit up into the air .
4 . Clock an airplane that ’s flying very low .
5 . Set the car mounted unit to calibrate and the unit will register whatever the patrol car vehicle ’s speed is at the time .
So as you can see , the number one error that people make when getting a speeding ticket is admitting guilt .
Once you admit guilt you have absolutely no chance to win in court !
Fighting traffic tickets is a MUST everyone should know , it would save you over $ 1200 over the course of a few years for learning to fight just ONE ticket .
Richard Gringer has been successfully teaching people all over America how to fight a [ http://www.trafficticketeliminator.com]traffic ticket .
He has compiled an award winning course that exposes [ http://www.trafficticketeliminator.com]fighting a speeding ticket .

Engineers are putting a high - tech spin on some old - fashioned items .
Researchers at UC Santa Barbara and Germany ’s Saarland University have found ways to use cameras and telescopes to transform everyday objects into data hacking devices .
It seems simple , but it ’s actually a pretty complex process .
The first concept uses standard web cams to watch someone ’s fingers moving across his keyboard .
UC Santa Barbara engineers created special software called Clear Shot that then translates those movements into words .
“ One of the most effective ways to protect electronic communication is the use of cryptography - based mechanisms , ” the UCSB study reads .
“ However , encrypting the communication does not help in protecting one ’s physical environment . …
Our goal was to recover all the information entered by the user through the keyboard . ”
The systems proved to be not entirely foolproof , but accurate enough to get a fairly good idea of what any given person was typing .
Now enter phase two : the telescopes .
The scientists from Saarland found they could aim the scopes at anything from glasses to spoons or even an eyeball and catch a reflection from a nearby computer screen .
They could then read text on the screen and see what the computer ’s user was doing .
“ Our work … exploits the visual emanation of the screen itself … in combination with everyday objects that are located in close proximity to the screen , ” the study reads .
A Saarland professor tells Network
World the idea came to him during lunch one day , when he suddenly noticed all the window reflections around campus .
“ It started as a fun project , ” he says in Network World ’s report .
“ We thought it would be kind of cute if we could look at what these people are working on . ”
The professor goes on to explain that he found with a $ 500 telescope , he could read text in a 12 point font from up to 16 feet away by looking at a reflection in a teapot .
A more expensive telescope , he says , allowed him to accomplish the same thing from six times the distance .
“ If you place a sphere close by , you will always see the monitor , ” he tells Network World .
“ You do n’t have to be lucky . ”
The researchers are working on further improving the technology .
They also say they ’ve pitched the concepts to at least one government agency .
Of course , protecting yourself from these attacks is n’t too tough .
The UCSB team even details it in their research :
“ Even though the automatic recognition of the keys pressed by a person based on video information only is a very complex and challenging task , preventing this attack is easy , ” they write .
“ The obvious solution is to place some kind of physical shield over the keyboard so that the keys can be seen only by the typist .
This technique is sometimes used to protect keypads used to enter PINs at ATMs and POSs .
However , this type of protections are not widely used for computer keyboards . ”
I smell a million dollar idea waiting to be claimed .
We 're guessing Mr. Baldwin is not next in line for Season 6 of The Apprentice .
Ask him if you have to eat on the table , or if he 's washed it .
Being a typical male , he 'll probably laugh , and you can sort it out in a comedic manner .
Or you could ask him what 's for dinner , if it would be the same thing he was telling you about having / eating there ?
( I know eating a girl out is n't sex , I 'm not stupid .
You just have to word it right . )
The authors behind a specific strain of malware are trying every trick in the book to get users to succumb to their ill - meaning plans .
You name it , they 've used it : weather news , personal greetings , reports that Saddam Hussein is still alive , reports that Fidel Castro is dead , sexy women , YouTube , and even blogs .
The group seems hellbent on creating the largest botnet to date , and they just might do it .
The " Zhelatin gang " — named after the trojan it installed — was responsible for what started out as the " storm worm . "
First spotted earlier this year , the spread of the " storm worm " started via e-mails purporting to provide information on some dangerous storms in Europe at the close of January .
Users who fell for it were directed to a web site containing malicious code aimed at turning Windows PCs into spam bots .
It was a success , if you can call it that ; Symantec security response director Dave Cole told InformationWeek in late January that the worm had accounted for 8 percent of global virus infections after a single weekend rampage .
Over time , e-mails containing links to the " storm worm " took on many forms , from supposed missile strikes to reports of genocide .
Then last month security firm F - secure noted that the Zhelatin team had switched gears and was focusing on greeting - card spam .
The e-mails originally directed users to a web site that prompted the download of ecard .exe , but eventually morphed slightly so that the link pointed to a site that claimed the user needed to install " Microsoft Data Access " in order to view the card .
Naturally , this download installed a trojan on the user 's computer for the purposes of relaying spam .
And that 's when the changes began to speed up .
Zhelatin changed its game mid-week to suggestive e-mails from lonely females , which prompted end users to click a link to see what they could do if they " get lonely . "
Days later , however , security firm Sophos noted that the e-mails had changed once again , this time to spam claiming to contain a link to an awesome new video on YouTube .
Same tactic , same virus .
The " Blogging " worm
But if promises of Kelly Clarkson 's latest music video in e-mail were n't enough , the worm has now switched its focus to blogs .
Unlike the typical " comment spam " that many of us have grown used to on our personal blogs , the worm is actually getting into people 's Blogspot accounts and creating new blog posts with links to the trojan .
Security software firm Sunbelt Software speculates that the posts are being made through Blogspot 's mail - to feature , where users can e-mail their blog entries to specific addresses in order to have them posted to their blogs .
This theory seems to make the most sense , as the worm would just need to comb the user 's local contact list and send itself out to everyone on the list , including Blogspot .
Heise Security notes that not all of the links work : " they appear to be referencing dynamically assigned IP addresses of infected computers and these computers are at the time either offline or have already been assigned a different IP address . "
We may never know whether the Zhelatin gang even meant for the worm to spread to blogs , but the group is probably happy that it did .
Heise estimates that , as of early August , 1.7 million computers were infected worldwide as part of a massive botnet , and that number has surely escalated since then .
Heise warns that this size could prove a very dangerous threat : " [ A ] lthough the network has so far been primarily used to send spam , it could also be used for DDoS attacks on businesses or even countries . "
Just how many computers are part of the botnet is anyone 's guess , but estimates from some security firms are reaching as high as 10 million .
Just last June the FBI warned that it had discovered more than a million PCs in a botnet .
This looks to be just the tip of the iceberg .
British cheerleaders banned from Indian cricket show
' because their skin was too dark '
Two cheerleaders hired to entertain crowds at India 's Twenty20 cricket premier league have accused organisers of racism .
Ellesha Newton and Sherinne Anderson say they were banned from performing because they had " dark skin " and told to sit out of the opening routine at the India Premier League 's inaugural match in Chandigarh .
They said they were left sobbing as Team Chennai and Team Mohali took to the field and that event organisers told them only " white girls " would be allowed to perform .
Ms Newton , 22 , from Islington , said they had been called " n*****s " and banned from performing .
Racism claim : Sherinne Anderson says that only white girls were allowed to perform for crowds at India 's Twenty20 cricket premier league
She said : " An organiser pulled us away .
He said the people here do n't want to see dark people .
The n***** word was used and they said they only wanted beautiful white girls . "
Ms Anderson , 25 , from Hayes , added : " This kind of thing has never happened to us not in Europe , not here , nowhere .
We are offended . "
The girls had been hired by Fierce Performance Productions which has offices in London and Bombay .
Director Jorge Aldana said the girls were eventually allowed to take part as cheerleaders after he intervened with local officials .
Several of India 'sTwenty20 cricket teams have hired American and British cheerleaders , including a number of black African - Americans , but this is the first allegation of racism .
The raunchy routines have caused outrage in the country , where protesters condemned their introduction as an insult to traditional Indian modesty .
Now India 's Twenty20 organisers are braced for a fresh and potentially more damaging row over the cheerleaders ' allegations .
Women 's rights groups in India have condemned the organisers , and called for action to be taken .
The All India Democratic Women 's Association , said : " Stopping anyone performing on the basis of colour of skin is not only illegal but unconstitutional .
Racism is rarely discussed in India , but African visitors and immigrants from Nepal face regular abuse .
The event management firm Wizcraft today denied the allegations and accused the women of having " an ulterior motive " for making them .
A spokesman said : " They are totally fabricated . "
1897 : Dr. John Kellogg , believing that a strict diet ( along with vigorous exercise , fresh air and plenty of rest ) benefits the patients at his sanitarium in Battle Creek , Michigan , serves up the world 's first corn flakes .
Kellogg was a Seventh - Day Adventist and a passionate adherent of the " healthy living " tenets of the church , which embraced a holistic approach to health in the days when there were no antibiotics and few effective drugs of any kind .
He carried his beliefs with him into his professional life as a doctor and surgeon .
The corn flakes he served at his Battle Creek Sanitarium ( the word " sanitarium " having been coined by Kellogg ) were sugarless , that is to say nearly tasteless , and meant not to fill you up but to round out a healthy diet .
His brother , Will , was the one who recognized and exploited the commercial value of corn flakes .
He added sugar to the flakes and sold the stuff as breakfast food , deeply offending the sensibilities of John , and causing a fallout between the brothers that became a legal battle when John sued to stop Will from marketing the cereal .
Needless to say , John lost .
And Will marketed as few had ever done .
His signature became the company logo , and he devoted millions to advertising .
In 1911 , he put up the world 's largest electric sign in Times Square in New York City : 80 feet by 160 feet , with the letter K in Kellogg standing more than 60 feet high .
John Kellogg , meanwhile , was a prolific author of medical books and used the royalties to subsidize his sanitarium , which became a working laboratory for putting his theories on healthy living into practice .
The sanitarium , which he billed as a " place where people learn to stay well , " became famous – for the services , not the corn flakes – and attracted a mainly wealthy clientele , who tended to check in for several weeks at a time .
Kellogg was no slouch as a surgeon , either , introducing new techniques ( primarily to abdominal surgery ) and performing more than 22,000 operations in a career spanning nearly seven decades .
The sanitarium operated at its original site until 1942 , a year before Kellogg 's death at 91 .
The government acquired the main building and used it as a medical facility for veterans of World War II and the Korean War .

The Judicial Conference ’s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure submitted its proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 502 dealing with “ Attorney - Client Privilege and Work Product ; Limitations on Waiver ” to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees .
See S. 2450 .
After receiving the proposed rule from the Judicial Conference ’s Rules Committee , the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the ABA for its view on the proposed rule .
After conferring with the leaders of the ABA Litigation Section ( principal sponsor of the ABA main policy on FRE 502 ( b ) ) and a subcommittee of the ABA Task Force on Attorney - Client Privilege , the ABA submitted a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on December 7 endorsing proposed FRE 502 .
See ABA Letter to SJC re 502 .
The ABA Litigation Section sent supplemental letters in support of legislation to implement proposed FRE 502 to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on December 10 .
Several other coalition groups , including ACC and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , also submitted separate letters to Congress endorsing the legislation .
After receiving this substantial input , Senators Leahy and Specter introduced legislation on December 11 , 2007 , S. 2450 , which would adopt proposed FRE 502 as submitted by the Judicial Conference ’s Rules Committee .
A copy of S. 2450 is attached .
It is expected that the legislation will advance following the current recess of Congress , though it is unknown whether the Senate will hold hearings or vote on the bill without hearings .

WASHINGTON  A plurality of Americans say Gen. David Petraeus ' proposal to begin withdrawing some U.S. forces from Iraq is on the right track , but his long - awaited testimony to Congress last week failed to change fundamental attitudes toward the war .
A USA TODAY / Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday found essentially no shift in views on whether U.S. forces are likely to win the war — two - thirds predict they wo n't — and if the United States should set a firm timetable to remove troops .
In the days before Petraeus ' appearances and President Bush 's speech to the nation last week , 60 % supported setting a timetable for withdrawal and sticking to it " regardless of what is going on in Iraq at the time . "
Now 59 % do .
The findings underscore how attitudes toward the war have solidified 4½ years after the U.S. - led invasion .
" In terms of public opinion , it seems like Petraeus did n't really change anyone 's mind , " says Christian Grose , a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who studies the impact of the war on voting behavior .
" He may have bought the president some time in Washington … but not in the public 's eyes . "
The number of Americans who say it was a mistake to send troops to Iraq ticked up to 58 % from 54 % in the USA TODAY Poll a week earlier .
The results are consistent with a Pew Research Center poll taken last week .
In that poll , 57 % of those who heard something about Petraeus ' report approved of his recommendations , but just 16 % said his testimony made them more optimistic about the war .
Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , told House and Senate panels that as many as 7,000 U.S. troops could be withdrawn this year .
By July , he said , the additional U.S. forces deployed this year could be pulled out , leaving about 130,000 U.S. troops on duty there .
" President Bush has accepted Gen. Petraeus ' recommendations to bring troops home , based on the return on success our troops have achieved in Iraq , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said when asked about the poll findings .
" The plan is to continue to solidify that success and push the trend lines to steeper gains so that the Iraqis get the reconciliation and less violence they need and deserve , and so that eventually , based on conditions , even more of our troops can return home . "
In the USA TODAY / Gallup Poll :
• Forty - three percent say Petraeus ' plan would withdraw " the right amount " of troops ; 36 % say it withdraws too few ; 9 % says it withdraws too many .
Similarly , 42 % say the plan would withdraw troops at the right pace ; 33 % call it too slow ; 12 % call it too fast .
• An overwhelming majority wants more U.S. pressure for political progress in Iraq .
Seven in 10 say the United States is n't doing enough to hold the Iraqi government accountable .
• Among those who support a timetable to pull out U.S. troops , 70 % prefer a gradual withdrawal , 30 % an immediate one .
That reflects a slight shift — albeit within the survey 's margin of error — toward gradual withdrawal .
• Neither Bush nor congressional Democrats get high marks as someone who can be trusted to recommend the right thing on Iraq .
Congressional Democrats are trusted by 35 % , Bush by 27 % .
More than one in four trust neither .
The partisan divide on that question is extraordinarily sharp : Just 4 % of Democrats trust Bush to recommend the right thing ; just 9 % of Republicans trust congressional Democrats to do so .
Only one in 10 Americans trust both .

Maryellen Martin , Manchester , NH – At the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention , Saturday , in spite of every possible roadblock thrown in her path by party leaders to prevent it , Rep. Betty Hall ’s Resolution to Commence Impeachment Procedures was adopted .
The message sent by the people is the first step of this Constitutional Procedure – BEGIN INVESTIGATIONS NOW to determine if there is sufficient cause / evidence to hold our current elected leaders in Washington responsible .
The Governor came and went , Howard Dean came and went , the same for the Congressional candidates and state politicos during a long stint in a packed gymnasium on a glorious spring weekend day which began at 8:30 am .
In the very last minutes of the convention , about 4:00 pm , the Democratic party leaders let the vote for the Hall Impeachment Resolution and the town of Newbury Accountability Resolution take place .
Representative Betty
Hall gave 2 of her 3 allotted minutes to the only speaker who was merely a citizen delegate .
She was the people ’s one lone grassroots speaker , who was not a leadership pick or an official .
Her name is Nan ; imagine her lone , quiet voice finally getting a chance to say something after all the “ notables ” .
She spoke , and even sang her support , and the room erupted !
Betty Hall ’s impeachment resolution asking for the support of the Democratic Party of NH passed .
The people ’s voice was finally heard !
Unlike the rest of the day , it was an unscripted , spontaneous expression of celebration , standing and cheering in support of Rep .
Hall ’s resolution to begin investigations and , at the very least , lay out the facts .
The delegates heard what they wanted to hear and with their vote confirmed , they want truth and accountability from our government !
Above the heads of the speakers was a huge banner that read : HOPE LEADERSHIP VICTORY .
The peoples ’ delegates proclaimed all three .
The People Get It .

It was apparently not enough Gary Talis was attacked and punched by John Lovetro for making the mistake of asking the women of the Bush crime family a question about 9/11 truth and the illegal and immoral Iraq occupation .
Witness Dianne Lipson took this photo of John Lovetro , restrained after attacking We Are Change activist Gary “ German ” Talis .
Now , according to the neocon newspaper the New York Post , Talis was “ arrested after he punched ” the “ wheelchair - bound girl whose parents had told him to shut up ” for “ heckling , ” i.e. , asking questions of the Bush women .
As Jason Bermas noted on the Alex Jones Show today , Gary Talis is non-violent and not likely to attack or yell obscenities at a girl with cerebral palsy confined to a wheelchair .
But this is precisely what the New York Post and a gaggle of neocon blogs and websites claim :
They [ Talis and We Are Change activists ] had been in the audience to hear the Bushes talk about their children ’s book , “ Read All About It . ”
“ He began yelling about Iraq and Iran at Jenna Bush .
She was waving at the crowd .
I told the guy , ‘ What are you doing ?
Shut up .
This is about a child and books , ’ ” said John Lovetro .
“ He was unperturbed .
I said , ‘ Get out of here !
You ’re being a moron ! ’ ” The next thing he knew , Talis was allegedly punching Maureen – a fan of the first lady since meeting her in 2004 .
“ I heard my daughter hysterical yelling , ‘ He ’s hitting me ! ’ ” said Wendy Lovetro .
“ He punched her on the shoulder blades , but that was n’t enough , ” she said .
“ My husband pushed the wheelchair away from him and he reached beyond my husband and began pounding my daughter in the thigh . ”
The two men fought as the president ’s family drove off .
Cops broke them up and busted Talis on charges of assault and resisting arrest .
Maureen was not seriously injured .
According to Gary Talis , Maureen Lovetro , who suffers from cerebral palsy , was used by her father as a weapon .
This account is at odds with a version presented by other witnesses .
Dianne Lipson emailed the following account to Jones Report editor and journalist , Aaron Dykes :
The event was over but the Bush ladies were still in the venue , the 92nd Street Y. I was with Gary and another member of WAC .
People were being told to wait behind a secret service agent or to cross the street .
A small group of people were gathered behind the agent to catch a glimpse of the Bush ladies when they would be going from the building into a waiting black van .
Gary was exercising his free speech rights , talking to the crowd .
The mood of the crowd was hostile toward Gary .
Among the waiting crowd was a man in a blue jacket and a woman , obviously his wife , and their teenage daughters , one of whom was in a wheelchair .
The man in the blue jacket was taking particular offense at what Gary was saying .
He even made threatening gestures at Gary .
At one point he cocked his fist at Gary , with an odd little half smile on his face , like he wanted trouble .
Gary and the man had words .
I was very surprised to see this man make threatening gestures at Gary while his family , including his daughter in the wheelchair , were right there .
The Bush ladies came out .
Gary asked them how they felt knowing that people thought that Bush was responsible for 9/11 .
He had to shout , as the Bush ladies were some yards away .
Then it was all over , the van pulled out and people were walking away .
The man in the blue jacket was pushing his daughter ’s wheelchair .
Instead of going straight up the street , he veered over to the side of the building to where Gary was .
Next thing I know , he caught Gary in a corner of the building and was whaling on him , saying that Gary had touched his daughter .
I know Gary , and he would never do something like that .
Gary ’s instinct is to protect women and children .
He had Gary in the corner , and was punching him and punching him .
If Gary managed to defend himself I did not see it .
The man ’s wife was pleading with him to stop .
The daughter in the wheelchair was in tears .
Then the police came and put Gary , not the man who assaulted him , but Gary , in handcuffs .
I went to the 19th precinct to make a statement .
They told me to wait .
The man who assaulted Gary was in the lobby area where I was , not back where Gary was in custody .
A policeman photographed Gary ’s assailant several times , then let him go .
I did not see a mark on this man .
Later I heard he had a split lip , but I did not see a mark on him .
Gary , I heard , was bruised up .
I am not surprised .
The man punched Gary over and over again .
So I waited over 2 hours , only to be told that I could not make a statement .
I still do n’t quite fully understand why .
From what I observed , the man who assaulted Gary was looking for a fight , and he actually exploited his physically challenged daughter , steering her wheelchair toward Gary , in order to fabricate an excuse to physically vent his anger .
Lipson ’s account is completely at odds with the version published in the New York Post , a well known venue for attacking truth and patriot movement activists .
Appearing on the Alex Jones Show , Dianne Lipson reiterated her account and told Jason Bermas she fears for Gary in the wake of the New York Post ’s hit piece .
Gary Talis also appeared on Jones ’ show .
He emphatically stated he did not assault the handicapped girl .
In fact , he said , John Lovetro used his daughter “ as a weapon ” against him , ramming the wheelchair into his kneecaps and accusing him of attacking the girl .
Talis told Bermas he believes the attack was coordinated .
Now that the neocon media network and blogs have kicked into high gear , the larger , neocon - friendly corporate media will likely characterize Talis and We Are Change at large as violent and dangerous , exactly as Glenn Beck , Morning Joe , Geraldo Rivera , and Bill O’Reilly have suggested , sans any evidence whatsoever .
Now they have “ evidence ” in the form of a skewered and biased report published in the New York Post and swiftly echoed by the likes of Michelle Malkin , the concentration camp apologist and neocon who routinely appears on Faux News .
Note : the author of the New York Post article is Philip Messing .
His email is : [ email protected ] .
Please write him and ask him to tell both sides of the story in the name of objective journalism .
I know , this is the New York Post , after all .
Remember to be polite and to the point .

The presidential hopeful will make his hip - hop debut on the US rapper 's next release due out in July
This article is more than 12 years old
This article is more than 12 years old
Barack Obama seems keen to add " hip - hop cameo " to the Related Experience section of his presidential candidate CV .
A Tribe Called Quest 's Q - Tip has enlisted the help of the American senator on his forthcoming album .
This July , Q - Tip will release The Renaissance , his first official album in nine years .
It includes guest appearances by D'Angelo , Norah Jones and Q - Tip 's former Tribesman Raphael Saadiq , but the most unexpected contributor is Obama , who speaks throughout one song .
" I 've got Norah Jones on there , but Barack is the big one .
You 'll see what happens , I can't reveal too much , " said Q - Tip .
The decision to release an album heavy on surprising guest appearances is an intriguing one .
The rapper has been bouncing from label to label for some time , and his last two albums - Kamaal the Abstract , from 2002 , and Open , from 2005 - were only available as bootlegs .
Nigel Godrich , the bleepy - bloopy producer behind Radiohead , Travis and Beck , will produce Q - Tip 's next - but - one album , with recording to take place this year .
English - born Godrich officially received his hip - hop cred when Q - Tip , in an interview with the LA Times this week , called him " really dope " .
" He 's a big fan of rap , " Q - Tip said .
" It 'll be cool working with him . "
The process will also be documented in a film .
Hopefully , Q - Tip will also approach Obama for the Godrich - produced follow - up .
We can't wait to hear that Illinois drawl cut up and looped into a Thom Yorke whine .
Then again , maybe we 're in no rush .
I was up late on IM with a much - younger computer programmer and he asked “ Damn , there ’s a lot going on .
Is it always like this ? ”
Well , no , it has n’t been .
But in the future , it may be .
Near as I can tell , we ’re simultaneously at inflection points in programming languages and databases and network programming and processor architectures and Web development and IT business models and desktop environments .
Did I miss anything ?
What ’s bigger news is that we might be inflection - point mode pretty steadily for the next few years .
Programming Languages ·
Up till not too damn long ago , for a big serious software project you could pick Java or .NET or , if you really liked pain , C ++.
Today you ’d be nuts not to look seriously at PHP , Python , and Ruby .
What ’s the future mind - share of all these things ?
I have no idea , but that decision is being made collectively by the community right now .
By the way , on this subject , check out the Interview with the TIOBE guy ; interesting stuff , even though I disagree with some .
Databases · CouchDB. SimpleDB. BigTable .
Need I say more ?
No , I do n’t think relational databases are going away anytime soon .
But I think that SQL ’s brain - lock on the development community for the past couple of decades has been actively harmful , and I ’m glad that it ’s now OK to look at alternatives .
Will the non-relational alternatives carve out a piece of the market ?
I suspect so , but that decision is being made by the community , right now .
Network Programming · CORBA is dead .
DCOM is dead .
WS -* is coughing its way down the slope to dusty death .
REST , they say , is the way to go .
Which I believe , actually .
Still , there ’s not much yet in tooling or best practices or received wisdom or blue - suit consultants or the other apparatus of a mainstream technology .
So what are they going to be teaching the kids , a few years hence , the right way is to build an application across a network full of heterogeneous technology ?
That ’s being worked out by the community , right now .
Processors · Moore ’s law is still holding , but the processors get wider not faster .
Now that the best and the brightest have spent a decade building and debugging threading frameworks in Java and .NET , it ’s increasingly starting to look like threading is a bad idea ; do n’t go there .
I ’ve personally changed my formerly - pro-threading position on this 180 º since joining Sun four years ago .
We still have n’t figured out the right way for ordinary people to program many - core processors ; check out the inconclusive results of my Wide Finder project last year .
( By the way , I ’ve now got an Internet - facing T2000 all of my own and will be re-launching Wide Finder as soon as I get some data staged on it ; come one , come all ) .
And I ca n’t even repeat my crack about the right answer being worked out right now , because I ’m not actually sure that anyone has a grip on it just yet .
But we ’re sure enough at an inflection point .
Web Development · Used to be , it was Java EE or Perl or ASP .
NET .
Now all of a sudden it ’s PHP and then Rails and a bunch of other frameworks bubbling up over the horizon ; not a month goes buy that I do n’t see a bit of buzz over something that includes the term “ Rails - like ” .
It seems obvious to me that pretty soon there ’s going to be a Rails + + that combines the good ideas from RoR with some others that will be obvious once we see them .
Also , that some of those “ Rails - like ” frameworks , even if they ’re not a huge step forward , will get some real market share because they ’ll have some combination of of minor advantages .
Once again , I ca n’t say it ’s being worked out right now , because for right now I see a pretty uniform picture of Rails ’ market share advancing steadily .
It wo n’t last .
Business Models · Servers , they ’re easy to understand .
Blue - suited salesmen sell them to CIOs a few hundred thousand dollars ’ worth at a time , they get loaded into data centers where they suck up too much power and HVAC .
Well , unless you ’re gonna do your storage and compute and load - balancing and so on out in the cloud .
Are you ?
The CIOs and data - center guys are wrestling this problem to the ground right now .
And as for software , used to be you shipped binaries on magnetic media and charged ’em a right - to - use license .
Nope , nowadays it ’s open - source and they download it for free and you charge them a support contract .
Nope , that was last century ; maybe the software ’s all going to be out there in the cloud and you never download anything , just pay to use what ’s there .
Personally , I do n’t think any of those models are actually going to go away .
But which works best where ?
The market ’s working that out , right now .
Desktops ·
As I wrote a couple of months ago : how long can the public and private sector IT management continue to go on ignoring the fact that in OS X and Ubuntu , there are not one but two alternatives to the Windows desktop that are more reliable , more secure , more efficient , and cheaper ?
More or less everybody now has a friend or relative that ’s on Mac or Linux and is going to be wondering why their desktop ca n’t be that slick .
What ’s going to happen ?
I do n’t know , but it ’s going to be dramatic once we get to the tipping point , and I think we ’re approaching it right now .
Will It Always Be Like This ?
·
You know , just maybe .
Our mastery of the IT technologies is still in its brawny youth , with lots of low - hanging fruit to be snatched and big advances to be made .
And these days , with the advent of blogs and unconferences and all those new communication channels , our thought leaders are busy chattering at each other about all these problems all the time , 24/7/365 .
The gap between the leading edge and technology that ’s actually deployed in the enterprise is as wide as it ’s ever been and to me , that feels like a recipe for permanent disruption .
Cowabunga !
Prince Andrew has accused the Bush administration of failing to listen to Britain on post- invasion tactics .
In a rare and outspoken interview with the International Herald Tribune , the Duke of York said the Iraq war had induced a " healthy scepticism " towards America .
He said there was a feeling in Britain of " why did n't anyone listen to what was said and the advice that was given " .
Citing Britain's past as a colonial power , the prince said there were " occasions where people in the UK would wish that those in responsible positions in the US might listen and learn from our experiences " .
Speaking ahead of a 10 - day trade mission to the US , Prince Andrew , now a trade envoy , said : " If you are looking at colonialism , if you are looking at operations on an international scale , if you are looking at understanding each other 's culture , understanding how to operate in a military insurgency campaign - we have been through them all . "
The prince , who is fourth in line to the throne , said : " " We've won some , lost some , drawn some .
The fact is there is quite a lot of experience over here which is valid and should be listened to . "
After the invasion , Britain criticised America 's de-Ba'athification policy - the purging of Saddam 's party from government .
Geoff Hoon , who was the British defence secretary , has more diplomatically said that Britain " lost the argument " with the Bush administration over rebuilding Iraq .
In the interview , the prince spoke of his time flying helicopters during the Falklands war .
He said the experience had left him with a " different view of life "

On the same day that the State Department instructed all its employees not to leave reinforced structures , due to increased rocket attacks in the Green Zone , President Bush gave a speech in Dayton , OH where he continued to paint a rosy picture of the situation in Iraq , and said the critics of the war refuse to acknowledge the progress that has been made .
The President characterized the Iraqi economy this way , “ A year later , almost every key economic indicator has turned around .
Since the surge began , business registrations have increased by more than 9 percent .
Total inflation has fallen by more than 60 percentage points .
Investment in the energy and telecom industries has increased .
The agriculture sector is improving .
Oil production is up , particularly north of Baghdad .
The oil fields there have more than doubled production , and exports through Turkey have expanded significantly . ”
He had this to say about critics of the war , “ Some , however , seem unwilling to acknowledge that progress is taking place .
Early in the war , they said the political situation was n’t good enough .
Then , after Iraq held three historic elections , they said the security situation was n’t good enough .
Then , after the security situation began to improve , they said politics , again , was n’t good enough .
And now that political progress is picking up , they ’re looking for a new reason .
But there ’s one thing that is consistent .
No matter what shortcomings these critics diagnose , their prescription is always the same — retreat .
They claim that our strategic interest is elsewhere , and that if we would just get out of Iraq , we could focus on the battles that really matter .
This argument makes no sense . ”

Bush then linked al - Qaeda and Iraq again .
“ If America ’s strategic interests are not in Iraq — the convergence point for the twin threats of al Qaeda and Iran , the nation Osama bin Laden ’s deputy has called “ the place for the greatest battle , ” the country at the heart of the most volatile region on Earth — then where are they ? ”
If you heard John McCain ’s speech on Iraq yesterday , then you already heard the entire Bush argument word for word .
In his speech , the president never mentioned how many hours of electricity Iraqis have each day , or the amount of clean drinking water in the country .
Bush avoided talking about the unemployment rate , or the status of the Iraqi school system .
According to the Brookings Institute , as of last month , oil production still has not returned to prewar levels , but oil exports have soared , meaning that Iraq has to import oil to meet its domestic needs .
Baghdad still has only 7.3 hours of electricity a day , and unemployment has been stuck at 25% - 40 % since November 2005 .
If one looks at the real numbers that paint a portrait of what life is like for the average Iraqi , thing do n’t sound nearly as good as President Bush makes them out to be .
The mythical al - Qaeda Iraq connection should not distract us from seeing things as they are .
It is time to end this war , and let the Iraqis determine their own fate .
This is not a strategy for defeat , but one that will allow both Iraq , and the United States to move forward .

In violation of a ruling by New York State 's Human Rights Division , the principal of W. Tresper Clarke High School stood in the schoolhouse doorway and refused entrance to 15 - year - old John Cave yesterday , as long as he had his service dog with him .
Cave is a deaf teenager with cochlear implants , and this week , the state 's Human Rights Division Commissioner Kumiki Gibson declared the school violated two provisions of the Human Rights law ( PDF ) and ordered that Cave and his service dog Simba be allowed in school .
Normally , when the HRD hands down a decision , it 's followed .
However , East Meadow School District Superintendent Leon Campo said the Nassau County school district will hold out for a court order before it will admit Cave 's dog Simba .
Principal Timothy Voels and a sign language translator were waiting for Cave and Simba at the entrance and laid down the law , so the teen and his service dog went home without attending any classes yesterday .
According to Newsday , Simba is " trained to alert Cave to noises and oncoming vehicles .
But school officials think the Labrador Retriever could aggravate or serve as a distraction to students with severe allergies and would pose a danger during fire and emergency lockdown drills .
Cave 's family countered that the 1,500 - student school could be outfitted with air filters .
They are also filing a lawsuit for $ 150 million against the school district for violation of his human rights .

Thin Blue Line
There are complaints that Seattle cops are unreliable and incompetent .
The solution ?
More cops — lots more cops — and better pay .
Paul Hoppe
When Robert Eickmann noticed that his laptop , which had been stolen along with his car , had been broadcasting a signal from the same location for several days , he passed the information on to the Seattle Police Department .
Eickmann hoped this information — this clue — would help the SPD track down his missing 1993 Saturn as well as his MacBook .
Instead , the cops told Eickmann that he should invest in software to remotely wipe his hard drive .
On Christmas Eve , a young family was taking a late - night carriage ride through downtown Seattle .
As they turned off of First Avenue onto Pike Street , a BMW plowed into the side of the carriage .
The driver of the BMW backed up and sped off .
But the people in the carriage wrote down the driver 's license - plate number and called the police .
" They 're not going to charge the guy with hit - and - run , " Joanna Graf , owner of Angel Horse Carriages , angrily grumbles three months later .
" They did n't even contact the guy . "
The police did n't even write the driver a ticket , and Graf had to pay for the $ 5,000 worth of damage done to her carriage .
" A hit - and - run — that 's pretty serious for the police to just say , ' Oh well . ' "
The most frightening example of our police department 's inability to police comes from Les Sandusky .
In February , Sandusky was celebrating a friend 's birthday at a house on Capitol Hill , when a group of uninvited guests crashed the party .
" Some guys showed up and we asked them to leave , " Sandusky says .
Instead , the men went outside and began writing homophobic slurs on the house .
Sandusky went to confront the six men and was attacked .
" They surrounded me .
One of them smashed a 40 ounce bottle over my head , " he says .
Then one of the men pulled out a knife and stabbed Sandusky in the chest and throat .
Sandusky spent a week in the hospital .
" There were eyewitnesses who knew their names and where they worked , " Sandusky says .
" One of the suspects even dropped his cell phone [ outside the house ] . "
But no arrests have been made and Sandusky says the detective on the case told him he would be " putting [ the ] case on the back burner . "
Andrew Taylor , president of the Miller Park Community Council , has fought prostitution and drugs in his neighborhood .
He believes officers in the East Precinct just can't keep up with crime in the area .
" I get the impression that when it 's life - threatening , [ the police ] are there , " says Taylor .
" But they 're basically running from fire to fire . "
The SPD has been getting hammered lately in the dailies as well as in The Stranger [ " Tase First , Ask Questions Later , " Dec 13 , 2007 ; " Head Banger , " Nov 29 , 2007 ; " Gil 's Boys , " July 5 , 2007 ; " Raw Deal , " June 7 , 2007 ] .
However , the department has hit a number of high - profile cases hard .
Solid detective work led police to 48 - year - old James Anthony Williams , who was arrested and charged for the brutal stabbing death on New Year 's Eve of Shannon Harps .
A month later , SPD swarmed 23rd Avenue and Union Street and launched a citywide manhunt after a man shot and killed Degene Barecha and wounded another man inside of the Philadelphia 's Best Cheesesteak restaurant .
Within 24 hours , the Seattle Police Department apprehended the alleged shooter , Rey Davis - Bell , at a house in Beacon Hill .
High - profile manhunts and investigations put a heavy strain on the department 's resources , which forces the SPD to prioritize .
This might explain why folks like Eickmann and Graf — victims of crimes that are n't dominating the front pages of newspapers — are having trouble getting the cops to return their calls .
But it 's not indifference and it's not incompetence — it 's staffing .
Seattle simply does n't have enough police officers to do the job .
" The staffing [ situation ] is getting very , very dangerous , " says Seattle Police Officers ' Guild ( SPOG ) president Rich O'Neill .
Seattle has 1,307 sworn officer positions , and SPOG estimates that more than 100 of those positions are currently unfilled .
Things have gotten so bad that cops are starting to seriously worry about their own safety .
Some officers flying solo on patrol have been forced to resort to shining their lights down dark alleyways and shouting orders to disperse over their megaphones — instead of making arrests for street crimes — because of the lack of backup .
Clearly , SPD is in desperate need of officers .
But does anyone want to work in Seattle ?
As the department tries to hold off a mass exodus , applicants just are n't coming fast enough .
In 2007 , after complaints about long response times and heightened workloads , Mayor Greg Nickels pushed for the city to hire 105 new officers .
The Seattle City Council also made hiring new officers a priority , and just about every candidate up for election last year pounded their fists about the need for more cops .
Easier said than done .
The city proudly announced that it had hired 60 officers in 2007 — well below its annual goal of 80 new hires .
On average , the city loses around 50 cops every year to transfers and retirement .
In the first quarter of 2008 , the city hoped to hire 33 officers — through recruiting and transfers — while holding losses to 15 .
But in the first two months of 2008 , SPD only had 21 recruits in training and lost 14 officers .
We 're in a recession .
Jobs are harder to come by .
Police work is dangerous and opens a person up to public scrutiny .
But the police have a strong union , good job security , and good benefits .
So why is Seattle having a hard time recruiting and retaining officers ?
Do n't cops get paid well ?
Travis Gnehm , 19 , wanted to be a journalist until his senior year of high school in Bellevue , when he found an old police scanner in his house .
Before long , Gnehm was chasing officers out on calls , recording amateur video of crime scenes , and offering the tapes to local TV stations .
" After seeing what police do and talking to them , I figured this was the job for me , " Gnehm says .
Now , Gnehm is looking to find a local police department that , he says , " fits me best . "
SPD , the Washington State Patrol , the Bellevue Police Department , and other suburban agencies are courting Gnehm .
He has been to SPD 's recruiting fair — where the department shows off all its high - tech gadgets , SWAT vehicles , K - 9 units , and CSI squads — and been on a ride - along with the department .
Gnehm says the excitement of working in an urban environment like Seattle is appealing , but he has reservations .
His biggest reservation ?
He wants to find a department that will help pay for his college education .
Many suburban departments offer higher pay for college graduates or even reimburse officers for school .
The SPD does not .
Smaller departments outside of Seattle are becoming a big draw — for reasons besides tuition , as well .
First off , suburban departments are safer .
Violent crimes are lower or nearly nonexistent , and some officers say they simply feel welcome and more appreciated in suburban communities .
Working outside of Seattle also gives officers the opportunity to have a shorter commute — less than 15 percent of SPD officers live in the city — which may be why the Lakewood Police Department was able to hire away seven Seattle cops recently .
Then there are the hefty hiring bonuses , the take - home cars , the education incentives , and , most importantly , the higher pay .
A new officer in Seattle starts out at around $ 47,000 a year .
But those same rookies can make $ 5,000 to $ 19,000 more by signing on to departments in Renton or Kent , plus bonuses for working patrol , physical fitness , and college degrees .
Across the lake in Bellevue , Gnehm 's hometown , a new recruit with a college degree can make as much in his or her first year as an SPD officer with more than four years of experience .
With poor benefits , few perks , and low pay , SPD is not only having trouble attracting new recruits like Gnehm , they 're having trouble keeping the officers they 've got .
As the city continues to pump money into the department 's budget to hire more officers , experienced cops are walking out the door .
Last year , SPD lost 46 officers to other departments .
Some of those cops are leaving for better pay , or shorter commutes , or what they perceive as more grateful residents .
But many Seattle cops are fed up with a drawn - out contract - negotiation process .
Police officers in Seattle have been working without a contract since December 2006 , and a number of officers are already packing up and preparing to jump ship if the guild 's contract is n't nailed down soon .
" You [ have officers ] with three , four , and five years leaving , that 's just devastating , " says SPOG president O'Neill .
" It takes a year to get someone hired , trained , and out there , and another before you know which end is up . "
Even if the SPD filled all its open positions and found a better way to retain officers , the question remains :
Is a department consisting of 1,307 officers big enough to police a city the size of Seattle ?
" I do n't think there 's an optimum number that you can say you get to that point and say you 're fine , " says Dr. Otwin Marenin , a professor in Washington State University 's criminal justice program .
But statistics from the U.S. Department of Justice point to the root cause of Seattle 's police problem :
There are n't enough of them .
According to the Department of Justice , the national average is about one officer for every 271 residents .
Some cities have more than that — New York City has one officer for every 218 residents — while others have fewer .
Atlanta , Georgia , with a population similar to Seattle 's , has one officer for every 279 residents .
Denver , Colorado , has one officer for every 354 residents .
Seattle has just one officer for every 500 residents .
To bring Seattle 's officer - resident ratio down to a manageable ratio of 1 to 250 , the city would need to double what it currently spends annually on patrol officers , to over $ 220 million .
While it may be financially infeasible for Seattle to double the size of its police force , Council Member Nick Licata says there 's more to policing than just numbers .
" We 're not going to double our police force , " he says .
" This game of ' how do you properly staff and pay for police in the city ' is a quagmire of statistical dead ends . "
Licata agrees that Seattle needs more cops , but he says the ones we have also need more training , and the department should pull from other pools it already has , such as the 20 or more officers working desk jobs at each of Seattle 's five precincts throughout the day .
" The question is , ultimately , does the population feel safe or not ? " Licata says .
" The polls that they 've done say people basically feel safe . "
After a string of violent incidents shook Seattle 's downtown core in the summer of 2007 , the SPD responded with an unprecedented show of force centered around Third Avenue and Pine Street , a hot spot of criminal activity for years .
But as officers made their presence felt downtown , bad guys simply pulled up stakes , according to neighborhood groups , and moved north to Belltown or east to Capitol Hill .
Now , the problems have spread and the department just does n't have the manpower to extend patrols .
SPD just can't win .
Over in the Pike Place Market , Kristen Sekera — assistant manager at Kasala Furniture — says a police crackdown in the neighborhood has n't done much .
" [ Victor Steinbrueck Park ] is out of control , " she says .
" I call it Crackhead Park . "
Sekera says she constantly sees people doing drugs in the alley behind Kasala — on Western Avenue and Virginia Street — and has called police " two or three times in the last month . "
Still , she says , when the police do come , it 's usually too late .
" Two weeks ago , I called [ the police ] , for these underage kids smoking pot and drinking [ behind the store ] .
It took the cops 45 minutes to show up . "
Sekera says as soon as the cops showed up , the kids ran .
" It was n't a prompt response , " she says .
One SPD officer — who asked not to be named — believes because of hiring problems and unreasonable expectations , the SPD will continue to be the " bad guy " in the mind of public .
" I think officers truly feel the community does n't support the police department , " the officer says .
In the last year , SPD has taken a beating in the media .
A number of officers — including Chief Gil Kerlikowske — have been accused of misconduct .
Tensions have grown recently between some communities and the department .
With all of the ink spilled over police accountability in the last year , it seems counterintuitive to argue for more cops .
Is hiring more cops the answer ?
Well , that all depends on how quickly Seattle wants its stolen cars returned , its hit - and - run drivers ticketed , and its violent criminals apprehended and arrested .
Clearly , Eickmann , Graf , and Sandusky 's cases show the department is n't living up to expectations .
Seattle is outgrowing its police force , and as the department 's numbers plummet , things are only going to get worse .
If this were just a numbers game , $ 100 million would go a long way toward super - sizing the department .
While blindly throwing money at the problem is n't going to fix anything , it 's clear the city is going to have to shell out some cash to attract more recruits , and keep the good cops we 've got .
If things keep going the way they 're going , we 're not going to get either .

Thank you for this video .
I have posted it on a Yahoo newsgroup I belong to .
I hope they start frequently the Brad Blog as they should after seeing this great piece of truly patriotic journalism .
BTW , is n't the criticizing and harping on what Rev. Wright said itself unpatriotic per the First Amendment ?
Wonderfully , the flap doodle about Rev. Wright reportedly had a net positive effect for Obama .
The latest flap about Obama knowing Paisley is equally disgusting .
If I had to agree with everyone I was friends with I would have no friends .
In all honestly , I have not watched a debate in decades .
OK , I 'm dating myself , but I watched the Nixon - Kennedy debate , and nobody mentioned lapel pins , which neither man wore , or their religion , which both men professed , or their relatives or people they knew .
No one asked them how many people they killed in the war , or tried to say that one man was more patriotic , brave , or evil because of it .
If you had told me in 1974 that I would think better of Nixon because of what was to pass in the next 24 years , I would have slapped you ( and I have never intensionally slapped anyone in my life ) .
I truly agree with every word those protesters said .
Bravo .

If skydiving does n't quite do it for you , you could always strap a jet engine to your chest .
That 's what Bob Maddox did until discretion got the better of him and he decided a jet - powered bicycle might be a little safer .
Maddox , an artist and cabinetmaker in Medford , Ore. , has been tinkering with pulse jet engines for seven years now .
He 's recently started bolting them to old - school cruiser bicycles and selling them on eBay , and a – video of him riding one is bouncing around the blogosphere .
We got ahold of him at his workshop , where he 's wrapping up a sweet purple jet bike for a customer in the Netherlands .
He 's only built two so far .
He got the first one up to 50 mph but backed off when visions of catastrophic wheel failure danced in his head .
He figures the bikes will hit 75 if anyone 's got the guts to do it .
" When you 're on a motorcycle going 50 mph , you do n't think anything about it , " he told us .
" But on a bicycle , it feels way too fast . "
And loud .
Way too loud .
" It 's loud like a top alcohol dragster loud , " he says .
" It 'll pop your ear drums if you are n't wearing protective gear .
That 's a drawback to the engines . "
No kidding .
Pulse jet technology dates to the beginning of the 20th Century when they were developed in Sweden .
Germany used them during World War II to propel the V - 1 " buzz bombs " they hurled at England during the Blitz of 1944 .
The exceedingly simple internal combustion engines that will run on just about anything and remain popular with hobbyists .
" It 'll run on propane , gas , kerosene , absolutely anything except cryogenic fuel , " he says .
" They 'd run on peanut oil if you want . "
Maddox has been into skydiving for 20 year and used to compete in tracking contests , where free - falling skydivers move horizontally across the sky at speeds approaching 120 mph .
His buddy was always just a little bit faster , so Maddox thought " it 'd be fun to strap a jet engine to my chest and make myself into a human missile . "
He discovered turbine jet engines are expensive .
But pulse jets are as cheap as they are simple , so Maddox set to work building one .
" All I started with was a schematic out of an encyclopedia , " he says .
The engines are basically a long tube with a fuel pump , a spark plug and a reed valve .
Air and fuel are mixed at the front and ignited in a process that repeats - or " pulses " - about 70 times a second .
Maddox soon had a working engine and he developed a throttle that allowed him to control the level of thrust - something he says is rare on a pulse jet .
He made three jumps from a plane ( that 's him in the pic ) but quit because " the fuel system was a little scary " and he worried about setting the plane on fire .
But Maddox was hooked .
He started refining his pulse jet engines , which he fashions from aluminum and stainless steel in his workshop .
He 's sold about 50 of them .
The smallest are used to power model airplanes .
The largest - two monsters producing 500 pounds of thrust apiece - have joined the beastly nitro-methane engine in Wally Larson 's Top Gun Groundfighter show car .
The thought of bolting a jet engine to an old Schwinn cruiser came to him about six months ago when " I wanted to throw the engine onto something that would get me around . "
The bike engines provide 50 pounds of thrust .
They weigh 13 pounds apiece , but Maddox says you hardly notice it when you 're on the bike .
Get it going , though , and things get interesting .
" It accelerates pretty quickly , " he says .
" It 'll hit top speed in about 7 seconds .
But even at high speed , it feels very stable .
You 're just being pushed along on a column of air . "
A column of air being produced by a red - hot tube howling at 150 decibels .
Besides being hot and loud , pulse jets are n't very efficient .
They 'll suck down half a gallon of fuel a minute at full throttle , and the bikes carry just six to eight quarts .
With his bikes starting to , er , take off , Maddox is looking to his next project - a pulse jet motorcycle that he'd bring to drag races or maybe the Bonneville Salt Flats .
If you think riding a jet bike is crazy , give a jet motorcycle a whirl .
Maddox says , " you'd be straddling the engine with a fork out front and a tire in the back . "

Faced with the new realities and challenges regarding how best to teach , learn , and conduct research during the COVID - 19 pandemic , Caltech has launched Caltech Together : a risk - prevention and community - support campaign .
Vice President Dick
Cheney does not have to testify as an eyewitness in a civil lawsuit filed against Secret Service agents by a man who says he was wrongfully arrested for criticizing the vice president -- at least not yet , U.S. District Magistrate Judge Craig Shaffer ruled Tuesday .
The judge , who issued a written decision , left open the possibility that he may change his mind if Steven Howards can prove that Cheney has information that others can’t provide about the 2006 encounter in the Colorado ski resort town of Beaver Creek .
Howards , a 55 - year - old environmental consultant , said that he had approached Cheney while the vice president was on a walk in town and told him : “ Your policies in Iraq are disgusting . ”
Howards said he also had lightly touched Cheney on the shoulder , then walked away .
A Secret Service agent later caught up to Howards and arrested him on suspicion of assault .

Assault charges were never filed .
Howards was issued a summons for misdemeanor harassment , but the Eagle County district attorney later dismissed the charge , saying it was clear that Howards had n’t attacked Cheney .
Howards later filed a federal lawsuit , claiming that the agents had violated his right to free speech and arrested him without probable cause -- possibly in retaliation for his critical comment .
Four Secret Service agents and two White House staffers who saw the encounter have since given conflicting views of what happened .
Though he was listed as the victim , Cheney was not interviewed .
“ The vice president is clearly a man who should know ” what happened , Howards ’ attorney , David Lane , said at a March 11 hearing .

Cheney ’s lawyer , James Gilligan , argued that Howards had to prove Cheney had “ unique personal knowledge ” essential to the case in order to compel the testimony of such a high - ranking official .
Ordering his testimony , Gilligan said , would be starting down a “ slippery slope . ”
Lane said he would appeal Shaffer ’s decision .
“ Frankly , Cheney should be volunteering to step forward and tell everyone what he knows , ” he said .

Woman with brain disorder arrested and locked up because police thought she was drunk
[ headerlinks}
A woman who suffers from a disease which causes balance problems was thrown into a cell - because police mistakenly thought she was drunk .
Lorraine Parkin , 37 , who is teetotal , was driving away from a supermarket when an officer ordered her to stop her car .
Mrs Parkin was asked whether she had been drinking .
The woman officer asked her to step out of her car and confiscated her keys .
Lorraine Parkin has a rare brain condition but was mistakingly arrested and locked up for drink driving
Mother - of - three Mrs Parkin explained that she suffered from Huntington 's disease , showed her medication and offered to take a breath test .
Police were nearby and at one stage up to ten officers surrounded her as they waited for a breath test kit to arrive .
She said that when a kit could not be found officers bundled her into the back of a van and took her to a police station where she was placed in a cell .
Huntington 's disease is a progressive hereditary condition , which affects the body 's nervous system .
Sufferers can have unco-ordinated movements and slurred speech , which make them appear drunk .
Mrs Parkin , from Swinton in Greater Manchester , was stopped after a police officer saw her walking to her car .
Last night , she accused police of discriminating against the disabled .
' I have never felt so humiliated and small , ' she said .
' I could not even tell friends and family without bursting into tears .
I felt terrified as I have never in my life been in the back of a police van .
' I was kept at that police station while they checked with the DVLA and found I was fully road legal including all relevant up to date retests .
' The police then rang my doctor to confirm that my tablets were a legal prescription .
' The doctor confirmed my diagnosis and my tablets but the desk sergeant said this was not enough information and I would have to be seen by the police doctor . '
Eventually Mrs Parkin , was released without charge .
Officers still insisted she was collected from the station by family or friends , saying she was in no condition to drive .
Mrs Parkin has been stopped several times before by police who believed her to be drunk .
She is calling for more training for police on how to deal with the disabled .
' I feel sick and tired of being judged by others , ' she said .
The life expectancy of someone diagnosed with Huntington 's disease is generally around 15 - 20 years though some can live much longer .
Police confirmed that Mrs Parkin was taken to the police station because a breath test kit was ' not available at the roadside ' .
A spokesman said : ' The woman was taken to Swinton police station at 11 am where officers were able to verify her symptoms .
' She was released without charge just after 11.50 am , having spent less than an hour at the police station . '
FEDERAL ministers will be barred from investing in the sharemarket and face a one - year cooling - off period before working for the corporate sector after they quit Parliament under a tough code of conduct announced by the Prime Minister yesterday .
Kevin Rudd also pledged a ban on political fund - raising events at his official residences , The Lodge in Canberra and Kirribilli House in Sydney , and detailed new rules to introduce greater transparency into dealings between ministers and lobbyists .
The rules , stricter than the decade - old code of conduct of the Howard government , will increase pressure on the Premier , Morris Iemma , to toughen his rules governing the activities of former state ministers after a string of controversies .
The former premier Bob Carr , as well as the retired ministers Carl Scully , Craig Knowles , Michael Egan and Richard Face have all attracted criticism for their post - parliamentary employment .
Richie Sambora Being Charged with Child Endangerment
Last monthwas pulled over in Laguna Beach for driving erratically in his Hummer .
He was charged with DUI .
The case has since been handed over to the Orange County DA 's Office with a recommendation that Sambora be charged with child endangerment in addition to the previous DUI charge .
DUI is clearly a case of extremely poor judgment but transporting his 10 year old daughter Ava and her cousin while in that condition borders on insane .
Jenn Mallini , the rockers girlfriend , was also along for the ride .
Assuming Sambora was driving with over a .08 blood - alcohol level with a passenger under 14 in the car , he 's looking at probable jail time , " says veteran DUI lawyer Lawrence Taylor , who 's not involved with the case .
" But it 's possible this can be plea bargained to a lesser offense , and / or he could get rehab in lieu of jail . "
Richie is due for arraignment on May 7th .
According to friends of the singer , he was in good spirits over the weekend in Las Vegas .
He was observed drinking only water at Hard Rock Hotel prior to joining Bon Jovi on stage at the MGM Grand .
Sambora has been the rehab route for alcohol and drugs last June .
Now that his daughter is involved , perhaps this is the wake up call that the singer needs .
The perverse and perilous paradox of this presidency is that the more Bush and Cheney fail , the more they succeed .
( See my article " Fighting Terror with Terror . " )
Bush parlayed his criminal failure to protect and come to the rescue of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Katrina into getting Congress to pass in September 2007 the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 .
The Warner Act abrogates the Posse Comitatus Act ( the Civil War law that prohibits the use of federal troops in domestic affairs ) and gives the President the power to declare , on his own say so , a " public emergency " and carry out mass roundups , arrests and detentions .
All Bush and Cheney need do , in other words , to nullify their record level of unpopularity is allow - or merely fail to prevent - another 9/11 attack ( the attack that Bush warns of in the article below . )
If they once again fail to prevent a terrorist attack as they did on 9/11 , they will then undoubtedly get their grandest wish : unfettered executive powers .
The reason that this perverse paradox works is because their " war on terror " rests upon a specific , immoral logic - the idea that Americans ' lives are more precious than that of Afghanis or Iraqis or Iranians or Pakistanis and that that it is necessary , and justifiable , to do anything to " protect American lives , " including torture , mass murder , surveillance of all of us , and so on .
So long as the logic of this rationale remains unchallenged , Bush and Cheney - and their successors ( McCain , Obama or Clinton and so on ) - will succeed in consolidating virtually all power in the executive branch , accountable to no one and to no law .
Anything and everything can be justified according to this reactionary , national chauvinist logic .
The Bill of Rights , US Constitution , Geneva Conventions , international law and the UN Charter be damned .
Nothing must or will stand in their way .
The Democrats - and Obama and Clinton in particular - have made it clear that they do not question the logic of this vicious rationale .
Where is the talk in Pennsylvania between Barack and Hillary right now about the recent revelations of how from the very top levels of the White House , torture was plotted ?
Why are the Democrats mum about this ?
What kind of leaders are these ?
What right do they have to say that they should lead this country and we should support and vote for them when they have n't stopped the torture ?
Obama can say all he wants that he will shut down Gitmo , but why has n't he done this while in the Senate ?
Obama and Clinton could have and should have filibustered the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 that legalized torture and stripped habeas corpus rights from anyone the president decides is an " enemy combatant . "
It is n't enough to say you 're against something and vote against it , but then allow it to nevertheless pass .
This is what a filibuster is for .
Even the NY Times said at the time , if you 're going to filibuster anything , filibuster this .
Since January 2007 the Democrats have had the majority in Congress and all of the leadership posts .
They could have and should have , if they 're really against all of this , repealed the MCA and the Warner Act and Patriot Act .
They should have defunded the war .
They have had the power to do this .
Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid hide behind the fig leaf that they do n't have the votes to stop the funding and stop the other tyrannies and crimes against humanity of the Bush regime .
This is disingenuous in the extreme .
They do n't even need the votes to turn out their way , the leadership can simply prevent a funding bill from coming to the floor .
They could hold hearings that reveal the depravities and atrocities being committed at Gitmo and Abu Ghraib and in Afghanistan and they would have no problem given the impact this would have on public opinion in repealing the fascistic laws that have been passed to enable Bush and Cheney 's power grab .
You have to ask yourself , what road are we on ?
Where is all of this headed ?
What would you do if you were Bush and Cheney and you had their worldview and their agenda ?
Would you go quietly into the night ?
Or would you do what you knew would give you the power you crave ?
What has been , after all , their entire record up to this point ?
You have to ask yourself , why would the very same people who have had all of the power in their hands for years to prevent and expose these crimes - but have n't used it - suddenly , upon getting the presidency , have a moral awakening ?
If you stand by for years while a murderer and torturer is doing their filthy deeds in full view of you , and you did nothing about it when you had the ability , and thus the blood is on your hands for your failure to act , why would you suddenly have an epiphany when you now occupy the highest office in the land ?
Even if you did suddenly have an epiphany , would n't the obvious question be : why did n't you do something about this back then ?

There 's a reason why programs like " 60 Minutes " win Peabody Awards .
Less than 2 months after airing a story exposing the politically motivated conviction of former Democratic Governor Don Siegelman -- yes , we now have political prisoners in this country -- Scott Pelley sits down with a newly - released Siegelman , who has some serious questions he wants Karl Rove to answer under oath before the Judiciary Committee .

CBS :
" What we need is Karl Rove to get himself over to the Judiciary Committee and put his hand on a Bible and take an oath and give testimony .
And he can either tell the truth or take the Fifth .
Either one will satisfy me . "
Many of us in the blogosphere were relentless in covering this case .
We should all be proud of ourselves .
Something tells me the Judiciary Committee is gonna have a hard time getting Turd Blossom 's hand on that Bible .
On March 31st , we published an article entitled Russian Intelligence Services State US Is Preparing For Attack On Iran .
We were not the first to break the story , and in fact , were behind the curve and found the story posted on the Digg Community .
The article was well received , however , we noticed that it was being read by an enormous amount of state governmental agencies as well as a “ who ’s who ” of federal entities - many of whom followed every link and spent a substantial amount of time reading , and then making return visits to the same article .
It ls unconscionable that our Mainstream News Media has n’t followed - up on and reported facts that indicate the United States is on a clear path to war with Iran :
On April the 2nd , and again on April the 5th , Russian sources reported the US was gong to strike Iran within two ( 2 ) weeks , yet not a word is mentioned on the MSM or in the Halls of Congress :
Russia ‘ Alarmed ’ As US Readies April Nuclear Attack On Iran By News Director on April 5th , 2008 Russian Foreign Ministry Officials are reported to be ‘ alarmed ’ today over a ‘ presentation ’ made by the United States War Leaders to President Putin at this weeks NATO summit in Romania and which details the Americans plan to begin a nuclear attack against Iran ’s atomic facilities in the next two weeks .
Most disturbing of these reports , according to Foreign Ministry Analysts , are the United States ‘ offers and threats ’ towards Russia to ‘ remain neutral ’ in this conflict or face the combined weight of the American and EU central banks deliberate collapsing of the Western banking system , and US dollar , and which is estimated will cause the loss of nearly $ 800 billion of Russian foreign reserves .
To the ‘ offers ’ presented to President Putin for keeping Russia out of this war , these reports continue , will be NATO ’s rejection of Ukraine and Georgia membership into the Western Military Alliance and the ending of the planned US Missile Shield being planned for Poland and the Czech Republic .
MUCH MORE
The same information was reported on April 2nd at “ War In Iraq ”
The story and allegations appeared to be credible , and since the MSM ignored the issue , we made this statement in a follow - up article , If We Go To War With Iran , Who Will You Blame ? :
The MSM is concentrating on the upcoming November elections and the economy in the US - essentially using it as cover for failing to warn us of an impending attack against Iran .
When we are faced with an issue that affects every American here and abroad , it ’s time to bombard the MSM with emails , letters to the various editors , and calls to Congress to demand answers .
On an issue this serious , the least the MSM could do is to try and debunk what is stated on the news in other countries - tell us why it ’s not a problem , and assure us that our military is n’t readying themselves to attack Iran .
If Russia is stating that they have evidence an attack on Iran is imminent , I believe that it is not only newsworthy , but to ignore a threat as dire as an attack that could be a precursor to WW III , if the MSM refuse to uphold their responsibility to warn the people , they are as guilty as those who make the final decision to begin the attack .
I expected an answer , either vague or an outright denial from the MSM or Congress itself , similar to the response Congress made when thousands of Americans jammed - up their phones in regard S 1959 ; with the substantiation that was offered on this issue , it ’s fair to say many Americans were making calls and demanding answers , none which I expected until the pressure began to mount - up - and for the first time , I was actually shocked when exactly the opposite occurred :
Conyers : “ If Bush Goes Into Iran , He Should Be Impeached ” By : Jane Hamsher Tuesday March 18 , 2008 9:09 am John Conyers just finished up a panel with John Cole and Christy Hardin Smith at Take Back America with words that were heartening to everyone made just a wee bit uneasy by the recent retirement of Admiral Fallon and the implications it might have for war with Iran : “ If Bush Goes Into Iran , He Should Be Impeached , ” said Conyers .
( Emphasis added . )
Conyers also said that with regard to FISA , the House was going into conference with the Senate .
That the Senate wanted to give retroactive immunity to the telecoms , and that the House is saying “ let a judge decide . ”
But he also made the point that it was n’t just the Republicans who were the problem : LINK

MANOREXIA . Orthorexia .
Diabulimia .
Binge Eating Disorder .
All are dangerous variations on the eating disorders anorexia and bulimia , and have become buzzwords that are popping up on Web sites and blogs , on television and in newspaper articles .
As celebrity magazines chronicle the glamorous and the suffering , therapists and a growing number of researchers are trying to treat and understand the conditions .
The latest entry in the lexicon of food - related ills is drunkorexia , shorthand for a disturbing blend of behaviors : self - imposed starvation or bingeing and purging , combined with alcohol abuse .
Drunkorexia is not an official medical term .
But it hints at a troubling phenomenon in addiction and eating disorders .
Among those who are described as drunkorexics are college - age binge drinkers , typically women , who starve all day to offset the calories in the alcohol they consume .
The term is also associated with serious eating disorders , particularly bulimia , which often involve behavior like bingeing on food  and alcohol  and then purging .
Anorexics , because they severely restrict their calorie intake , tend to avoid alcohol .
But some drink to calm down before eating or to ease the anxiety of having indulged in a meal .
Others consume alcohol as their only sustenance .
Still others use drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine to suppress their appetites .
There are a few certainties in life : death , taxes and harddisk failure .
I have no less than 6 failed harddisks sitting here on my desk patiently awaiting their appointment with Mr Lump Hammer .
2 Seagates , 3 Maxtors and 1 Western Digital .
This equates to roughly one disk failure per year .
Perhaps this is not suprising given that I have about 9 working harddisks at the moment spread across various machines .
Given the incredible tolerances to which harddisks are manfactured , perhaps it is a miracle harddisks work at all .
As an analogy , a magnetic head slider flying over a disk surface with a flying height of 25 nm with a relative speed of 20 meters / second is equivalent to an aircraft flying at a physical spacing of 0.2 µm at 900 kilometers / hour .
This is what a disk drive experiences during its operation .

We all know we need to back - up our data .
But it is a chore that often gets forgotten at the most critical periods .
Here are my hints for preparing yourself for that inevitable ‘ click of death ’ .
Buy an external USB / Firewire harddrive .
500 GB drives are ridiculously cheap these days .
Personally I do n’t like back - up tapes due to experiences of them stretching and corrupting data .
Back - up images of the entire OS , not just the data .
You can use Acronis TrueImage on Windows and SuperDuper on MacOSX .
This can save you days restoring your entire development environment and applications from scratch .
Back - up individual files as well as entire OS images .
You do n’t want to have to restore a whole image to retrieve one critical file .
Windows Vista and Mac OS X Leopard both have back - up applications built into the OS .
Use a separate machine to your development machine as source code server .
Use a RAID - 1 ( mirrored ) disk on your main development machine [ 1 ] .
It is worth noting that this actually doubles the likelihood of harddisk failure , but makes the likelihood of a catastrophic failure much lower .
Keep an identical 3rd drive on hand to swap in when a drive fails .
Back - ups are n’t much use if they get incinerated along with your office in a fire , so store copies off - site .
For example you can : ftp copies to your webserver use a service such as Amazon S3 + JungleDisk [ 2 ] or specialised on - line back services such as Mozy or Carbonite give DVDs to friends and family
Make sure any off - site copies are securely encypted , for example using Axcrypt .
Automate your back - ups as far as possible .
Computers are much better at the dull repetitive stuff .
Test restoring data once in a while .
There is not much point backing up data only to find you ca n’t restore it when needed .
There are lots of applications for backing up individual files .
So many in fact , that no - one has any hope of evaluating them all ( marketing tip : do n’t write another back - up application – really ) .
I also worry that data stored in their various proprietary formats might not be accessible in future due to the vendor going out of business .
I find the venerable DOS xcopy adequate for my needs .
I run it in a scheduled Windows batch file to automatically synch file changes on to my usb harddrive ( i :) every night .
Here it is in all its glory :
XCOPY c:\data i:\data /d /i /s /v /f /y /g /EXCLUDE:exclude.txt
The exclude . txt file is used to exclude subversion folders and intermediate compiler files :
\.svn\
.obj
.ilk
.ncb
.pdb
. bak >
Which of the above do I do ?
Pretty much all of them actually .
At least I try , I have n’t yet automated the offsite backup .
This may seem rather excessive , but it paid dividends last month when gremlins went on the rampage here in the Oryx Digital office .
I had 2 harddrive failures in 2 weeks .
The power supply + harddisk + network card on my old XP development machine failed then , while I was in the process of moving everything to my new Vista development machine , one of the RAID - 1 disks on the new machine failed .
Things did n’t go quite according to plan though .
The new RAID - 1 box would n’t boot from either harddisk .
I have no idea why .
Also the last couple of weekly Acronis image back - ups had failed and I had n’t done anything about it .
I had recent back - ups of all the important data , but I faced a day or more reinstalling all the apps I had installed since the last successful image .
It took several hours on the phone to Dell technical support and much crawling around on the floor before I could I get the new RAID - 1 box to boot off one harddisk .
I was then able to rebuild RAID - 1 using the spare harddisk I had on standby for such an eventuality .
Nothing was lost , apart from my sense of humour .
Dell offered to replace the defective harddisk under warranty , but I declined on the grounds that there is far too much valuable information on this disk ( source code , digital certificate keys , customer details etc ) for me to entrust it to any third party .
Especially given that Dell reserve the right to refurbish the harddisk and send it to someone else .
What if they forgot to wipe it ?
My experiences with courier companies also have n’t given me great confidence that the disk would reach Dell .
And I did n’t want to receive a reburbished disk as a replacement .
It just is n’t worth relying on a refurb given how cheap new harddisks are .
So the harddisk has joined the back of the growing queue to see Mr Lump Hammer .
The availability of cheap harddisks and cheap bandwidth means that it has never been easier to backup your systems .
No more fiddling with mag tapes .
Of course it is possible that your harddisk will work perfectly until it becomes obselete , but I think it would be very unwise to assume that this will be the case .
Do n’t say I did n’t warn you …

What ’s your backup strategy ?
( the prolific and always worth reading Jeff Atwood beats me to the punch )
[ 1 ] RAID - 1 is built in to some Intel motherboards and is available as a relatively inexpensive extra from Dell .
You may have to ask for it though – it was n’t listed as a standard configuration option when I purchased my Dell Dimension 9200 .

Since I wrote this article I installed the latest version of JungleDisk on my Vista box .
On the 3 occasions I have tried to use it it hung Vista to the point where I had to I had to cut the power in order to reboot .
I have now uninstalled it .
Would six - figure salaries attract better teachers ?
A New York City charter school set to open in 2009 in Washington Heights will test one of the most fundamental questions in education :
Whether significantly higher pay for teachers is the key to improving schools .
The school , which will run from fifth to eighth grades , is promising to pay teachers $ 125,000 , plus a potential bonus based on schoolwide performance .
That is nearly twice as much as the average New York City public school teacher earns , roughly two and a half times the national average teacher salary and higher than the base salary of all but the most senior teachers in the most generous districts nationwide .
The school ’s creator and first principal , Zeke M. Vanderhoek , contends that high salaries will lure the best teachers .
He says he wants to put into practice the conclusion reached by a growing body of research : that teacher quality  not star principals , laptop computers or abundant electives  is the crucial ingredient for success .
“ I would much rather put a phenomenal , great teacher in a field with 30 kids and nothing else than take the mediocre teacher and give them half the number of students and give them all the technology in the world , ” said Mr. Vanderhoek , 31 , a Yale graduate and former middle school teacher who built a test preparation company that pays its tutors far more than the competition .
At Abercrombie & Fitch , little girls were sold thong underwear tagged with the phrases " eye candy " and " wink wink . "
In Britain , preschoolers could learn to strip with their very own Peekaboo Pole - Dancing Kits , complete with kiddie garter belts and play money .
And ' tween readers of the magazine Seventeen discovered " 405 ways to look hot " like Paris Hilton .
This kind of sexualization of ' tween girls - defined as those between the ages of 8 and 12 - in pop culture and advertising is a growing problem fueled by marketers ' efforts to create cradle - to - grave consumers , a University of Iowa journalism professor argues in her new book .
" A lot of very sexual products are being marketed to very young kids , " said Gigi Durham , author of The Lolita Effect .
" I 'm criticizing the unhealthy and damaging representations of girls ' sexuality , and how the media present girls ' sexuality in a way that 's tied to their profit motives .
The body ideals presented in the media are virtually impossible to attain , but girls do n't always realize that , and they 'll buy an awful lot of products to try to achieve those bodies .
There 's endless consumerism built around that . "
Durham advocates healthy and progressive concepts of girls ' sexuality , but criticizes the media for its sexual representations .
Studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation and other research organizations show that sexual content aimed at children has increased steadily since the 1990s , Durham said .
Times were prosperous , Britney Spears emerged as the sexy schoolgirl on MTV , and ' tweens had plenty of disposable income -- a perfect alignment for marketers trying to expand into a new demographic .
By 2007 , 8 - to 12 year - olds ' consumer spending was $ 170 billion worldwide , according to the market research firm Euromonitor .
The book , published this month by Overlook Press , is the culmination of 13 years of research by Durham , an associate professor in the UI School of Journalism and Mass Communication , part of the UI College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .
Durham immersed herself in magazines , movies , TV shows , catalogs and Web sites aimed at young girls , from Cosmo Girl to " Hannah Montana . "
She went to junior high schools to talk with girls about how the messages affected them .
In the book , Durham identifies five myths of sexuality and provides advice and resources for caring adults who want to discuss the issue with young girls .
The myths are :
--
If you 've got it , flaunt it .
Bare a " Barbie body " as often as you can .
But do n't celebrate or enjoy any other body type .
" It 's really excluding a lot of girls from enjoying and recognizing pleasure in their own bodies , " Durham said .
-- Anatomy of a sex goddess .
" Media reinforce a ridiculous ideal of being both extremely thin and voluptuous -- a body not found in nature , " Durham said .
" You have to go through borderline starvation and plastic surgery to get it . "
-- Pretty babies .
Representations of sexual girls are getting younger and younger .
Many of the images presented as the most sexually desirable are images of girls as young as 11 or 12 .
" It 's problematic in many ways :
It encourages sexualization of girls too young to make good decisions about sex .
It legitimizes the idea that young girls should be looked at as sexual partners .
And , presenting pre-pubescent bodies as the sexual ideal pressures grown women to achieve the body of a child who has n't even matured yet , " Durham said .
-- Sexual violence is hot .
Media aimed at children -- like PG - 13 " slasher " movies -- convey the message that violence is sexy or that sex should be violent .
-- Girls do n't choose boys ; boys choose girls -- and only hot girls .
Women and girls are supposed to focus on pleasing men .
But little emphasis is placed on women taking pleasure in their own sexuality or bodies , or on guys striving to please gals , Durham said .
" It 's a very one - way construction of sex . "
" The book definitely is n't anti-sex , " Durham said .
" It starts with the recognition that girls are sexual -- everybody 's sexual -- but that girls deserve good information that will help them make good decisions .
We have the highest rate of teen pregnancy in the industrialized world , and a study by the Centers for Disease Control just reported that 1 in 4 teen girls in the U.S. has an STD .
Clearly we 're not giving them the kind of information they need to take care of themselves sexually and transition to adulthood in safe ways . "
Durham encourages parents , teachers and counselors to jump - start conversations about sexualization of young girls in the media .
Ask girls to look through a teen magazine and discuss the messages .
How seriously do they take them ?
Do they understand the profit motives , or how images can be doctored to perfection ?
Other tips include : complimenting girls on more than just their appearance to emphasize that they are multidimensional ; encouraging activism for causes like ending sex trafficking ; and assisting girls in creating their own media --
Web sites , blogs or ' zines -- that are less focused on sex and appearance .
" There 's this hesitance to talk about these issues , especially before kids reach adolescence , " Durham said .
" But often , when parents finally do bring it up , it 's too late .
Kids have already had their sexual understanding shaped by media .
We need to be having a lot of open discussions about the sexualization of childhood and what constitutes healthy sexuality .
I do n't think we should neglect our responsibility as adults and leave them to navigate this terrain on their own . "
Throughout his career , Mr. Obama has enjoyed close ties to Jews , including various employers , law school buddies , wealthy donors on the north side of Chicago who backed his early political career , and the many Jews in the Hyde Park community where he lives .
This may account for some of Mr. Obama ’s apparent incredulity at the way some Jewish voters view him .
“ I ’ve been in the foxhole with my Jewish friends , so when I find on the national level my commitment being questioned , it ’s curious , ” he said recently in an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg on theatlantic.com .
Now the half - Kenyan - by - way - of - Hawaii candidate , who only recently completed a beer - and - bowling tour to impress blue - collar Midwesterners , has committed more fully to showing off his inner Jew .
He recently made a surprise speech at the Israeli Embassy in Washington , and , in the interview with Mr. Goldberg , he told stories about a long - lost Jewish summer camp counselor who taught him about Israel and recalled reading Leon Uris and Philip Roth , arguably opposite poles of American - Jewish fiction .
Aides say Mr. Obama will spend as much time in South Florida as possible in the coming months .
His aides believe that the negative rumors floating around about him are mere “ noise , ” as one put it , and have had little impact .
His aides also expressed confidence that when Mr. Obama officially becomes the nominee , the Democratic Party , including its many prominent Jews , will put their full force behind his efforts in Florida .
In anticipation , Mr. Obama has lined up surrogates like State Representative Dan Gelber , the House minority leader , and Mr. Wexler , both of whom are Jewish .
Mr. Wexler said he would try to convert voters one mah - jongg table at a time , with town - hall meetings in the card rooms of high - rise condominiums and articles in community newspapers .
“ Many of the political leaders in Palm Beach and Broward County were at my son ’s bris , ” he said .
Mr. Wexler said he had constituents who voted for Al Smith , the first Catholic presidential nominee , in 1928 , “ and they ’ve never voted for a Republican since . ”
“ They are not going to vote for Senator John McCain , ” he added .
Still , Mr. Wexler admits , he has not yet been able to persuade his in - laws to vote for Mr. Obama .
The other problem for the Government and others who urged the then Home Secretary David Blunkett to downgrade cannabis in the run-up to 2004 , is that the drug on sale to young people on the streets today is very different from the one ministers thought they were downgrading .
Doctors believe that this new strain has the potential to induce paranoia and even psychosis .
Some of those we met who work with young criminals link the advent of the new drug with the growth and intensity of street violence .
Uanu Seshmi runs a small charity in Peckham , where gun crime is rife , which aims to help boys excluded from school escape becoming involved in criminal gangs .
He has seen boys come through his doors who are " unreachable " and he blames the new higher strength cannabis sold on the streets as " skunk " or " super skunk " for warping young minds .
" It is n't the cannabis of our youth , 20 or 30 years ago , " he told me .
" This stuff damages the brain , its effects are irreversible and once the damage is done there is nothing you can do .
I smoke around six joints of regular cannabis every week , mostly at the weekends .
What I like about smoking hash or weed is that it keeps me calm and gives me a more amusing outlook on life .
With skunk , it ’s a completely different story .
Just three drags on a skunk joint will induce paranoia on a massive scale .
I ’m not talking about the difference between a beer and a vodka shot .
I ’m talking about being unable to get out of bed in the morning because you feel paralyzed , about being incapable of holding a conversation .
I would like to think I ’m a pretty lucid guy , but after smoking skunk I find myself struggling to string a sentence together .
In the skunk haze of my student days , I would sometimes find myself unable to leave the house at all .
It ’s like a mild form of dementia .
Once , a friend passed me a skunk joint before going to a birthday party .
After just a few drags , I went into a room full of people , barely able to talk .
I headed straight for the bar and drank as much alcohol as possible to counteract the effects .
It helped , but using one vice to neutralize another is not exactly ideal .
Location :
With British Prime Minister Gordon Brown poised to reclassify marijuana as a more serious drug subject to stiffer penalties , the United Kingdom appears to be in the grip of an outbreak of Reefer Madness that would make Harry Anslinger blush .
Bizarrely , much of the British concern about marijuana is centered on the dreaded " skunk . "
The Daily Mail , which makes the New York Post look like the New York Times , has been a leading proponent of skunk mania .
In an article headlined Cannabis : A deadly habit as easy for children to pick up as a bag of crisps , after blaming marijuana for the problems of British youth culture and prohibition - related violence , the Mail breathlessly reports that skunk is n't your father 's marijuana .
( Have n't we heard this one before ? ) This new strain of marijuana ?
Skunk ?
Odd , since it 's been around since the 1970s ( read the description of Skunk # 1 ) and is just another of the countless indica - sativa hybrids .
Thankfully , we have " drug experts " like Mr. Seshmi to raise the alarm about its irreversible effects .
There 's more from the Mail , which apparently has made reclassifying cannabis its moral crusade of the day .
In another article , How my perfect son became crazed after smoking cannabis , the Mail consults an unhappy mum whose child ran into problems smoking weed .
Last fall , the Mail was warning of -- I kid you not -- " deadly skunk " .
Here are some more skunk headlines from the Mail in recent months : " Son twisted by skunk knifed father 23 times , " " How cannabis made me a monster , " " Escaped prisoner killed man while high on skunk cannabis , " " Boys on skunk butchered a grandmother , " and " Teen who butchered two friends was addicted to skunk cannabis . "
While one expects such yellow journalism from the likes of the tabloid press , even the venerable Times of London is feeling the effects of skunk fever .
Under the headline Cannabis : ' just three drags on a skunk joint will induce paranoia ' , the Times managed to find and highlight some guy named Gerard who does n't like that particularly variety of pot :
My advice to Gerard ( and it 's something he apparently still has the brain cells left to figure out by himself despite smoking the evil skunk ) :
If you do n't like it , do n't smoke it .
But more broadly , what does the Times piece tell us ?
Nothing except this guy does n't like skunk .
Honestly , I do n't understand this British mania over skunk .
Something similar is going on in Australia , only down under , it 's not skunk but the dreaded " hydro " that is causing murder , mayhem , and madness .
Blaming a particular cultivation technique is about as stupid as blaming one variety of cannabis .
I think this is something I 'm going to have to write about in a feature article this week .
I 'll consult cannabis cultivation experts , media critics , and the latest science to try to get a handle on this .

Adventures in an iTunes nation
I 've never had an iPod .
Up to now I 've used a Nokia N95 phone as a portable music player .
I 've had an ad - hoc system of putting music on it involving ripping CDs from linux and occaisionally bothering to connect my phone and copy files to and from it .
Things I 've never investigated but would like to would be how to make podcasts work seamlessly , random changing of music on the device prioritising new stuff and other things I have n't thought of .
I 'm aware that I have n't really got a handle on the new digital music revolution , I still tend to play CDs because I have disks and players everywhere .
I 'd always chalked it up as a thing to find out about at some point in the future .
For christmas I got an iPod Nano Video .
This made the future come through , so I thought it was time to find out .
Given Apple have seamless fantastic support for everything , and the fact my linux laptop initially crashed the device I thought I 'd try out iTunes and see how great the new music revolution actually was .
Starting out
Initially it all went well .
I copied some mp3s onto my iPod via iTunes and it worked .
With a bit of faff downloading a media convertor I was even able to put a music video I had lying around onto it .
All seemed well .
Then I tried to rip a CD via iTunes to install onto my iPod .
I can't .
I tried several CDs .
None of them would rip .
Maybe it 's because I had a USB cd drive ( which linux supports absolutely fine I hasten to add ) .
iTunes can't even play music from the USB cd drive and even Windows Media Player can do that .
Arse , I thought .
But I headed up to my computer upstairs to install the CD on my iPod .
Why wo n't it RIP ?
I put the CD into my other computer with normal CD drive , go to iTunes .
CD still wo n't rip .
Try another CD , that works fine .
Blimey , this copy protected CD stuff actually works on iTunes .
Double check that linux correctly ignores all the stuff and I act suprised that Apple have n't fixed this and that record companies are stupid enough to release music that can't be played on an iPod .
Seriously , music that can't be played on the worlds most popular media device out of the box ?
And they wonder why they 're losing money .
Where did my music go ?
So I connect my iPod to my newly ripped old CD , sync it across .
The iPod is now blank apart from my new CD .
WTF moment # 2 strikes .
I can only use my iPod with one computer .
That 's a complete pain given I have two that I commonly use and it's entirely possible I might want to charge the device without wiping it when I 'm not at home .
Maybe I 'd like to download a podcast when I 'm on the move .
After all , it 's a portable music player that only works with my distinctly non-portable computer because my laptop has a USB cd drive that every other media player in the world can use fine .
So I 'm officially completely unimpressed .
I had these crazy visions that I could plug my iPod into any iTunes machine anywhere and it would magically fill up with the podcasts I 've requested , and I could immediately put CDs and iTunes tracks on it .
Ideally it 'd automagically rotate my music collection around on my iPod even if I was n't at home .
Is this really the best that there is ?
The iPod itself is gorgeous , but the software support is worse than the adhoc system I threw together for my phone over a coffee .
Lost sales
The iPod has sold over 100 million units .
That 's over 100 million people who like listening to music that can't purchase copy protected CDs .
Apparently sales of CDs are on the slide .
Astonishing .
The industry went out of it's way to exclude its 100 million best customers and is now suffering declining sales .
Competition
Name a stupider move a business could make than CDs that can't be played on the iPod .
Advocate , watchdog call for Congress to investigate shoddy kevlar in troop helmets Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 28 , 2008

This A company that allegedly produced sub - standard kevlar for battle helmets used by US troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan continues to receive lucrative government contracts , and Congressional oversight committees need to investigate if the company endangered servicemen and women , veterans ' and government ethics activists said Thursday .
Much remains to be learned about whether Sioux Manufacturing cut corners and ignored safety standards outlined in its federal contract to produce the kevlar helmets .
" The bottom line is that there 's zero room for error when it comes to the protections we give our soldiers , " said John Soltz , director of VoteVets.org , which is joining watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in calling for investigations from the House and Senate Armed Services committees .
Problems with kevlar fabric woven at Sioux 's North Dakota factory were revealed by the New York Times earlier this month .
Soltz spoke to reporters on a conference call Thursday , where he was joined by CREW executive director Melanie Sloan and two whistle - blowers who sued Sioux over its apparently lax manufacturing standards .
According to the Times :
At the core of the investigation was the contention by two former plant managers that Kevlar woven at Sioux failed to meet the governments critical  minimum standard of 35 by 35 threads a square inch .
When properly woven , Kevlar , a polymer thread made by Dupont , is stronger than steel , and able to deflect shrapnel and some bullets .
Government regulations call for rejecting Kevlar below the 35 - by - 35 standard .
The company was underweaving ,  [ The United States attorney for North Dakota , Drew H. ]
Wrigley said .
 That is undebatable ,  he said .
The factorys own inspection records often showed weaves of 34 by 34 threads or as low as 32 by 34 and 33 by 34 .
Looms were always set for 34 by 34 , always ,  said Jeff Kenner , who operated and repaired the looms and oversaw crews on all three shifts .
CREW requested congressional investigations when the Times article first appeared , on Feb. 6 , but the group said neither committee has replied to them .
The Times said the kevlar was produced for PASGT helments , a model that is currently being phased out by the Army .
A spokesperson for the House Armed Services Committee tells RAW STORY , " The Committee continues to engage the Army and [ Defense Logistics Agency ] about quality control practices for helmet procurement and on the status of implementing Secretary Englands order to all military services that they turn in all PASGT helmets currently issued to troops . "
Information provided to the committee by the Army , said no PASGT helmets had been " fielded by the Army " since November 2002 .
After the Justice Department began its inquiry , the Army conducted live - fire tests on a sample of PASGT helmets , all of which passed the inspections .
However , the Army noted it is " physically impossible to deconstruct the helmet , due to resin , fabric bonding and forming . "
Sioux Manufacturing , which is owned by the Spirit Lake Nation Native American tribe , has vigorously denied allegations that its kevlar was not up to par .
 We deny any and all of the allegations originally brought to the attention of the DOJ by disgruntled former employees ,  Carl McKay , the company 's CEO , stated in a news release .
 We cooperated fully throughout the investigation .
Our door was open and employees were permitted to speak during multiple visits by federal agents .
It is unfortunate such allegations can be made that dont require the burden of proof . 
Also on Thursday , CREW released secret recordings they say back up the assertions from whistleblowers Jeff Kenner and Tamra Elshaug that the company knowingly produced sub - standard kevlar .
Both employees say they were fired in November 2005 for raising questions about the kevlar production .
Elshaug said she was harassed by co-workers after questioning company procedures and feared for her safety .
" I was threatened my head would get cut off , " she said Thursday .
Elshaug also said several gunshots were fired at the secluded trailer where she lives after coming forward with her allegations , but the harassment has since tapered off .
Attorney Andrew J. Campanelli , who is representing Elshaug and Kenner , said the Defense Department cannot be trusted to investigate Sioux ; he noted that several DoD documents went missing after the Pentagon learned that as many as 2.2 million helmets were produced with inadequate kevlar .
Sioux Manufacturing paid $ 2 million to settle the whistleblower 's law suit , but just before the settlement was reached , the company received another $ 74 million government contract , according to the Times .
The company has released a lengthy rebuttal of the article .
 How was Sioux Manufacturing allowed to make insufficient Kevlar in the first place and then once that was exposed how could the company be awarded a new contract ?
Are there soldiers who would have escaped injury or death if their helmets had met government standards rather than the inferior ones produced by Sioux ? " CREW executive director Melanie Sloan asked .
" Frankly , the chairs and ranking members of Armed Services , Senators Carl Levin and John McCain and Representatives Ike Skleton and Duncan Hunter cannot be permitted to take a pass on this . 
- Berlin , Germany .
If you were asked to name one person who has enabled more people to gain wealth and security than any other person on the globe , who would you name ?
In 1881 , here in Berlin , Otto von Bismarck started the world 's first modern pay - as - you - go social security system which served as the model for the U.S. Social Security system and that of many other countries , including setting the retirement age at 65 .
No , Bismarck is not the answer to the opening question , the answer is Jose Pinera , and here is why .
Bismarck 's social security system was basically a Ponzi scheme whereby young workers pay taxes to support the retirees .
It only works over the long run where the population is growing and where most retirees do not live very long .
These conditions no longer exist in the high - income countries .
And even in low - and middle - income countries , population growth has slowed , and lifespans increase rapidly .
As a result , many of the world 's social security systems have become retirement insecurity systems as they head toward bankruptcy .
Thirty years ago , a young Jose Pinera , who had earned a Ph.D. at Harvard , was Chile 's labor minister .
He saw the coming disaster in the government old - age pension system .
Inspired by an idea from the late Nobel Prize winning economist , Milton Friedman , he developed a solution that empowers workers and gives them real financial security .
Pinera - type social security systems have now been adopted by more than 30 countries and cover several hundred million people — for a very simple reason — it works !
Under the Pinera - type social security systems , workers are required to invest in highly diversified , qualified funds .
Because they actually own their pension funds ( like 401 ( k ) funds in the United States ) , workers can choose their age of retirement , whether it is age 50 or 80 .
The longer they work , the more money they will have — but again each individual determines his or her own retirement age .
( The very poor and those unable to work are still covered by a government system . )
Mr. Pinera is here in Berlin , selling his concept to German opinion leaders , as part of a multi-country " Free Market Road Show " sponsored by the European Center for Economic Growth and the Hayek Institute of Vienna , Austria .
The Chilean privatized system began in 1981 , exactly 100 years after Bismarck instituted his system in Germany .
It has been 29 years since the system went into effect in Chile so Mr. Pinera now can answer his critics , not only with theoretical arguments , but with hard data .
The results are remarkable .
Chile 's citizens have on average experienced a 10 percent per year , above inflation , compounded growth rate in their pension funds for the last 29 years .
The result is most Chileans are no longer poor , but are , in fact , " small capitalists . "
The Chilean government , increasingly freed from paying pensions out of tax funds ( almost all Chileans have moved into the private accounts , though they could have stayed in the old government system ) , is now running a budget surplus of 10 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which could pave the way for the abolition of the income tax .
The new Chilean system has provided so much investment capital that Chile moved from being a poor country to being a solid middle - income country with the highest per capita income in South America .
Critics in the U.S. and elsewhere claim investing pension funds in stocks and bonds is risky , but the real risk to the elderly is being trapped in government social security schemes headed toward insolvency .
In 1981 , the Dow Jones stock average stood at about 800 .
Despite all the ups and downs over the years , and the turmoil of this last year , the Dow Jones average stands about 12,800 or about 16 times where it was in 1981 .
Those Americans now retiring on Social Security will unfortunately receive only very modest payments in relation to what they could have received if their political leaders had not kept them locked into a fiscally unsustainable government system .
Some critics of privatized social security claim that even though the returns are better under a privatized system , the " transition costs " are too great .
In fact , there are no economic costs to the country of the transition , as Chile and other countries which have adopted the privatized system have shown .
We now know that both in theory and practice privatized social security works far better than pay - as - you - go government systems .
Opponents can only keep their citizens from adopting Pinera - type systems by keeping them ignorant of the benefits , and making false statements about the privatized social security system 's successes .
Fortunately , the world still has a very vigorous Jose Pinera , who for three decades has made it his life 's work to empower workers and make them small capitalists , freed from the government foot upon their necks .
Mr. Pinera has already made life more secure and prosperous for millions , and with luck it will soon be billions of people .
John McCain and Barack Obama , are you listening ?

Sexologist Jamye Waxman will lead three hands - on sex workshops for fans at the Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas this week . *

In yet another sign that the sex industry is going mainstream , Adult Entertainment Expo seminars will be open to porn fans for the first time this week in Las Vegas .
The annual conference 's seminars usually target adult industry insiders only , but this year 's fan - friendly topics are n't necessarily what people might expect to find at a porn show : a female orgasm workshop , a sex toy demo and , perhaps most surprising , a relationship clinic called " Monogamy Without Monotony . "
Seminar sponsor Adam & Eve ( NSFW ) admits that the workshops are an attempt to attract a new , younger demographic to the company 's line of instructional videos .
" Adult has come out of the shadows , and we feel we 're at the forefront of that , " said Peter Reynolds , vice president of sales and marketing at Adam & Eve .
" How refreshing that you can go to something like this and it's all fun and positive , not like a bunch of creepy old men in raincoats . "
This year 's Adult Entertainment Expo , or AEE , will offer the usual blend of trade business and fan access , with corporate deals taking place behind the " take a picture with a porn star " curtain at the Sands Expo and Convention Center .
As the adult industry struggles to find its place in a rapidly changing consumer environment – competing with amateurs , pirates and independent producers – AEE organizers are trying to find new ways to convince fans to plunk down $ 80 for a day pass to the show , which runs Jan. 9 through 12 .
Boobies , it seems , are no longer enough .
" People are coming to AEE to see porn stars and be in this Hollywood sex world where it's all about the fantasy , " said New York - based sexologist Jamye Waxman , who is leading the classes .
" These workshops can help people incorporate the fantasy back into the reality . "
Waxman has a master 's degree in human sexuality from Widener University and has been a professional sex educator for almost 10 years .
Her seminars are based on the Personal Touch ( NSFW ) line of educational porn videos she is directing for Adam & Eve .
Adult actors Dick Chibbles and Daisy Layne , a married couple who star in the series '
Exploring the " O " video , will join Waxman for Friday 's " Uncovering the O : Female Orgasms and More " session and Saturday 's " Sex Toy Workshops : How to Choose Them / How To Use Them , " helping to demonstrate tips and techniques .
Chibbles said he believes that hosting the seminars at AEE represents a shift in American culture .
" In the past five years , the country has really loosened up about pornography in our society , " he said , mentioning several television series and specials that revolve around porn and sex .
" It seems that America is starting to get with the rest of the world , not being so uptight about sex .
I think it 's great .
It 's about time . "
But will fans want to work on their relationships at the porn show ?
Waxman said she thinks so : " Porn is a good gateway for men to talk to their women about things they might want to try or experiences they might want to have . "
" The monogamy clinic recognizes that you 're going to be in a long - term relationship , and focuses on ways you can have a great sex life , " she said .
" It 's not about inviting a third party in , it 's about role - play and mutual masturbation and anal sex – both sexes can have pleasure from having stuff up their butts – and other things you can do to keep that sizzle , or bring it back if it 's gone . "
Others are n't so sure .
Julian Prichard of Seattle , a porn fan and Sex Drive forum participant who wo n't make it to the convention this year but has always been curious about AEE , said the seminar topics , while interesting , do n't seem like a good fit for the event .
" They seem like standard relationship workshops bolted on to the conference , " Prichard said .
" Why not have workshops like how to use porn to enhance your relationship , or a beginner 's guide to porn and relationships , and things like that ? "
It remains to be seen how eager fans will be to spend an hour away from the AEE porn extravaganza to learn about sex .
Michael West , a network manager who lives in Alabama and has always wanted to attend AEE , says he would check out the seminars if he were able to go this year .
" It 's a reflection of the normalization or mainstreaming of porn these days , " he said .
Gabriel Carrejo , vice president of adult social networking site Sin2.0 ( NSFW ) , is a bit more cynical .
" No one is going to AEE for the seminars , " he said .

Grumbles over Wednesday 's scheduled appearance by John Bolton at the Hay festival turned caustic last night as the activist and journalist George Monbiot called for a citizen 's arrest of the man George Bush controversially appointed to the UN in 2005 .
The Guardian columnist 's demand - greeted with cheers from the audience - came just hours after an audience member challenged the veteran author Gore Vidal for appearing on the same festival bill as Bolton , who is widely viewed as a driving force behind the 2OO2 invasion of Iraq .
Monbiot expressed astonishment that a " war criminal " such as Bolton could " swim through the politest of polite soirees - which is of course Hay " , without fear of proper interrogation .
People such as Bolton and Tony Blair " would 've been hanged " had a Nuremberg - like trial been held to investigate the war in Iraq , he added .
Speaking at a session to discuss the book Defeat : How They Lost in Iraq , with its author Jonathan Steele and former UN senior official Shashi Tharoor , Monbiot attacked the way Bolton and others had been " rehabilitated " after playing a role in the war which he characterised as " clearly a prima facie case of criminality " .
Bolton , who was the US administration 's undersecretary of state for arms control in the lead up to the iraq war , is due to appear with Nik Gowing at the literary festival , which is sposnored by the Guardian , on Wednesday evening .
Earlier in the day , the esteemed American man of letters Gore Vidal was asked from the audience whether he thought the invitation extended to Bolton , decribed by the questioner as a " war criminal " , was justifiable .
Vidal , deliberately or otherwise , appeared not to recognise Bolton 's name towards the end of a wind - buffeted session .
It 's not the first time a prominent neoconservative figure from the US has raised Hay hackles .
At last year 's festival , the Republican party stalwart Richard Perle faced flak from the audience as he defended his support for the invasion of Iraq .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Nicole Paultre Bell bolted from the courtroom Friday as a judge acquitted three New York City detectives of all charges in the shooting death of her fiance .

" I 've got to get out of here , " Paultre Bell said .
Justice Arthur Cooperman was announcing the verdict clearing Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora of manslaughter , assault and reckless endangerment in the death of Sean Bell .
Detective Marc Cooper was cleared of reckless endangerment .
" What we saw in court today was not a miscarriage of justice , " the Rev. Al Sharpton said on his radio program .
" Justice did n't miscarry , " he said .
" This was an abortion of justice .
Justice was aborted . "
Sharpton , who has been advising Bell 's family , had called for calm Wednesday .
Bell , 23 , died in November 2006 in a 50 - bullet barrage -- 31 fired by Oliver -- hours before he was to be married .
Two of his companions were wounded in the gunfire outside a Queens nightclub .
Alexander Jason , an expert witness for the defense , produced a video demonstrating how quickly Oliver could have fired off 31 rounds , including a pause to reload .

The three officers made brief statements more than four hours after the verdict .
" I want to say sorry to Bell family for the tragedy , " Cooper said .
Isnora thanked the judge " for his fair and accurate decision today . "
Oliver praised Cooperman " for a fair and just decision . "
That 's not how one community leader viewed it .
" This case was not about justice , " declared Leroy Gadsden , chair of the police / community relations committee of the Jamaica Branch NAACP .
" This case was about the police having a right to be above the law .
If the law was in effect here , if the judge had followed the law truly , these officers would have been found guilty .
" This court , unfortunately , is bankrupt when it comes to justice for people of color . "
Patrick Lynch , president of the New York Police Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association , said " there 's no winners ; there 's no losers " in the case .
" We still have a death that occurred .
We still have police officers that have to live with the fact that there was a death involved in their case , " Lynch said .
But , he added , the verdict assured police officers that they will be treated fairly in New York 's courts .
Many people outside the courthouse saw it differently .

" You can't be proud of wearing that hat .

" You must stop working for the masters !
Stand down !
Stop working for the masters ! "
" Fifty shots is murder .
I do n't care what you say .

Watch the commotion outside the courthouse »
Despite the evident anger and a brief fistfight , the crowd remained generally orderly .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a statement saying , " An innocent man lost his life , a bride lost her groom , two daughters lost their father , and a mother and a father lost their son .
No verdict could ever end the grief that those who knew and loved Sean Bell suffer . "
However , he said , the legal system must be respected .
" America is a nation of laws , and though not everyone will agree with the verdicts and opinions issued by the courts , we accept their authority . "
Bloomberg also said he had spoken briefly with Paultre Bell on Wednesday and agreed with her on the need to ensure that similar incidents would not occur in the future .
Queens County District Attorney Richard A. Brown echoed the mayor 's sentiments .
" I accept his verdict , and I urge certainly that all fair - minded people in this city to the same , " Brown said .
" The bottom line is that all of us working together -- the law enforcement community , our elected public officials , our individuals who are involved -- have got to make certain that that which occurred ... is never again repeated . "
In announcing the verdict , Cooperman said he found problems with the prosecution 's case .
He said some prosecution witnesses contradicted themselves , and he cited prior convictions and incarcerations of witnesses .
" At times , the testimony just did n't make sense , " Cooperman said , according to a transcript released by his office .
He also cited the demeanor of some witnesses on the stand .
Bell was killed just before dawn on his wedding day , November 25 , 2006 .
He and several friends were winding up an all - night bachelor party at the Kalua Club in Queens , a strip club that was under investigation by a NYPD undercover unit looking into complaints of guns , drugs and prostitution .
Undercover detectives were inside the club , and plainclothes officers were stationed outside .
Witnesses said that about 4 a.m. , closing time , as Bell and his friends left the club , an argument broke out .
Believing that one of Bell 's friends , Joseph Guzman , was going to get a gun from Bell 's car , one of the undercover detectives followed the men and called for backup .
What happened next was at the heart of the trial , prosecuted by the assistant district attorney in Queens .
Bell , Guzman and Trent Benefield got into the car , with Bell at the wheel .
The detectives drew their weapons , said Guzman and Benefield , who testified that they never heard the plainclothes detectives identify themselves as police .
Bell was in a panic to get away from the armed men , his friends testified .
But the detectives thought Bell was trying to run down one of them , believed that their lives were in danger and started shooting , according to their lawyers .
A total of 50 bullets were fired by five NYPD officers .
Only three were charged with crimes .
No gun was found near Bell or his friends .
Paultre Bell , Guzman and Benefield have filed a wrongful - death lawsuit in federal court that has been stayed pending the outcome of the criminal trial .
Federal prosecutors will conduct a review to determine whether there were any civil rights violations , Brown said .

George Bush 's nominee for Surgeon General has drawn a lot of heat for among other things , his crack - pot anti-gay views as a leader in the United Methodist affiliate of the Institute on Religion and Democracy .
But a new report may finally sink his already controversial nomination in a sea of conflicts of interest that have marked his career .
Dr. James Holsinger has also been a longtime leader of the Confessing Movement in the United Methodist Church .
The Confessing Movement is a rightwing " renewal group " affiliated with the Washington , DC - based Institute on Religion and Democracy ( IRD ) , whose purpose for a generation has been to divide and disrupt the historic churchs of mainline protestantism in the interests of advancing neoconservatism and the religious right .
Holsinger was elected to the highest court in the Methodist Church a time when the IRD - affiliated church " renewal " groups had launched efforts to use church judicial systems to enforce their notions of orthodoxy , particularly on matters related to homosexuality .
Now , an investigation Rev. Andrew J. Weaver , Ph.D. and Lawrence H. McGaughey , Esq. , and published at Media Transparency , shows that Holsinger used the sale of a United Methodist Church - owned hospital in Kentucky , as a cash cow for his personal ambitions .
It took years of litigation by the church to find out what had happened to its money , only to learn that Holsinger had diverted millions to endow professorships at the Chandler Medical Center at the University of Kentucky where he served as Chancellor and fundraiser - in - chief .

Martin Feldstein says the Fed has cut the federal funds rate enough , further cuts will hurt the domestic economy more than they will help , and the cuts would have a negative impact on developing economies :
Enough With the Interest Rate Cuts , by Martin Feldstein , Commentary , WSJ :
It 's time for the Federal Reserve to stop reducing the federal funds rate , because the likely benefit is small compared to the potential damage .
Lower interest rates could raise the already high prices of energy and food , which are already triggering riots in developing countries .
...
Many factors have contributed to the recent rise in the prices of oil and food , especially the increased demand from China , India and other rapidly growing countries .
Lower interest rates ... add to the upward pressure on these commodity prices – by making it less costly for commodity investors and commodity speculators to hold larger inventories of oil and food grains .
...
An interest rate - induced rise in the price of oil also contributes indirectly to higher prices of food grains .
It does so by making it profitable for farmers to devote more farm land to growing corn for ethanol .
...
Rising food and energy prices can contribute significantly to the inflation rate and the cost of living in the U.S. ... [ A ] 10 % rise in the prices of food and energy adds 2.5 % to the overall price level .
Commodity price inflation is of particular concern now that the CPI has increased 4 % in the past 12 months .
Surveys indicate that households are expecting a 4.8 % rise in the coming year .
In lower - income , emerging - market countries , food and energy are generally a larger part of consumer spending .
A rise in these commodity prices can therefore add proportionally more to the cost of living in those countries , and therefore depress real incomes to a greater extent than in the U.S .
Government actions to dilute these effects by increased subsidies on the prices of energy and food add to the government deficits , reducing the national saving available for investment in plant and equipment that would otherwise contribute to faster economic growth .
The rise in the U.S. inflation rate , and the adverse effects in emerging market countries , might be defensible if lower interest rates could significantly stimulate demand and reduce the risk of a deep recession .
But under current conditions , reducing the federal funds interest rate from the current 2.25 % by 50 or 75 basis points is not likely to do much to stimulate demand .
The current conditions in the housing industry and in credit markets mean that ... with the massive inventory of unsold homes ... a further cut in the fed funds rate would have little effect on housing construction .
Moreover , lowering the fed funds rate has not brought down mortgage interest rates .
...
Economic recovery will require resolving the difficult problems of the credit markets , dealing with the millions of homeowners who may now be tempted to default on mortgages that exceed the value of their homes , and reducing the risk that the ongoing decline in house prices will push millions of additional homeowners into a vulnerable , negative equity condition .
A lower fed funds rate will not solve any of those problems .

The infamous and questionable JPEG patent held by Global Patent Holdings ( GPH ) and used to threaten just about anyone online ( including the Green Bay Packers , CDW , a resort in Florida and others ) who happened to have a JPEG on their website has been put on hold for a while .
While the folks behind it somehow got Forbes to write a puff piece making it sound like the patent holder was the victim , if you look at the details , it was clear that this was an abuse of the patent system .
It was a questionable patent from the beginning , and an earlier review of the patent hadthrown out .
However , during that process , the patent holder tried adding a ton of other claims -- one of which the USPTO actually allowed to go through .
It 's that single remaining claim that 's being used to sue lots of folks .
However , with the USPTO recently agreeing to re-examine that one claim , those being sued have asked the court to put all of the cases on hold until the re-exam is done .
As we 've pointed out , all too often , judges refuse to wait for the Patent Office to re-examine a patent -- which is a big problem , since so many re-exams result in rejected claims
However , that 's not the case here .
Last week , the judge ruled that it made sense to stay the case until the re-exam was complete .
GPH protested this move , noting that the patent had already been re-examined before , and that process took many years during which GPH could n't enforce the patent .
However , the court reasonably responded on a few different points .
First , it noted that while the length of the re-exam last time was quite long , with only one claim it should n't take as long this time .
Second , it pointed out that while it 's true the patent was re-examined once before , since this claim is a new claim , it wasre - examined -- only examined .
Finally , and most importantly , the court noted that if the courts hadwaited , a bad decision likely would have resulted , as they would have had to assume the later rejected claims were valid .
This should , effectively , keep GPH from filing any more suits on this patent until the USPTO has a chance to review the remaining claim .
While other lawsuits can be filed , a quick pointer to this ruling should hopefully keep those cases from going anywhere until the USPTO has reviewed the patent .
Oh , and by the way , the judge appears to not have been even remotely swayed by the totally unrelated fact that the original inventors of the patent were old and feeble , which GPH had used in trying to get a sympathy vote .
It was so inconsequential the judge does n't even mention it in the ruling .

Khaled looked at me with a broad smile .
He was almost laughing .
At one point , when I told him that he should abandon all thoughts of being a suicide bomber – that he could influence more people in this world by becoming a journalist – he put his head back and shot me a grin , world - weary for a man in his teens .
" You have your mission , " he said .
" And I have mine . "
His sisters looked at him in awe .
He was their hero , their amanuensis and their teacher , their representative and their soon - to - be- martyred brother .
Yes , he was handsome , young – just 18 – he was dressed in a black Giorgio Armani T - shirt , a small , carefully trimmed Spanish conquistador 's beard , gelled hair .
And he was ready to immolate himself .
A sinister surprise .
I had travelled to Khaled 's home to speak to his mother .
I had already written about his brother Hassan and wanted to introduce a Canadian journalist colleague , Nelofer Pazira , to the family .
When Khaled walked on to the porch of the house , Nelofer and I both realised – at the same moment – that he was next , the next to die , the next " martyr " .
It was his smile .
I 've come across these young men before , but never one who so obviously declared his calling .
His family sat around us on the porch of their home above the Lebanese city of Sidon , the sitting room adorned with coloured photographs of Hassan , already gone to the paradise – so they assured me – for which Khaled clearly thought he was destined .
Hassan had driven his explosives - laden car into an American military convoy at Tal Afar in north - western Iraq , his body ( or what was left of it ) buried " in situ " – or so his mother was informed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It 's easy to find the families of the newly dead in Lebanon .
Their names are read from the minarets of Sidon 's mosques ( most are Palestinian ) and in Tripoli , in northern Lebanon , the Sunni " Tawhid " movement boasts " hundreds " of suiciders among its supporters .
Every night , the population of Lebanon watches the brutal war in Iraq on television .
" It 's difficult to reach ' Palestine ' these days , " Khaled 's uncle informed me .
" Iraq is easier . "
Too true .
No one doubts that the road to Baghdad – or Tal Afar or Fallujah or Mosul – lies through Syria , and that the movement of suicide bombers from the Mediterranean coasts to the deserts of Iraq is a planned if not particularly sophisticated affair .
What is astonishing – what is not mentioned by the Americans or the Iraqi " government " or the British authorities or indeed by many journalists – is the sheer scale of the suicide campaign , the vast numbers of young men ( only occasionally women ) , who wilfully destroy themselves amid the American convoys , outside the Iraqi police stations , in markets and around mosques and in shopping streets and on lonely roads beside remote checkpoints across the huge cities and vast deserts of Iraq .
Never have the true figures for this astonishing and unprecedented campaign of self - liquidation been calculated .
But a month - long investigation by The Independent , culling four Arabic - language newspapers , official Iraqi statistics , two Beirut news agencies and Western reports , shows that an incredible 1,121 Muslim suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq .
This is a very conservative figure and – given the propensity of the authorities ( and of journalists ) to report only those suicide bombings that kill dozens of people – the true estimate may be double this number .
On several days , six – even nine – suicide bombers have exploded themselves in Iraq in a display of almost Wal - Mart availability .
If life in Iraq is cheap , death is cheaper .
This is perhaps the most frightening and ghoulish legacy of George Bush 's invasion of Iraq five years ago .
Suicide bombers in Iraq have killed at least 13,000 men , women and children – our most conservative estimate gives a total figure of 13,132 – and wounded a minimum of 16,112 people .
If we include the dead and wounded in the mass stampede at the Baghdad Tigris river bridge in the summer of 2005 – caused by fear of suicide bombers – the figures rise to 14,132 and 16,612 respectively .
Again , it must be emphasised that these statistics are minimums .
For 529 of the suicide bombings in Iraq , no figures for wounded are available .
Where wounded have been listed in news reports as " several " , we have made no addition to the figures .
And the number of critically injured who later died remains unknown .
Set against a possible death toll of half a million Iraqis since the March 2003 invasion , the suicide bombers ' victims may appear insignificant ; but the killers ' ability to terrorise civilians , militiamen and Western troops and mercenaries is incalculable .
Never before has the Arab world witnessed a phenomenon of suicide - death on this scale .
During Israel 's occupation of Lebanon after 1982 , one Hizbollah suicide - bombing a month was considered remarkable .
During the Palestinian intifadas of the 1980s and 1990s , four per month was regarded as unprecedented .
But suicide bombers in Iraq have been attacking at the average rate of two every three days since the 2003 Anglo - American invasion .
And , although neither the Iraqi government nor their American mentors will admit this , scarcely 10 out of more than a thousand suicide killers have been identified .
We know from their families that Palestinians , Saudis , Syrians and Algerians have been among the bombers .
In a few cases , we have names .
But in most attacks , the authorities in Iraq – if they can still be called " authorities " after five years of catastrophe – have no idea to whom the bloodied limbs and headless torsos of the bombers belong .
Even more profoundly disturbing is that the " cult " of the suicide bomber has seeped across national frontiers .
Within a year of the Iraqi invasion , Afghan Taliban bombers were blowing themselves up alongside Western troops or bases in Helmand province and in the capital Kabul .
The practice leached into Pakistan , striking down thousands of troops and civilians , killing even the principal opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto .
The London Tube and bus bombings – despite the denials of Tony Blair – were obviously deeply influenced by events in Iraq .
Academics and politicians have long debated the motives of the bombers , the psychological make - up of the men and women who cold - bloodedly decide to undertake the role of suicide executioners ; for they are executioners , killers who see their victims – be they soldiers or civilians – before they flick the switch that destroys them .
The Israelis long ago decided that there was no " perfect " profile for a suicide bomber , and my own experience in Lebanon bears this out .
The suicider might have spent years fighting the Israelis in the south of the country .
Often , they would have been imprisoned or tortured by Israel or its proxy Lebanese militia .
Sometimes , brothers or other family members would have been killed .
On other occasions , the example of their own relatives would have drawn them into the vortex of suicide - by - example .
Khaled is – or was , for I no longer know if he is alive , since I met him a few weeks ago– influenced by his brother Hassan , whose journey to Iraq was organised by an unknown group , presumably Palestinian , and whose weapons training beside the Tigris river was videotaped by his comrades .
Hassan 's mother has shown me this tape – which ends with Hassan cheerfully waving goodbye from the driver 's window of a battered car , presumably the vehicle he was about to ram into the American convoy at Tal Afar .
None of this addresses the issue of religious belief .
While there is evidence aplenty that the Japanese suicide pilots of the Second World War were sometimes coerced and intimidated into their final flights against US warships in the Pacific , many also believed that they were dying for their emperor .
For them , the fall of cherry blossom and the divine wind – the " kamikaze " – blessed their souls as they aimed their bombers at American aircraft carriers .
But even an industrialised dictatorship like Japan – facing the imminent collapse of its entire society at the hands of a superpower – could only mobilise 4,615 " kamikazes " .
The Iraq suicide bombers may already have reached half that number .
But the Japanese authorities encouraged their pilots to think of themselves as a collective suicide unit whose insignia of imminent death – white Rising Sun headbands and white scarves – prefigured the yellow headbands imprinted with Koranic script that Hizbollah guerrillas wore when they set out to attack Israeli soldiers in the occupied zone of southern Lebanon .
In Iraq , however , those who direct the growing army of suiciders do not lack inventiveness .
Their bombers have arrived at the scene of their self - destruction dressed as car mechanics , soldiers , police officers , middle - aged housewives , children 's sweet - sellers , worshippers and – on one occasion – a " harmless " shepherd .
They have carried their bombs in Oldsmobiles , fuel trucks , garbage trucks , flat - bed trucks , on donkeys and bicycles , motor - bikes and mopeds and carts , minibuses , date - vendors ' vans , mobile recruitment centres and lorries packed with chlorine .
Incredibly , there appears to be no individual central " brain " behind the bombings – although " groupuscules " of bombers obviously exist .
Inspiration , imitation and the globalised influence of the internet appear sufficient to empower the bombers of Iraq .
On an individual level , it is possible to see the friction and psychological trauma of families .
Khaled 's mother , for instance , constantly expressed her pride in her dead son Hassan and , in front of me , she looked with almost equal love at his still - living brother .
But when my companion urged Khaled to remain alive for his mother 's sake – reminding him that the Prophet himself spoke of the primary obligation of a Muslim man to protect his mother – the woman was close to tears .
She was torn apart by her love as a mother and her religious - political duty as the woman who had brought another would - be martyr into the world .
When my friend again urged Khaled to remain alive , to stay in Sidon and marry – eerily , the muezzin's call to prayer had begun during our conversation – he shook his head .
Not even a disparaging remark about those who would send him on his death mission – that they were prepared to live in this world while sending others like Khaled to their fate – could discourage him .
" I am not going to become a ' shahed ' [ martyr ] for people , " he replied .
" I am doing it for God . "
It was the same old argument .
We could produce a hundred good ways – peaceful ways – for him to resolve the injustices of this world ; but the moment Khaled invoked the name of God , our suggestions became irrelevant .
Rationality – humanism , if you like – simply withered away .
If a Western president could invoke a war of " good against evil " , his antagonists could do the same .
But is there a rational pattern to the suicide bombings in Iraq ?
The first incidents of their kind took place as American troops were actually advancing towards Baghdad .
Near the Shia town of Nasiriyah , an off - duty Iraqi policeman , Sergeant Ali Jaffar Moussa Hamadi al - Nomani , drove a car bomb into an American Marine roadblock .
Married , with five children , he had been a soldier in Iraq 's 1980 - 88 war with Iran and had volunteered to fight the Americans after Saddam 's occupation of Kuwait .
Shortly afterwards , two Shia Muslim women did the same .
In its dying days , even Saddam Hussein 's own government was shocked .
" The US administration is going to turn the whole world into people prepared to die for their nations , " Saddam 's vice - president , Taha Yassin Ramadan , warned .
" All they can do now is turn themselves into bombs .
If the B - 52 bombs can now kill 500 or more in our war , then I 'm sure that some operations by our freedom fighters will be able to kill 5,000 . "
Ramadan even referred to " the martyr 's moment of sublimity " – an al - Qa'ida - like phrase that ill befitted a secular Baathist – and it was clear that the vice - president was almost as surprised as the Americans .
But only two days after the US occupation of Baghdad , a woman killed herself while trying to explode a grenade among a group of American troops outside the capital .
Throughout the five years of war , suicide bombers have focused on Iraq 's own American - trained security forces rather than US troops .
At least 365 attacks have been staged against Iraqi police or paramilitary forces .
Their targets included at least 147 police stations ( 1,577 deaths ) , 43 army and police recruitment centres ( 939 deaths ) , 91 checkpoints ( with a minimum of 564 fatalities ) , 92 security patrols ( 465 deaths ) and numerous other police targets ( escorts , convoys accompanying government ministers , etc ) .
One of the recruitment centres – in the centre of Baghdad – was assaulted by suicide bombers on eight separate occasions .
By contrast , suicide bombers have attacked only 24 US bases at a cost of 100 American dead and 15 Iraqis , and 43 American patrols and checkpoints , during which 116 US personnel were killed along with at least 56 civilians , 15 of whom appear to have been shot by American soldiers in response to the attacks , and another 26 of whom were children standing next to a US patrol .
Most of the Americans were killed west or north of Baghdad .
Suicide attacks on the police concentrated on Baghdad and Mosul and the Sunni towns to the immediate north and south of Baghdad .
The trajectory of the suicide bombers shows a clear preference for military targets throughout the insurgency , with attacks on Americans gradually decreasing from 2006 and individual attacks on Iraqi police patrols and police recruits increasing over the past two years , especially in the 100 miles north of Baghdad .
Just as the Islamist murderers of Algeria – and their military opponents – favoured the fasting month of Ramadan for their bloodiest assaults in the 1990s , so the suicide bombers of Iraq mobilise on the eve of religious festivals .
There was a pronounced drop in suicide assaults during the period of sectarian liquidations after 2005 , either because the bombers feared interception by the throat - cutters of tribal gangs working their way across Baghdad , or because – a grim possibility – they were themselves being used in the sectarian murder campaign .
The most politically powerful attacks occurred inside military bases – including the Green Zone in Baghdad ( two in one day in October 2004 ) – and against the UN headquarters ( in which the UN envoy Sergio de Mello was killed ) and the International Red Cross offices in Baghdad in 2003 .
By December 2003 , British officials were warning that there were more " spectacular " suicide bombings to come , and the first suicide assault on a mosque took place in January of the following year when a bomber on a bicycle blew himself up in a Shia mosque in Baquba , killing four worshippers and wounding another 39 .
Scarcely a year later , another suicider attacked a second Shia mosque , killing 14 worshippers and wounding 40 .
In February 2004 , a man blew himself up on a bus outside the Shia mosque at Khadamiyah in Baghdad , killing 17 more Shia Muslims .
Only a few days earlier , a man wearing an explosives belt killed four at yet another Shia mosque in the Doura district of Baghdad .
The suicide campaign against Shia places of worship continued with an attack on a Mosul mosque in March 2005 , killing at least 50 , two more attacks in April that killed 26 , and another in May in Baghdad .
While Shia mosques were being targeted in a deliberate campaign of provocation by al - Qa'ida - type suiciders , markets and hospitals frequented by Shia Muslims were also attacked .
Almost all the 600 Iraqis killed by suicide bombs in May 2005 were Shias .
After the partial demolition of the Shia mosque at Samarra on 22 February 2006 , the " war of the mosques " began in earnest for the suicide bombers of Iraq .
A Sunni mosque was blown up , with nine dead and " dozens " of wounded , and two Shia mosques were the target of suicide bombers in the same week .
In early July 2006 , seven suicide killers blew themselves up in Sunni and Shia mosques , leaving a total of 51 civilians dead .
During the same period , a suicide bomber launched the first attack of its kind on Shia pilgrims arriving from Iran .
Bombers were to attack the funerals of those Shia they had killed , and even wedding parties .
Schools , university campuses and shopping precincts were also now included on the target lists , most of the victims yet again being Shia .
Over the past year , however , an increasing number of tribal leaders loyal to the Americans – including Sattar Abu Risha , who publicly met President Bush on 13 September 2007 , and former insurgents who have now joined the American - paid anti-al - Qa'ida militias – have been blown apart by Sunni bombers .
Only about 10 of the suicide bombers have been identified .
One of them , who attacked an Iraqi police unit in June 2005 , turned out to be a former police commando called Abu Mohamed al - Dulaimi , but the Americans and the Iraqi authorities appear to have little intelligence on the provenance of these killers .
On at least 27 occasions , Iraqi officials have claimed to know the identity of the killers – saying that they had recovered passports and identity papers that proved their " foreign " origin – but they have never produced these documents for public inspection .
There is even doubt that the two suicide bombers who blew themselves up in a bird market earlier this year were in fact mentally retarded young women , as the government was to allege .
Indeed , nothing could better illustrate the lack of knowledge of the authorities than the two contradictory statements made by the Americans and their Iraqi protégés in March of last year .
Just as David Satterfield , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 's adviser on Iraq , was claiming that " 90 per cent " of suicide bombers were crossing the border from Syria , Iraq 's Prime Minister , Nuri al - Maliki , was announcing that " most " of the suiciders came from Saudi Arabia – which shares a long , common border with Iraq .
Saudis would hardly waste their time travelling to Damascus to cross a border that their own country shared with Iraq .
Many in Baghdad , including some government ministers , believe that the nationality of the bombers is much closer to home – that they are , in fact , Iraqis .
It will be many years before we have a clearer idea of the number of bombers who have killed themselves in the Iraq war – and of their origin .
Long before
The Independent 's total figure reached 500 , al - Qa'ida 's Abu Musab al - Zarqawi was boasting of " 800 martyrs " among his supporters .
And since al - Zarqawi's death brought not the slightest reduction in bombings , we must assume that there are many other " manipulators " in charge of Iraq 's suicide squads .
Nor can we assume the motives for every mass murder .
Who now remembers that the greatest individual number of victims of any suicide bombing died in two remote villages of the Kahtaniya region of Iraq , all Yazidis – 516 of them slaughtered , another 525 wounded .
A Yazidi girl , it seems , had fallen in love with a Sunni man and had been punished by her own people for this " honour crime " : she had been stoned to death .
The killers presumably came from the Sunni community .
One of George Bush 's most insidious legacies in Iraq thus remains its most mysterious ; the marriage of nationalism and spiritual ferocity , the birth of an unprecedentedly huge army of Muslims inspired by the idea of death .
As the International Whaling Commission meets to search for common ground between pro- and anti-whaling nations , the BBC's Chris Hogg reports from a Japanese town showing no sign of giving up on its whale meat .
The meat will be flavoured with soy sauce and sake , then dried
If you want to understand why the Japanese hunt whales , you need to travel to one of the handful of small coastal communities where they still take them from the sea , a place like Wada .
If you want to understand why the Japanese hunt whales , you need to travel to one of the handful of small coastal communities where they still take them from the sea , a place like Wada .
The small town clings to the steep hills that surround it , as if trying to stop itself falling into the sea .
Fishing boats are pulled up on the shore in the tiny harbour .
Nearby a few men are mending their nets .
The International Whaling Commission bans commercial whaling , but not all species of whale are covered by its rules .
Yoshinori Shoji is the town 's whaler .
He catches 14 whales every year .
Most of the whales Mr Shoji catches are Baird 's Beaked Whales .
He finds them about 20 km ( 12 miles ) off the coast .
Japanese government fishing quotas allow him to hunt during just three summer months .
In all , in Wada , 26 whales were brought ashore last summer .
They were brought to Mr Shoji's whale meat processing factory to be made into whale jerky , whale burgers , whale steaks - whatever the customer wants .
Commercial venture Mr Shoji is a huge man by Japanese standards , towering over his workers .
He is softly spoken , but determined to get his message across - happy to debate the rights and wrongs of whaling , but not to concede that the practice should be stopped .
He shows me around the plant .
We stop in front of two women who are slicing up huge hunks of deep red whale meat .
The blood runs down their plastic overalls and on to the floor .
This batch of meat will be flavoured with soy sauce and sake , then dried to make jerky .
Japanese delegate to the IWC Joji Morishita " Kyushu people like their whale meat fresh , " Mr Shoji tells me , referring to people who live in the south of Japan .
" Around here we like it with a little flavour , so when we bring the carcass ashore we leave if for a day before we cut it up for the freezer . "
The meat caught each summer is stored and then used when needed .
He pulls open a large metal door to show me .
Inside the freezer are boxes and boxes of whale .
Some of it is minke whale which has been cut into small regular blocks like match boxes .
This is whale caught in the oceans off Antarctica by Japan 's Institute of Cetacean Research .
Mr Shoji buys the meat from them .
The proceeds of the sales are used to help fund the Japanese research programme .
" We use it for sashimi , " he says .
I put it to him that around the world there is opposition to Japan 's annual whale cull in Antarctica , and to the activities of fishermen like him who catch whales off Japan 's coast .
" I do not see the difference between fishing and whaling , " he tells me .
" We have been eating whale for 400 years so what is the difference between catching a whale and catching a fish ? "
Endangered species
He says he accepts the argument that some species need to be protected to prevent them from dying out .
Blue whales , for example , should not be hunted .
Despite the pressure from overseas , Japan 's government should not back down
Yoshinori Shoji
But he believes minke whales are abundant , and does not see why others should be able to tell him what he can and cannot hunt off the coast of Japan .
But he believes minke whales are abundant , and does not see why others should be able to tell him what he can and cannot hunt off the coast of Japan .
As for the environmental activists who try to disrupt Japan 's whale hunts , " they are just trying to gain publicity to attract donations " , he argues .
But as we talk it becomes clear that for Mr Shoji , this is not a matter of tradition or of economics .
He explains that the problem with using tradition alone to defend whaling is that it is not a good enough reason to continue when species are at risk .
He gestures around the small room in which the two women are slicing up the hunks of meat .
The economic argument is not that strong either .
But when whaling can be done in a sustainable manner who has the right to tell him not to ?
" It 's a matter of justice , " he says .
" Despite the pressure from overseas , Japan 's government should not back down . "
Part of the culture Later he takes me to a school in town where he has been invited to take part in a lesson about whaling .
There is not much public debate about the issue in Japan , but here the children are engaged in detailed discussions about the way whaling hunts are carried out .
" I know some people think it is brutal to kill whales , " one of the pupils tells me , " That is why they are against it .
But I was born here so I think we should continue because it is our tradition . "
As the lesson continues , it is clear the children are aware that around the world there is considerable opposition to whaling .
There is no attempt by Mr Shoji or their teacher to hide that from them , or to persuade them to accept that what he does is right .
Eating whale meat is part of Wada 's culture and heritage
But although the classroom is decorated with pictures of whales and drawings of their favourite species , much the same as you would find in other countries , the children seem to accept the view that whales are food .
But although the classroom is decorated with pictures of whales and drawings of their favourite species , much the same as you would find in other countries , the children seem to accept the view that whales are food .
Indeed Mr Shoji admits to some frustration that Japan 's government does not do more to try to get that across to opponents of whaling in other countries .
It was a point that I put to a fisheries official when I returned to Tokyo .
He shrugged .
" Organisations like Greenpeace spend millions on their campaigns , " he told me .
" How could we compete and justify that to taxpayers as a sensible way to spend their money ? "
Japan 's insistence on its right to hunt whales is harming its image abroad , in particular in countries where the opposition is strongest like Australia .
But in a place like Wada , you see why it would be hard for the government to back down .
Here they see this not as a conservation issue but as an issue of sovereignty almost .
And any attempt to stop them whaling would provoke an angry response .

前述の実験では，英語とロシア語の語彙の違いを使って，言語が知覚に与える影響を調べた。これはこれで面白い結果が得られているのだけれど，できれば語彙の違いには頼らないかたちで，この関係性を確かめたい。実験に影響を与えうる要素は，できるだけ少なく絞られていた方がいいからね。
そこで研究者が利用したのは，左視野と右視野を使い分けるという方法だった。
人の目から入力された情報は，左の視野は脳の右半球へ，右の視野は脳の左半球へと伝達される。これを optic chiasm （視神経交叉）と呼ぶ 。 「 右目・左目」ではなくて「右視野・左視野」であることに注意しよう。
一般に右利きの人の脳は，左側が優位半球となる。人の言語機能は優位半球に集中していると考えられているから，もし言語と知覚の関係性が存在するならば，その影響は左半球への入力――つまり右視野からの入力を行った場合に，現れやすくなるに違いない。
研究者たちは右利きの被験者を集めて実験を行った。円状に並べられた四角形の中から，ひとつだけ違う色の四角形を探すという作業で，同じ名前の色を並べた場合と，違う名前の色を並べた場合とで比較を行う。
さらに今回は特殊な条件が用意された。一部の試行では，「円状に並べられた四角形」が表示される前に，「色に関する単語」あるいは「グリッドパターン」が表示される。被験者はその内容を試行後まで覚えているよう指示される。
実験の結果は予想通りだった。右視野で作業を行った場合のみ，「違う名前の色」での応答速度の向上が見られた（下グラフｂ）。そしてその効果は，「色に関する単語」を覚えるよう指示された場合に消滅し，逆転した（下グラフｃ）。また，「グリッドパターン」を覚えるよう指示された場合は，特に変化が現れなかった（下グラフｄ）。
さらに研究者たちは，色以外でも同様の現象が起こるかどうかを確かめている。手法は上の実験とほとんど同じなのだけれど，色ではなく「犬のシルエット」と「猫のシルエット」が用いられる。
この実験でも，やはり同じような結果が得られた。違う名前のシルエットが並べられた場合に応答速度の向上が見られ，それは右視野の場合に強く現れた。そして，単語を覚えるよう指示された場合に，その効果は消滅した。
どう？ これで， 「 英語とロシア語では言語系の違いが云々……」とか，「 文化の違いが云々……」とか，「人種の違いが云々……」とか，そういう仮説とは関係のない要素を排除したうえで，予想された関係性を確認することができた。どうやら言語は知覚に影響を与えるらしい。それがどんな言語であったとしても，恐らく同じように，ね。

Bold economic predictions are dangerous , and I ’ve been wrong before , but here goes : Oil prices are about to tumble .
There are several important reasons to believe that crude oil prices of roughly $ 130 / barrel are simply not sustainable .
The first is that world - wide economic growth , and hence the demand for crude oil , has slowed markedly due to the credit crunch and the bursting real estate bubble .
The second reason is that the Federal Reserve has finally decided to stop lowering interest rates and / or creating credit as if it were the Tooth Fairy ; a stronger dollar will mean lower oil prices .
Third , the already record high crude oil and gasoline prices have created strong incentives for consumer and business conservation and that has lowered overall demand .
Yet the most fundamental reason to expect prices to fall is that the gap between the price of crude oil and the cost of producing it is just way , way too large to be sustained long - run .
According to the Energy Information Administration , the average cost ( in constant dollars ) of finding , lifting , and storing onshore domestic and / or foreign oil between 1980 and 2004 has been approximately $ 20 per barrel ; between 2004 and 2006 that average cost rose to approximately $ 25 per barrel and is slightly higher now .
( The cost of producing offshore oil is more than double onshore costs ) .
Yet the price of crude oil has risen to approximately $ 130 per barrel ( doubling in the last year alone ) creating large profits for most producers and integrated oil companies .
Marginal suppliers around the world with costs above $ 30 per barrel but still far below current prices now have overwhelming incentives to uncap wells , engage in secondary and tertiary techniques to recover more oil from existing wells , drill additional wells , and otherwise expand production .
( Houston is currently booming with oil production investment as is Brazil ) .
Any serious output expansion will take time but the increasing supply coupled with lower demand will lead inexorably to lower prices ; indeed , sharply lower prices .
To be sure , speculators have helped bid up the price of crude oil .
Most of the speculation centers around legitimate concerns about “ supply disruptions ” and some wider war in the Middle East Gulf region .
My guess is that roughly 20 % of the current price is a supply disruption premium while another 10 % is associated with our own debasement of the currency ( the dollar ) by our own central bank .
( This can be proven by comparing oil prices in dollars with oil prices in Euros ) .
When ( if ) these speculations prove unwarranted , oil prices will decline sharply into ( my guess ) the $ 80 per barrel range .
But if we get a new war , all bets are off .
Public policy can encourage this bursting bubble scenario .
The Democrats want to tax the oil companies or use the antitrust laws against them .
Big mistake .
More taxes get you LESS oil and “ concentration ” in the oil industry is not really the problem .
The on - going Congressional hearings “ investigating ” oil prices and profits is a charade and is purely political theater .
The very same federal and state governments that complain about high oil prices continue to tax gasoline at a rate ( 40 cents per gallon ) far higher than the profit rate for the oil companies .
So much for government concern about consumers .
On the other hand , public policy can and must change to allow energy companies to explore for and develop domestic and offshore supplies of crude oil .
Obstacles to expanding and building new oil refineries domestically must be removed , and quickly .
Alternative energy sources , if they are cheaper , must be allowed to proceed ( including and especially nuclear ) but direct subsidies to ALL energy companies ( including to oil companies , if any ) should end .
We need the contributions of wind , solar , etc. , but only if and when their real costs and prices are comparable with oil and natural gas .
Competitive energy suppliers will work to produce in our interest if we free up the markets and let them .

Jenny : I just saw a new book by Katherine Addison ( Goblin Emperor ! ) is coming out in June and it sounds intriguing but entirely different from the world of her previous novel .
I know many of us were hoping for more in that world and maybe that will still happen someday .
Copied from publisher blurb :
" Katherine Addison , author of The Goblin Emperor , returns with a fantasy novel of alternate 1880s London , where killers stalk the night and the ultimate power is naming .
This is not the story you think it is .
These are not the characters you think they are .
This is not the book you are expecting .
In an alternate 1880s London , angels inhabit every public building , and vampires and werewolves walk the streets with human beings under a well - regulated truce .
A fantastic utopia , except for a few things : Angels can Fall , and that Fall is like a nuclear bomb in both the physical and metaphysical worlds .
And human beings remain human , with all their kindness and greed and passions and murderous intent .
Jack the Ripper stalks the streets of this London too .
But this London has an Angel .
The Angel of the Crows . "

[ '@ Play ' is a monthly column by John Harris which discusses the history , present and future of the Roguelike dungeon exploring genre .
This time out - a look at initial entries Harris has compiled from an in - progress Roguelike encyclopedia . ]
For a while now I 've been working on a general encyclopedia of roguelikes , covering many games , general concepts , some specifics of the big games , and general items of interest .
It 's still very much a work in progress .
What follows , presented for general interest , entertainment , and maybe just a little education , is some excerpts from this document .
( Included entries may not match their final form . )
AMULET ( of Life Saving )
This particularly useful amulet instantly revives the player character when he is killed .
The item is destroyed in the process .
In Nethack , this also remedies whatever condition it was that caused the death .
If run out of hit points it completely heals ; if starved to death it fills the stomach , it reverses stoning , and so on .
( There at least two exceptions to this : self - genocide and brainlessness . )
In the process , and in one of the many homages to classic Dungeons & Dragons the game offers , it drains one point of Constitution , although this is much less of a problem in Nethack since that statistic fluctuates with exercise .
It still adds one to the player 's “ death count , ” and in fact is the only way to do this without ending the game or being in either discovery or wizard mode .
In ADOM , Amulets of Life Saving only protect against running out of hit points .
KANSAS CITY , Missouri ( Reuters ) - Widespread contamination of U.S. corn , soybeans and other crops by genetically engineered varieties is threatening the purity of organic and natural food products and driving purveyors of such specialty products to new efforts to protect their markets , industry leaders said this week .
A range of players , from dairy farmers to natural food retailers , are behind an effort to introduce testing requirements and standards for certification aimed at keeping contamination at bay .
That goal is rapidly becoming harder , however , as planting of biotech corn , soybeans , and other crops expands across the United States .
“ Now there is a real shortage of organic grain for animal husbandry and dairy operations , ” said Organic Consumers Association national director Ronnie Cummins .
“ People are having to be real careful . ”
Proponents of the plan are rolling it out this week at an industry meeting in Anaheim , California , seeking to get the entire organic and natural foods industry to agree on testing and standard certifications .
Companies that get certified will be allowed to use a seal designating as much on their products .
“ We think we can keep the contamination from getting worse by putting safeguards in place so people who want to choose to eat organic products free of genetic contamination can do so , ” said Michael Funk , CEO of United Natural Foods , which is backing the initiative .
“ The longer we delay ... the more challenging it is going to be . ”
Biotech crops , primarily corn , soybeans , cotton and canola , have genes that have been manipulated to express specific traits , most commonly a resistance to herbicide , which helps farmers .
Biotech developers such as Monsanto
Co patent the crop technology and tightly control use of the seed .
But mixing of biotech crops and conventional crops can occur during many phases of harvest , storage and shipment of grain , and drifting pollen and other natural forces can also contaminate crops while they are still in the fields .
Indeed , contamination of conventional crops by biotech crops has been reported around the world .
There were 39 cases of crop contamination in 23 countries in 2007 , and more than 200 in 57 countries over the last 10 years , according to biotech critic Greenpeace International .
Contamination of corn is the biggest concern for those trying to sell biotech - free food .
Corn is not only used in human food but is also used to feed livestock , meaning organic beef and dairy farmers must ensure their animals are fed corn that is free of contamination .
That has become more difficult as biotech corn acres have expanded in the United States .
In 2007 , an estimated 73 percent of the 92.9 million acres of U.S. corn planted were biotech , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
The USDA has a set of national standards for foods labeled “ organic ” as part of its marketing service , but the industry players seeking independent testing said the USDA has not gone far enough to require organic and natural foods are free from biotech contamination .
Organic dairy farmer Albert Straus , who started testing corn fed to his 300 - head dairy herd more than a year ago , and found about one - third had been contaminated , now tests every lot of grain he buys .
“ I started to test our products to see if there was an issue or not .
It turned out there was an issue , ” said Straus .
He is now adding a label to his dairy products to alert consumers to the extra level of caution .
“ There is so much contamination , ” he said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Programs teaching U.S. schoolchildren to abstain from sex have not cut teen pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases or delayed the age at which sex begins , health groups told Congress on Wednesday .
The Bush administration , however , voiced continuing support for such programs during a hearing before a House of Representatives panel even as many Democrats called for cutting off federal money for so - called abstinence - only instruction .
“ Vast sums of federal monies continue to be directed toward these programs .
And , in fact , there is evidence to suggest that some of these programs are even harmful and have negative consequences by not providing adequate information for those teens who do become sexually active , ” Dr. Margaret Blythe of the American Academy of Pediatrics told the committee .
These programs , backed by many social conservatives who oppose the teaching of contraception methods to teenagers in schools , have received about $ 1.3 billion in federal funds since the late 1990s .
Currently , 17 of the 50 U.S. states refuse to accept federal funds for such programs .
Experts from the American Public Health Association and U.S. Institute of Medicine testified that scientific studies have not found that abstinence - only teaching works to cut pregnancies , sexually transmitted diseases or the age when sexual activity begins .
The American Psychological Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also issued statements to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform criticizing the abstinence - only programs .
Comprehensive sex education programs should emphasize abstinence as the best way for a teenager to avoid pregnancy or a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) , Blythe said .
“ Those adolescents who choose to abstain from sexual intercourse should obviously be encouraged and supported in their decisions by their families , peers and communities .
But abstinence should not be the only strategy that is discussed , ” Blythe said .
HIGH STD RATES
Lawmakers cited government statistics showing that one in four U.S. teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease and 30 percent of U.S. girls become pregnant before the age of 20 .
Republicans said even if some abstinence - only programs do not work , others do , and it would be wrong to end the funding .
Rep. John Duncan , a Tennessee Republican , said that it seems “ rather elitist ” that people with academic degrees in health think they know better than parents what type of sex education is appropriate .
“ I do n’t think it ’s something we should abandon , ” he said of abstinence - only funding .
Charles Keckler of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the Bush administration believes abstinence education programs send the healthiest message .
Stan Weed , director of the Institute for Research and Evaluation , a Utah - based group that researches abstinence programs , disagreed with the other health experts , saying research cast doubt on the effectiveness of broader , comprehensive sex education programs .
Panel chairman Rep. Henry Waxman , a California Democrat , said , “ We are showering funds on abstinence - only programs that do n’t appear to work , while ignoring proven comprehensive sex education programs that can delay sex , protect teens from disease , and result in fewer teen pregnancies . ”
“ Meanwhile , we have no dedicated source of federal funding specifically for comprehensive classroom sex education , ” Waxman added .
Are you on the hunt for a solid business phone system ?
Are you tired of being tethered to a landline with cables , or having to use your own personal cell service for work - related calls ?
If so , then it ’s high time that your business looked into a VoIP phone service provider .
If you yet dow n’t know the answer to the question of how do VoIP phones work , you ’re in the right place .
In this article , we ’ll take a look at the inner workings of VoIP technology and how your business could benefit .
How Do VoIP Phones Work ?
First , it ’s important to understand what VoIP stands for : voice over Internet protocol .
So in a nutshell , think of a VoIP phone service as a phone service that happens over the Internet .
Instead of physical phone lines being used to transmit your voice over the phone as they are with regular cell service , the Internet is instead used as the exchange medium .
The way this works actually is n’t too complicated , conceptually .
When you speak into the microphone , the VoIP service provider is able to process the sound waves received into a particular digital signal .
The coding of this digital signal is transferred over the Internet to the other party on the line .
Finally , the digital signal is then transferred back to its sound wave format , and your recipient is able to hear your voice on the other end of the call .
Should You Use VoIP in Your Business ?
So why should you use VoIP in your business ?
What are the main advantages of using the Internet to complete a call instead of using a traditional phone service ?
For one , using the Internet can turn out to be far less expensive than a traditional phone service if you are making lots of phone calls .
Because you already have some kind of Internet infrastructure in your office , adding VoIP capabilities to that is not a significant task .
In addition , using an Internet - based dialer allows your employees to continue to make calls even when a cell tower goes down or when they ’re in an area with poor cellular reception .
As long as they have wifi , they ’ll be totally capable of completing high - quality phone calls .
Lastly , bringing on a VoIP service provider means that your employees can now initiate and take calls over the computer .
This can be far more convenient than having to answer and initiate calls on a separate mobile device .
For instance , a customer service rep could answer a call on their computer and type up any notes from the call while they are talking to the customer .
In addition , because VoIP service providers typically comply with strict phone and conversation recording laws , you can easily find a HIPAA compliant VoIP phone provider if you need one .
Everything You Need to Know about VoIP
There you have it .
Now that you know all about how do VoIP phones work and what the benefits of a VoIP connection are , all that remains is for you to figure out whether VoIP phones will fit into your business ’s plan .

Bruce Lee : Productivity Dragon grant balfour | May 9 2008
The aptly named " Positivity Blog " recently had a rather compelling overview of Bruce Lee , Productivity Guru .
Like our own dear Merlin , Mr. Lee was from the Bay Area and took a lifelong interest in the fundamental rules underlying systems ; unlike Mr. Mann , Bruce Lee could break Chuck Norris in half but never once listened to Zen Arcade .
What 's more impressive , though , is how much of the Little Dragon 's martial arts philosophy can be applied to pretty much everything .
I 'm especially fond of # 4 on Positivity 's list ( “ Take no thought of who is right or wrong or who is better than .
Be not for or against . ” ) , but probably need to work most on # 2 :
“ It ’s not the daily increase but daily decrease .
Hack away at the unessential . ”
“ If you spend too much time thinking about a thing , you ’ll never get it done . ”
If you want to improve your life then it ’s tempting to want to add more .
... Removing clutter and activities , tasks and thoughts that are not so important frees up time and energy for you to do more of what you really want to do .
And as the clutter in your outer world decreases the clutter in your inner world also has a tendency to decrease ....
Adding more thoughts and thinking things over for the 111th time may create a sense of security .
It ’s also a good way to procrastinate and to avoid taking that leap you know you should take .
And the more you think , the harder it gets to act .
Quote : I 'm not going to argue with that .

Starting at a mere $ 400 , the Everex CloudBook marks the latest entry to the expanding world of UMPC - type subnotebooks at affordable prices .
With a 7 - inch display , 1.2 GHz processor , and 30 GB hard drive , the CloudBook certainly does n’t make a very good desktop replacement computer , but it does look like one impressive little road warrior .
( view large image )
Table of Contents
Preface
As both an editor for a laptop review web site and as an average consumer I am in love with the low - priced UMPC - type subnotebook market .
Laptops like the Everex CloudBook , the Asus Eee PC , and soon - to - be released subnotebooks from other manufacturers represent something truly innovative .
In short , these affordable ultraportables are virtually " disposable " travel laptops .
Granted , anyone would be upset if something happened to a $ 400 computer , but it ’s much more convenient to lose a $ 400 laptop than a laptop that costs $ 700 or more .
The other factor that makes these subnotebooks convenient is that they are much easier to carry for travel .
Sure , they lack the power to serve as a primary workhorse for video or photo editing , but these laptops are designed to serve as temporary travel computers .
With that being said , last year I purchased an Asus Eee PC 4G for personal use and business travel .
While I think the Eee PC is great , I ’m quick to realize its shortcomings and limitations .
When Everex announced the release of the CloudBook I was excited that this might be a perfect replacement for my Eee PC .
The CloudBook offers more storage ( 30 GB vs 4 GB ) and DVI out ( rather than simple VGA ) for better external monitor connections .
Before our CloudBook review unit arrived I was planning to replace my Asus Eee PC with the CloudBook .
Did this happen ?
Continue reading and you ’ll see .
Build and Design
The Everex CloudBook is an impressive little machine at first glance .
The innovative grip - through LCD hinge design and compact form factor come together with smooth matte black plastics and a hint of metal reinforcement in just the right places .
Weighing in at just two pounds the CloudBook was built around the VIA Nanobook reference design — a subnotebook prototype developed by VIA as a platform for its new mobile technologies .
( view large image )
Despite the impressive compactness of the design , the CloudBook is reasonably solid and durable thanks to the fact so much was packed into such a tiny space .
I do n’t recommend dropping the CloudBook , but it should survive the average use and abuse that any other $ 400 notebook can handle .
The CloudBook does not have a latch to hold it closed , and while the hinge mechanism generally works well at holding the lid in place , it is very easy to move the lid by slightly shaking the notebook .
While we ’re on the topic of the screen lid , the hinge was designed so that you can reach under the CloudBook and grasp the back of the notebook with one hand ( wrapping your fingers under the display ) and type with your free hand .
While this is a nice idea , it ’s hardly practical since the CloudBook uses a non-standard touchpad interface which requires two hands to use ( more on this later ) .
On the bright side , there is almost no flex to the screen or chassis .
Operating System ( Or Lack Thereof )
Everex decided to use the relatively new " gOS Rocket " operating system , which is a Linux variant using an attractive graphical user interface ( GUI ) to make it easy for Windows or Mac OS X users to understand .
The first thing most people think when they see the gOS desktop for the first time is that it ’s Mac OS X .
Typical gOS Desktop
( view large image )
Unfortunately , surface appearance is where the similarity ends .
While gOS is n’t a bad operating system , it ’s clear that Everex did nothing to customize this operating system installation for use on the CloudBook .
For starters , the first time you turn on the CloudBook you are prompted to select your time zone and other settings on a number of dialog windows .
Unfortunately , because the dialog windows are n’t designed to fit on the 800 x 480 resolution display on the CloudBook , you cannot read the entire text .
What ’s worse is that you cannot select the settings and click on the " OK " or " Next " buttons required to move forward with the setup process .
Of course , since gOS is a Linux - based operating system you can press and hold the " Alt " key while clicking on the dialog window to move the window so you can press the required buttons .
Let ’s pause for a moment and let reality sink in here .
The Everex CloudBook is a $ 400 laptop being sold at Wal - Mart .
How many average Wal - Mart shoppers do you think know the " hold down Alt " trick for moving windows in Linux ?
It ’s safe to say most consumers will be calling Everex customer support after 5 minutes to figure out how to start using the CloudBook .
To test this , I called Everex tech support using the toll - free number located on the bottom of the device .
I told them I just turned on my CloudBook and was stuck on the startup window and could n’t figure out what to do next ( a little lie for the sake of a review is n’t horrible ) .
Rather than tell me to hold down the Alt key and drag the window I was put on hold for 15 minutes .
When tech support finally returned they told me I could get a RMA ( return merchandise authorization ) to return my CloudBook for a replacement unit .
I guess when I called there was no one working at Everex technical support who knew about Linux .
If that ’s the case , maybe gOS was the wrong choice of operating system for the CloudBook .
Although Windows has many faults I suspect fewer consumers would need to contact tech support just to turn on their laptops for the first time .
Performance
The CloudBook has generally acceptable performance , as it ’s based on the 1.2 GHz VIA C7 - M ultra low voltage processor .
That said , our benchmarking suggests the performance on this processor is comparable to much slower 700 MHz Intel processors .
In fact , the wPrime processor benchmark indicates the 1.2 GHz VIA processor is slower than the 900 MHz Intel processor in the Asus Eee PC .
In a nutshell , Everex had to sacrifice some performance in order to bring this ultra-mobile laptop to consumers for only $ 400 .
Granted , the CloudBook only includes 512 MB of RAM , so we also tested the system with a 1 GB module of RAM from Crucial .
The problem with doing that is there is no easy - access RAM door on the bottom of the CloudBook .
You must completely disassemble the CloudBook in order to replace the RAM .
Another problem is that Everex uses non-standard sized screws to hold the chassis together … so most small screwdrivers are too large to remove the screws .
What ’s worse is that opening the chassis voids the manufacturer ’s warranty … making upgrades ill - advised for average consumers .
Adding 1 GB of DDR2 533 MHz SDRAM from Crucial did improve the PCMark05 score by almost 60 points ( 671 PCMarks after upgrade ) .
However , given the difficulty involved with the upgrade and the lack of warranty after the upgrade , I ca n’t say adding more RAM to the CloudBook is worth the trouble .
The VIA UniChrome Pro integrated graphics processor should provide adequate performance for some games with minimal system requirements .
That said , do n’t expect this notebook to play the latest graphics - intense games … we ’re not dealing with a dedicated graphics card here , and in some cases the UniChrome Pro is less powerful than Intel integrated graphics .
Screen
The 7 - inch WVGA ( 800 x 480 pixels ) matte screen on the CloudBook is n’t ideal for extended use and certainly is n’t designed for HD video , but it does offer sharp contrast , excellent color , and reasonably even backlighting .
Horizontal viewing angles were excellent , although vertical viewing angles were only average .
The screen itself did n’t suffer from ripples or stuck pixels , but I did notice some minor light leakage from the top edge of the display at maximum brightness .
One of the most impressive features about the screen on the CloudBook ( and the video drivers that VIA uses ) is that users can " scale " higher resolutions on the screen .
In other words , you can fit 1000 x 600 pixels worth of resolution on the 800 x 480 screen .
Scaling the display does cause some loss of fine details and text can be more difficult to read , but it ’s much nicer to view web sites at 1000 x 600 than it is using the default resolution .
Desktop at native 800 x 480 Resolution
( view large image ) Desktop scaled to 1000 x 600 resolution

Another interesting problem I encountered during my first day with the CloudBook involved connecting an external monitor to the built - in DVI port on the side of the notebook .
After connecting an external display and changing the settings in the default gOS operating system the CloudBook responded with an error message and refused to display anything on the external monitor .
After I disconnected the external monitor the built - in LCD could not be reset to the native 800 x 480 resolution and would only work in 640 x 480 mode … not acceptable for much of anything .
After several hours of work I was forced to format the hard drive and install Microsoft Windows in order to restore the display to the correct default resolution .
Again , that ’s just not something you expect from a brand new notebook .
After I installed Windows on the CloudBook and connected the external display to the DVI port I discovered that the CloudBook only supports one widescreen resolution ( 1000 x 600 ) so if you use a large widescreen external display you will not be able to set the correct resolution or aspect ratio on the CloudBook .
For comparison purposes , we tested the Asus Eee PC with the same widescreen external monitor and the Asus model supported all the correct resolutions and aspect ratios .
Keyboard and Touchpad
( view large image )
The keyboard on the CloudBook is cramped to say the least .
It will take most users several hours or more to get used to typing on such a small area .
The keyboard is virtually identical to the keyboard used on the Asus Eee PC , and is probably the same part provided by the same OEM .
However , unlike the keyboard on the Asus Eee PC , the keyboard on the CloudBook has significant flex that makes typing somewhat like pressing down on a plastic trampoline .
As mentioned previously , the touchpad interface on the CloudBook is quite unique compared to other notebooks currently on the market .
The actual touchpad is located above the keyboard on the right side of the notebook , and is a small area about the size of a U.S. postage stamp .
There is no dedicated area for scrolling ( thank goodness ) and the touchpad is so small that precise control is extremely difficult .
The left and right touchpad buttons are located above the keyboard on the left side of the notebook , and are likewise much smaller than typical touchpad buttons .
Both buttons have deep feedback and well - cushioned clicks , but they are so small that it ’s easy to press the wrong button or both buttons at the same time .
Left - Side Buttons

( view large image )
Gaming is perhaps the single most difficult thing to do with the touchpad interface on the CloudBook .
Most games require use of the touchpad , touchpad buttons , and multiple keyboard keys ( such as W , A , S , and D ) .
Trying to control a game while using the touchpad with your right hand and press the touchpad buttons with your left hand while pressing keyboard keys at the same time is next to impossible .
If the CloudBook used a standard touchpad interface you could control the touchpad and touchpad buttons with one hand … and I just ca n’t understand why VIA and Everex engineers did n’t do this .
( More on gaming later ) .
Bottom line , buy an external mouse if you ’re going to use the CloudBook .
Memory and Storage
The 30 GB hard drive in the CloudBook provides a reasonable amount of storage , but is n’t anywhere near the amount of storage that most consumers are likely to want in a modern laptop .
Sure , you ’ve got enough storage for travel needs , but if you download tons of music , movies , and TV shows from iTunes and store them on the CloudBook ’s hard drive then you ’ll quickly run out of space .
Additionally , the slow 3600 rpm speed of the 30 GB hard disk means the CloudBook wastes a large amount of time trying to access data .
Both the average data transfer speed ( read / write speed ) and the average data access time ( how long it takes the drive to locate data ) for the 30 GB hard drive were slower than either the internal 4 GB SSD inside the Asus Eee PC or a 16 GB SDHC card used as a second storage drive inside the Eee PC .
Of course , you can use a SDHC card inside the card reader on the Everex CloudBook , but unlike most notebooks the card reader on the CloudBook does n’t allow SDHC cards to set flush against the edge of the notebook .
Since SDHC cards stick out of the side of the CloudBook and can be accidentally removed with a simple bump it is n’t a good idea to use an SDHC card as a second storage drive in this device .
Input and Output Ports
Although the ultra-mobile form factor of the CloudBook cannot accommodate the standard array of ports you ’ll find on other notebooks , Everex did manage to include a reasonable number of ports .
The complete list of ports includes :
DVI out
Two USB 2.0 ports
Audio out
Microphone in
4 - in - 1 card reader
10/100 Ethernet
Although VIA and Everex engineers deserve serious credit for developing the CloudBook , it ’s safe to say that most consumers would have rather taken a third USB port or FireWire port instead of the DVI out … particularly since the VIA integrated graphics are n’t particularly powerful .

The CloudBook certainly is n’t designed to play the latest graphics - intense video games like BioShock or Crysis , but it does meet the minimum requirements for many older games .
During the review period I tested a number of older games like Freelancer and Freedom Fighters on this model .
The CloudBook was able to play these older games at acceptable frame rates , but level load times and cinematic cutscenes took much longer than they should have .
In some cases the CloudBook took 15 seconds or more to load a new level compared to less than 5 seconds on typical notebooks or the Asus Eee PC .
In addition , I decided to test a freeware gaming application called 3DAnalyze on the CloudBook .
This makes modern games playable on computers with modest integrated graphics by forcing the game to run without certain settings required for highly detailed 3D graphics .
I ’ve used 3DAnalyze on a number of laptops with integrated graphics ( including the Asus Eee PC ) to play games such as Halo and Shattered Union at 800 x 480 resolution .
While the Asus Eee PC is able to play Halo and Shattered Union with acceptable frame rates thanks to 3DAnalyze , the Everex CloudBook was not able to accomplish this … most likely due to an incompatibility with the integrated VIA graphics .
Audio
The built - in stereo speakers located beneath the display hinge are the very definition of bad notebook speakers .
Most budget laptops have terrible speakers that sound like someone speaking through a tin can , and indeed so does the CloudBook .
The difference here is that the speakers on this model sound like someone speaking through extremely tiny tin cans .
The good news is that the audio out port ( headphone minijack ) provides excellent audio output .
There ’s little or no distortion or static , and the sound on my earbuds was quite enjoyable .
Battery
The CloudBook uses a four - cell lithium - ion battery rated at 2200 mAh and 14.4 V. Everex claims five hours of battery life on the CloudBook , but my tests under gOS , Windows XP Pro , and Windows Vista Home Premium suggest the battery life is closer to three hours on average .
With the screen set to the lowest brightness setting and Wi-Fi off while typing Word documents and watching movie files I was able to get the CloudBook to last just more than three and a half hours .
Heat and Noise
Considering the small form factor of the CloudBook and the ultra low voltage VIA processor I expected the CloudBook to produce little in the way of heat and noise .
Unfortunately , after only a few minutes of use I discovered it generates both heat and noise in abundance .
The processor cooling fan is always running on the low , medium , or high setting when the CloudBook is plugged in .
I was able to tell the fan has three settings because I could easily hear the change in pitch as the fan throttled up and down .
Imagine the sound of a muffled hair dryer running inside your notebook and you ’ll have some idea what the CloudBook sounds like when it ’s plugged in .
On the bright side , the fan typically stays at the lowest setting or off while the CloudBook is running on battery .
The down side of this is that the VIA processor runs at a slower clock cycle most of the time while on battery power ( regardless of the Windows power management settings ) which means slower performance .
Despite the issue of fan noise , the most troublesome issue I encountered during the test period was heat .
While plugged in the bottom of the CloudBook reached temperatures of 126 degrees Fahrenheit ( too hot for direct skin contact over an extended period ) .
HDTune reported hard drive temperatures as hot as 56 degrees Celsius ( 133 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
During my benchmarking tests ( which stressed the system and generated more heat ) the Wi-Fi card inside the CloudBook would stop working after 30 - 45 minutes of use .
The only way to get the card to start working again was to turn off the CloudBook and let it cool down for at least 10 minutes before restarting the system and connecting to the Internet again .
When a notebook overheats to the point that it stops working every 30 - 45 minutes you know there ’s a serious problem .
Below are images with the external temperatures listed in degrees Fahrenheit .
Conclusion
At first glance the CloudBook is an impressive design with some innovative features and some reasonably impressive specs for the $ 400 price tag .
However , upon closer examination it ’s clear that VIA and Everex had to make a number of sacrifices to bring this ultra-mobile notebook to the market for such a low price .
The low - capacity , slow , hard drive , and slow overall performance make the CloudBook a less than compelling purchase compared to the current generation Asus Eee PC 4G … despite the other device ’s much smaller storage space .
The fact that the CloudBook cannot support the correct resolutions for widescreen external monitors is another problem for anyone who wants to connect this laptop to a larger screen .
The issue of excessive heat build up inside the CloudBook is perhaps the most obvious " deal killer . "
Who wants to own a laptop that you can only use for 30 - 45 minutes when connected to the Internet before you have to turn it off and let it cool down ?
I do have to say the high - resolution scaling on the tiny screen and 30 GB of storage space are very nice features , but these benefits pale in comparison to the other problems and limitations the CloudBook brings to the table .
In short , I have a hard time recommending the current generation of the Everex CloudBook for any consumer .
Given the strength of the Asus Eee PC and upcoming budget subnotebooks from other manufacturers , there simply is n’t a compelling reason to purchase the CloudBook .
Pros
Excellent high - resolution scaling on the tiny screen
Innovative design
Cons
Very low performance
Included gOS operating system is a joke ( a bad joke at that )
Horrible touchpad interface
No easy upgrades , opening chassis voids warranty
System gets too hot … overheats and stops working
Loud cooling fan that is constantly on when plugged in
Specifications
The Everex CloudBook ( starting at $ 400 ) is available in just one configuration at the time of this writing .
It has the following specifications :

BBC News , Jerusalem
Gheith Nasr 's parents were taken to the police station a day after his arrest Gheith Nasr , 18 , of the Burj Luqluq neighbourhood in East Jerusalem , has not had the ideal preparation for his high - school graduation exams in a few weeks time .
Since January , he says , he has been arrested four times by the Israeli security services , accused of stone - throwing and vandalising security cameras in the Old City .
He says he has been detained each time for a few days in one of Jerusalem 's interrogation centres , and then sent home under orders not to leave the house for another few days .
The muscular , but shy and inarticulate teenager says he regularly suffered violent treatment as interrogators tried to get him to own up to crimes he says he did n't commit - but one of his arrests stands out from the others .
" When I saw my mother being brought into the cell with handcuffs , I tell you , I would have told them anything just to save her , anything , " he said .
It happened a day after Gheith was taken off to Qishlik police station .
Plainclothes officers and troops returned to the house and searched through the family 's belongings .
I was only in the room for a few seconds ; we looked at each other but we were both too shocked to say anything
Um Gheith , mother of prisoner Already in possession of their ID cards , one of the officers told the parents they must now go down to the police station where they would see their son .
' Too shocked '
The parents were taken into separate rooms at Qishlik station .
Um Gheith - the mother - takes up the story .
" There were two men in the room .
I sat down and one stood behind me while the other started shouting in my face in a most aggressive and intimidating way .
" I was shocked , it was the first time I had even set foot in a police station and this man was saying horrible things about what they were going to do to Gheith .
" Then the one behind said : ' Cuff her hands for the night ' and they put handcuffs on me and then took me along to another room , where I was surprised to see Gheith sitting .
" I was only in the room for a few seconds ; we looked at each other but we were both too shocked to say anything .
Then they took me out and took off the handcuffs . "
After an hour Mrs Nasr was brought back into the cell for another short and wordless encounter .
Then she and her husband were given back their IDs and released .
In the meantime , Mr Nasr had also been taken in to see Gheith , minus handcuffs and an initial " softening up " , but with instructions from a secret service man to encourage the boy to confess .
" I did nothing of the kind , " the genial hospital goods supplier told me .
" I sat together with my son for about 10 minutes , asking him how he was and how they were treating him , and saying a few things to keep his morale up .
" Then the officer came back and Gheith was then taken away .
The officer asked whether my son was going to own up .
I said : ' He has done nothing ' and the officer replied : ' You are a liar ! '
Suicide attempts
In a statement , Israel 's domestic security agency , the GSS or Shin Bet , said it never detains suspects ' relatives or gives false information to detainees to obtain confessions .
" Terrorist investigations are conducted by the Shin Bet according to the [ 1999 ] Supreme Court ruling [ limiting interrogation methods ] , under the restrictions of the law and the tight supervision of the Justice Ministry and the courts , " the statement said .
Human rights group the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel ( PCATI ) says a pattern has emerged recently of the security forces using such tactics with Palestinian interrogees .
It has published detailed evidence of six sample cases from the last year by the GSS .
The parliamentary constitutional and legal committee has taken the unusual step of scheduling a hearing hours after publication .
Manipulating innocent family members is morally reprehensible whatever the danger
Eliahu Abram , PCATI
The cases are all far more serious than that of Gheith Nasr in security terms , involving terrorism charges , but the interrogation tactics appear exactly the same .
When Mahmoud Sweiti , accused of belonging to the Hamas military wing in Hebron , was shown his wife and father , who was dressed in a prison coat , he twice attempted suicide , the report says .
In another testimony , the mother and brother of another prisoner - Said Diab - say they were both detained and that he was forced to secretly watch them being violently interrogated , as he claimed to have been himself .
" Presenting close family members as suspects or under interrogation puts the real suspect under incredible psychological pressure , which can be as bad - if not worse - than physical torture , " says PCATI legal consultant Eliahu Abram .
" The General Security Service may think that between beating a prisoner and showing him his mother crying in detention , the latter is the more non-abusive way , but it is not , " he told the BBC .
Violent techniques Israel says it adheres to regulations concerning the treatment of detainees " The prisoner feels a sense of powerlessness and responsibility for what is happening to their loved - one - there is no telling whether information obtained in this way is reliable , " Mr Abram said .
He agrees the domestic intelligence service has to do all it can to investigate the terrorism threat which Israel faces from resourceful and determined foes .
" But that is no justification ; manipulating innocent family members is morally reprehensible whatever the danger . "
The use of violent interrogation techniques is prohibited under Israeli and international anti-torture laws , but Mr Abram says the Supreme Court has allowed the use of " trickery " to obtain information .
PCATI believes the domestic intelligence agency is breaking the rules on physical abuse and is acting in an atmosphere of impunity because it says the legal authorities do not investigate accusations made by human rights groups .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc ’s attempt to form an alliance with Google Inc to stave off Microsoft Corp could run into more trouble with antitrust regulators than Microsoft ’s unwelcome takeover bid .
Pedestrians walk past the Time Square Yahoo sign in New York April 7 , 2008 .

While Yahoo is seeking a business partnership with Google -- unlike the outright merger that Microsoft wants -- legal experts say any deal between the world ’s two largest Internet search services will draw heavy scrutiny from U.S. and European competition regulators .
“ The Justice Department would certainly want to take a serious look at that because it would mean that a firm that would want to take advertisements or to place advertisements ( online ) would have only one place to go , ” said Aaron Edlin , who teaches law and economics at the University of California at Berkeley .
In recent years , Web search services have taken over from once popular portals or home pages , such as AOL , MSN or Yahoo ’s own home page , as the primary starting point for many consumers seeking information on the Internet .
Google held a 59.2 percent share of the U.S.
Web search market in February , compared with Yahoo ’s 21.6 percent and Microsoft ’s 9.6 percent , according to research firm comScore .
To counter that dominance , Microsoft offered in January to buy Yahoo in a cash - and - stock deal now valued at $ 42 billion .
Yahoo rejects that price as too low and has been casting around for other partners .
It announced last week a test to outsource search advertising to Google , which sources say is part of Yahoo ’s plans to form a three - way alliance with Time Warner Inc ’s AOL to fend off Microsoft .
Antitrust experts said regulators would likely oppose any permanent alliance between Google and Yahoo , while they would likely approve Microsoft ’s proposed merger with Yahoo .
“ A Yahoo / Microsoft merger would primarily be designed to attack Google , ” said Thomas Hazlett , who teaches law and economics at George Mason University in Virginia .
“ What you ’re seeing here is the sort of merger that has ... a plausible efficiency case . ”
FRAGMENTED MARKET
While Google dominates search , Yahoo argues the market for online display ads -- the splashy banners or video ads that companies love -- is so fragmented that Yahoo is the biggest player with just 8 percent of the market .
But the proposed cooperation between Google and Yahoo has already prompted congressional concern .
The U.S. House of Representatives ’ Judiciary Committee announced it would take up the issues in upcoming hearings .
Sen .
Herb Kohl , a Wisconsin Democrat and chair of a Senate antitrust panel , said he was watching the Google test .
“ Should there be moves to make this agreement permanent , we will examine it closely in the antitrust subcommittee to ensure that it does not harm competition , ” Kohl said in a statement .
Kohl expressed concern about the rapid consolidation of formerly independent players in the Web advertising market .
A year ago , Google agreed to buy DoubleClick in a $ 3.4 billion deal that closed only last month .
Microsoft paid $ 6 billion for aQuantive , Yahoo bought BlueLithium for $ 300 million and Time Warner Inc ’s AOL unit bought Tacoda for an undisclosed amount .
Gregory Sidak , founder of the economic consulting firm Criterion Economics , said U.S. regulators are likely to view the tech market as so dynamic and fast - changing that they will abstain from blocking any particular deal or joint venture in what appears to be an ultra-competitive industry .
But European regulators are generally more likely to act to block mergers than their U.S. counterparts .
“ Europe poses a larger antitrust risk for any of the ( Yahoo ) deals , ” Sidak said .
In the absence of certainty , U.S. regulators tend to opt for less intervention rather than more .
The Justice Department , in particular , has a reputation for approving deals that antitrust experts consider suspect , most recently the merger of the only two U.S. satellite radio companies XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc .
“ I think any company contemplating a merger or acquisition would want to get it through during the Bush administration , ” said Sidak , expressing a commonly held view in the legal community that , even if Republican nominee John McCain wins the 2008 election , there will be stricter controls .
“ Even if McCain is elected , I think there ’s reason to believe they ’ll be some tightening of antitrust enforcement , ” he said .
Evan Stewart of law firm Spaeder Zuckerman LLP predicted that , when the dust settled on the various deal scenarios , Yahoo would lose its fight to stay independent , a view widely shared among Wall Street investors betting on the outcome .
There are “ very creative investment bankers providing Yahoo with all these very different end - games , ” he said .
“ If you ’re hooked , eventually you ’re going to be dragged into the boat . ”
It 's no secret that I think plugins are unnecessary .
Unfortunately , they are also popular , largely due to to how easy it is to create a plugin and put it in your Rails project .
It 's also easy to create a new gem .
In 2006 Dr. Nic released the newgem gem .
This was a great step in 2006 , but it 's 2008 now and it does n't feel like we 've moved much in the way of shared ruby code .
We 're all to blame .
The vast majority of Ruby work is working with Rails .
I do believe the next step for RubyGems is to play seamlessly with Rails .
Since RubyGems are great for any Ruby code , it does n't make sense to add Rails specifics to RubyGems .
However , RubyGems could be more opinionated about how gems are structured .
Right now , RubyGems library code can be structured in almost any way that you 'd like .
If the structure followed a stricter convention then auto gem loading code could be written for Rails .
I like newgem , but I think the features provided by newgem should actually be part of RubyGems itself .
If the gem command could create a project skeleton it could be opinionated about the file structure without creating a larger barrier to entry .
There is another change that needs to happen .
Everyone knows that you should vendor everything for your Rails projects .
But , there 's no single step to go from uninstalled gem to vendored gem .
The path is generally to install it locally and them unpack it in whatever folder you 've created that gets autoloaded .
I 'm pretty sure a remote unpack is fairly simple , which is why we are all to blame .
RubyGems is an open source project .
Anyone can contribute patches to make it better .
Lastly , if gems become the standard way to share Ruby / Rails code then we 'll need a few rake tasks added to Rails .
For example , who would n't want a rake command to upgrade to a later version of a gem .
I 'm hoping 2008 is the year that shared ruby code becomes synonymous with RubyGems and the year Rails Plugins become unnecessary .
“ The poorest quality crap the world has ever seen .
We ’re growing it today . ”
2007 .
Unrated .
Now out on DVD , also free streaming on Netflix .
Directed by Aaron Woolf .
Featuring Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis .
.
The United States has the cheapest and most secure food supply in the world , and a large reason for that is the industrialization of agriculture and technological developments in both farming equipment and in the actual crop ( genetic engineering , for example ) that has led to record - breaking crop yields across the board .
It takes far less time and labor from fewer people to produce enough food for the country , and freeing up people to specialize in other areas has been a major driving force behind the technological advances our country has made over the past 30 years .
King Corn traces this back to the policies of former Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz , who in 1974 stopped the practice of artificially lowering the supply by paying farmers not to grow crops , and instead implemented a program of subsidizing production .
Because of how easy it is to grow and ideal weather conditions in Middle America , corn became the crop of choice for many farmers looking to maximize production .
The framing device is a bit cheesy , as best friends Ian Cheney ( a Chase Utley look - alike ) and Curtis Ellis decide to move from New York to a small town in Iowa where their great - grandparents coincidentally both lived and raise an acre of corn .
A good entire harvest back at the turn of the century was 40 bushels , and now just on one acre , the two expect somewhere around 200 bushels .
What ’s even more remarkable is how little effort they put in , with only a couple of steps and a lot of waiting around .
While they wait , they explain how and why corn has become the dominant crop in the country and how the surplus of cheap crops have led to its ubiquity in our culture .
They visit experts in many different fields and try to answer whether the pendulum has swung too far towards production and away from quality .
In trying to follow where their acre of corn will eventually end up , they track the consequences and effects of corn ’s dominance in our food supply .
Director Aaron
Woolf does a great job , and there are some really beautiful shots and strong cinematography all - around .
The movie flows well and never loses interest .
Both leads are bland , but fairly likable and do a good job of distilling fairly complicated issues down to the basics .
The framing device is very gimmicky , but the issues they end up tackling are pretty interesting — from the effects of corn- fed beef , to how corn syrup has led to the diabetes explosion .
One major omission is the lack of ethanol discussion , but in their defense , it was n’t as big an issue in 2004 as it is now , or at least I do n’t remember it being one .
Nevertheless , it would have been a welcome addition .
Overall King Corn is worth seeing — it ’s light , entertaining fare and piqued my interest in a topic I did not know a lot about before viewing .
It ’s certainly not a definitive work on the subject but as a primer , it does the job .

I did something unexpected the other day : I watched a little of The O’Reilly Factor .
The host made two proclamations that might ’ve made me chuckle if they were n’t so frighteningly emblematic of America ’s intellectual vacancy .
According to O’Reilly , Arianna Huffington is a member of the “ far left ” and her website , Huffington Post , is home to “ hate speech . ”
Of course , the myth of a monolithic Left — one that includes everyone from Dan Rather to Derrick Jensen , from Barack Obama to Ward Churchill — is extremely useful to anyone seeking to stifle public debate .
However , it only requires an iota of objectivity to recognize that Arianna Huffington dwells in the realm of what might generously be characterized as the “ liberal Left ” ( or , more accurately , the “ soft Left ” ) .
Along with Sean Penn , Michael Moore , Al Franken , and others of her ilk , Arianna Huffington may not actually be a radical , but will gladly play one on TV .
But let ’s move now to the far more noteworthy O’Reilly claim : the Huffington Post is a hate site .
In a recent article , the popular Fox TV host focused on Huffington Post visitor comments like this one about an ailing Nancy Reagan : “ I feel no pity for the bitch who took delight in watching thousands die of a horrible disease and watching the poor having to eat out of dumpsters because of her husband ’s political beliefs . ”
Of course , one could justifiably take issue with the harsh tone , the use of the word “ bitch , ” and the assumption that Just - Say - No Nancy consciously “ took delight ” in others ’ misery .
I ’m certainly not endorsing the cowardly commentary of internet trolls , e.g. childish name - calling or the spineless reliance on sexism , racism , etc … but the primary point of the above comment seems germane to me .
Our society and our planet are in critical condition ( or worse ) thanks to willful decisions made by human beings occupying positions of power .
So , why are we being so damn polite when talking about these elites ?
Why do we show any mercy when discussing the villains who knowingly pollute , exploit , wage war , steal , and treat all living things as if they were expendable ?
Why are we so afraid to hate those most responsible for our current global nightmare ?
Well - paid entertainers like O’Reilly cow us into fearing the label of “ hater ” when , in reality , elected [ sic ] officials and the corporations that own them display sheer , unrestrained hatred in every move they make .
They hate freedom , they hate justice , and they hate solidarity .
They hate the environment , plants , animals , and even humans .
They hate everything … except fame , power , and profits .
Why the hell do we give any of them one shred of respect ?
They have n’t earned our deference ; they have n’t earned our patience ; they have n’t earned the benefit of anyone ’s doubt .
They have earned nothing except our utter contempt and loathing .
Pacifist types might cringe at my words and urge us all to eschew hatred .
Moderates will talk of the need to find common ground .
The candlelight vigil crowd tells us that we must love our enemies .
Personally , I ’d rather heed the words of Malcolm X : “ We are nonviolent with people who are nonviolent with us . ”
I feel no solidarity with the professional liars who make up the corporate media .
I feel no compassion for the career criminals that stock the corporate ranks .
I hold no love for the pinstriped mountebanks we call “ politicians . ”
If that sounds like “ hate speech ” to you , well … that ’s because it is .
New cases of HIV / Aids in China soared by 45 per cent last year compared with 2006 , the Health Ministry in Beijing has revealed .
The staggering rise was put down to changing social attitudes and an improvement in data collection .
The government had said late last year that 700,000 people were living with the virus , an increase from an earlier estimate of 650,000 .
The year before , China lowered its estimate to 650,000 from 840,000 , despite warnings from international experts that the disease was spreading due to ignorance and because many people were too afraid or too poor to seek help .
The ministry gave few details about the large percentage rise in sexually transmitted diseases or those passed through the blood .
There was also a sharp rise of 24 per cent in syphilis cases .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" It 's been hard over the years to discover the number of Aids patients because of the social stigma , " a ministry spokesman said .
The disease is spreading fast in a country where information about Aids has long been suppressed .
For many years , Chinese would say HIV / Aids was a disease that affected foreigners , and could be passed through shaking hands or sharing chopsticks .
The government has finally acknowledged that it faces a battle in resolving the rise in HIV / Aids infections .
The disease is now mainly sexually transmitted ; before , it had been mostly caused by intravenous drug use .
The United Nations has warned that China could have 10 million cases of HIV by 2010 unless it takes steps to educate the public and fight the epidemic .
A major advance in breaking down the stigma attached to HIV / Aids came in 2003 when Premier Wen Jiabao became China 's first senior leader to publicly shake hands with Aids patients , marking a significant change in government policy on the disease .
President Hu Jintao has also been photographed embracing Aids patients .
As well as the traditional routes of spreading HIV / Aids , such as prostitution and intravenous drug use , the disease in China has been spread by unsanitary , uncontrolled blood banks that travelled rural areas buying blood .
About 70,000 people had been infected by contaminated transfusions .
The Health Ministry survey also showed that even among better - educated city dwellers , nearly 60 per cent were " nervous " to have public contact with HIV - positive people .
Against this kind of background , changing attitudes is an uphill battle , and the Health Ministry has come up with imaginative ways to deal with the problem .
It has introduced a major TV campaign to promote condom use , with advertisements produced by the Oscar - winning Aids documentary maker , Ruby Yang .
This is a significant advance in a country where talking about sex remains taboo .
China 's 200 million migrant workers are among the high - risk groups .
Building workers can now attend lectures on the ways HIV / Aids is spread and the importance of condom use .
" I came to know that Aids was not a disease exclusively belonging to sexually active Westerners , " Chen Wei , 28 , told the People 's Daily after a session in the training school on a building site in Changsha in Hunan province .
In 2006 , the government issued new rules .
Now no organisation or individual is allowed to discriminate against Aids patients or their families , and Aids patients will be entitled to free treatment .
The Health Ministry data also showed scarlet fever and measles cases rose in 2007 , though other diseases declined .
There was just one death from plague last year , and none from cholera .
Archivists at the Clinton Library blocking access " of hundreds of pages of White House papers on pardons that the former president approved , including clemency for fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich . "
The risk with this kind of thing is that , basically , Democratic partisans do n't want to hear about it and do n't care .
We know perfectly well that the right - wing dragged all this stuff up as part of a crazy and pernicious scandal net and only talks about it to use their nefarious agenda .
Thus maybe it wo n't hurt Clinton much in a primary .
But in a general election ?
In a country where her husband never secured a majority ?
It 'll be damaging .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The number of Americans being secretly wiretapped or having their financial and other records reviewed by the government has continued to increase as officials aggressively use powers approved after the Sept. 11 attacks .
But the number of terrorism prosecutions ending up in court -- one measure of the effectiveness of such sleuthing -- has continued to decline , in some cases precipitously .
The trends , visible in new government data and a private analysis of Justice Department records , are worrisome to civil liberties groups and some legal scholars .
They say it is further evidence that the government has compromised the privacy rights of ordinary citizens without much to show for it .
The emphasis on spy programs also is starting to give pause to some members of Congress who fear the government is investing too much in anti-terrorism programs at the expense of traditional crime - fighting .
Other lawmakers are raising questions about how well the FBI is performing its counter - terrorism mission .
The Senate Intelligence Committee last week concluded that the bureau was far behind in making internal changes to keep the nation safe from terrorist threats .
Lawmakers urged that the FBI set specific benchmarks to measure its progress and make more regular reports to Congress .

These concerns come as the Bush administration has been seeking to expand its ability to gather intelligence without prior court approval .
It has asked Congress for amendments to the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act to make it clear that eavesdropping on foreign telecommunications signals routed through the U.S. does not require a warrant .
Law enforcement officials say the additional surveillance powers have been critically important in ways the public does not always see .
Threats can be mitigated , they say , by deporting suspicious people or letting them know that authorities are watching them .
“ The fact that the prosecutions are down does n’t mean that the utility of these investigations is down .
It suggests that these investigations may be leading to other forms of prevention and protection , ” said Thomas Newcomb , a former Bush White House national security aide .
He said there were half a dozen actions outside of the criminal courts that the government could take to snuff out potential threats , including using diplomatic or military channels .
Although legal experts say they would not necessarily expect the number of prosecutions to rise along with the stepped - up surveillance , there are few other good ways to measure how well the government is progressing in keeping the country safe .

“ How does one measure the success ?
The short answer is we are n’t in a great position to know , ” said Daniel Richman , a former federal prosecutor .
With prosecutions declining , he said , the public is left with imperfect and possibly misleading ways to gauge progress in the Bush administration ’s war on terrorism -- such as the number of secret warrants the government issues or the number of agents it assigns to terrorism cases .
“ These are the only tracks in the snow left by terrorism investigations , if there are no more counter - terrorism prosecutions , ” Richman said .
“ This is why , more than ever , there is a pressing need for congressional oversight , for accountability at the top of the [ Justice ] department , and for public confidence in the department . ”

Changing numbers

A recent study showed that the number of terrorism and national security cases initiated by the Justice Department in 2007 was more than 50 % below 2002 levels .
The nonprofit Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University , which obtained the data under the Freedom of Information Act , found that the number of cases brought declined 19 % in the last year alone , dropping to 505 in 2007 from 624 in 2006 .
By contrast , the Justice Department reported last month that the nation ’s spy court had granted 2,370 warrant requests by the department to search or eavesdrop on suspected terrorists and spies in the U.S. last year -- 9 % more than in 2006 .
The number of such warrants approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has more than doubled since the 2001 terrorist attacks .
The department also reported a sharp rise in the use of national security letters by the FBI -- from 9,254 in 2005 to 12,583 in 2006 , the latest data available .
The letters seek customer information from banks , Internet providers and phone companies .
They have caused a stir because consumers do not have a right to know that their information is being disclosed and the letters are issued without court oversight .
The inspector general of the Justice Department has found numerous cases in which FBI agents failed to comply with rules and guidelines in issuing the letters , often gaining access to information they were not entitled to .
The FBI has responded by taking a number of measures to tighten its internal procedures .

Civil liberties groups say the new data reveal a disturbing consequence of the government ’s post - Sept. 11 expanded surveillance capabilities .
“ The number of Americans being investigated dwarfs any legitimate number of actual terrorism prosecutions , and that is extremely troubling -- for both the security and privacy of innocent Americans as well as for the squandering of resources on people who have not and never will be charged with any wrongdoing , ” said Lisa Graves , deputy director of the Center for National Security Studies , a Washington - based civil liberties group .

A mixed record

But Dean Boyd , a Justice Department spokesman , said statistics on court - approved FISA applications and statistics on criminal prosecution were “ apples and oranges . ”
“ There are a variety of factors that may account for the increase in court - approved FISA applications since 9/11 , ” he said .
Boyd said he could not comment on those factors , but said , “ It is important to remember that surveillance under FISA is authorized by an independent court and used carefully and judiciously to protect the country from national security threats . ”
Certainly , the government has pursued a number of high - profile terrorism cases of late .
A U.S. sailor was convicted in March of providing support to terrorists by passing classified information regarding movements of a Navy battle group to operators of an Internet site suspected of terrorist leanings .
The record in court has been somewhat mixed , however .
Federal prosecutors in Miami twice have failed to secure verdicts in the cases of six men accused of plotting to destroy Chicago ’s Sears Tower and several FBI offices .
After two mistrials , the “ Liberty City Seven ” case is due in court in January .

Even some former government officials concede many intelligence investigations fail to yield evidence of a serious threat to the U.S.
“ Most of these threats ultimately turn out to be wrong , or maybe just the investigating makes them go away , ” said Washington lawyer Michael Woods , former head of the FBI national security law unit .
“ A lot more information is going to pass through government hands , and most of that is going to be about people who turn out to be innocent or irrelevant . ”

The bouquet curves towards me in a hideous slow - motion arc .
I back away from the throng of scrambling womanhood , but , nightmarishly , the more I endeavour to elude this marital missile the closer it looms , until it hits me square on the head , sliding down my body to rest at my feet .
Appalled , I shudder backwards , arms planted at my sides .
A stunned silence prevails as the entire wedding party regards me with clinical fascination .
Finally the chief bridesmaid tuts , bends forward , scoops up and dusts down the bouquet , before brandishing it half - heartedly in the air .
Platitude has it that it is every little girl 's dream to be metamorphosed into a billowing white cloud .
I was no exception , only mine was a recurrent , Angela Carter - esque nightmare : my dress a shroud , the groom a vampire , my train snaked around my throat removing first speech then vital signs .
In adult life the dreams prove still more tormenting .
My refusal to marry has been the cause of painful separations ( I now no longer sleep with advocates of the institution , although nothing propels a chap to seek to knot - tie more than a partner disinclined ) .
My refusenik stance is the cause of baffled offence from friends , followed by aggressively emotional attempts at conversion .
It is a constant provocation to colleagues , with the result that I find myself editing wedding sections ( the ignominy ! ) , or being dispatched to road - test designer wedding dresses ( my body rebelled , generating my first freak period in 25 years , an occurrence that did not sit happily amid £ 12,000 of tulle ) .
When my sister announced her engagement I was appalled that someone I thought I knew could do something so alien , psychologically dubious , banal .
While she , quite rightly , felt that a simple ' Congratulations ' would have sufficed .
Gamophobia - fear of marriage - is a little - used term to mark a still less acknowledged concept .
I hold my hands up to it , not waving but drowning under the rampant gamomania of society at large , where £ 20,000 is the average nuptial spend and nothing blinds like the glare of a white frock .
I am wedding - phobic , but no less averse to the institution itself .
According to my own peculiarly fundamentalist secular beliefs marriage is lazy , anachronistic , morally bankrupt .
Moreover , in the same way that if there were a God , He is not one I 'd wish to have any truck with , so if marriage were the only thing holding a union of mine together , then I 'd rather let it pass .
( Hence the bumper - sticker axiom that abstainers ' get to choose their partner every day ' . )
There are many things that my objection does not entail : fear of commitment ( nope ) ; a reflection on my parents ' relationship ( they are still together ) ; a judgment as to whether or not I want children ( neither here nor there ) ; and that great patronising lie that I am yet to meet ' the right man ' .
Nor am I some joyless ideologue - I 'm rather in favour of a good knees up , and have no objection whatsoever to being presented with jewellery .
Forced to unpack my antipathy , I would cite four po-faced motives : atheism ; feminism ; a loathing of state and / or public intervention in matters I deem private ; and something more oddball regarding the close - down of narrative possibility .
One reason would be enough to quash any Doris Day ambition ; the four together topple into each other like spinsterish dominos .
My stance may be at the more neurotic , proposing - as - a - dumping - offence extreme , but I am by no means alone in my disinclination towards getting hitched .
Rates of marriage in Britain - 283,730 in 2005 - are at their lowest since 1896 .
Given the ebb and flow of population , this is the most paltry scoring since records began almost 150 years ago .
Divorce statistics may have fallen ( there being fewer candidates ) , yet , still , 40 per cent of first marriages and 70 per cent of second shots end in divorce .
The attitudes reflected in these statistics suggest that love and marriage do indeed go together like a horse and carriage in the sense that both are quaint anachronisms .
According to this year 's British Social Attitudes ( BSA ) Survey , published in January , two - thirds of people see little difference between marriage and cohabitation ( a mere one - fifth taking issue ) .
Even regarding children , where more traditional views tend to apply , only one in four people believes that married couples make better parents .
Meanwhile , over half declare weddings to be more about celebration than lifelong commitment , with two - thirds endorsing the truism that divorce can be ' a positive step towards a new life ' .
As Professor Simon Duncan , co-author of the marriage chapter , decreed : ' The heterosexual married couple is no longer central as a social norm . '
Indeed , the heterosexual married couple shows every sign of taking its role model from Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ?
In a survey released in the wake of the annual post - Christmas divorce rush , over half of 2,000 adults confessed to being unhappy in their marriage .
A staggering two - thirds of wives revealed that they would divorce immediately were their economic security assured .
A plaintive half of husbands considered their marriages loveless , while 30 per cent of those questioned were lingering in doomed marriages ' to avoid upheaval ' .
Experts recommend caution in regarding the British public as increasingly wedlock - averse .
According to Penny Mansfield , director of the relationship research organisation One Plus One , ' There is very little indication that people are opposed to marriage ; simply evidence that people are not getting married .
In the main , people do n't see any difference between the institution and long - term cohabitation .
Those in relationships who are not married simply see themselves as being just like people who are .
People do n't really think about it .'
The effect is a massive backing away from what , even in the reputedly swinging Sixties and Seventies , was a fundamental rite of passage for the vast majority .
Whether its abstainers are actively resistant or merely nonchalant , what we are seeing is , if not the end of marriage , then quite possibly the beginning of the end .
So who are these conjugal avoiders ?
For some , refusal to marry is a God thing .
Ryan Thompson , 28 , a journalist for Men's Health , is adamant : ' I do n't believe in marriage because I do n't believe in God . '
Like me , as a teenager , Thompson taunted his married parents for their ideological weakness ; his views have also been the cause of relationship meltdown .
' If I were not so fundamentally against it , I 'd probably have a nice legal bill now , less hair , and would never have met my current partner .
Marriage has long been a publicly acknowledged contract of convenience .
My life with my partner is a private seal of my commitment to her .
We do n't need our status authenticated by institutions outside our own personal one . '
The feminist thing is no less compelling .
Hailing from multicultural Birmingham , I did not attend a traditional Christian wedding until my mid-twenties .
Words cannot express my head - spinning , Carrie - style horror at the revelation that my friend , a lawyer , was being walked down the aisle by one man to be handed over to another , a ( rather less distinguished ) lawyer whom she promised to obey , the whole thing rounded off by a series of male speeches while she remained silent in her faux virgin's white .
Ten years on , another friend , the breadwinner in her relationship , was instructed by the officiating cleric to submit to her husband in all matters , to thunderous masculine applause .
Of course , a good many feminists put a less Stepford stamp on their ceremonies , and go on to draw great strength from their marriages , considering themselves to have reinvented its limits .
Personally , I find this as impossible a notion as the idea that one could somehow reinvent slavery .
Marriage is the sum of its history ; a history that encompasses subordination , drudgery , property theft , and , well within my lifetime , the legal impossibility of rape .
In this context , not only would I be mortified to participate in such a structure myself , I would be ashamed to bring up children in such a shoddy and despicable arrangement .
Elizabeth Enright , 30 , an Edinburgh psychologist , concurs : ' I certainly have feminist issues around the history of marriage as a tradition of buying and selling women .
I can't believe other women are so unselfconscious about it , and surprised that I have a desire to be neither princess nor chattel . '
Younger women are no less open to these qualms .
Susie Corbett , a 21 - year - old customer services employee from Sheffield , rejects the term feminist - ' as I think it connotes a scary , angry woman ' - but her suspicion of marriage reveals no little feminist content .
' It 's a dated concept .
I do n't believe that a wife should stay at home while the husband goes out to work .
The roles of men and women have become more equal . '
Nadia Idle , 27 , an anti-poverty campaigner from London , prefers to consider herself as ' radical independent left - wing ' rather than feminist .
' My position on marriage stems from my political beliefs and my lack of religious affiliation .
I do n't need or want the approval of the state or any religious authority to enter into a relationship .
I do n't need an artificial contract to make me feel secure .
Anthropologically , marriage fulfilled an important social function in organising society which I just do n't think emancipated individuals need to adhere to . '
Underlying many such statements is a disapproval of state or even community investment in what is a private relationship .
For many refuseniks , the very thing that draws others to marry - a declaration before family and friends - proves repellent .
( I recall having to explain to a former partner that a party with speeches and fancy outfits in the orangery at Blenheim Palace would not really cut it as far as non-marriage went . )
The very notion still causes Caitlyn Jones , a 35 - year - old charity worker from Bristol , discomfort .
' When I was about eight , one of the things I feared most about adulthood was marriage .
I would lie in bed and worry about having to walk down an aisle and kiss a man in front of loads of people while wearing some hideous dress .
The embarrassment factor was a huge turn - off , but the name - change even more so .
I really could n't get my head around the idea that a woman had to take a man 's surname .
As I got older it turned out that my suspicions were not unfounded .
I 've never been proposed to and I hope I never will .'
A few of us also wrestle with what might be categorised as marriage 's shutdown of narrative possibility - not the possibility of further erotic adventure per se , but the possibility of adventure at large .
Marriage is the end not the beginning of most women 's stories ; there will not be much to say after ' Reader , I married him . '
As an adolescent , I was powerfully moved by the opening of DH Lawrence 's Women in Love , with its heroines ' assertion of their modernity by renouncing connubial ambition .
The writer and broadcaster Nadine Baggott , 45 , expresses similar feelings : ' I have never wanted to get married , not for one second .
I think it 's because I watched too many Bette Davis and Joan Crawford films and identified with those wisecracking , fast - talking dames .
If it were a case of choosing between being Doris Day and Joan Crawford , I would always choose to be the mistress , never the wife .
The bride 's story ended with marriage , because after the wedding there was never anything interesting worth filming .
And so today , in essence , after years of living with my partner , I am a " wife " and we are " married " , ' she says , ' but I stick to the fact that I am still the girlfriend and we live together because for me being married means being boring and predictable and conforming to what is expected . '
For many , hostility to the state of wedlock will be the price of already having conformed .
Richard Quick , 35 , a London publisher , married at 26 and separated at 29 , when his second child was two , the age he was when his own parents parted .
' I thought my parents ' experience meant I was well - armed for marriage , ' Quick says .
' In fact , I was just well - prepared for divorce . '
Would he remarry ?
' No , I just do n't see any need .
It 's an outmoded institution .
Children would be better served by broader , more open family units .
In our modern consumer society we pick what we want from any situation , but marriage is still one - size - fits - all .
We need to unbundle those vows , to cherry - pick the bits we want .
That way there 'd be a lot less disappointment . '
Quick leaves potential partners in no doubt regarding his position .
' I 've found it actually helps narrow the field .
There was a time when saying that marriage was off the cards was as bad as saying you did n't want kids , but that 's changed once women have got past their Barbie doll stage . '
Indeed , Dr Jane Lewis , Professor of Social Policy at the London School of Economics , argues that these days marriage involves no small degree of risk for women .
' At the beginning of the 20th century marriage offered protection of a sort .
If the marriage worked , it was probably the best way of coping economically .
Today , the costs of marriage in terms of childbearing are front - loaded for women .
What if one marries , gives up work while the children are young , sacrificing pension contributions , earnings , promotion prospects - and then the husband leaves ?
Marriage has become a risk , ' says Lewis .
' The more economic independence one has , the more one can protect against that risk . '
Professor Lewis agrees with Penny Mansfield that Britons are not necessarily turning away from wedlock so much as deferring it .
' It 's just that people no longer operate according to the old rules ordering sex , children and marriage , ' Lewis says .
Relate changed its name from the National Marriage Guidance Council 20 years ago to reflect this shifting demographic .
Jenny North , Relate 's head of public policy , has also observed a sea change whereby couples have come to regard marriage as the pinnacle not the premise of their relationship .
' In the past , marriage was something one did en route to adulthood .
These days it often comes after one 's got the house and the car , when the job is going well , when you 've had the baby , as the sign to those around you that you 've made it .
People aspire to and idealise marriage , only wanting to do it when all the pieces have fallen into place and everything 's perfect - and because of this , marriage has become identified with the wedding . '
Perfection being the impossible dream it is , this results in couples indefinitely postponing their weddings .
Lucy Wigmore , 32 , lives in the Midlands and has two children .
' I strongly want my children to have married parents , but we just have n't got round to it .
We 're too busy to plan something and can't afford a big party right now .
Plus I 'd like to get my figure back .
So we 're looking at the end of 2009 , later perhaps . '
There 's no business like nuptial show business .
As Penny Mansfield remarks : ' In Alan Bennett 's Untold Stories , he recalls his parents getting married at 8 am because they wanted to avoid the spotlight .
But in our celebrity culture , everyone wants to show off . '
This exhibitionism is one of the many aspects of knot - tying that repulses 36 - year - old Southampton researcher Tom Richards .
' The spectacle involved in modern marriage is in inverse proportion to its meaning .
The more devoid of content the institution becomes , the more a grotesquely postmodern , style - over - substance principle applies .
The entire event becomes a swaggering parody of some bygone society wedding .'
John Amery , who is in his early forties , lays the blame for such orgiastic consumption squarely with the bride .
' I gaze with horror at the way women hold out their hands screeching with excitement about the engagement while everyone gawks at the rock and judges the absent man by the size of the ring , and thus his salary and , by extension , his penis .
The three months ' salary thing , women selling themselves as chattels ... it 's all so base . '
Other men express shock at the lemming - like frenzy that may take hold of a social group .
Guy Amis , a 29 - year - old IT worker from east London , recalls : ' At university I felt confident that my friends would pursue all manner of romantic arrangements .
Within three years I had been to seven weddings .
It seemed overly hasty and shockingly middle - of - the - road .
Ours was meant to be the generation that chose .
But here we were , just finishing our degrees , and suddenly somehow married .
I would have marriage overhauled , shed the pretence .
To have and to hold ?
Cool .
In sickness and in health ?
Lovely .
Till death us do part ?
Forget about it .'
Women may be no less realistic , but their attitude is often also tempered by a sense of the potential sacrifice of self .
Julia Wright , 42 , is a commissioning editor living in Brighton : ' Marriage is an act of faith , and one that belongs to the young .
I am not so young any more .
I 've lost the faith .
It means something to stand up and declare your union .
And for me , now , that 's exactly why I doubt I could do it .
I know love is fallible , that it fades , that some relationships have a shelf life .
I trust my judgment enough to say no to someone ; I do n't trust it enough to say yes .
' Besides , at this age , ' Wright says , ' marriage would seem inappropriate , silly , self - indulgent .
My sense of identity is stronger than ever , and marriage would dilute my sense of self : the view from my window , the books on my shelves , the people I 'd see .
I guess it comes back to Virginia Woolf 's idea of a room of one 's own .
My own space , to be me , to engage in the things that make life important . '
Her partner wants ' the marriage , the house , the kids , the shared life ' , a circumstance Wright fears will prove the relationship 's end .
' I do n't disapprove of marriage ; I like displays of bravado and daring .
Unfortunately , I fear the fallout , the unhappy ending , the sense of being trapped . '
When I read Wright 's words I forget for a moment that marriage is anathema to me , and see it in its place : a small , spent thing , still panting for the attention of the conformist and the reckless .
And , yet , at the thought of its infringing upon my own existence , the suffocating white pall descends .
Perhaps , as God has been imagined to prefer the engagement of the atheist to the believer 's unthinking compliance , so marriage will retain its power only among its abstainers .
Growing impatience in Congress over the enormous costs being racked up by the Iraq war , as well as the Pentagon ’s belief that it needs more troops in Afghanistan to fight insurgents there , is putting the vaunted success of the George W. Bush administration ’s " surge " strategy to the test .
Although the House of Representatives appears poised to approve an additional $ 163 billion Thursday for military operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan through the end of the year , most observers believe that Congress will impose unprecedented conditions on Iraq - related spending .
This could include requirements that the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki pay substantially more in reconstruction and related costs than it has to date .
The argument that Baghdad must bear more of the burden gained momentum last week when the Pentagon ’s special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction reported that Iraq ’s oil revenue in 2008 should exceed $ 70 billion , twice as much as had been forecast just a few months before .
That report , which comes amid growing concern over the weak domestic economy , has fueled efforts by a bipartisan group of senators to halt virtually all U.S. funding for major reconstruction and infrastructure projects in Iraq .
Indeed , the Senate Armed Services Committee voted unanimously last week to approve a bill that would ban the Pentagon from funding any reconstruction or infrastructure project in Iraq that costs more than $ 2 million .
Similar legislation is expected to be taken up by the House .
" This is the first significant bipartisan change in our policy toward Iraq , " declared Republican Sen.
Susan Collins , one of the sponsors of the legislation after last week ’s vote , while the committee chairman , Sen .
Carl Levin said Iraq ’s failure to pay reconstruction costs was " unconscionable [ and ] inexcusable " given the windfall it has received from the stunning rise in world oil prices .
Another provision of the same bill would require Iraq ’s government to pay the salaries and training costs of the predominantly Sunni militias , or so - called sahwa or " Awakening " councils , on which the U.S. has been spending roughly $ 27 million a month .
Despite U.S. pressure , the Maliki government has strongly resisted integrating the vast majority of the estimated 90,000 members of these militias  most of which were previously part of the Sunni insurgency  into the army or police for fear that they will eventually turn their guns on the regime .
The result has been growing frustration on the part of the militias , frustration that reportedly was significantly enhanced last month after Maliki enlisted thousands of members of the Badr Organization into the government ’s security forces during fighting with Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army in Basra and Sadr City in Baghdad .
The Badr Organization is the armed wing of the Shia Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) , the strongest party in the coalition .
Both the intra-Shia conflict between the Sadrists and the government and the growing anger of the sahwa militias  most recently dramatized by a series of strikes and public protests and by an increasing number of attacks on U.S. and Iraqi forces in Anbar province and other Sunni strongholds where the militias have kept the peace for most of the past year  have resulted in a sharp rise in both Iraqi and U.S. casualties over the past two months , threatening the security gains made by the surge .
The surge , which was initiated in February 2007 , was aimed at pacifying both Anbar province and the capital by adding some 30,000 U.S. troops to the 140,000 already deployed to Iraq to stop and reverse the drift to sectarian civil war between Sunnis and the various Shia militias .
Its strategic aim was to foster a climate of peace and stability that would encourage all factions to make the political compromises necessary for national reconciliation .
While the surge made substantial headway in achieving its tactical goals of improving security  with the critical help of the sahwa militias , which had mostly broken with al - Qaeda in Iraq and allied themselves with the U.S. even before the surge got underway  its strategic goal of political reconciliation has been far more elusive .
Moreover , the surge ’s tactical success has failed to translate into additional popular or congressional support for the war at home .
As a result , the Bush administration , which promised months ago to withdraw the 30,000 surge troops by the end of July , is adhering to its pledge , leaving fewer troops to ensure that a new round of violence does not break out .
At the same time , the Pentagon leadership is pressing the White House to continue the drawdown from Iraq beyond July so that it can deploy the three brigades  between 10,000 and 12,000 troops  it says it needs to cope with the Taliban and their allies in Afghanistan .
While Bush has announced that there will be at least a 45 - day pause to assess the impact of the surge withdrawal after July , the pressure on him to resume the process  not only from the Pentagon , but from Republican candidates in the November elections  is expected to be intense .
Republican backing for the Armed Services Committee bill banning additional spending on major reconstruction projects and support for the sahwa militias is clearly seen by both the administration and the promoters of the surge as a worrisome portent , and not only for maintaining the relative  albeit fragile  peace that has prevailed for much of the past year .
One of the surge ’s architects , Frederick Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , said that legislation would " do catastrophic damage to our image in the world , particularly the Muslim world .
The argument that Iraq should use its oil revenues to pay the United States sounds like the ultimate proof that we invaded Iraq for mercenary reasons . "
Ending U.S. funding for the sahwa militias , in particular , will pose a critical  and long overdue  test of the surge strategy , according to a number of observers , who see Maliki ’s failure to integrate them as a critical stumbling block to national reconciliation .
" If the Awakenings are not integrated into the national security forces , then there is little hope for political accommodation or for lasting security and the U.S. is effectively trapped , " according to Marc Lynch , an expert at George Washington University whose blog , AbuAardvark.com , is widely read .
" Since all other forms of persuasion seem to have failed , it ’s time to give Maliki an ultimatum .
If he gives in , then there may finally be some hope for political accommodation . "
" The downside is that if Maliki does n’t go along then things may well get ugly .
But all signs suggests that they will get ugly anyway  and better that they get ugly while the U.S. is at the highest troop levels it will ever have , " Lynch wrote .
" If Maliki wo n’t do this now , when U.S. troop levels are high and security is relatively better , with the shadow of a new president who likely will not continue to offer an open - ended commitment , then he never will and everyone should know this . "

I ’ve written before about the mixing of Yeti expeditions and spy missions by Nazis , Tom Slick , Edmund Hillary , and as hidden in other links .
If by land , such covert cover missions also happen in the water , as well .
The Times of London revealed over the weekend that Bob Ballard has come forth to tell that he was really on a secret mission to find two American nuclear submarines when he told the media he was searching for the Titanic .
“ Dr. Ballard , an oceanographer , has admitted that he located and inspected the wrecks for the US Navy in top secret missions before he was allowed to search for the Titanic .
Only once he had used his new underwater robot craft to map the submarine wreck sites was he able to use it to crisscross the North Atlantic seabed to pinpoint the last resting place of the luxury liner .
It meant he had only 12 days to find the Titanic , ” reported The Times .
I could n’t tell anybody .
There was a lot of pressure on me .
It was a secret mission .
I felt it was a fair exchange for getting a chance to look for the Titanic .
We handed the data to the experts .
They never told us what they concluded – our job was to collect the data .
I can only talk about it now because it has been declassified .
Bob Ballard
This instantly reminded me of what occurred in Lake Pend Oreille as mentioned in an article researched over a dozen years ago by science writer Patrick Huyghe .
As North Idaho College Prof. James R. McLeod told Huyghe ( “ Deep Secrets , ” The Anomalist 5 , 1997 ) , the Navy used reports of a Lake Monster , locally called Paddler , in Lake Pend Oreille for decades , as a cover story .
In 1984 , McLeod and his college - based cryptozoological research group conducted a much - publicized investigation , “ Crypto Quest 84 , ” concluding that a majority of the sightings could have been of a huge , prehistoric - looking sturgeon — not native to the lake but possibly an occasional visitor .
( McLeod kindly donated the expedition ’s flag to the International Cryptozoology Museum , several years ago . )
McLeod would learn , “ Every once in a while we would get someone who also saw a submarine , and the word nuclear kept coming up .
That started bothering me . ”
It bothered McLeod because no nuclear subs are ever supposed to be in an American lake .
Idaho anthropologist Duke Snyder said , “ I ’m inclined to think that a lot of events that occurred on the lake are really the result of Navy activity of one kind or another … .
If somebody begins a story about a monster in the lake , then that ’s a pretty handy explanation for strange things that go on .
Of course , that raises the question [ of ] what the heck is the Navy doing in the lake . ”
For years , the Navy denied it has ever used manned submarines or minisubs in the lake , but in the 1960s two Navy contractors , Vickers and the International Submarine Engineering ( ISE ) groups of Canada , did use a minisub , Pisces I , to train personnel in torpedo - recovery in some American lakes .
The very deep Lake Pend Oreille appears to have been one of them .
McLeod was able to confirm that the Pisces I was at Pend Oreille in 1965 .
Finally , the truth came out .
In Spring 2001 , the US Navy , in an article authored by one of their own personnel in Vol. 3 , No. 3 of Undersea Warfare ( “ The Official Magazine of the U.S. Submarine Force ” ) , made it clear that submarine models were being used in the lake .
See the Navy ’s article , now online at : “ Small Subs Provide Big Payoffs For Submarine Stealth . ”
For more information on the reports of the cryptid Paddler , see the book I coauthored with Patrick Huyghe , The Field Guide to Lake Monsters , Sea Serpents , and Other Mystery Denizens of the Deep ( NY : Tarcher / Penguin , 2003 ) .
About Loren Coleman
Loren Coleman is one of the world ’s leading cryptozoologists , some say “ the ” leading living cryptozoologist .
Certainly , he is acknowledged as the current living American researcher and writer who has most popularized cryptozoology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries .
Starting his fieldwork and investigations in 1960 , after traveling and trekking extensively in pursuit of cryptozoological mysteries , Coleman began writing to share his experiences in 1969 .
An honorary member of Ivan T. Sanderson ’s Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained in the 1970s , Coleman has been bestowed with similar honorary memberships of the North Idaho College Cryptozoology Club in 1983 , and in subsequent years , that of the British Columbia Scientific Cryptozoology Club , CryptoSafari International , and other international organizations .
He was also a Life Member and Benefactor of the International Society of Cryptozoology ( now - defunct ) .
Loren Coleman ’s daily blog , as a member of the Cryptomundo Team , served as an ongoing avenue of communication for the ever - growing body of cryptozoo news from 2005 through 2013 .
He returned as an infrequent contributor beginning Halloween week of 2015 .
Coleman is the founder in 2003 , and current director of the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland , Maine .

Naturalism ' ad absurdum ' .
Richard Dawkins is not pleased with God :
The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all of fiction .
Jealous and proud of it ; a petty , unjust unforgiving control - freak ; a vindictive , bloodthirsty ethnic - cleanser ; a misogynistic homophobic racist , infanticidal , genocidal , filicidal , pestilential , megalomaniacal … .
Well , no need to finish the quotation ; you get the idea .
Dawkins seems to have chosen
God as his sworn enemy .
( Let 's hope for Dawkins ' sake God does n't return the compliment . )
The God Delusion is an extended diatribe against religion in general and belief in God in particular ; Dawkins and Daniel Dennett ( whose recent Breaking the Spell is his contribution to this genre ) are the touchdown twins of current academic atheism .
1
Dawkins has written his book , he says , partly to encourage timorous atheists to come out of the closet .
He and Dennett both appear to think it requires considerable courage to attack religion these days ; says Dennett , " I risk a fist to the face or worse .
Yet I persist . "
Apparently atheism has its own heroes of the faith — at any rate its own self - styled heroes .
Here it 's not easy to take them seriously ; religion - bashing in the current Western academy is about as dangerous as endorsing the party 's candidate at a Republican rally .
Dawkins is perhaps the world 's most popular science writer ; he is also an extremely gifted science writer .
( For example , his account of bats and their ways in his earlier book The Blind Watchmaker is a brilliant and fascinating tour de force . )
The God Delusion , however , contains little science ; it is mainly philosophy and theology ( perhaps " atheology " would be a better term ) and evolutionary psychology , along with a substantial dash of social commentary decrying religion and its allegedly baneful effects .
As the above quotation suggests , one should n't look to this book for evenhanded and thoughtful commentary .
In fact the proportion of insult , ridicule , mockery , spleen , and vitriol ...
You really , really , really , really need to listen to this interview , and get other people to listen to it , also .
It is almost 40 minutes long , but worth every info - packed , thought - provoking second .
The [ stock ] market went up last week because there is the belief that Bear Stearns is the end .
But there are some of us who are very worried that Bear Stearns is the beginning and not the end , and if we needed $ 30 billion to bail out Bear Stearns . . . .
And Greenberger warns that we are at the beginning of the financial crises , not the end .
Michael Greenberger , former Director of Trading and Markets at the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) , was interviewed by NPR's Terry Gross this past Thursday , April 3 .
He explained that the sub - prime mortgage crisis was caused by financial derivatives , and that there are more crises coming , because there are many more financial derivatives out there .
He notes that the one act of deregulation most to blame - even more to blame than the 1999 repeal of the Glass - Steagal Act ( the law passed in the First Great Depression to separate commercial banking from investment banking ) - is the Commodities Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 , introduced on the sly by then Senator Phil Gramm ( R - TX ) , who is now the top economic advisor to John McCain :

Act of 2000 , introduced on the sly by then Senator Phil Gramm ( R - TX ) , who is now the top economic advisor to John McCain :
it was a 262 page bill , and it was added as a rider to an 11,000 page omnibus appropriation bill as Congress was recessing for Christmas in 2000 .
I would say there was no one except the drafters of the bill who understood what the legislation did , and I can assure you that the drafters of the bill were not members of Congress .
They were the lawyers for the investment bankers on Wall Street .
Greenberger notes that there is now more money invested in these unregulated financial derivatives than in stocks and bonds .
( In my opinion , this is the root of everything that ails the U.S. economy , from the growing gap between rich and poor , to the bane of " free trade " , to the lack of investment in public infrastructure and a new , green economy . )
He explains that the financial system today is focused not on actual investment in the economy , but on booking bets , just like a Las vegas bookie .
He and interviewer Terry Gross use a sports team analogy : with stocks and bonds , you are actually putting money into the team .
But with derivatives , instead of investing in the team , you 're just betting on whether the team is going to win or lose .
Moreover , Phil Gramm's Commodities Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 prohibited the federal and state governments from regulating financial derivatives , so nobody really knows how big the problem is .
That 's why
We do n't know if Bear Stearns is the mine disaster , or the canary in the mine warning us of a much bigger disaster .
Greenberger warns that the securitization Wall Street applied to sub - prime mortgages to allow these bets to be placed was also applied to all other types of debt .
" We are soon going to find out that it 's not just mortgages , but it 's all kind of loans : credit card loans , auto loans , student loans , are all going " to become problems in the very near future .
Greenberger has a beautiful implicit condemnation of the role Bush has failed to play :
It all goes back to these credit default swaps .
The American people do n't understand that .
If Franklin Delano Roosevelt were President right now , we would understand that : there would be a fireside chat ; we would make it so that the American public understand it .
And it 's important that the American public understand it , because even as we speak , the Wall Street interests , who have all the money in the world to hire lobbyists , the lobbyists are lobbying 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 365 days a year ... to keep this market , a shadow market , that nobody understands .
Greenberger notes that Treasury Secretary Paulson 's plan , unveiled last week , is actually the result of a review of U.S. financial regulation that began in months before the financial crises erupted , in response to Wall Street crying that it was being too heavily regulated and as a result was losing business to London .
Greenberger then judos the whole competition argument by noting that the less regulated British financial system is in even worse trouble than the U.S. system , with the British government having been forced to buy Northern Rock , which suffered a classic Depression - era bank run .
The Paulson proposals are modeled on the British , lighter , regulation .
The ironic development we see with the present financial crises , is that the less regulation you have , the more state ownership you end up with .
So , Greenberger says ,
I do n't think there is any effective proposal on the table .
First of all , Phil Gramm 's surprise legislation that prevented regulation of derivatives is far more important than the repeal of Glass - Steagal .
. . . [ We ] need to eliminate the ability of banks and all other lenders not to worry that the loan they are making will be paid back or not .
Derivatives have removed financial discipline from the market .
( This is the same point made by Ian Walsh on The Agonist a few weeks ago , Why Financial Crises Will Keep Happening . )
Greenberger explains why the Paulson plan is actually less regulation , not more : because it gives all the responsibility for oversight to the Fed , but does not give the Fed the power to prevent problems from developing .
It only gives the Fed power to deal with problems as they occur .
And it takes regulatory powers away from the states , which is why the state attorneys general and state insurance commissioners were very upset and came out in opposition very quickly .
At the end of the interview , Greenberger asks what I think is the fundamental question about the whole financial system .
It is the question that defines the fault line along which the progressive movement is likely to fracture in the next few years .
Should we have an economy that 's based on whether people make good or bad bets ?
Or should we have an economy where people build companies , create manufacturing , do inventions , advance the American society , make it more productive ?
This economy is based on people sitting at their computers and making bets all day long .
They call it credit default swaps , OTC derivatives , asset backed securities , etc. etc , - makes it all very complicated , but we are rewarding people for sitting at their computers and punching in bets .
That 's not the way our economy is going to be built , and India and China , with their focus on science and industry and building real businesses , are going to eat our lunch , unless the American public wakes up and puts an end to an economy that praises and makes heroes out of speculators .
Again , here is the link to the interview with former CFTC Director of Trading and Markets , Michael Greenberger .
Greenberger is now a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law and the director of the University 's Center for Health and Homeland Security .

Human Rights First Military Commission Trial Observation Blog
Frank Kendall – Human Rights
First volunteer consultant – is in Cuba to monitor the proceedings and is reporting back on events as they unfold .
He is providing updates of what he observes .
GuantÃ¡namo Bay , April 10 , 2008 : I lost a business colleague on one of the airplanes that was flown into the World Trade Center .
During my government career , I worked extensively with the Defense Intelligence Agency , which bore the brunt of losses experienced in the attack on the Pentagon .
I have no problem with the concept of bringing al Qaeda to justice .
But I believe that justice must be obtained in a manner consistent with America ’s long - standing position of leadership on human rights and with the core values embedded in our Constitution , our legal system , and our international obligations .
We also should not forget that the prisoners at GuantÃ¡namo have not been found guilty of anything yet .
As one well known American politician put it , “ this is n’t about who they are ; it ’s about who we are . ”
Today ’s proceedings did nothing to alleviate my concerns about the trials conducted under the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) .
The substantive legal issues that today ’s events highlighted include : the impossibility of providing adequate legal representation , the court ’s inability to enforce a defendant ’s rights , and the lack of adequate record to support an appeal .
I also feel compelled to note the appearance of illegitimacy , which I believe would plague any results that come out of this system as it is being implemented .
Today ’s defendant : Ibrahim al Qosi
Mr. al Qosi is a Sudanese national , aged 47 , although he looks older .
He entered the courtroom wearing the white jump suit of a “ compliant ”  detainee and a knitted white skull cap .
He is full bearded with a mix of black and grey .
As he came in under close physical escort by three MPs , he scanned the faces of the press and observers sitting directly behind the defense table .
Mr. Qosi seemed alert and curious about his surroundings .
He was cooperative throughout the hearing .
He insisted on reading a prepared statement and ultimately said he would boycott the proceedings .
He never once communicated with his detailed military attorney , Navy Commander Lachelier .
Mr. al Qosi is charged with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism .
The charge sheet alleges that he was in Afghanistan with al Qaeda from about 1996 through 2001 .
He is referred to as a bodyguard and driver for Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda members and as having provided other services .
( A number of prisoners are designated as bodyguards or drivers for bin Laden .
It is not clear whether this implies a close relationship or merely that the men provided security at the al Qaeda compound and elsewhere ) .
Al Qosi is alleged to have fought as a member of a mortar crew near Kabul between 1998 and 2001 .
In the fall of 2001 , he is said to have left Kandahar with other security people and accompanied bin Laden until he arrived in Tora Bora .
He is not charged with any specific acts of terrorism .
The government is seeking life in prison for Mr. Qosi .
Summary of the proceedings
At today ’s arraignment , Mr. al Qosi became the third defendant to refuse to participate in the proceedings , which he considers illegitimate .
As was the case yesterday , there were major issues with the translation from Arabic to English , including the inability to hear the translator and numerous inaccuracies .
( At each break in the hearing , an Arabic speaking NGO representative and an Arabic speaking member of the press discussed the many inaccuracies in the translation ) .
Eventually the judge questioned Mr. al Qosi to determine whether he understood his rights and wanted legal representation .
Like Mr. al Darbi , Mr. al Qosi refused to recognize the legitimacy of the court , rejected the representation offered him , and refused to participate in the proceedings .
He was escorted from the courtroom , after which the court reconvened to deal with scheduling and procedural matters .
During the course of the proceedings , Mr. al Qosi ’s detailed military defense counsel attempted to raise a number of issues without success .
Mr. al Qosi ’s Statement : “ I reject this unjust and illegal court ” ¦ ” 
Mr. al Qosi had brought a written statement with him , which he repeatedly asked permission to read at the same time as the judge was trying to question him about his rights under the MCA .
Eventually the judge had her questions answered for the record , and Mr. al Qosi was permitted to read his statement .
Apparently , Mr. al Qosi had been preparing the statement for a long time .
It was delivered calmly and eloquently .
Here is a summary :
Mr. al Qosi said he regarded the proceedings as illegitimate and unjust .
He stated that , just as the September 11 attacks had been reported as a military and political success by al Jazeera , exposing America ’s weaknesses , so too was the military commissions system an exposure of United States hypocrisy about the rule of law .
He went on to state that it was a lie that the United States was a protector of human rights .
Mr. al Qosi compared his treatment to the British and Australian citizens who had received short sentences or simply been sent home as evidence of discriminatory treatment .
He accused the United States of discriminating in particular against men from “ what the United States calls third world countries . ” 
Mr. al Qosi also accused the United States of having failed in its first attempt to try him when the Supreme Court overturned the first set of military commission rules ( leading to the MCA and the current set of military commission rules ) .
Mr. Qosi asserted that the new military commissions were just an attempt to create rules of evidence and crimes after the fact so that he and others could be tried .
Mr. al Qosi closed with a story from Moses and the Pharaoh in which the Pharaoh had threatened to cut off the hands and legs of Moses ’ people .
“ Do whatever you wish to do .
This life will pass by .
I remind you that one day we will all stand before together before the same court , before God . ” 
Finally he said , “ I will boycott this court , and I will leave the field to you , and I will leave in your hands the camel and all it carries so you can do everything as you wish . ” 
Highlighted Issues from Today ’s Hearing
The text of the MCA asserts that the military commissions system complies with the requirement under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions that courts must be “ regularly constituted courts affording all the judicial guarantees that are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples . ” 
I have written in earlier posts about some of the ways in which the MCA falls short of this standard .
I would like to discuss three ways that were particularly apparent during today ’s hearing : ( 1 ) the impossibility of providing adequate representation , ( 2 ) the judge ’s inability to enforce the defendant ’s rights , and ( 3 ) the lack of an adequate record to support an appeal .
The Impossibility of Providing Adequate Representation
Mr. al Qosi ’s defense lawyer , Cmdr. Lachelier said today that she has been given inadequate access to her client , as a result of which she has been unable to verify whether or not he wants to participate in the proceedings or to develop a relationship of trust with him .
Her requests to meet with Mr. al Qosi in his cell or to communicate with him from outside his cell have all been denied for “ security reasons . ” 
Her description of the communication process was not disputed .
She writes a note to Mr. al Qosi , which the guards take and read to him .
The guards verbally report his responses to her ; he is not permitted to write responses of his own .
Additionally , the guards are only willing to deliver one note per day .
Cmdr. Lachelier was told that taking in more then one note a day would be “ harassing ” 
Mr. Qosi .
Given these procedures , Cmdr. Lachelier has no way to personally confirm that her client refuses to meet with her and no way to develop a relationship that would gain her client ’s trust so that he might accept her representation .
This is inadequate .
The judge ’s inability to enforce the defendant ’s rights
Cmdr .
Lachelier asked the court to order that she be provided with direct access to her client .
The following is the judge ’s response : “ I do not have the authority or the desire to alter the security procedures .
You will use the normal procedures . ” 
Because the MCA is a new body of law , there is no precedent to guide judges as to their authority beyond the courtroom .
There is no clear reason why the judge could not halt the proceedings until those responsible for security procedures found a way to provide attorney access .
As an alternative , the judge could require that Mr. al Qosi be brought to the commission building holding cell to meet with his attorney .
It is hard to see how a judge can conduct a fair trial and protect a defendant ’s rights when the judge has no authority to enforce those rights .
The lack of adequate record to support an appeal
We learned today that there are no audio recordings being made of these proceedings .
This may seem a small point , but any convictions under the military commission system will undoubtedly be appealed .
An accurate record may be essential to an effective appeal .
One defense counsel stated in my presence that his fundamental purpose in these proceedings , which he expects to result in a conviction under any circumstances , is to create a record for appeal before a federal court .
I have already spoken of the difficulty with incorrect translations .
Without an audio recording , it will be impossible to determine the correct translation of a defendant ’s statements or whether the proceedings were adequately translated into the defendant ’s language .
The lack of even the appearance of legitimacy
I have tried to confine my comments to legal issues , but it is hard not to consider the impression the military commissions proceedings are likely to create .
Three defendants have now stated they will boycott their trials because they are illegitimate .
Whether or not their decision to boycott is a strategic one , it does not diminish the evidence that supports their assertions .
Two defense attorneys have said they may not be able to continue in their roles because it might be an ethics violation to act as someone ’s representative despite his instructions not to do so .
( Imagine the government having to detail defense attorneys based on whether their individual state licensing bars allow them to provide representation where it is explicitly forbidden by the client ) .
Today a presiding judge said she had no authority to grant a defense attorney access to her client over the desires of the military command .
The camel and all that it carries are not very attractive .
The acting chief , Edgar Millán Gómez , was ambushed by several men wearing rubber gloves and carrying weapons as he entered his apartment building in the Guerrero neighborhood of Mexico City with two bodyguards at 2:30 a.m .
He was hit eight times in the chest and once in a hand .
He died a few hours later at Metropolitan Hospital .

Commander Millán was the highest ranking official to be killed since Mr. Calderón ’s campaign against drug dealers began .
Intelligence officials said it was highly likely that he was killed in retribution for the arrest on Jan. 21 of Alfredo Beltrán Leyva , one of the leaders of a cartel based in Sinaloa State .
“ It was in response to his role in the arrest , ” said one intelligence officer , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release classified information .
“ It ’s the worst casualty we have suffered so far . ”
Commander Millán , 41 , had served for the last year as the federal police official in charge of the antidrug operations throughout the country .
A month ago , he was promoted to become the acting chief of the entire force .
His death was the 10th assassination of a federal police official in the last two months .
Last week , gunmen also shot and killed the head of the organized crime division in the public security ministry , Roberto Velasco Bravo .
Remember when the Object database was going to kill the Relational database ?
OOP was the sexy programming model , and relational set theory seemed so quaint .
Once you are using Objects , why would n’t you just want to persist them instead of having to drop down to this crazy SQL ?
Inner joins instead of just person.name. first ?
Fools .
Well , it did n’t quite work out that way of course .
Instead we got half way measures such as object - relational systems , and the huge quagmire ( as Ted Neward would put it ) of the ORM years , which continue to do well .
Why did Object databases fail ?
If I remember correctly , it feels like there were a couple of problems :
They were slow at first
People had a crap load of tools around the relational world .
It was fine to do some simple work , but what about reporting ?
Where was the Business Objects for the Object database ?
I remember working with a huge bank that used Versant AND Oracle , and they had a nightmare involving syncing between the two .
Ok , so the Object database failed , so what is the new attack ?
The Cloud-y Web
SQL is an enterprise victory that managed to make its way into the consumer Web and application space .
A lot of people knew SQL , and it seemed obvious to have a LAMP stack or a Java / .NET stack backed by a RDBMS .
Is this really the right choice for Web applications ?
Why was Rails so successful ?
It was due to the productivity gain .
How much of that is due to ActiveRecord vs. the other Action * pieces that make up Rails ?
I would argue a large percentage .
Working with the database was actually a big pain in the tuches .
ActiveRecord together with migrations helped a lot .
It gave us a nice middle man between a full ORM and the SQL that we know and …. know .
What if the database piece did n’t need to be that painful ?
The source of the pain can be the paradigm shift between the various worlds , but also a huge part of it is scalability .
When you have to scale your website , it can be fairly easy to make your application stateless , and then the bottleneck becomes the poor database .
This is when you break out the master / slave relationships , think about partitioning of the application , and caching layers ( Tangosol Coherence , memcached ) .
Now you have to really think about an architecture ;)
Google had to do this thinking a long time ago , as they obviously have to scale their applications to a huge degree .
Scaling the fairly read - only search operation is one thing , but as soon as you get to read - write operations you have a lot more of a head - ache .
Scaling a MMORG astounds me .
To be that real - time , and having the world constantly changing .
Wow .
At least there are the separations of locations ( world X can be this cluster of machines ) .
Now we get to Bigtable , the engine that Google built to scale in the cloud .
Amazon has their new SimpleDB , and there are others .
What these guys are all doing , is revisiting the database story .
Maybe it is time to think about if a RDBMS is the no-brainer choice .
When Google App Engine launched , I thought there would be a lot of people saying “ oh man , I just want MySQL instead of this new thing ” .
I barely heard that , and instead heard more thoughts along the lines of “ It is great to be able to use the scalable database that Google uses internally . ”
In fact , when you start using it and see that it is schema - less , you get a bit of a relief .
You can build your model , and even use an Expando to be highly dynamic on the data in the backend .
You go along your way , iterating on your code and model and you do n’t have to spend time working on up and down migration methods .
Does n’t that remind you a little of the OODBMS dreams ?
But this time it is fast and scalable !
Resting on the Couch
With the interest in Bigtable via App Engine pushing thought , we also have CouchDB pushing from the other end .
The end that says , what would a RESTful approach to a database be ?
Apache CouchDB is a distributed , fault - tolerant and schema - free document - oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP / JSON API .
JSON built in .
JavaScript right there .
A database built for the Web ?
It is great to see new ideas and thought about the storage of data .
The RDBMS is n’t going anywhere of course .
There are still a ton of tools out there for it and legacy code , and we all know that :
Data stays where it lies .
It is much easier to implement a new application talking to the old datastore , than migrate the datastore itself .
It is like taking out the foundation .
Also , SQL is getting new life in places too .
SQLite
I recently saw an application that used GWT on the client , and JavaScript on the server , which reminded me of my comic above .
I wonder if we may end up with another flip , having SQL being used in the client , and other systems like CouchDB , Bigtable , etc being used in the enterprise / on the server .
It is happening on the client .
SQLite seems to be everywhere .
Your operating system , phone , browser , applications , everywhere .
I bet I have around 20 SQLite engines on my system right now , and growing .
Why is this happening ?
Well , instead of coming up with your own data format , parser , and search engine , why not just use SQLite and be done .
It is very faster , perfect for single user mode , so everyone is a winner .
So , SQL has a looooong future ahead of it , but it will be interesting to see how the RDBMS weathers the latest storm .
What do you think ?

If the debt became more than a decade old , it might have been sold for pennies on the dollar , with a company making a big profit if it could collect .
At a purchase price of a penny on a dollar , for example , a $ 10,000 debt would cost a collector just $ 100 .
So even if the collector managed to get paid just a few hundred dollars of that debt , the profit margin would be substantial .

Before deciding to fund your payment with a debit or credit card , consider the benefits of paying with your bank account .
Paying with your bank account is instant and your payment will be completed immediately , as easy as paying with cash
My response
Paypal keeps your bank account information safe and secure through military - grade encryption and 100 % coverage of any unauthorised use .
My response
Easy - use the same bank account for making payments and withdrawals
My response
Dear Customer , please pay using direct payment because it costs us less in fees .
If you have a Paypal account linked to a bank account ( i.e. so that you can withdraw money ) then you are greeted with this abomination every time you attempt to pay by a credit card :
It 's the default option to pay by bank account and you can't change it .
However , I wonder if enough people wrote to customercare@paypal.com and asked them to change this spurious policy they might change their mind .
When I want to spend my money , I 'd like the option of specifying which account is debited by default , especially if I ever pay by mobile phone the contortions you have to go to to change the payment method from the default are a major pain .
As someone with a bit of e-commerce experience ( E - commerce lead for Scotland 's tourism portal and Project Manager for Tesco.com grocery )
I 'd like to think that the laughable reasons Paypal gives could do with a bit of comment .
Paypal 's text : : Indeed , however since paying with cash is n't an online option this is rather a bogus comparison , no ?
Paying with a credit or debit card of course is also instant as paypal gets an authorisation code when I pay with a credit or debit card , therefore the vendor can dispatch the goods immediately .
No different to paying with a debit or credit card in a shop , as opposed to handing over my banking details there .
Furthermore , if I could pay with cash online it would n't be as easy because then I would n't benefit from any Paypal or credit card protection would I ? Paypal statement : : I hope you 're not implying that my other info , such as my card details , is n't held to the same exacting standards ?
Which military - grade encryption would that happen to be by the way , Ancient Roman Army encryption of letter transposition or 256 bit AES ?
100 % coverage of any unauthorised use eh , you mean just like all the credit cards I have ?
Paypal statemet : :
This is n't easy at all .
I want to make withdrawals to my bank account so that I can spend the money .
I want to make payments from a credit card so not only do I benefit from up to 7 weeks interest free credit and have a few weeks notice of any fraud hitting my actual bank account when the payment is due , I also do n't want to use my business bank account for payments because being a business bank account it is charged per transaction fees whereas my credit card is not .
So , using the same account for payments and withdrawals is n't easy at all , in fact you trying to make me use the same account for both is a major pain in the arse .
Let me now redo the screen to say what Paypal is probably wanting to writeWhich does strike me as rather odd , especially since I can go onto numerous websites and legally download MP3s for as little as 79 p .
Clearly these sites not only have to cover the artists ' licensing costs and their own profits but also any credit card processing charges which let 's face it must be pretty minuscule .
Indeed , companies such as Protx offer flat rate transactions of 10 p for high volume users and the kind reader is referred to realbusiness or even an article I wrote for further info on credit card charges and the options available .
So come on Paypal , come clean with customers and give us some choice instead of bogus excuses please .
After all , it 's our money .
thanksCraigp.s .
I wonder if Paypal presents the same bogus arguments when you try to pay with one of their own branded credit cards ?

Unbeknownst to most software users , a lawsuit now at a critical stage could drastically expand the ability of software vendors to restrict how their customers can use their software .
Blizzard Entertainment , the company that makes the hugely popular massively multi-player online role - playing game World of Warcraft , sued Michael Donnelly , the developer of Glider , a program that helps WoW users raise their character level to 70 by “ playing ” for the user while the user goes to get a cup of coffee , read the paper , etc .
The WoW licensing agreement ostensibly forbids using programs like Glider .
Blizzard says that Donnelly illegally interfered with that agreement by selling Glider and , therefore , encouraging users to breach the license agreement by using the program .
Here ’s the scary part : Blizzard also insists that because the license agreement forbids using Glider with WoW , Glider users are committing copyright infringement when they load copies of WoW into RAM in order to play the game .
( Blizzard says Donnelly is contributing to that infringement . )
If Blizzard ’s theory were correct , Glider users could be on the hook for statutory damages , which could start at $ 750 per RAM copy .
Blizzard ’s theory would also give software vendors the power to stop the sale of software that interoperates with their product .
But Blizzard ’s theory is wrong , because it confuses a copyright holder 's intellectual property rights in the software it develops with a buyer 's rights in the actual copy of the software .
An owner of software has a right to copy it if that copy is essential to the customer ’s use of the software .
( See Section 117 of the Copyright Act . )
This rule is a crucial part of the balance Congress crafted between the rights of the copyright holder to manage and benefit from its expressive work , and the rights of the public to innovate , recreate and otherwise use and build on that work .
Blizzard argues that players are n’t owners but merely software licensees , so section 117 does n’t apply .
But court after court has held that the question of whether a user is an owner for purposes of Section 117 depends the substance of the transaction , not just how one party wants to describe it .
For example , if you buy the software , keep it on your own computer and do n’t have to return it when you are done , you probably own it .
This is not to say that there might not be a contract , like the license agreement , that restricts use of the software .
But violation of that agreement is a matter of contract law , not copyright , which means that different standards apply and there is no minimum statutory damages requirement .
Blizzard has filed for summary judgment on its claims .
Given the facts of the case — Glider is , after all , a program that helps some folks cheat at WoW — there is a danger here that the court will lose sight of the implications of its ruling for all software users .
Public Knowledge filed an amicus brief last week calling the court ’s attention to those implications .
We hope the court will take heed , and reject Blizzard ’s absurd and overreaching copyright theory .
Dedicated sardonically “ to Dwight and Nikita ”  President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev , for those too young to remember  Mordecai Roshwald ’s futuristic novel Level 7 was published in 1959 .
It was the “ diary ” of a “ button pusher ” responsible for launching a nuclear war while living 4,000 feet underground in the deepest part of a seven - level bomb shelter .
In the course of the book , each level of the shelter is successively snuffed out and falls silent .
It represented , as Paul Brians wrote in his Nuclear Holocausts , Atomic War in Fiction , 1895 - 1984 , “ a seven - stage holocaust that deconstructs , as it were , the results of the seven days of creation in Genesis . ”
As in the 1957 nuclear novel ( and 1959 movie )
On the Beach , Roshwald ’s embunkered world ended not with a bang but with a whimper .
His was but one of a riot of novels , movies , and even TV shows that populated the 1950s and early 1960s with radioactive creatures , alien “ rays , ” hordes of mutants , and post - apocalyptic landscapes galore  like the desert from which , 600 years after a nuclear holocaust , the monks of A Canticle for Liebowitz struggle to get their prospective saint canonized .
Who could , for instance , forget the screeching sound made by the gigantic mutant ants in Them !
or the Twilight Zone episode in which friends and neighbors fall to fighting over who will occupy a private fallout shelter during a nuclear alarm , or the one in which possibly the last man on Earth after the apocalypse hits , being nearly blind , drops and breaks his only pair of glasses .
While film - makers set loose their giant ants , spiders , dinosaurs , and even rabbits ( in the deeply avoidable 1972 film Night of the Lepus ) , members of the National Security Council , in the privacy of highly classified documents , screened nightmares of their own .
From perhaps 1950 on , in their new battle scenarios , which were but other kinds of “ fiction , ” these advisors to the president , began to plan for the possibility that 100 atomic bombs landing on targets in the U.S. would kill or injure 22 million Americans , or that an American “ blow ” might result in the “ complete destruction ” of the Soviet Union .
About the time Roshwald published his novel , American military planners were developing the country ’s first SIOP ( Single Integrated Operational Plan ) meant to organize the delivery of more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Communist world , including at least 130 cities which would , if all went well , cease to exist .
Official estimates of casualties ran to 285 million dead and 40 million injured ( and this undoubtedly underestimated radiation effects ) .
Everyone , it seemed , had a version of the “ unthinkable ” to offer , of future wars of annihilation in which humanity would descend en masse into the charnel house of history .
And then , as if in imitation of Dr. Strangelove , the Pentagon created its own version of Level 7 by gouging out the insides of a mountain in Colorado .
And among those who ended up working inside Cheyenne Mountain was none other than Tomdispatch regular William Astore , who now takes us into the real Level 7 , while reminding us that the unthinkable is still being thought about  and not only in outlaw “ rogue states ” either .
This piece is a shared venture of Tomdispatch on - line and the Nation magazine in print .
Tom
Leaving Cheyenne Mountain
By William Astore
It took more than four years just to excavate and construct that mountain redoubt outside of Colorado Springs , that Cold War citadel whose two huge blast doors weighed 25 tons each .
Within its confines , under 2,000 feet of Rocky Mountain granite , fifteen buildings were constructed , each mounted on steel springs , each spring weighing nearly half a ton , so that , when the Soviet nukes exploded , each building would sway but not collapse .
When it became operational in 1966 , the Cheyenne Mountain Complex was the ultimate bomb shelter .
Its 200 or so crewmembers were believed to have a 70 % likelihood of surviving a five - megaton blast with a three - mile circular error of probability , even if the surrounding countryside became an irradiated wasteland .
Today , over four decades later , the Complex remains an important command center , though last year the military announced that it would now serve primarily as a back - up facility ( on “ warm stand - by , ” in military jargon ) .
From 1985 to 1988 , in the waning years of the Cold War , as a young Air Force lieutenant , my job took me inside that mountain citadel .
The approach to it was n’t in any way awesome , since the mountain , at the south end of the Front Range of Colorado Springs , is overshadowed by Pike ’s Peak .
Except for all the communication antennae blinking red at night , you ’d hardly know that it was the site of a major command center for a future nuclear war .
Yet each time I drove up its access road , its solid , granite bulk made an impression ; so , too , did the security fence topped by cameras and razor wire , the security police toting M - 16s , and the massive access tunnel , bored out of solid rock and paved for vehicular traffic that still leads inside the mountain to the actual command centers .
Like cereal box atomic decoder rings and “ duck and cover ” exercises , the Complex is a relic of the Cold War era .
I entered on a bus which , though painted Air Force blue , was similar to the ones I had taken in grade school .
On a few nights , I left work after the last bus took off and so had to hike the third of a mile out of the tunnel , a claustrophobic and often bone - chilling experience in the windy and wintry Rockies  until , that is , you emerged into a starry night above with the lights of the city twinkling below .
Of that “ mountain , ” meant to corral and contain our nuclear fears , what struck most first - time visitors were the huge steel - reinforced blast doors , ten - feet high and several feet thick .
They were supposed to seal the Complex , protecting it from a nuclear strike .
Then , there were the enormous springs ( 1,319 in all ) upon which each of the 15 separate buildings inside that mountain rest .
I liked to think of them as giant ( if immobile ) Slinkies .
As visitors got their bearings and looked around , they were sometimes disconcerted by the bolts embedded in the granite walls and ceiling .
These held wire mesh , meant to stabilize the rock and protect against falling shards .
Lots of exposed pipes and cables gave the mountain a style that might be termed “ early industrial chic ”  and one that you sometimes see echoed today in high - end lofts and dance clubs .
The blast doors were usually open  except , of course , during “ exercises , ” when the mountain “ buttoned up ” its self - contained world .
Along with enough food and other provisions to weather any initial rounds of Earthly devastation , the mountain also had four freshwater reservoirs , each with a total holding capacity of 1.5 million gallons .
The inside joke was that the Complex , technically an Air Force station , had its very own navy  the row boats used to cross the reservoirs ( though , sad to say , I never used one ) .
Today , when I think of them , the River Styx and Charon come to mind .
Images of the underworld were then , and remain , all too appropriate .
By the time I was inside Cheyenne Mountain , we knew it was vulnerable to a new generation of high - yield , highly accurate Soviet Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles ( ICBMs ) .
In case of a full - fledged nuclear war , as a popular poster of the 1970s put it , we had no doubt that any of us could “ bend over and kiss your ass goodbye . ”
The citadel that had been built to ensure official survival during a planetary holocaust was , by then , sure to be among the initial targets struck by those ICBMs  perhaps a dozen or more warheads  to ensure a “ first strike kill . ”
Our job was simply to detect the coming nuclear attack by the Soviets and act quickly enough to coordinate a retaliatory strike  to ensure that the Soviet part of the planet went down  before we , too , were obliterated , along with Colorado Springs ( a “ target - rich ” city that includes Fort Carson to the south , Peterson Air Force Base to the east , and the U.S. Air Force Academy to the north ) .
Launched over the North Pole from missile fields in the USSR , those Soviet ICBMs would explode over American cities in 30 minutes .
Reacting before they hit placed a premium on decisions based on computers and early warning satellites .
Due to the hair - trigger nature of such a scenario , human errors and system malfunctions were inevitable .
One false alarm came on November 9 , 1979 , when a technician mistakenly loaded a “ training tape ” that simulated a full - scale Soviet missile attack .
Two false alarms followed less than a year later on June 3 and June 6 , 1980 and were eventually traced  according to an official Air Force release  to a defective integrated circuit , a silicon chip costing less than $ 100 .
In each case , the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) alerted ICBM crews and scrambled air crews to nuclear - armed B - 52s , which were warming up engines for takeoff before the alarms were rescinded .
Mountain Men
Cheyenne Mountain was something more than a bastion to seal in our nuclear fears .
It was also a repository of our technological dreams and a response ( however feeble ) to our technological nightmares .
In this high - tech , man -made cave , we could for a moment forget how hydrogen bombs had reduced the bravest of warriors to inconsequential matter .
To this end , we cultivated a quiet professionalism  a studied detachment from our surroundings as well as the implications of Cold War deterrence theory .
That said , working within the mountain was decidedly unglamorous .
Obviously , there were no windows , so no natural light .
Air circulated artificially ( and noisily ) .
As big as that cavern sometimes seemed , space was often at a premium in a complex manned 24/ 7  with at least a brigadier general always on duty in case the “ nuclear balloon ” went up .
( I recall one quiet mid-shift where I read several chapters of Tom Clancy ’s Red Storm Rising  the irony was not lost on me . )
Crewmembers sat in the Missile Warning Center in front of consoles , processing data from satellites and other sensors .
The most vital of these were the super secret DSP satellites used to detect Soviet missile launches .
I worked mostly in the Space Surveillance Center , which kept track of the objects orbiting Earth ( including lost wrenches and shattered satellites )  tedious , but necessary work that involved weekly software “ crashes . ”
The men and women who served in the Complex were anything but Strangelovean .
The U.S. strategy of that time , known as Mutually Assured Destruction ( which boiled down to the distinctly Strangelovean acronym of MAD ) , may have been comical in an obscenely dark way , but the crewmembers themselves did their duty with little fanfare .
Like them , I was caught up in “ the mission , ” in making everything work , even if everything included a potentially world - ending event .
We all  each in his or her own mundane way  became servants of the early warning machinery of nuclear war .
We were , as technology critic Lewis Mumford might have put it then , “ encapsulated men ” serving the Pentagonal megamachine .
“ Manly ” military glory was still an ever - present ideal in those years ; but , as we all were well aware , it lay somewhere beyond the mountain and missile silos in the so - called air - breathing element of the Strategic Air Command .
It was the property of the air - jockeys in the long - range bombers .
Today , it ’s not the brilliant , but intentionally deviant Dr. Strangelove that really catches the ethos of that SAC moment  a certain cocksure insouciance to what bombing actually meant when your planes were nuclear armed .
For that , check out the 1963 movie A Gathering of Eagles , starring Rock Hudson and Rod Taylor .
Watch for the scene in which Taylor resolutely reacts to the news of a no - notice , make - or - break “ Operational Readiness Inspection ”  the dreaded ORI .
He rips off his tie , Clark Kent - style , exposing an impressive thatch of chest hair .
It ’s a classic embodiment of testosterone - driven , hard - charging command , whose end point is redemption for him as well as the wing  not the extinction of life on Earth as we know it .
Certainly though , Dr. Strangelove did a better job capturing the surreal world of nuclear theory outside Cheyenne Mountain , rather than the humdrum one inside the Complex .
Serving in SAC in the early 1970s , for instance , my brother routinely appended to its official motto , “ peace is our profession , ” the unofficial , but popular , “ war is our hobby . ”
That , after all , was more consistent with the mailed fist that dominated SAC ’s emblem .
While it clearly existed to deter nuclear wars , SAC also stood ready to fight and “ win ” them .
As late as 1999 , one B - 1 bomber pilot assured me , straight - faced , “ Do n’t tell me we ca n’t win a nuclear war  that ’s what I train for . ” Buck Turgidson , eat your heart out .
My War Games
In 1986 , the year President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev teetered on the brink of eliminating superpower nuclear weapons at their summit meeting in Reykjavik , I participated in a computerized war game inside Cheyenne Mountain .
It ended in a simulated nuclear attack against the United States .
By today ’s standards , our computers were primitive leviathans : IBM mainframes with old - fashioned tape drives  roughly the size of jumbo , sub - zero refrigerators in today ’s McMansions ; they had disc drives or “ packs ” roughly the size of dishwashers .
Our computer screens were a monochromatic green .
From a Hollywood special - effects perspective , they were poorly lit and relentlessly boring  not at all like the glitzy nuclear war room in the 1983 film WarGames that starred a fresh - faced Matthew Broderick .
As those monochromatic missile tracks crossed the Arctic Circle and began to terminate at various U.S. cities , the mood among the battle staff grew reflective .
Yes , it was only a game , but everyone present knew that nuclear Armageddon with the Soviet Union was possible , and that it would kill tens , perhaps even hundreds of millions of people in both countries .
That day , in that command center , we were virtual witnesses to our worst nightmare : a nuclear holocaust that might not only destroy our country and the Soviet Union , but perhaps civilization as we knew it .
How We Never Left Cheyenne Mountain
When the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in 1989 , few people were more surprised than our intelligence agencies and our military ( myself included ) .
After putting decades of thought and planning into mutually assured destruction , after planning not just to fight but to win nuclear wars , we now faced a brighter , potentially less nuclear , or even non-nuclear future .
And all this had come about  under the shadow of true global terror  without a Department of Homeland Security , or an Orwellian “ PATRIOT Act , ” or so many of the other accoutrements of our present homeland security moment .
( Without , in fact , even the emotive , vaguely un-American word “ homeland ” being in use . )
Indeed , when it was over , we claimed victory on the very basis that our freedoms  and our political system  were stronger than our rival ’s .
We had , those declaring victory claimed , trusted and empowered the people , not an ossified state bureaucracy .
The optimism of 1990 was strikingly mainstream .
President George H.W. Bush spoke of “ a new era , freer from the threat of [ nuclear ] terror , stronger in the pursuit of justice , and more secure in the quest for peace . ”
We were supposedly lining up as a society to cash - in our “ peace dividend ” chips  with our winnings designated for pressing domestic concerns .
Like presidential candidate Warren G. Harding , who campaigned for a return to “ normalcy ” after World War I , Jeane Kirkpatrick , Reagan ’s tough - talking ambassador to the United Nations , wrote that , after so many decades of vigilance and sacrifice , we could once again become “ a normal country in a normal time . ”
But it never happened .
Instead of normalcy , we remained hunkered down in Cheyenne Mountain .
We continued to look fearfully out at the world , while arming ourselves to the teeth .
We became wedded to the idea of bunkers and barriers , whether fortified fences along the Mexican border , imperial military bases along the peripheries of a burgeoning empire , or , on a micro scale , security gates patrolled by small armies of private guards to keep the “ have nots ” out of “ have ” communities .
( To these , the ultra - rich have now added “ panic rooms ” in their mansions  tiny domestic Cheyenne Mountains secured by mini-steel blast doors , monitored by cameras , and stocked with provisions . )
After the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , it was as if we had “ buttoned up ” and slammed shut the blast doors to Fortress America .
How did the planet ’s self - proclaimed “ sole superpower ” in its moment of triumph become such a fearful country ?
In our endless face - off with the Soviet Union , did we come to resemble it far more than we ever imagined ?
After all , instead of the USSR , it ’s now we who are fighting a difficult war in Afghanistan ; it ’s now we who are inflating our currency with massive deficits for weapons of marginal utility ; it ’s now we who put forward unilateral proposals for earth - penetrating , bunker - busting nukes ; it ’s now we who are often seen as aggressors on the world stage .
As we approach the 50th anniversary of the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) this May ( “ Guarding What You Value Most ” is the motto at its web site ) , is n’t it high time that we closed those 25 - ton blast doors one last time and , without glancing back , walked toward those starry skies and the twinkling lights of that city in the distance ?
Is n’t it high time that we fulfilled the Reykjavik dream ?
As Americans , should n’t we again learn to start worrying and loathe the bomb  so much so that we roll up our collective sleeves and work to eliminate it from our planet ?
It ’s never too late to cash - in whatever peace - dividend chips still remain .
And as we walk away with the last of our Cold War winnings  no matter how meager  let ’s leave behind as well the bunker and barrier mentality that went with them .

How do you claim the free Jackpot Poker bonus promo cards ?
( currently unavailable )
Please note that Americas Cardroom has suspended the free Jackpot Poker cards part of this promotional bonus .
To make up for it , they ’ve doubled the bonus to 200 % for cryptocurrency deposits .
Log in to the Americas Cardroom software .
Click the Rewards tab and then Special offers .
Click the $ 50 free tourney bucks graphic .
Click today ’s card and redeem your prize of $ 2 - 6 .
Repeat every day for 20 days .
How do you claim the 200 % bonus ?
Start earning Americas Cardroom Award Points by contributing rake in cash games or tournament fees .
Every time you earn 27.5 Award Points ( the equivalent of $ 5 of rake ) you ’ll receive $ 1 in real money .
You ’ll have to manually redeem your cash by clicking “ Rewards ” and then the “ Bonuses ” tab .
After clicking the redeem button you ’ll immediately see cash added to your cashier balance .
What exactly do you get with this bonus code ?
When Americas Cardroom announced a new part of their bonus , I gave it a psychological shrug .
Sure , I would need to update my review for 2020 , but I ’ve been around long enough to see through most bonuses .
Online poker rooms use bonuses as marketing tools , not as realistic rewards for everyday players .
They ’re structured in a way to give players as little as possible through confusion and complex requirements .
This one is different , which is why I ’ve been mentioning it everywhere I can on the site lately .
200 % up to $ 1,000 play - through ACR bonus
This is the standard bonus that ’s plastered in a large font at every online poker site you ’ve ever visited .
It ’s 200 % ( or 100 % if you do n’t make your first deposit using a cryptocurrency ) and is worth up to $ 1,000 .
$ 1,000 is a pretty large cap , but , as with 99 % of all poker bonuses , you do n’t get it just credited to your account .
You have to clear it through either cash game or tournament play .
Americas Cardroom has never offered a no deposit bonus code .
Is there an ACR reload bonus ?
There is currently no ACR reload bonus and this promo code is only valid for players making a new account .
Americas Cardroom occasionally offers reload promotions for 1 or 2 weeks at a time , usually giving players a 50 % bonus up to $ 300 .
This is only valid on one reload deposit and is released at a rate of $ 5 for every 120 Award Points earned .
Why ACR is better than most play - through bonuses
There ’s one key I really like about the Americas Cardroom promo code play - through offer and that ’s the increment the bonus is cleared .
Every poker site clears bonuses like this in increments or stages when you ’ve earned enough player points , which are earned by how much rake you contribute in cash games or tournament fees you pay .
Every other site makes those increments $ 5 , $ 10 , or even something wacky like 10 % of the bonus .
Translation :
You ’re going to be playing a while before you see any of it as usable cash .
The key is in the $ 1 release increments
What Americas Cardroom does is release bonus money for every $ 1 earned .
That means you ’ll actually see the bonus faster .
In 2020 , if you register using bonus code ACRBTF your bonus funds will be released in $ 1 increments for every 27.5 ACR Award Points accumulated .
The points are accumulated at a rate of 5.5 points for $ 1 in rake paid at cash tables or in tournament fees .
Essentially 20 % rakeback with weighted contributed rake system
Note that Americas Cardroom uses the weighted contributed rake system , which only counts the rake for players who actually put the money in the pot based on the amount invested .
This can be obnoxious when you ’re card dead and getting no Award Points , but I ’m guessing the end goal of Americas Cardroom is encouraging more action , which in turn creates more rake for them and higher quality games for players .
Simply put , every time you pay $ 5 in rake , you ’ll receive $ 1 back from the Americas Cardroom welcome bonus .
That ’s effectively a 20 % rakeback from this part of the bonus alone .
Frequently Asked Questions ✅ Does Americas Cardroom offer free money with a bonus code ?
Yes , if you sign up using the ACRBTF bonus code and make at least the minimum $ 25 deposit .
Americas Cardroom will give you a 200 % bonus if you deposit using Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and 100 % using other deposit methods .
You can also claim the bonus if you sign up here .

20 free Americas Cardroom Jackpot Poker entries totaling at least $ 50
Why do I talk about this part of the bonus code so much ?
It ’s instant .
It ’s free on any deposit .
No strings .
And you do n’t have to play a single hand to get it .
That stands out to me because instant no - play bonuses are so hard to come by these days .
You get 20 free cards that give a random tournament dollar amount between $ 2 and $ 6 .
I usually got $ 3 for my bonus .
You can redeem 1 per day and they ’re usable for Jackpot Poker Sit and Go buy -ins .
You keep all the winnings .
There ’s no risk because you ’re only playing with your free tournament cards .
You ’re guaranteed to get at least $ 50 in Americas Cardroom tournament entries if you deposit $ 25 or more .
I got about $ 65 .
That ’s more than double what you have to put in .
What is Jackpot Poker ?
They ’re 3 - player winner - take - all Sit and Go’s in a hyper - turbo quick blind format .
Everyone only get 500 chips .
Most Jackpots only last a few minutes , but I ’ve played in some that took 10 - 15 minutes .
The “ Jackpot ” comes in because the prize pool is random .
Most of the time it will be 2 x the buy - in , but over 25 % of the time they will be 4 x or greater .
The upper limit is 2,500x , which can happen less than .01 % of the time .
You can play in a free $ 2 Jackpot every day you redeem a card or save them all up to enter a $ 40 buy - in one and still have some tourney bucks left over .
This part of the Americas Cardroom referral code is somewhat hidden
A lot of other poker affiliate sites with Americas Cardroom bonus code pages are n’t even talking about the 20 free tournament cards as they do n’t actually play at the poker rooms they review or return to their pages to update them .
ACR also does n’t do a stellar job at advertising it , although they ’ve finally added it in more prominent spots on their site .
Kudos to Americas Cardroom for doing something different that genuinely stands out and gets the interest of this skeptical veteran .
Unlimited Freerolls
By making the first deposit you ’ll also be eligible for unlimited on - demand freerolls .
These events are played at Americas Cardroom around the clock after 270 players registers .
Check the Freerolls tab in the tournament section to find them on the schedule .
All new depositing players receive entries for the first next Saturday and all other Saturdays during the month .
Is this bonus package a good deal ?
As of 2020 , many online poker sites have been moving towards offering worse rakeback deals for their players and , in general , reducing promotions and rewards .
This trend has been the most unfavorable for serious players who have hard time finding a place that appreciates their patronage .
This bonus code offer stands out in that regard .
The welcome bonus and tournament tickets you receive make up for arguably the best deal available on the market .
The clearance rate with this promo code of 20 % is pretty decent as well so if you play even semi-seriously you should have no problems clearing the full Americas Cardroom welcome bonus .
As for the poker room itself , even though Americas Cardroom with this promo referral code is n’t my highest - rated site they ’re still one of the only reputable outfits I ’m still willing to recommend to US players for these main reasons :
They have decent traffic up to the $ 5/10 level
I ’ve had excellent payout history with them
The games are above - average in terms of softness
Rewards you can earn beyond the ACR bonus code
Of course , as you ’re working off the play - through bonus and entering Jackpot Poker tournaments you ’re still eligible for the standard rewards program .
Here ’s what you can expect to earn over time .
ACR VIP Program
All players get to participate in a VIP scheme featuring a military theme .
As you play at cash tables or join tournaments you ’ll collect Rank Points .
These are separate from the Award Points you ’ll get to clear your bonus and are earned at a faster rate .
Rank Points will determine your Rank , which then determines the multiplier used on the base Points collected .
By multiplying the base Points by the Rank multiplier the player receives a final number of Combat Points .
These can be exchanged for :
Cash bonuses ,
Tournament tickets
Merchandise
Entries into live events
Achievement medals for instant cash rewards
Furthermore , your Rank Points accumulate during the year .
As much as I ca n’t stand the monthly requirement to maintain your Rank at least your total points are counted annually .
As players reach certain annual milestones , they are awarded Achievement Medals .
These Medals are , in fact , cash bonuses , awarding $ 1,200 in total .
Once you ’re done with all the Medals , you can then proceed to move up through the Levels of Distinction , which can net you nearly $ 130,000 .
Of course , the highest levels are incredibly hard to achieve , but probably not impossible for the most devoted of mid- to - high - stakes grinders out there .
Parting Shot on the 2020 Americas Card Room Bonus
I honestly do n’t make many pages like this dedicated to bonus codes .
Most bonus packages are filled with player - robbing cliches and mediocre offers that I would have a tough time filling a Post - It with interesting things to say about them .
This Americas Cardroom bonus code offer is strong enough that it deserves its own page .
Although it ’s been removed for the time being , the instant free tournament bonus previously stood out to me most as the rare benefit that even penny - limit micro-stakes players could earn .
Higher - limit players will be going for the 200 % offer , which has a substantial cap at $ 1,000 .
Americas Cardroom has also been trending in the right direction over the past several years , enough so that you ’ll probably stick around even after the bonus referral offer has dried up .
Americas Cardroom Bonus Code Summary
One of the better offers online right now with the 200 % bonus for Bitcoin deposits being one of the largest bonuses in online poker .
You only need to make a minimum deposit of $ 25 in order to qualify .

Overall Bonus Rating
For Jean Csvihinka , 48 , who works at a bank in Milford , getting a civil union meant paying tax on an additional $ 6,000 a year .
Ms. Csvihinka said that adding her partner , Gina Bonfietti , 43 , a self - employed piano technician , to her health insurance obligated her to pay a federal tax on the value of the additional coverage that married couples would not owe , and that since the civil union she has also had to pay tax on her daughters ’ coverage even though the girls were on her plan , tax - free , before .
She said she was told that “ it ’s a systems issue . ”
Experts blame some of these problems on the disconnect between state taxes , which civil union couples can file jointly , and federal taxes , which they cannot because of the 1996 Defense of Marriage
Act that defines marriage as between a man and a woman .
Some employers provide people in same - sex partnerships with two W - 2 forms , one that includes the imputed income for the extra health - care coverage for federal purposes and one that does not .
Maureen M. Murphy , a New Haven lawyer who has represented same - sex couples for 15 years , said it often takes civil union couples two or three times as long to prepare their taxes , because they need to fill out a dummy joint federal return in order to calculate figures they need for their Connecticut joint filing .
“ Believe me , we ’ve run all - day continuing legal education seminars on this , ” Ms. Murphy said .
One pair of plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court , Janet Peck and Carol Conklin , refused to get a civil union because , as Ms. Peck put it , they give “ gays and lesbians an impossible choice between those rights that everybody needs and our own self - respect and dignity . ”
On a more practical level , the couple complained to the court that not being able to marry could jeopardize their “ priority seats and access ” to University of Connecticut women ’s basketball games , among the most coveted rights or benefits a state resident might seek .
Ms. Peck ’s name is on the tickets , and should she die , the university allows them to be passed only to a spouse .
Mike Enright , a spokesman for the university ’s athletic program , said the Huskies “ follow current state regulations , ” suggesting that if the couple obtained a civil union they could transfer the tickets .
Amy Pear , a 39 - year - old police captain in Middletown , said she was reminded again this month of her own murky legal status when she returned home from an overseas trip with June Lockert , 46 , her better half for the last 14 years .
Arriving at Kennedy International Airport , the couple were asked whether they were one household .
Captain Pear said she explained that they were , in Connecticut , because of their civil union .
She said the customs officer sent them back to be processed separately since the federal government took a different view , and remarked “ Welcome home ” as she passed .
Captain Pear said she has also been unable to get a firm answer from Middletown officials as to whether Ms. Lockert would get survivor benefits if she died in the line of duty .
“ Unfortunately , a lot of people do n’t know how civil unions will work because it ’s not marriage , ” Captain Pear said .
“ You ask does this apply or not , and they say maybe . ”

The Discus language is an experimental dialect of Haskell which investigates static typing and program transformation in the presence of computational effects .
Discus includes region and effect typing , and this extra information provides a handle on the operational behaviour of code that is n't available in other languages .
Programs can be written in either a pure / functional or effecful / imperative style , and one of our goals is to provide both styles coherently in the same language .
The two styles can be mixed safely , for example : when using laziness the type system guarantees that computations with visible side effects are not suspended .
Many Haskell programs are also Discus programs , or will run with minor changes .

Rep. Vito Fossella AP WASHINGTON 
A week after he was arrested on drunken - driving charges , New York City 's only Republican congressman disclosed Thursday that he fathered a child through an extramarital affair with a retired Air Force officer who lives near Washington , D.C. " I have had a relationship with Laura Fay , with whom I have a 3 - year - old daughter , " Rep. Vito Fossella , 43 , said in a statement .
" My personal failings and imperfections have caused enormous pain to the people I love , and I am truly sorry . "
Fossella and his wife , who have three children , have been married since 1990 .
He did not say whether he would resign .
House Minority Leader John Boehner said he expected Fossella to decide his future in a matter of days .
" I think Mr. Fossella is going to have some decisions to make over the weekend , " he said .
The Staten Island congressman is the latest in a string of Republican lawmakers embroiled in career - threatening sex scandals , including Idaho Sen .
Larry Craig , who said he would not run for re-election after being accused of soliciting sex in an airport bathroom , and Louisiana Sen .
David Vitter , who admitted he patronized an escort service .
The Senate Ethics Committee said Thursday that it declined to investigate Vitter because his conduct preceded his Senate service and did not result in charges .
Several other members of Congress are in the cross hairs of law enforcement , including Rep. Rick Renzi , R - Ariz. , who has been charged with corruption , and Rep. William Jefferson , D - La. , who is under indictment in a corruption case after the FBI found $ 90,000 in his freezer .
Renzi is not running for re-election ; Jefferson has not said whether he will .
Even amid the recent spate of alleged congressional misconduct , Fossella 's apparent double life stands out .
On May 1 , he was arrested in Alexandria , Va. , a suburb of Washington , after a breath test showed his blood - alcohol level to be more than twice the legal limit for driving , according to a police report .
The charge carries a mandatory five - day jail sentence .
It was only the beginning of Fossella 's troubles .
At a news conference a few days later , he apologized to his constituents and told reporters he had been on his way to visit friends .
When the police report became public , though , it showed that he told the officer he was heading to pick up his sick daughter in Alexandria .
Three days later , the New York Daily News reported that Fay picked Fossella up from the booking facility .
Fay did not return a message seeking comment .
The Daily News also reported that Fay and Fossella attended an Air Force - sponsored dinner in Britain on a congressional trip in 2003 .
Fay was then the Air Force liaison to the U.S. House .
Fossella was elected to Congress in 1997 in a special election to replace Rep. Susan Molinari , who resigned .
" While I understand that there will be many questions , including those about my political future , making any political decisions right now are furthest from my mind , " his statement said .
" Over the coming weeks and months , I will to continue to do my job , and I will work hard to heal the deep wounds I have caused . "

Hollywood has been granted another victory in its war against piracy , this time at the expense of two linking sites that the Motion Picture Association of America believes profited from enabling copyright infringement .
Both ShowStash.net and Cinematube.net have been hit with multimillion dollar judgments recently for copyright infringement of various movies and TV shows .
Even though ShowStash and Cinematube did n't host any of these files , both were found guilty of contributory copyright infringement , according to the judges ' opinions , because they searched for , identified , collected , and indexed links to illegal copies of movies and TV shows .
Aside from monetary damages , both sites are now prohibited from engaging in further activity that would infringe upon the studios ' work .
The damages totaled $ 2.7 million for ShowStash and $ 1.3 million for Cinematube , neither of which were particularly well - known to the general Internet community .
The MPAA does n't seem to care much that it gives free publicity to these tiny sites when it makes announcements of its litigation plans , however .
The organization apparently hopes that others will merely feel threatened by the prospect of paying out millions of dollars and shut down voluntarily .
" Our goal is to stop this kind of blatant and illegal activity , " MPAA executive VP John Malcolm said in a statement .
" These judgments indicate that the studios will not hesitate to vigorously pursue litigation against this type of site . "
The MPAA announced the two judgments just two weeks after the organization was awarded $ 110 million in damages from TorrentSpy .
The MPAA hailed the decision as a clear victory for the movie studios that served as the icing on the cake after TorrentSpy 's announcement that it would shut down for good on March 24 .
With two more ( albeit relatively small ) victories under its belt , the MPAA is even more confident in its stance against sites that merely link to potentially copyrighted material .
It would n't be surprising to see ShowStash and Cinematube eventually mirror TorrentSpy 's decision to shut down , too .
It 's not uncommon to find illegal movies being hosted on servers outside the US , which is why sites based in the US have not hesitated to merely tell users how to get to them .
The increase in lawsuits against sites that point to illegal movies , however , may push more of them to move operations overseas too in order to skirt further litigation .

US leaders ' missed 10 chances to avert 9/11 '
Mike Scheuer quit the CIA last week , as did CIA deputy director John McLaughlin , fuelling rumours of serious internal rifts and low morale .
In a BBC interview , Mr Scheuer said US policies risked " an extraordinarily long and bloody war " against al - Qaeda .
He said he had resigned to speak out over US government security failings .
Mr Scheuer , who has written two books anonymously , said he finally decided to leave the CIA after being told to stop publicising his worries about policy failings .
He said the CIA 's executive director had presented him with ways to stay on during a " very cordial , friendly " talk , but " all of them included not speaking out any more " .
Blind spot
Mr Scheuer , who began tracking Osama Bin Laden in the mid-1990s during the Clinton administration , said the White House had consistently failed to understand the threat from al - Qaeda or to take it seriously , and was still doing so .
Osama Bin Laden : ' professional ' and determined
" I do n't think they get it now , " he told BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera , warning of al - Qaeda 's " high degree of professionalism " in seeking out weapons of mass destruction and nuclear material .
Al - Qaeda 's antagonism to the US was based on " a specific set of US policies that have been in gear for 30 years and have not been reviewed , have not been debated , have not been questioned " , he said .
Instead , both contenders in the recent US presidential election had told voters that al - Qaeda was opposed to American values on women 's rights or the sale of alcohol , warnings that sidestepped many major issues .
Al - Qaeda 's hostility stemmed from US government 's " unqualified support for Israel " and desire " to manipulate the price of oil " in favour of Western consumers , he said .
Al - Qaeda also views US - supported Arab regimes like Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Jordan as " Muslim tyrannies " .
Confronting big issues
In his view , " there should be a debate over support for Israel " , alternative energy and how the US manages its relationship with the Muslim world .
US backing for Israel angers Muslims
He offered no policy blueprint , saying that US citizens might decide to continue to support existing strategy , but would then be able to do so knowing the risks .
" The American people would be going into the future knowing that they were faced with an extraordinarily long and bloody war to be fought because of those policies " , he said .
Mr Scheuer also lambasted US administrations for being soft on terrorism , missing chances to attack Osama Bin Laden , and being over - concerned about public opinion in Europe and the Muslim world .
Infighting
The 9/11 commission 's report had shown that US intelligence services " had presented the government with at least 10 different occasions on which Osama Bin Laden could 've been captured or attacked by the US military " , he said .
The 9/11 report embarrassed the CIA
" The decisions were not taken on the basis of defending American citizens ...( they ) were always made on the basis of not offending Muslim opinion , not offending European opinion , " he added .
The 9/11 commission 's report published in July criticised the CIA for faulty intelligence and poor co-operation with other government agencies .
Many commentators believe its revelations drove CIA director George Tenet to resign in June , ahead of publication .
His deputy , Mr McLaughlin , stepped in to run the agency on a temporary basis , until Porter Goss took over the top job two months ago .
Now Mr McLaughlin has also gone , amid rumours of bitter divisions about the agency 's role and future direction .
Researchers took blood from American alligators Proteins isolated from alligator blood may lead to new antibiotics to treat " superbugs " , such as MRSA .
Speaking at the American Chemical Society conference , US researchers said the discovery could also lead to treatments for severe burns and ulcers .
Alligators can suffer serious injuries during fierce territorial battles but heal quickly despite contact with bacteria , viruses and fungi .
Antibiotic resistance is on the rise yet there is a lack of new treatments .
Humans build up immunity to infection - causing organisms after coming into contact with them .
There 's a real possibility that you could be treated with an alligator blood product one day
Dr Mark Merchant But , the Louisiana researchers said , previous work has shown alligators have a particularly strong immune system which can fight microorganisms such as fungi , viruses , and bacteria without being previously exposed to them .
The team collected blood samples from American alligators after injecting them with a substance to stimulate their immune systems .
They then isolated infection - fighting white blood cells and extracted antibiotic proteins .
In laboratory tests , tiny amounts of the protein extracts killed a wide range of bacteria , including MRSA .
The proteins also killed six out of eight different strains of Candida albicans - a yeast infection which can be a serious problem in people with weakened immune systems , such as Aids patients .
Future treatments
It is hoped the proteins can be used as a basis for new antibacterial and antiviral drugs to treat human infections .
The next step is to work out the exact chemical structure of the antibiotic proteins .
The researchers are also looking into the possibility of using the alligator proteins in developing treatments for HIV after showing white blood cells from alligators could destroy the virus in a Petri dish .
Biochemist Dr Mark Merchant , who has been looking into the antibiotic properties of alligator blood for the past four years , said the team was very excited about the potential for developing antibacterial and antifungal treatments .
" There 's a real possibility that you could be treated with an alligator blood product one day . "
He predicts creams made from alligator blood could be used for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers or to keep infections at bay in burn patients .
Dr Merchant has done similar work using Australian crocodiles .
Professor Paul Williams , an expert in microbiology at the University of Nottingham said most antibiotics in use today were developed a long time ago .
" We 're basically running out so we need to develop new antibiotics .
" People are looking for peptides in frog skin and alligators , for example , to see if they are effective at reducing virulence , killing bacteria or improving the ability of the immune system to fight infection .
" But lots of them have never made it into the clinic . "

What are these ?

One of the problems with virtual reality has always been that you had to either confine yourself to a joystick or strap into some crazy Lawnmower Man - style harness .
Hardly natural .
This April , however , a team based at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen , Germany , unveiled the CyberWalk , an omnidirectional treadmill designed to serve as a VR - capable movement platform .
Treadmills have been tried in VR before , of course , but early models were unconvincing — either too small to keep goggled wanderers on the platform or too slow , bouncy , or gap - ridden to feel the least bit real .
The CyberWalk solves these problems with a stiff , gapless , 20 x 20 - foot floor and movement and feedback systems that enable quick , fluid changes of direction .
We know what you 're thinking : Halo !
But gamers must wait .
For now , access goes to spatial - cognition and perception researchers , who will use the CyberWalk to " explore all sorts of things we have n't been able to explore before , " says William Thompson , a University of Utah computer scientist .
In addition to studying our brains and understanding space and movement , they 'll assess potential for military and disaster - response operations and see if the device can be used to treat medical issues such as Parkinson's .
After that , and only if you 're good boys and girls , maybe you 'll get to use it for Halo .

Disneyland ’s “ Small World ” will soon be getting a little more crowded .
The Anaheim amusement park is planning to add iconic Disney characters to the anonymous international cast of the beloved ‘ round - the - globe boat ride .
The idea has sparked outrage among the family of the attraction ’s original designer and prompted a preservation campaign for the ride , which opened in 1966 and closed for renovations in January .
Walt Disney Co. is n’t saying how many familiar characters will appear in the revamped ride or how prominent they will be .
But relatives of artist and ride designer Mary Blair sent a blistering letter to Disney executives last week , berating what they called an “ idiotic plan ” that “ represents a gross desecration of the ride ’s original theme . ”
“ The ride itself is a classic ride , ” said Kevin Blair , the designer ’s son .
“ They should leave the ride the way it was with the children of the world and leave all the Disney characters out .
It just bastardizes the whole ride . ”
Walt Disney Imagineering spokeswoman Marilyn Waters said a number of familiar characters would appear in “ stylized ” form in the overhauled ride and placed into appropriate countries .
Mickey and Minnie Mouse are not part of the plan , she said .
The changes carry on Disney ’s tradition of “ plussing ” attractions , Waters said , and help enrich the storytelling and keep the experience relevant for future generations .
“ No one approaches our classic attractions with more reverence than Disney Imagineers , who take great care when refreshing beloved attractions , ” Waters said , adding that the original intent and celebration of children will be “ retained and strengthened . ”
Some fans of the original ride , however , fear the changes are a crass attempt by Disney to make the attraction more commercial and sell more plush toys , dolls and other products .
Many are posting plots and pleas on savethe smallworld.com and other Disney - related sites .
“ I ’ll sign any petition , wear any T - shirt or handcuff myself in a human chain to ‘ It ’s a Small World ’ in protest , ” wrote one fan .
Another penned new lyrics to the ride ’s iconic song :
It ’s a world of franchise ,
it ’s a world of fun
Piles of plush mean profit
for everyone
Wonder , Magic of Dream ,
in our marketing scheme ,
it ’s a mall world after all .
The criticism comes as Disney prepares to open its newest version of “ It ’s a Small World ” at Hong Kong Disneyland .
Thirty - eight recognizable characters , old and new , will appear in the attraction : Aladdin and Jasmine , from the movie “ Aladdin , ” will be in the Middle East ; Woody and Jessie from “ Toy Story ” can be spotted in an expanded America section with the Golden Gate Bridge and Empire State Building .
The song has also been modified , adding “ familiar Disney melodies , ” Waters said .
The changes that will be made to the Anaheim ride wo n’t mirror those in the one in Hong Kong , Waters said .
Ken Bruce , a former employee of Pixar Animation Studios , which Disney now owns , maintains a blog “ for Imagineering and animation professionals to critique the current state of Disney theme parks . ”
He said the “ It ’s a Small World ” overhaul has sparked fierce debate about change and creativity .
Most of the people contributing to his site want “ Small World ” kept in its original form .
“ It ’s job No. 1 right now as far as we ’re concerned , ” Bruce said .
“ It ’s a Small World ” is a “ very cogent , carefully thought - out piece of thematic storytelling , ” Bruce added .
“ To think that Disney characters are going to invade the place and take away from the rightful stars -- the children of the world -- is really scary for us .
It ’s Disney turning their backs on one of the classics and turning it into another marketing scheme . ”
Still , for all the outcry , Disney has successfully refurbished other attractions , including “ Pirates of the Caribbean . ”
Last summer , the Anaheim park added several lifelike animatronic Capt .
Jack Sparrows -- played by Johnny Depp in the movies -- prompting complaints from purists .
But after the updated attraction opened , many fans grudgingly acknowledged that the lovable troublemaker had been seamlessly introduced and that the additions may make the ride more appealing to young park - goers who had seen the movies .
Of course , some park - goers who find “ It ’s a Small World ” dull and its song saccharinely repetitive and cloying say Disney ca n’t do enough to change the attraction , which will reopen in November .
“ What is the big deal ? ” one Disneyland fan wrote on Bruce ’s website .
“ The ride is old , sad and boring .
“ Disney : Tear the thing down and put in something more interesting please ! ”

Josef Altstötter had the misfortune , because of his name , to be the first defendant listed among the 16 .
He was not the most important or the worst , although he was one of the 10 who were in fact convicted ( 4 were acquitted , one committed suicide , and there was one mistrial ) .
He was a well - regarded member of society and a high - ranking lawyer .
In 1943 he joined the Reich Ministry of Justice in Berlin , where he served as a Ministerialdirektor , the chief of the civil - law - and - procedure division .
He became a member of the SS in 1937 .
The U.S. Military Tribunal found him guilty of membership in that criminal organization — with knowledge of its criminal acts — and sentenced him to five years in prison , which he served in full .
He returned to legal practice in Nuremberg and died in 1979 .
Ludwig Altstötter had all the relevant documents , and he generously invited me to go over them with him in Nuremberg .
I took Ludwig to the most striking passage in the tribunal ’s judgment .
“ He gave his name as a soldier and a jurist of note and so helped to cloak the shameful deeds of that organisation from the eyes of the German people . ”
The tribunal convicted Altstötter largely on the basis of two letters .
Ludwig went to the piles on the table and pulled out fading copies of the originals .
The first , dated May 3 , 1944 , was from the chief of the SS intelligence service to Ludwig ’s father , asking him to intervene with the regional court of Vienna and stop it from ordering the transfer of Jews from the concentration camp at Theresienstadt back to Vienna to appear as witnesses in court hearings .
The second letter was Altstötter ’s response , a month later , to the president of the court in Vienna .
“ For security reasons , ” he wrote , “ these requests can not be granted . ”
The U.S. Military Tribunal proceeded on the basis that Altstötter would have known what the concentration camps were for .
The words “ security reasons ” reminded me of remarks by Jim Haynes at the press conference with Gonzales : “ Military necessity can sometimes allow … warfare to be conducted in ways that might infringe on the otherwise applicable articles of the Convention . ”
Haynes provided no legal authority for that proposition , and none exists .
The minimum rights of detainees guaranteed by Geneva and the torture convention can never be overridden by claims of security or other military necessity .
That is their whole purpose .
Mohammed al - Qahtani is among the first six detainees scheduled to go on trial for complicity in the 9/11 attacks ; the Bush administration has announced that it will seek the death penalty .
Last month , President Bush vetoed a bill that would have outlawed the use by the C.I.A. of the techniques set out in the Haynes Memo and used on al - Qahtani .
Whatever he may have done , Mohammed al - Qahtani was entitled to the protections afforded by international law , including Geneva and the torture convention .
His interrogation violated those conventions .
There can be no doubt that he was treated cruelly and degraded , that the standards of Common Article 3 were violated , and that his treatment amounts to a war crime .
If he suffered the degree of severe mental distress prohibited by the torture convention , then his treatment crosses the line into outright torture .
These acts resulted from a policy decision made right at the top , not simply from ground - level requests in Guantánamo , and they were supported by legal advice from the president ’s own circle .
Those responsible for the interrogation of Detainee 063 face a real risk of investigation if they set foot outside the United States .
Article 4 of the torture convention criminalizes “ complicity ” or “ participation ” in torture , and the same principle governs violations of Common Article 3 .

PRINCETON , NJ --
The momentum in the Democratic nomination race has clearly swung toward Barack Obama .
Not only has he won all of the post - Super Tuesday contests , but he has steadily gained in Gallup Poll Daily tracking to the point where he has overtaken Clinton as the national leader for the first time , holding a statistically significant lead in each of the last three tracking poll results .
Obama 's standing has improved among most Democratic subgroups over the past several days .
But one of the more substantial shifts has been the changing preferences of middle - aged Democratic voters , who have moved away from Clinton and toward Obama in the past week .
Obama has also made gains among three other groups that have favored Clinton throughout much of the campaign -- women , Hispanics , and self - identified Democrats .
Obama and Clinton are now running even among these three key groups in the most recent Gallup tracking data .
These findings are based on a comparison of Democratic voters ' nomination preferences in Feb. 5 - 9 polling with those in Feb. 13 -17 polling .
Each of these five - day tracking periods consists of interviews with roughly 2,000 Democratic voters nationwide .
Overall , in the Feb. 5 - 9 data , Clinton led Obama by an average of 49 % to 42 % .
In the most recent five days ( Feb. 13 -17 ) , the candidates ' standings have basically flipped , with Obama leading Clinton by an average of 49 % to 43 % .
The Age Effect
Throughout the campaign , exit polls have shown that Obama has appealed to younger voters , and Clinton to older voters .
Even as the momentum has swung in Obama 's favor , those basic relationships at opposite ends of the age spectrum still hold .
The change in recent days has been in middle - aged Democratic voters ' preferences .
In the Feb. 5 - 9 period , Clinton led among Democratic voters aged 35 to 54 by a 49 % to 42 % margin .
Now , Obama is the leader among this group by 51 % to 42 % .
This suggests that middle - aged voters will be a key swing group to monitor in the remaining Democratic primaries and caucuses .
For the moment , Obama has captured their allegiance .
The Gender Gap
Clinton 's primary victories to date have been fueled in large part by support from female voters .
The former first lady and current New York senator has always demonstrated a particular appeal to women .
When Obama has closed the gap with Clinton nationally -- as he did in the days leading up to Super Tuesday ( see " Hillary Clinton 's Gender Advantage Over Obama Narrows " in Related Items ) -- he has usually been able to do so by reducing her lead among women .
In the days immediately after Super Tuesday , Clinton rebuilt her lead among women , enjoying a 53 % to 38 % lead in the Feb. 5 - 9 polling .
But her gender advantage has once again dissipated , and in the latest data , female Democratic voters are about as likely to say they prefer Obama ( 45 % ) as Clinton ( 46 % ) .
Hispanics
Many credited Clinton 's strong appeal to Hispanics for helping her win the important Feb .
5 California primary , and her support among this key group gives the campaign hope for a comeback victory in the March 4 Texas primary .
But the tracking data suggest her support advantage among Hispanics may be eroding , at least on a national level .
In the Feb. 5 - 9 data , Clinton led Obama by nearly 2 - to - 1 , 63% - 32 % , among Hispanic Democratic voters .
In the most recent polling , the two are essentially tied among this constituency , with 50 % preferring Obama and 46 % Clinton .
Party ID
Clinton looked like a solid bet for the nomination early in the campaign process not only because of her consistent lead , but also because she was typically the preferred choice among core Democrats ( those who identify as Democrats when asked to give their party affiliation ) .
Meanwhile , Obama tended to fare better among those who initially identify as independents but then say they " lean " to the Democratic Party .
In the Feb. 5 - 9 data , Clinton continued to lead Obama , 51 % to 41 % , among Democratic identifiers , while trailing slightly ( 48 % to 42 % ) among independents .
In the most recent results , Obama has expanded his lead among independents ( 58 % to 36 % ) while achieving parity with Clinton among core Democrats ( 46 % Obama , 45 % Clinton ) .
Other Democratic Voter Groups
The following table shows how the race has shifted among other Democratic voter groups of note .
Among the highlights :
Obama has further expanded his dominant positioning among black Democrats .
Both candidates have maintained their leads among their core supporters by education -- Clinton among those with less formal education and Obama among college graduates .
The middle group of those who attended college but did not graduate shows movement toward Obama in the latest polling .
Married Democratic voters have shifted from a Clinton - leaning to an Obama - leaning group .
Clinton 's leads among Democrats in the Northeast and West have dissipated .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 2,072 national Democratic voters , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 5 - 9 , 2008 , and 2,022 national Democratic voters , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 13 -17 , 2008 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .

The Raconteurs - Consoler For The Lonely
Artist name : The Raconteurs
Album name : Consolers of the Lonely
Label : Warner Bros. Records
Gender : Alternative / Blues
Release date : March 25 , 2008
ZMErating : 9/10
Website : www.theraconteurs.com
Two years ago Jack
White announced his latest side project , The Raconteurs , with a bang , after the group ’s debut record “ Broken Boy Soldiers ” was very well received .
Partly , of course , because of White Stripes ‘ high notoriety and cult like following .
Now , the band has reached record number two in the form of “ Consolers of the Lonely . ”
First off , I think it ’s better you try to erase any preconceptions and previous notions of The Raconteurs from your head , as this sophomore release is significantly more different then anything they ’ve put out before .
Broken Boy Soldiers had a set sound that carried though the entire listen , which although was great and catchy , tended to get highly repetitive after a while , Consolers however is so beautifully diverse , packed with tons of different kind of tunes from 70 ’s classic blues , to garage rock , to pretty pop .
I was pretty much shocked ( in a good away ) when I first listened to the album by how much The Racs have evolved and changed in musical direction , drifting from comfortable mainstream mainland towards more shallow uncharted areas .
The way they promoted and announced the album was also very strange , as much as very cool , with only a week ’s notice before the official release date .
It ’s that kind of spontaneity that manifests itself both in their music and real life , making The Raconteurs so beautifully unique .
The first thing you ’ll notice after you finish the record ’s first spin is it ’s a lot more diverse and pumped up .
You can feel the high energy levels from a mile away .
I especially enjoyed the mix of different paced songs , some more fast ( White Stripes style ) , while others a bit faster , cooler , more bluesier and retro like .
Actually speaking of retro and blues , if you was n’t really aware that the Racs are actually a contemporary act , I bet you a pint you ’d say the band ’s a ’ 70ish blues / garage band , that you ca n’t quite pinpoint .
I ’ve read a few reviews of the record , to see how other fellow critics perceived their new music , and , besides the constant White Stripes comparisons that began to grow irritating , I was a bit disheartened to read that a lot of reviewers found Consolers ’ retro blues a bit of place , invoking temporal differences .
Let me make something clear : there ’s nothing wrong with rehashing old school styles , just as long as you do it well !
Consolers opens up with the title track , a fun song packed with typical Jack White humorous lyrics about seclusion , isolation , sympathy , laziness and boredom .
The album ’s lead single “ Salute Your Solution ” sounds a bit like a Angus Young riff fest , in which Jack and Brendan Benson each takes turns on vocal duties .
“ You Don’t Understand Me ” is one of the record ’s most beautiful song , featuring calming piano - pop notes , harmonizing Queen like uh - ohs and chorus repetitions on the background , demonstrating the band ’s creative capabilities are far from limited .
The groups Zeppelin influences are extremely well materialized in “ Top Yourself , ” with Pagesque hooks and riffs , with a slowly unfolding slide - guitar attack and an unexpected banjo .
“ These Stones Will Shoot , ” is another song baring striking similarities to those form Led Zeppelin , resembling ” Your Time is Gonna Come ” .
Consolers comes to a epic halt onces as “ Carolina Drama , ” a Dylan - esque narrative epic , starts unfolding out , telling the story of a murdered preacher and a fatherless milkman .
It ’s definitely the funnest track to listen to .
With “ Consolers for the Lonely ” The Raconteurs have certainly managed to step up their game tenfold and proved once again that their a very talented bunch , that ’s just waiting to reach its fullest potential .
Jack
White ’s storyteller specialty , that ’s been often unjustfully overlooked , is as evident as ever .
Also thanks to the expanded lineup and instruments , he ’s now able to better musically express himself , fact most evidently clear in the string parts , where Patrick Keeler ( drums ) and Jack Lawrence ( bass ) did a fantastic job as a rhythm duo , of which even Meg White might take pride .
If you ’re a Stripes fan and you enjoyed every second of Broken Boy Soldiers , then this is a must have !

( CNN ) -- James Karl
Buck helped free himself from an Egyptian jail with a one - word blog post from his cell phone .
James Karl Buck sent a message using Twitter which helped get him out of an Egyptian jail .
Buck , a graduate student from the University of California - Berkeley , was in Mahalla , Egypt , covering an anti-government protest when he and his translator , Mohammed Maree , were arrested April 10 .
On his way to the police station , Buck took out his cell phone and sent a message to his friends and contacts using the micro-blogging site Twitter .
The message only had one word .
" Arrested . "
Within seconds , colleagues in the United States and his blogger - friends in Egypt -- the same ones who had taught him the tool only a week earlier -- were alerted that he was being held .
Twitter is a social - networking blog site that allows users to send status updates , or " tweets , " from cell phones , instant messaging services and Facebook in less than 140 characters .
Hossam el - Hamalawy , a Cairo - based blogger at UC - Berkeley , was one of the people who got word of Buck 's arrest .
" At first I was worried about his safety , " el - Hamalawy said .
Then , el - Hamalawy took to the Web and wrote regular updates in his own blog to spread the information Buck was sending by Twitter .
Nobody was sure how long Buck would be able to communicate .

But Buck was able to send updates every couple of hours saying he was still detained , he had spoken to the prosecutor , he still had not been charged , and he was worried about Maree .
" Usually the first thing the police go for is the detainees ' cameras and cellular phones , " el - Hamalawy said .
" I 'm surprised they left James with his phone . "
Twitter is normally used to keep groups of people connected in less urgent situations .
Watch how Twitter works »
But Biz Stone , co-founder of Twitter , said he and others knew that the service could have wide - reaching effects early on , when the San - Francisco , California - based company used it to communicate during earthquakes .
Stone said that as the service got more popular , they began to hear stories of people using Twitter during natural disasters with a focus on activism and journalism .
Buck 's urgent message is proof of the value of Twitter , Stone said .
Buck 's entry set off a chain of events that led to his college hiring a lawyer on his behalf .
" James ' case is particularly compelling to us because of the simplicity of his message -- one word , ' arrested ' -- and the speed with which the whole scene played out , " Stone said .
" It highlights the simplicity and value of a real - time communication network that follows you wherever you go . "
Initially , the Twitter message was a precaution -- something people could trace in case anything went wrong , Buck said .
" The most important thing on my mind was to let someone know where we were so that there would be some record of it ... so we could n't [ disappear ] , " Buck said .
" As long as someone knew where we were , I felt like they could n't do their worst [ to us ] because someone , at some point , would be checking in on them . "
Buck began using Twitter as a way to keep up in touch with the bloggers at the heart of his project and the events going on in Egypt that he intended to cover .
Buck was working on a multimedia project on Egypt 's " new leftists and the blogosphere " as part of his master 's degree thesis .
Buck found out from a Twitter message that a planned protest against rising food prices and decreasing wages in Mahalla had been shut down by Egyptian authorities April 6 .
The next day , tensions rose as family and friends of protesters who had been detained took to the streets , eventually throwing Molotov cocktails and setting tires on fire , he said .
On April 10 , Buck returned to Mahalla , where protests continued .
" I was worried about getting arrested , so I made sure to stay at a distance from the protest so there was no way I could be accused of being part of it , " Buck said .
" Mohammed and I had a bad sense ; it was really tense . "
When the men tried to escape , they were detained .
That 's when Buck thought of Twitter and sent out his message .
Buck and Maree were interrogated , released and then detained again by the same police officers .
" We are really worried that we are off the radar now , " Buck said .
Eventually Buck was released , but Maree was transferred to another police station .
As he left the station , Buck reached into his pocket , as he did less than 24 hours earlier .
Another one - word blog entry said it all : " Free . "
As happy as he was to be free , Buck said , his biggest frustration was leaving behind the translator who helped protect him during the riots .
Although the Twitter message helped him find contacts to get out of prison , he says it was more the power of the network he had as an American that enabled him to be released so quickly .
" Mohammed was sitting next to me , " he said .
" But he did n't have the network to call .
I tried to use my network to shield him until they tore us apart . "
Twitter may not have been able to secure Maree 's release , but Buck hopes his initial reason for using Twitter will help find his missing friend .
" It was my big hope that people would get [ the message ] right away and at least put a thumbtack on the map as far as our location , " Buck said .
There has been no official confirmation regarding Maree 's whereabouts .
Attiya Shakran , press counsel for the Egyptian Consulate in San Francisco , said Maree was released April 13 .
Maree 's brother Ahmed Maree said that he had not heard from his brother and that he believes he is still in jail .
Government officials in Egypt could neither confirm nor deny Maree 's release , despite repeated requests for comment .
Buck is now using his story and Twitter page as a way to rally people looking for answers about Maree 's status .
He 's gone as far as publishing the phone number of the press counsel of the Egyptian Consulate in San Francisco and posting a petition for Maree 's release .
For Buck , the main story is no longer about his quest for freedom from jail ; it 's a quest to find answers and , eventually , find his friend .

This sounds like a wonderful idea — if anyone happens to have $ 200 million lying around .
A plan has been submitted to cover a stretch of California highway with a 24 - acre park .
It would be built on a deck constructed over the below - grade portion of the Hollywood Freeway ( US - 101 ) .
Organizers argue that by placing a “ cap ” over one of the world ’s most congested freeway systems , the necessary ventilation system would clean the air before re-circulating it back into the environment — creating a positive improvement in air quality for LA .
Additionally , the park would also provide a nexus between East Hollywood and Central Hollywood – ” alleviating the strain on the community from the initial creation of the freeway through this section of Hollywood . ”
From the site ,
The case for new parks in Los Angeles is perhaps the most compelling of any American metropolitan area .
More than 1.5 million children in Los Angeles County do not live within walking distance of a public park , and existing park space is disproportionately concentrated in the region ’s wealthy neighborhoods .
As a result , studies based on U.S. Census Bureau data show that Latino , African - American , and Asian Pacific Islander youth are dramatically less likely than their White counterparts to enjoy access to open space , playgrounds , and other exercise facilities .
Apparently , the LA City Council have already approved $ 100,000 for a feasibility study .
If everything goes well — and the funding comes through — we could see a construction start on the project in 2010 — with completion in 2012 .
It ’s certainly a creative idea for more green space — and if any state could actually come through on something like this it would be California .
Judge gives White House a deadline on emails
This case seems to be a never - ending source of entertainment .
The White House has three days to explain why it should n’t be required to copy its computer hard drives to ensure no further e-mails are lost , a federal judge ordered Tuesday .
Already , e-mails between March and October 2003 appear to have been lost , Judge John M. Facciola noted , because they were improperly archived and no backup copies exist .
That period includes the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
E-mails by White House staff are considered part of the nation ’s historical record , and federal law requires they be preserved .
The White House has admitted that potentially millions of e-mails from the past eight years have been erased , although it has provided conflicting accounts on how many may still exist on backup tapes .
The order , issued Tuesday morning by a federal magistrate judge in Washington , D.C. , comes in a case brought against the Bush administration by the National Security Archive , a nonpartisan group affiliated with George Washington University .
The National Security Archive apparently proposed , initially , that the White House be forced to quarantine every computer workstation it had to protect the data before staffers could “ accidentally ” delete more correspondence .
The judge would n’t go for that , calling it “ draconian . ”
Instead , Facciola wants the White House to make a “ forensic copy ” of all preservable data on every computer that could have been used by an employee between 2003 and 2005 — and gave the Bush gang until Friday to explain why that is n’t a good idea .
And just to provide a little background and context — because , well , this story just fascinates me —
I ’d just remind readers that the Bush White House was directly responsible for creating a “ primitive ” email system that created a high risk that data would be lost .
Steven McDevitt ’s written statements , placed on the public record at a congressional hearing , asserted that a study by White House technical staff in October 2005 turned up an estimated 1,000 days on which e-mail was missing .
Two federal laws require electronic messages to be preserved . [… ]
In his written statements , McDevitt said he participated in meetings with White House counsel Harriet Miers and members of her staff .
The meetings , in December 2005 and early 2006 , occurred around the time McDevitt and other technical staffers were trying to determine how much e-mail was missing from the White House .
In a report presented at the hearing , Waxman ’s Democratic staff said difficulties arose in recovering e-mails for Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald in the CIA leak probe .
Fitzgerald publicly disclosed the fact that the White House had an e-mail problem in early 2006 .
There were no archived e-mails from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney from Sept. 30 , 2003 , to Oct. 6 , 2003 , just as the Justice Department was launching its investigation into whether anyone at the White House leaked Valerie Plame ’s CIA identity , according to documents provided to the House panel .
The only e-mails that could be recovered for prosecutors were from the personal e-mail accounts of officials in Cheney ’s office , according to the report by Waxman ’s staff .
McDevitt ’s statements detailed shortcomings that he said have plagued the White House e-mail system for six years .
He declared that : * The White House had no complete inventory of e-mail files .
* Until mid-2005 the e-mail system had serious security flaws , in which “ everyone ” on the White House computer network had access to e-mail .
McDevitt wrote that the “ potential impact ” of the security flaw was that there was no way to verify that retained data had not been modified .
*
There was no automatic system to ensure that e-mails were archived and preserved .
Perhaps most startling of all , the Bush Administration managed to dismantle , apparently on purpose , the Clinton Administration ’s email archive system — which worked just fine — without replacing it with anything at all .
These guys just amaze me .
GET your plastic grocery bags while you can .
By Earth Day , that is , Tuesday , the national chain Whole Foods Market will no longer offer shoppers plastic bags – leaving consumers who do n’t want reusable canvas bags one choice : paper .
Unfortunately , paper has its own drawbacks , such as : it ’s preferred by cockroaches – like those contributing to New York City ’s asthma epidemic .
Like other Earth Day initiatives , this move by Whole Foods reeks of a phenomenon known as “ greenwashing ” – when companies make lofty claims in an effort to profit from “ environmentally concerned ” shoppers .
Whole Foods insists that the decision to take away the plastic option is wildly popular with consumers .
When pressed on why consumers would be happy about having fewer choices , Whole Foods spokeswoman Kate Lowery insists that the “ emphasis is on reusable canvas bags . ”
Why not let customers have the choice ?
The company claims on its
Web site that it is n’t “ trying to settle the ‘ paper vs. plastic ’ debate . ”
But by no longer offering plastic , it sure sounds like Whole Foods has chosen paper .
Unfortunately , so have cockroaches .
Entymologists , including Coby Schal of North Carolina State University , have observed that cockroaches prefer paper to plastic .
“ They really like to live in the creases found in paper bags , ” said Schal , the nation ’s top expert on cockroaches .
Many cockroach species chew into paper bags to lay their eggs – something they do n’t do with plastic .
This is a problem beyond just the yuck factor .
Darryl Zeldin , a senior scientist with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , says : “ Cockroaches significantly increase asthma symptoms in allergic individuals .
And while a third of inner-city residents are cockroach - sensitive , sensitivity to cockroach exposure is widespread in our nation – not just in the inner cities . ”
If Whole Foods ’ “ green ” move starts a trend among food stores , it may contribute to New York ’s asthma epidemic .
It gets worse .
The move flies in the face of the enviro mantra to “ reduce , reuse and recycle ” – in that order .
Almost everyone keeps a stash of plastic bags .
We reuse them to line garbage cans , bring lunch to work and clean up after the dog – try doing that with paper .
Plastic bags are easier to reuse and more efficient to recycle than paper .
In fact , starting this summer , New York City will require large stores to offer shoppers recycling bins .
( Maybe the city ’s overbearing emphasis on public health resulted in something positive , this time . )
That makes a lot more environmental sense than San Francisco ’s governmental greenwash : an outright plastic - bag ban .
If you are worried about the environment , reusing plastic bags is a better choice than paper bags , which rarely get reused .
Too many mindlessly follow green initiatives and bask in how good it feels – without recognizing the unintended consequences .
Magicians Penn and Teller have a video posted on YouTube in which hundreds of naive greens at a rally happily sign a petition to ban a “ chemical found in reservoirs and lakes ” and used in pesticides and nuclear energy that is finding its way into grocery stores and baby food .
The chemical the people signing the petition want banned ?
Dihydrogen monoxide – water .
Blindly following environmental extremists might make you feel good , but there is a dark side .
Recall the millions of unnecessary malaria deaths that have resulted from Rachel Carson ’s “ green ” effort to ban DDT .
Next time you are asked “ paper or plastic , ” do something the water - petition - signers did n’t do .
Think .

Research by a group of scientists studying the effects of heavy marijuana use suggests that withdrawal from the use of marijuana is similar to what is experienced by people when they quit smoking cigarettes .
Abstinence from each of these drugs appears to cause several common symptoms , such as irritability , anger and trouble sleeping - based on self reporting in a recent study of 12 heavy users of both marijuana and cigarettes .
" These results indicate that some marijuana users experience withdrawal effects when they try to quit , and that these effects should be considered by clinicians treating people with problems related to heavy marijuana use , " says lead investigator in the study , Ryan Vandrey , Ph.D. , of the Department of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States .
Admissions in substance abuse treatment facilities in which marijuana was the primary problem substance have more than doubled since the early 1990s and now rank similar to cocaine and heroin with respect to total number of yearly treatment episodes in the United States , says Vandrey .
He points out that a lack of data , until recently , has led to cannabis withdrawal symptoms not being characterized or included in medical reference literature such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th Edition , ( DSM - IV ) or the International Classification of Diseases , 10th edition ( ICD - 10 ) .
Since the drafting of the DSM - IV in 1994 , an increasing number of studies have surfaced suggesting that cannabis has significant withdrawal symptoms .
What makes Vandrey 's recent study unique is that it is the first study that compares marijuana withdrawal symptoms to withdrawal symptoms that are clinically recognized by the medical community - specifically the tobacco withdrawal syndrome .
" Since tobacco withdrawal symptoms are well documented and included in the DSM - IV and the IDC - 10 , we can infer from the results of this comparison that marijuana withdrawal is also clinically significant and should be included in these reference materials and considered as a target for improving treatment outcomes , " says Vandrey .
Vandrey added that this is the first " controlled " comparison of the two withdrawal syndromes in that data was obtained using rigorous scientific methods - abstinence from drugs was confirmed objectively , procedures were identical during each abstinence period , and abstinence periods occurred in a random order .
That tobacco and marijuana withdrawal symptoms were reported by the same participants , thus eliminating the likelihood that results reflect physiological differences between subjects , is also a strength of the study .
Interestingly , the study also revealed that half of the participants found it easier to abstain from both substances than it was to stop marijuana or tobacco individually , whereas the remaining half had the opposite response .
" Given the general consensus among clinicians that it is harder to quit more than one substance at the same time , these results suggest the need for more research on treatment planning for people who concurrently use more than one drug on a regular basis , " says Vandrey .
Vandrey 's study , which appears in the January issue of the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence , followed six men and six women at the University of Vermont in Burlington and Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston - Salem , N.C. , for a total of six weeks .
All were over 18 ( median age 28.2 years ) , used marijuana at least 25 days a month and smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day .
None of the subjects intended to quit using either substance , did not use any other illicit drugs in the prior month , were not on any psychotropic medication , did not have a psychiatric disorder , and if female , were not pregnant .
For the first week , participants maintained their normal use of cigarettes and marijuana .
For the remaining five weeks , they were randomly chosen to refrain from using either cigarettes , marijuana or both substances for five - day periods separated by nine - day periods of normal use .
In order to confirm abstinence , patients were given daily quantitative urine toxicology tests of tobacco and marijuana metabolites .
Withdrawal symptoms were self reported on a daily basis Monday through Friday using a withdrawal symptom checklist that listed scores for aggression , anger , appetite change , depressed mood , irritability , anxiety / nervousness , restlessness , sleep difficulty , strange dreams and other , less common withdrawal symptoms .
Patients also provided an overall score for discomfort they experienced during each abstinence period .
Results showed that overall withdrawal severity associated with marijuana alone and tobacco alone was of similar frequency and intensity .
Sleep disturbance seemed to be more pronounced during marijuana abstinence , while some of the general mood effects ( anxiety , anger ) seemed to be greater during tobacco abstinence .
In addition , six of the participants reported that quitting both marijuana and tobacco at the same time was more difficult than quitting either drug alone , whereas the remaining six found that it was easier to quit marijuana or cigarettes individually than it was to abstain from the two substances simultaneously .
Vandrey recognizes that the small sample size is a limitation in this study , but the results are consistent with other studies indicating that marijuana withdrawal effects are clinically important .
###
This study was conducted while Vandrey was a doctoral candidate at the University of Vermont .
It was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
Other researchers who contributed to this study are Alan Budney , Ph.D. , of the University of Arkansas for Medical Studies , Little Rock ; John Hughes , M.D. , of the University of Vermont ; and Anthony Ligouri , Ph.D. , of Wake Forest University School of Medicine .
View slideshow of invasive species .
Gray squirrel may look cute and harmless with their twitchy noses , piercing peepers and oh - so - bushy tails .
But an international team of scientists recently named the furry beasties one of Europe 's 100 worst environmental offenders .
Their crime ?
Driving the equally adorable European red squirrel toward extinction .
The problem of invasive alien species is not unique to Europe .
From reindeer on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia to mouflon sheep in Hawaii and cane toads in Australia , biological invaders are flourishing around the globe , devastating native plants and animals in their wakes .
Often , they deliver multiple punches , as in the case of the U.K.'s gray squirrels .
They not only sap resources from the native reds , but carry and spread squirrel pox — a disease that is decimating their red cousins .
Initiatives , such as the European Commission 's Delivering Alien Invasive Species In Europe ( DAISIE ) project , which seeks to identify species wreaking havoc on ecosystems across Europe , and Aliens in Antarctica , an International Polar Year ( 2007 –2008 ) project , are attempting to further the understanding of biological invasions to eliminate current problems as well as prevent future ones .
Needless to say , species movements from one location to another are nothing new — the terrestrial flora and fauna on volcanic islands that rose out of the sea , like Hawaii and the Galapagos , had to come from somewhere .
The difference between the natural spread of species and today 's invasions is how far — and fast — species are traveling .
" The natural process happens over slow time periods , " says Barry Rice , an invasive species specialist with The Nature Conservancy .
" When you have human - augmented invasions , these things happen at rates that are thousands of times faster than natural processes . "
Many invasive species were released intentionally , like the South Georgia reindeer that were intended to provide meat to whalers in the early 1900s .
Now they have overgrazed the native plants , which serve as nesting areas for seabirds and did not evolve to protect themselves against large herbivores .
Others , like the Eurasian zebra mussels that invaded the Great Lakes in the 1980s , were stowaways , using oceangoing ships to taxi to a new environment .
Years later , the voracious interlopers are continuing their steady march across the nation 's waterways and are overwhelming native freshwater mollusks .
Global climate change is adding other dimensions to the problem .
" South Georgia is undergoing reasonably rapid climate change and retreat of glaciers , and it's hard to say what will happen in the future , " says Kevin Hughes , the British Antarctic Survey 's environmental research and monitoring manager .
" One of the problems with the melting of some of the glaciers is that the reindeer might be able to extend their range and get to parts of the island they 're not currently able to access . "
The interplay of climate change and biological invasions is not only a concern in the polar regions .
Wherever more severe and frequent weather events occur , there will be an increasing number of disturbed habitats , which may be ideal for nonnative species .
" This is all unknown , but invasive species may be able to take advantage of disturbances and move into these habitats much more quickly than native species , " says Steven Hess , a wildlife research biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center 's Kilauea Field Station in Hawaii National Park .
Native species accustomed to a particular environment have a tough time coping when conditions change , the Conservancy 's Rice says .
In contrast , many of the most successful invasive species are organisms like rats that easily adapt to various environments .
The best way to limit damage from invasive species ?
Prevent them from getting a foot in the door .
" A really good analogy is to think about invasive species [ as you would ] wildfires , " Rice says .
" You can control a small fire when all you have to do is step on it , but once it 's a large blaze , the logistics are much more complicated . "
The first line of defense , he says , is to take appropriate biosecurity measures whenever possible .
For example , many of the sub-Antarctic islands have implemented simple procedures , such as requiring visitors to dip their shoes in biocide ( a chemical that kills microbes and plants ) before disembarking onto the islands to prevent seeds or new pathogens from being introduced .
But it is impossible to prevent all invasions , which is why Rice stresses the importance of a network of experts who can immediately identify new threats and nip them in the bud .
The Invasive Plant Atlas of New England project is doing just that , using trained volunteers to inventory habitats and document the arrival and spread of invasive species .
Once intrusive populations become established , it can be almost impossible to get rid of them .
Often , as is the case with rats , feral pigs and many plant species , they have extraordinarily high reproductive rates .
Rice says that efforts to control invasive species should be tailored to each situation .
Called adaptive management , this practice takes into consideration the characteristics of each site , goals , the manpower required and financial resources .
Economics almost always figures into decisions about managing invasive species , given limited conservation budgets and the tremendous damages inflicted by invaders on ecosystems .
According to The Nature Conservancy , invasive species are estimated to cause $ 120 billion in damages each year in the U.S. alone .
The worldwide toll is hundreds of billions of dollars greater , not to mention the human health and environmental costs .
" If I 'm a preserve manager and I decide to wipe out every nonnative species , I will drive myself crazy and break my budget , " Rice says .
" I have to look at the site and ask myself , ' What is important ?
What am I trying to protect ? '
Then I ask myself which invasive species are causing damage to that purpose and how to deal with those on a local level . "
For instance , officials would not waste time or resources trying to remove wild grass from a stopover for migrating birds unless it was interfering with their efforts to , say , drink from ponds there .
Management decisions to eradicate populations of introduced species , especially mammals , can be fraught with emotion and regret .
In 2005 , for instance , The Nature Conservancy killed 5,000 wild pigs on Santa Cruz Island to save the isle 's endangered foxes and plants .
According to The Conservancy , the action was taken only after extensive consideration of other options .
In the end , officials concluded that transporting pigs to the mainland carried too great a risk of disease .
" When we find ourselves in a situation [ in which ] we have to kill some organisms because we introduced them and they 're damaging native organisms , ultimately this is a tragedy , " Rice says .
" We should take responsibility for that tragedy and we should channel that energy into avoiding introducing such organisms in the future . "
Still , he says , although problems associated with invasive species may be pervasive and complicated , they are not insurmountable .
" You can define successes on a regional level — they 're not measured only by whether the organism has been eradicated , " he says .
" Keep your eye on what you 're there to protect and not what you 're there to control .
The goal is protecting native biodiversity .
The goal is not to kill nonnative species . "

Scientists are finalising plans to link radio wave detectors in five countries and create a device sensitive enough to pick up signals from worlds the other side of the galaxy .
By connecting banks of detectors in fields across Britain , France , Holland , Sweden and Germany , astronomers aim to create a radio telescope that will have the accuracy of a machine the size of Europe .
They believe it could solve some of the universe 's most important secrets - including the discovery of radio broadcasts from intelligent extraterrestrials .
' This system works by collecting radio waves over a range of frequencies , ' said cosmologist Robert Nichol of Portsmouth University .
' These can then be analysed using arrays of computers which can identify patterns from the data streaming from our detectors .
' Some of these signals will reveal information about the early universe , for example .
However , broadcasts by alien intelligences would also be revealed by our computers because we will , primarily , be collecting radio signals .
Signals that have regular patterns will give themselves away as the possible handiwork of extraterrestrials .
Such work is a bonus , however .
The main work of the system is basic research , ' added Nichol .
The project - known as Lofar ( low frequency array ) - was launched in Holland several years ago , but has attracted the attention of other European astronomers .
All have agreed to build their own banks of detectors , which can then be linked to those in Holland .
Britain is committed to building one set , while requests for money for another three have been put to research councils .
Several sites for Britain 's first array are being considered , although most scientists expect it to be built at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire , where the giant radio dish is threatened with closure because of funding cuts .
By building the Lofar antenna , which represents the future of radio astronomy , ground - breaking research can continue at the site , say scientists .
Lofar arrays exploit the fact that metals pick up radio waves and convert them into weak electric signals .
In the past , dishes were pointed at heavenly objects so that their radio waves could be focused on a central receiver and generate a signal strong enough to be analysed .
Lofar uses a very different approach .
' Instead of moving a huge dish around the sky and pointing it at a star or galaxy or nebula , you simply cover a field with sheets of metal .
The metal will pick up radio waves from all over the sky , ' said Nichol , who this month was awarded a € 50,000 Marie Curie prize by the European Union for his research .
' You then analyse these with banks of computers and , by carefully writing your software , you can pinpoint the object you want to study .
' The crucial point is that the more arrays you have , the more radio waves you collect , so Lofar becomes more sensitive .
And if you have arrays far apart from each other , you can resolve distant objects with greater and greater precision . '
In other words , instead of using complex hardware to target objects in the sky , astronomers will exploit highly sophisticated 21st - century computer software to select and study their targets .
Thus the steerable radio telescope at Jodrell Bank could be replaced by a series of metal plates the size of a football pitch .
' We will be looking for all sorts of different things with Lofar , ' added Nichol .
' We will make surveys of the skies to look for unexpected events ; for things that go bump in the night , as it were .
We will also be able to study the universe 's childhood years .
We know a lot about the Big Bang , when the universe was created 13 billion years ago , and a lot about it now .
But its early childhood years , around 500 million years after the Big Bang , remain a mystery .
' Why and how did stars form out of atoms that then permeated the cosmos ?
Lofar will help us work that out . '
Other scientists , including Lyndsay Fletcher at Glasgow University , intend to use Lofar to study objects much nearer to home , such as the Sun .
' Radio emissions pour from the Sun at all sorts of frequencies , each characteristic of a different physical process that is going on inside it , ' said Fletcher .
' Lofar will give us a completely new method for understanding what goes on inside our own Sun . '
Two evolutionary biologists  P. Z. Myers of the University of Minnesota , Morris , and Richard Dawkins of Oxford  tried to go to the movies at the Mall of America in Minneapolis Thursday evening .
Dr. Dawkins got in .
Dr. Myers did not .
On those facts , everybody agrees .
After that , things break down .
The movie the two scientists wanted to see was “ Expelled , ” whose online trailer asserts that people in academia who see evidence of supernatural intelligence in biological processes  an idea called “ intelligent design ”  have unfairly lost their jobs , been denied tenure or suffered other penalties as part of a scientific conspiracy to keep God out of the nation ’s laboratories and classrooms .
Dr. Myers asserts that he was unfairly barred from the film , in which both he and Dr. Dawkins appear , and that Dr. Dawkins would have been , too , if people running the screening had realized who he was  a world leader in the field of evolutionary biology .
But Walt Ruloff , a partner in Premise Media , the film ’s producer , said the screening was one of a series the producers have organized for the film , which opens April 18 , in hopes of building favorable word - of - mouth among people likely to be sympathetic to its message .
People like Dr. Myers and Dr. Dawkins would not have been invited , he said .
In 1860 , at the climax of the Second Opium War , a joint English and French army marched on Peking and burned the imperial summer palace to the ground .
It was the most dramatic possible demonstration of the accelerating superiority , military and financial , of Europe over the rest of the world .
China was far larger in territory and population than either France or England , yet the thought of a Chinese force storming Buckingham Palace was self - evidently absurd .
The Middle Kingdom had no choice but to submit to the Western powers ' demands , giving their merchants and missionaries the right to move freely throughout the country .
Click Image to Enlarge The Granger Collection Britains William Pitt and Frances Napoleon Bonaparte carve up the world in an 1805 etching .
For the Chinese  who still dominated East Asia , and enjoyed an unbroken cultural tradition much older than Europe 's  it looked as though the world had been turned upside down .
" We are shamefully humiliated , " lamented a Chinese scholar quoted by John Darwin in his exceptionally wide - ranging new history , " After Tamerlane " ( Bloomsbury , 592 pages , $ 34.95 ) .
China 's helplessness , the scholar
recognized , was " not because our climate , soil , or resources are inferior to " the ' Westerners ' , " but because our people are really inferior ...
Why are they small and yet strong ?
Why are we large and yet weak ? "
These remain the great questions of modern history .
How are we to explain what Mr. Darwin , a historian at Oxford , calls " the great divergence " between the trajectories of Europe and its New World progeny , on the one hand , and the civilizations of Africa and Asia , on the other ?
How did a small , fragmented region on the western edge of the Eurasian landmass manage to dominate the rest of the known world ?
Many historians have dedicated themselves to explaining this mystery , by analyzing the factors that distinguish the West from the rest .
Jared Diamond , in " Guns , Germs , and Steel , " took a biologist 's approach , focusing on Europe 's advantages in geography and biodiversity .
David Landes , in " The Wealth and Poverty of Nations , " argued for the importance of culture and values .
Mr. Darwin's answer to the great question is more ambiguous , and therefore less likely to make his book a best seller .
In fact , his major purpose in " After Tamerlane " is to complicate what he believes to be a simplistic and chauvinistic view of Western superiority .
The rise of Europe , he reminds us , was neither preordained nor permanent .
Europeans might have been able to have their way with China in the 1850s , but the march on Peking would have been impossible a hundred years earlier or a hundred years later .
More broadly , Mr. Darwin wants to show that Europe 's hegemony , which began in the late 18th century and crumbled after World War II , was the result of a contingent historical process , not the manifestation of some superior essence .
Invoking Edward Said , Mr. Darwin attacks the " orientalist " assumptions behind Western historiography .
" The European path to the modern world should no longer be treated as natural or ' normal , ' the standard against which historical change in other parts of the world should always be measured , " he writes .
" Europeans had forged their own kind of modernity , but there were other modernities  indeed , many modernities . "
Yet reading " After Tamerlane , " with its panoramic yet fine - grained view of six centuries of world history , it is by no means clear that Mr. Darwin has achieved his revisionist purpose .
The clearest lesson of " After Tamerlane , " in fact , is that there were not " other modernities , " equally valid competitors with the West's , which might have resulted in a different , more equal distribution of global power .
On the contrary , it is precisely because modernity was Western  because it came flying the flag of England or France or America or Germany or even Russia  that it was so challenging and unsettling to the rest of the world .
Non-Western civilizations were never at leisure to formulate their own visions of modernity , because they were desperately trying to stay afloat in the whirlpool caused by the West 's rapid progress .
As even Mr. Darwin writes , " Being modern was not an absolute state , but a comparative one , " and it was Europe that always offered the term of comparison .
" After Tamerlane , " then , can be read as an account of the way each of the world 's empires dealt with the challenge of European modernity .
And nothing less than empires , Mr. Darwin argues , will do as a unit of historical analysis .
While the word " imperialism " is usually associated with the global domination of 19th - century Europe , and its benign or malign consequences , Mr. Darwin insists that " the history of the world ... is an imperial history , a history of empires . "
In the history of states , empires  which Mr. Darwin loosely defines as " systems of influence or rule in which ethnic , cultural , or ecological boundaries [ are ] overlapped or ignored "  are " the default position . "
They are the most common way people and territory have been ruled , from the Incas to the Romans to the Persians .
Our current assumption that empires are " abnormal , " Mr. Darwin writes  that only the nation - state is a really valid form of government  must be discarded if we are to understand the history of Europe and Asia .
Taking a continental and global view , Mr. Darwin charts the rise and fall of such empires over a span of 600 years .
His starting point , as his title indicates , is the death of Tamerlane , the great Mongol conqueror , in 1405 .
Tamerlane was the last in a long series of Turkic and Mongol warlords who burst out of the Central Asian plains at the head of a mounted army to conquer the cities of the Middle East  to " rule the sown from the steppe , " in Mr. Darwin 's phrase .
Before he died , he managed to cut a path of destruction from Damascus to Delhi .
But his significance for Mr. Darwin is that he had no successors : After Tamerlane , it was no longer possible " to challenge the partition of Eurasia between the states of the Far West , Islamic Middle Eurasia and Confucian East Asia . "
Instead , in the 15th century , it was Europe that took the first steps on the road to world dominance .
The opening act in this long drama was Columbus 's discovery of America  what Mr. Darwin calls " the Occidental Breakout "  which gave Christendom an important commercial and scientific advantage over its Muslim and Confucian rivals .
It also demonstrated in the most dramatic fashion what an encounter with the West could mean for other civilizations .
But the instantaneous collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires in the face of Spanish aggression also provides Mr. Darwin with a key example of the contingency of Western expansion .
If the Spanish had not advanced so quickly from the Caribbean to mainland South America ; if they had not found the local empires at odds with their own subject populations ; above all , if European diseases had not proved so devastating to native immune systems , what Mr. Darwin calls " the Spanish blitzkrieg " could not have succeeded .
Europe 's conquest of the New World was " more like science fiction than history , " Mr. Darwin writes , and it could not be replicated with the much more vigorous and wary civilizations of Asia .
Indeed , he reminds us that the European penetration of Asia and Africa was a long , halting process , with many lulls and setbacks .
His accounts of the imperial fortunes of China and Turkey , Japan and Iran , introduce the reader to whole dimensions of modern history usually invisible from a Western perspective .
Simply by juxtaposing Europe 's history with its neighbors ' , Mr. Darwin helps to dispel the easy assumption that only Europe could have played the protagonist on the world stage .
Not until after the Napoleonic wars did " the Eurasian revolution " take hold in earnest , and " even in the 1830s , " Mr. Darwin maintains , " European pre-eminence was not a foregone conclusion . "
What turned it into a reality was a combination of three factors : the prolonged peace of the long 19th century in Europe , the accelerating industrial revolution , and the growing willingness of Europeans to see their own civilization as superior to all others .
Together , these elements gave Europe , and especially Britain , the power and opportunity to impose its will on the rest of the world .
Crucially , Mr. Darwin helps us to see European expansion as a dynamic system , in which commerce , politics , and culture reinforced one another .
Non-Western empires were faced with an impossible dilemma .
To join the modern world system meant ceding political autonomy to Europe , accepting a subsidiary place in the global economy , and jeopardizing local structures of authority and belief .
On the other hand , refusing to join meant facing financial coercion or armed force from the European powers .
Over the 19th century , the British in particular managed to strongarm their way into positions of dominance around the world , whether as outright colonial sovereigns , as in Africa and India ; de facto rulers , as in Egypt , or bullying profiteers , as in China .
Attempts to resist were met with concentrated fury :
When the Islamic " Mahdist " movement rebelled against British rule in Egypt , in the 1880s , the British commander Lord Kitchener not only crushed the rebels , he disinterred their leader 's corpse and threw it into the Nile .
" A word from Queen Victoria , " Mr. Darwin writes , " was needed to stop him using ... the skull as an ashtray . "
The last part of " After Tamerlane " deals , inevitably , with the decline and fall of this arrogant hegemony .
As late as the 1890s , Europe 's domination looked irresistible : China and Turkey seemed destined to fall entirely under its grip .
What brought it to an end was the suicide of European civilization in the two world wars .
" The most vital prop of Europe 's primacy in Eurasia , " Mr. Darwin argues , " had been [ the European powers ' ] determination not to fight each other . "
When that determination failed , so too did the financial and cultural premises of European imperialism .
In telling the story of the last 50 years , Mr. Darwin is on more familiar ground , and his analysis of the Cold War is fairly conventional .
He ends " After Tamerlane " on a cautious note : Despite the current unipolarity of American power , he writes , history demonstrates " Eurasia 's resistance to a uniform system , a single great ruler , or one set of rules . "
This final judgment  so general as to be a truism , yet fruitful as a reminder of the diversity of history  reflects both the strengths and the weaknesses of Mr. Darwin 's book .

At first glance , Google ’s App Engine looks like a great way to build the next big web application ; you get access to a massively scalable infrastructure , you get access to a huge existing authentication system , you get baked - in stats , you get all sorts of cool goodies .
Oh , and you get Python , which is a great language for writing web applications , and I ’d be remiss if I did n’t take some pleasure in Django being available out of the box .
Personally I do n’t really care one way or another about hosting code with Google , or letting a data store sit on their servers ; the terms of service , if you read them , are surprisingly reasonable , and you do n’t hand over any rights to peek at user data by hosting an application with Google , so that ’s a non-issue .
But …
The overwhelming strength of Python is its libraries .
Not just the standard modules that come with Python itself , but the whole ecosystem of third - party stuff that makes Python so incredibly useful for writing web applications .
And that ’s where , as far as I can tell , App Engine falls over .
Unless I ’m missing something , Google ’s URL fetch module is the only way you ’re allowed to talk to the rest of the Web , and that pretty much sinks the platform .
I understand that they need to sandbox things for safety , but cutting off the standard Python modules for doing URL retriveal and speaking HTTP throws out an unbelievably large amount of software that you ’ll now either have to rewrite or fork :
Want to use Akismet to filter spam submissions ?
Better come up with a wrapper that uses Google ’s fetch API .
.
Want to sync to popular services like Flickr or del.icio.us ?
Yup , gonna have to put that together yourself .
Want to use the API of the hot new Web 2.0 property ?
You guessed it : existing Python wrappers are n’t going to work .
of the hot new Web 2.0 property ?
You guessed it : existing Python wrappers are n’t going to work .
Irony : want to use existing Python modules that talk to Google ’s web services ?
Whoops .
The list just goes on and on ; all this stuff needs to either be rewritten to use Google ’s API , or needs to be forked and patched .
And it seems you can just forget about anything that is n’t doing HTTP .
And that ’s just the tip of the iceberg : it looks like a simply vast amount of useful Python software is going to be verboten on App Engine .
I have a very hard time believing , if this is how it works , that it ’ll really be useful for Python web developers .
And if / when other languages are supported on the platform , they ’ll have similar problems .
Do n’t get me wrong : I ’m not saying that a free - to - start - with , massively - scalable service for hosting web applications is n’t cool .
I ’m just not sure that ’s what Google App Engine is ; they ’ve got the scalable bit and the hosting bit , but there ’s a surprising lack of , well , “ web ” and “ application ” going on here .

Explanation : Galaxies do n't normally look like this .
NGC 3256 actually shows a current picture of two galaxies that are slowly colliding .
Quite possibly , in hundreds of millions of years , only one galaxy will remain .
Today , however , NGC 3256 shows intricate filaments of dark dust , unusual tidal tails of stars , and a peculiar center that contains two distinct nuclei .
Although it is likely that no stars in the two galaxies will directly collide , the gas , dust , and ambient magnetic fields do interact directly .
NGC 3256 , part of the vast Hydra - Centaurus supercluster of galaxies , spans over 100 thousand light - years across and is located about 100 million light - years away .
Students commonly assume that , even if Milgram ’s famous experiment sheds important light on the power of situation today , were his experiment precisely reproduced today , it would not generate comparable results .
To oversimplify the argument behind that claim :
The power of white lab coats just ai n’t what it used to be .
Of course , that assertion has been difficult to challenge given that the option of replicating the Milgram experiment has been presumptively unavailable — indeed , it has been the paradigmatic example of why psychology experiments must be reviewed by institutional review boards ( “ IRBs ” ) .
Who would even attempt to challenge that presumption ?
The answer : Jerry Burger , a psychology professor at Santa Clara University .
With some slight modifications , Burger managed to obtain permission to replicate Milgram ’s experiment — and the results may surprise you .
Below ( or at this link ) you can watch a video containing the ABC Primetime News story on Milgram original experiment and Burger ’s replication of Milgram .
Below that , you can read Burger ’s first - hand account , from the December edition of the Observer , of how he managed this impressive feat .
Finally , we ’ve included a news story from this week suggesting the relevance of the Milgram ’s findings for real - life .
* * *
“ It ca n’t be done . ”
These are the first words I said to Muriel Pearson , producer for ABC News ’
Primetime , when she approached me with the idea of replicating Stanley Milgram ’s famous obedience studies .
. . .
Milgram ’s participants were placed in an emotionally excruciating situation in which an experimenter instructed them to continue administering electric shocks to another individual despite hearing that person ’s agonizing screams of protest .
The studies ignited a debate about the ethical treatment of participants .
And the research became , as I often told my students , the study that can never be replicated .
Nonetheless , I was intrigued .
. . .
The challenge was to develop a variation of Milgram ’s procedures that would allow useful comparisons with the original investigations while protecting the well - being of the participants .
But meeting this challenge would raise another : I would also need to assuage the apprehension my IRB would naturally experience when presented with a proposal to replicate the study that can never be replicated .
I went to great lengths to recreate Milgram ’s procedures ( Experiment Five ) , including such details as the words used in the memory test and the experimenter ’s lab coat .
But I also made several substantial changes .
First , we stopped the procedures at the 150 - volt mark .
This is the first time participants heard the learner ’s protests through the wall and his demands to be released .
When we look at Milgram ’s data , we find that this point in the procedure is something of a “ point of no return . ”
Of the participants who continued past 150 volts , 79 percent went all the way to the highest level of the shock generator ( 450 volts ) .
Knowing how people respond up to this point allowed us to make a reasonable estimate of what they would do if allowed to continue to the end .
Stopping the study at this juncture also avoided exposing participants to the intense stress Milgram ’s participants often experienced in the subsequent parts of the procedure .
Second , we used a two - step screening process for potential participants to exclude any individuals who might have a negative reaction to the experience .
. . .
More than 38 percent of the interviewed participants were excluded at this point .
Third , participants were told at least three times ( twice in writing ) that they could withdraw from the study at any time and still receive their $ 50 for participation .
Fourth , like Milgram , we administered a sample shock to our participants ( with their consent ) .
However , we administered a very mild 15 - volt shock rather than the 45 - volt shock Milgram gave his participants .
Fifth , we allowed virtually no time to elapse between ending the session and informing participants that the learner had received no shocks .
Within a few seconds after ending the study , the learner entered the room to reassure the participant he was fine .
Sixth , the experimenter who ran the study also was a clinical psychologist who was instructed to end the session immediately if he saw any signs of excessive stress .
Although each of these safeguards came with a methodological price ( e.g. , the potential effect of screening out certain individuals , the effect of emphasizing that participants could leave at any time ) , I wanted to take every reasonable measure to ensure that our participants were treated in a humane and ethical manner .
Of course , I also needed IRB approval .
I knew from my own participation on the IRB that the proposal would be met with concern and perhaps a little fear by the board ’s members .
. . .
Given the possibility of a highly visible mistake , the easy response would have been to say “ no . ”
To address these concerns , I created a list of individuals who were experts on Milgram ’s studies and the ethical questions surrounding this research .
I offered to make this list available to the IRB .
More important , Steven Breckler , a social psychologist who currently serves as the executive director for science at the American Psychological Association , graciously provided an assessment of the proposal ’s ethical issues that I shared with the IRB .
In the end , all the extra steps and precautions paid off .
The IRB carefully reviewed and then approved the procedures .
More than a year after collecting the data , I have no indication that any participant was harmed by his or her participation in the study .
On the contrary , I was constantly surprised by participants ’ enthusiasm for the research both during the debriefing and in subsequent communications .
We also produced some interesting findings .
Among other things , we found that today people obey the experimenter in this situation at about the same rate they did 45 years ago .
ABC devoted an entire 60 - minute Primetime broadcast to the research and its implications .
Finally , it is my hope that other investigators will use the 150 - volt procedure and thereby jump - start research on some of the important questions that motivated Stanley Milgram nearly half a century ago .

Sometimes real life instances of Milgram experiments prove the most telling .
For a very recent one , we take you to Canton , Massachusetts , and specifically the Judge Rotenberg Education Center , a special - education school for students in grades one through 12 .
The Boston Herald reports on a harrowing story of students receiving electric shocks because of a prank caller who seemed authoritative .
We excerpt portions of the story below .
* * *
Staff members at a group home made multiple mistakes when they followed a prank caller ’s direction to give dozens of electrical shocks to two emotionally disturbed teenagers , according to a report by a state agency that investigated the incident .
The report by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care said six staffers at a Stoughton residence run by the Canton - based Judge Rotenberg Education Center had ample reason to doubt the orders to administer the shocks , but did nothing to stop it .
The six staff members and video surveillance worker on duty that night were fired on Oct.
1 , Ernest Corrigan , the school ’s spokesman , said Thursday .
After the Aug. 26 call , the teens , ages 16 and 19 , were awakened in the middle of the night and given the shock treatments , at times while their legs and arms were bound .
One teen received 77 shocks and the other received 29 .
One boy was treated for two first - degree burns .
The caller posed as a supervisor and said he was ordering the punishments because the teens had misbehaved earlier in the evening .
But none of the staffers had witnessed any problems , and other boys said the two teens had done nothing wrong .
One boy suggested the call was a hoax .
The report says the caller was a former resident of the center with intimate knowledge of the staff , residents and layout of the Stoughton home .
No motive was given and the caller ’s identity was n’t disclosed .
Police are looking into filing criminal charges .
Five of the six staffers had worked a double or triple shift and most had been on the job less than three months .
The staffers were described as concerned and reluctant about the orders , but failed to verify them with the central office or check treatment plans to make sure the teens could receive that level of shock therapy , the report said .
Staffers also did n’t know who the shift supervisor was that night .
Staff members realized their mistake after someone finally called the central office .
One reason staffers might not have been suspicious of the phone call is that the Rotenberg Center uses surveillance cameras in its group homes to monitor residents and staff , and a central office employee is allowed to initiate discipline by phone .
As a result of the investigation , the center has expanded staff training , implemented new telephone verification procedures , added oversight at group homes and eliminated delayed punishment .

NEARLY FIVE years since the start of the Iraq war , the Bush administration is still funding much of it through emergency appropriations , and only partially through the regular defense budget .
This is one of several ways in which the administration has managed to hide the true cost of the war from the American people .
Until Congress insists on a full and open accounting , the nation wo n't know how much of a drag it is on the economy .
Economists once believed that wars stimulated an economy .
But when much of the funding goes to Iraqi or Filipino contractors working in Iraq , the benefit to the US economy diminishes , especially in light of what the funding could achieve if used for home - front needs .
In the run-up to the war , President Bush 's top economic adviser , Larry Lindsey , said it might cost as much as $ 200 billion .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the actual amount would be just $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion , calling Lindsey 's projection " baloney , " much as Rumsfeld had belittled General Eric Shinseki 's estimate that it would take several hundred thousand US troops to fight the war successfully .
Both Lindsey and Rumsfeld were far from the mark .
Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard University 's Linda Bilmes have just published " The Three Trillion Dollar War : The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict , " and they consider that figure a conservative estimate .
In their estimate , Stiglitz and Bilmes include the long - term costs for care of the wounded and the financing costs of paying for the war with borrowed money .
Calculating the cost for veterans ' care was not easy .
While the government discloses figures on those wounded by hostile action , Stiglitz and Bilmes had to use Freedom of Information Act lawsuits to learn the total injured in Iraq .
The two authors make much of what the country could be getting if it were not paying for the war .
For a fraction of the war 's cost , Stiglitz has noted , Congress could put the Social Security system " on solid financial footing . "
The entire federal budget for autism research , about $ 108 million , is spent every four hours in Iraq .
With just $ 1 trillion , the country could provide 43 million students with scholarships for four years at public universities .
Wasted dollars are just one of the costs of the war , and not the most important .
Nearly 4,000 US troops and at least tens of thousands of Iraqis have lost their lives .
The conflict has left Iraq divided along its religious and ethnic fault lines , strengthened the theocracy in Iran , and made Uncle Sam a pariah in much of the Islamic world .
This toll in human life and geopolitical consequences is all too obvious .
Congress should make sure the country understands the economic cost of the war , too .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. banks suffered a tough winter and may see credit losses grow as the economy flounders , yet investors may react positively later this month to lenders that appear to be on top of the problem .

As banks start reporting first - quarter results next week , analysts expect more losses from subprime and other mortgages , credit cards , and commercial real estate , especially in markets such as the Southwest , Florida , Michigan and Ohio .
But some observers say bank stocks already reflect expectations for plenty of bad news .
Market sentiment has been growing that the sector may have already cratered .
" We 're watching to see if news is ' less bad ' than expected , " said Chris Armbruster , an analyst at Al Frank Asset Management in Laguna Beach , California , which owns shares of Citigroup Inc C.N and Washington Mutual Inc WM.N .
Banks , savings - and - loans and mortgage lenders have suffered more than $ 200 billion of write - downs for credit and other losses , an amount some analysts expect to grow this year by hundreds of billions of dollars .
The industry is also exposed to well over $ 100 billion of loans used to fund corporate buyouts , which it ca n’t unload .
Banks are “ constipated from all these bigger deals that they have stuck on their shelves , ” Lawrence Schloss , who runs private equity firm Diamond Castle Holdings LLC , said at this week ’s Reuters Hedge Funds and Private Equity Summit .
“ It ’s a bad liquidity environment , ” he added .
And yet , some outside investors are showing support .
Since the credit crisis began , they have infused well over $ 100 billion into the industry , helping lenders shore up capital .
Washington Mutual , the largest thrift and a big mortgage lender , was the latest , raising $ 7 billion this week even as it forecast a second straight , $ 1 billion - plus quarterly loss .
CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE
In the first quarter , the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .
BKX of 24 large banks fell 10.9 percent , and the KBW Regional Bank Index .
KRX fell 6.2 percent .
These compared with a 9.9 percent drop in the Standard & Poor 's 500 .SPX .
Longer - term , the damage has been more severe .
In the 12 months ended March 31 , the large bank and regional bank indexes fell a respective 30.7 percent and 25.9 percent , while the S&P 500 was off just 6.9 percent .
“ There is a crisis of confidence for many investors in bank stocks , ” Armbruster said .
Problems have prompted some banks to seek buyers , including Cleveland - based National City Corp NCC.N , which has been hurt by exposure to mortgages and Florida .
And some analysts fear banks have n’t set aside enough for sour loans .
“ Delinquencies on credit cards , home equity , autos : they ’re all moving upwards , ” said Peter Winter , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets .
“ Banks are still under - reserved . ”
Nevertheless , some investors have begun treating some news that might ordinarily be seen as bad , as good .
Disclosures last week that UBS AG UBSN .VX wrote off $ 19 billion and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.
N sold $ 4 billion of convertible securities sent shares of both soaring .
Why ?
Investors saw the news as one bank scrubbing its books clean , and the other getting a crucial vote of confidence .
Moreover , lending margins may also rise , helped by 3 percentage points of cuts in a key Federal Reserve lending rate since September .
Washington Mutual said net interest margin has risen to 3.05 percent from 2.86 percent the prior quarter .
Most of the nation ’s largest lenders report results between April 15 and 22 .
Analysts on average expect earnings per share excluding items to fall from a year earlier at all but one of the 15 largest commercial banks and thrifts , Reuters Estimates said .
The exception is U.S. Bancorp USB.N , where profit may be little changed .
Operating profit may increase at the large securities servicers and asset managers Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N and State Street Corp STT.N .
And compared with the fourth quarter , earnings per share may grow at 13 of the 15 largest commercial banks and thrifts .
TIME TO CHERRY - PICK ?
Much of this quarter ’s focus will be on Citigroup , the largest bank .
It wrote off $ 18.1 billion in the fourth quarter , and several analysts said it may write off more than $ 10 billion by the time it reports results on April 18 .
Chief Executive Vikram Pandit is expected to soon unveil an overhaul that could result in thousands of layoffs , on top of 6,200 already set this year .
He is already preparing to sell $ 12 billion of leveraged loans to some private equity firms .
Profit per share may fall by more than half from a year earlier at Bank of America Corp BAC.N , hurt by write - downs and credit losses .
It may fall a similar amount at Wachovia Corp WB.N , which has been hurt by its $ 24.2 billion foray into adjustable - rate mortgages in 2006 when it bought Golden West Financial Corp .
Other lenders may fare better .
Though profit per share may fall by nearly half at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N , which had an estimated $ 26.4 billion of leveraged loan exposure , the bank has steered clear of other credit minefields .
And earnings may drop by only a mid-teens percentage at Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N , the second - largest mortgage lender .
Some observers have begun to cherry - pick .
“ We believe that it is too early to overweight U.S. financials as a whole , but believe that investors can benefit by distinguishing ‘ exaggerated fears ’ from legitimate , ongoing problems , ” Goldman Sachs & Co analysts wrote on Tuesday .
Among the companies they rated " buy " were Bank of New York Mellon , SunTrust Banks Inc STI.N and U.S. Bancorp .
First Wind Powered City
May 5th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
Rock Port , Missouri is the first 100 % wind powered city in the US .
Loess Hill Wind Farm , with four 1.25 MW wind turbines is estimated to generate 16 gigawatt hours ( 16 million kilowatt hours ) of electricity annually .
13 gigawatts hours of electricity have historically been consumed annually by the residents and businesses of this town of 1,400 people .
The local electric company , Missouri Public Utility Alliance , will purchase excess electricity when available .
They will then supply power when there is not enough wind energy available .
Excess wind energy will not be stored but rather fed into the city ’s high voltage line , making it an intermittent source of power .
Several factors made this smaller scale project possible .
The city has a bluff within the city limits with good resources , John Deere ’s Wind Energy financing the project , and proximity to the power grid .
Sarah Lozanova is a freelance writer that is passionate about the new green economy and is a regular contributor to environmental and energy publications and websites , including Energy International Quarterly , ThinkGreen.com , Triple Pundit , Green Business Quarterly , Renewable Energy World , and Green Business Quarterly .
Her experience includes work with small - scale solar energy installations and utility - scale wind farms .
She earned an MBA in sustainable management from the Presidio Graduate School and is a co-founder of Trees Across the Miles , an urban reforestation initiative .

BRUSSELS ( AP )  David Susskind survived the Holocaust by fleeing to Switzerland , eventually joining the French Resistance .
When he returned to Belgium after the war , he had nothing .
His mother , a widow , died in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz .
Strangers were living in his family home in Antwerp .
The local grocer greeted him with shock , saying , " You 're still alive ? "
" We lost everything .
There was nothing , " said Susskind , now 82 .
On Tuesday , Belgium 's banks and government sought to make material amends , announcing $ 170 million in restitution for the Jewish community and families of Holocaust survivors whose property and goods were looted by Nazi occupiers .
Overall , $ 54 million will be paid to individual claimants , with the rest going to a Jewish trust that will help the poor and keep the memory of the horrors of World War II alive .
" In a certain way , justice has been done .
Unfortunately , there are people who never came back " from the Nazi death camps , said Eli Ringer , the co-chair of the committee on the restitution of Jewish assets .
Some 50,000 Jews lived in Belgium in the 1930s and about half died in the Holocaust .
Last year , Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt apologized for the involvement of Belgian authorities in the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps .
After the Nazi invasion in May 1940 , the Belgian government fled to Britain , but instructed civil servants who stayed to work with the Nazis to keep services running and prevent the economic breakdown that occurred during the German occupation in World War I .
That often led to Belgian officials collaborating with the persecution of Jews , though the resistance movement was also strong and underground networks to save Jews were more successful than in many occupied nations .
Belgium is facing 5,210 outstanding claims for restitution stemming from the Holocaust .
From those , 162 amount to more than $ 30,000 .
Of the total payout , $ 69.8 million will come from the Belgian authorities and $ 85 million from banks .
Most of the remainder will come from insurance companies .
Susskind , who has worked for the Jewish cause since the war , did not file an individual claim .
" The point is to rebuild a Jewish community like we had before the war , " he said in a telephone interview .
" For suffering , there is no price . "
The Belgian deal was the latest successful effort by Holocaust victims to win compensation .
The German government has paid more than $ 6 billion to Jewish victims or their families since the first deal was negotiated by the World Jewish Congress in the 1950s .
In the 1990s , Swiss banks agreed to pay $ 1.25 billion on dormant accounts left by Holocaust victims .
A decade - long legal battle in the United States against European insurance companies , accused of refusing to pay on policies to victims or their beneficiaries , was settled this year for $ 175 million .
For Belgium , the compensation decision was another opportunity to come to terms with a dark chapter of its history .
Last year , a government - backed report blamed Belgian authorities and the ruling elite for collaborating with the Nazi persecution of Jews .
The head of the Senate condemned the " cowardliness of our administration " during the 1940 - 1944 occupation .
Jewish citizens were forced at first to be registered .
Then they were obligated to wear yellow stars , and schools and hospitals were segregated .
Raids soon rounded up Jews in Belgian cities for deportation to Nazi concentration camps .
Some cities helped with the deportations .
With the compensation , " the primary objective was clearly to close a section of the past , which still seems half - open , more than sixty years after the events , " the restitution commission said .
The commission , set up by the government , acknowledged that its offer fell short of some expectations , saying it was " frequently confronted with the disappointment of rightful claimants who had plainly expected much bigger indemnification . "

Paul Graham ’s latest essay , You Were n’t Meant to Have a Boss , has caused quite a stir .
Although I thought the discussion of the pathologies of large organizations was interesting , the assertion that only startup founders are living life the way they are meant to ( lions on the savannah , rather than caged animals ) really rubbed me the wrong way .
The Cliff Notes version attempts to smooth things over , but in a way also basically says that employees are choosing to live in cages .
Graham starts his essay with an anecdote about a recent experience that he feels demonstrates his point .
After spending some time thinking about why I felt his point was wrong , I realized that I also have an anecdote with relevance to share .
I happen to have a friend ( 1 ) who is in this YCombinator round .
Last week I was in the Bay Area for a couple days , so I dropped him a line to see if he had time to meet up for dinner .
He replied that my timing was good , because I was there the day after “ demo day ” , so they had a day off ( 2 ) .
We met up in downtown Mountain View and went looking for a place to eat that fit his budget : $ 10 entrees would be okay , but $ 15 , as was common at most of the restaurants , was too much .
At dinner , I kvetched about Yahoo , and he kvetched about YCombinator .
I talked about my jaunt up to San Francisco the previous evening to meet up with friends for excellent cocktails ( on another trip it might have been a great restaurant , or an art museum , or hiking on the beach or Mt. Tam ) .
It turns out he ’s been in Silicon Valley since December but has yet to make it into SF .
He also only gets to eat out once or twice a month .
Unlike Graham ’s conclusions drawn from a couple minutes of observing strangers , I ’ve know this person for over 10 years .
I ’ve seen him go through good times and bad times .
I want to be fair ; he ’s far from the least happy I ’ve seen him .
But I also definitely would n’t say that he ’s the most alive I ’ve known him to be either .
I definitely did n’t feel like a caged animal in comparison .
Even in the case of these founders that Graham describes who are passionately consumed by their work , I still question the assertion that they are living life as they were meant to .
How much time do they spend with friends and family ?
Do they get to enjoy the amazing city they live just outside of ?
Can they go out to dinner without having to count their pennies ?
By some argument , perhaps this is how we were “ meant ” to live , in an evolutionary sense .
Historically humans spent almost all their time hunting and gathering and performing other essential survival tasks ( i.e. , working ) .
The modern concept of leisure is , perhaps , evolutionarily unnatural .
But regardless , the fact is that productivity has risen to the point where most people can work 40 or so hours a week and produce enough to cover their needs ( and a reasonable amount of their wants ) .
We can accept being less than fully self - actualized at work in exchange for the ability to pursue a variety of other activities during the remaining 60 hours of wakefulness we have each week .
Furthermore , Graham seems to assume that all people share the ambition to produce exceptional results at work .
I assure you , they do not .
I know plenty of people who would n’t complain too much about the “ team - building ” exercise he scorned because , hey , they ’re getting paid to run around Palo Alto on a silly scavenger hunt , rather than having to sit at their desk .
While coworkers who accept average results may sometimes be frustrating to those of us who aspire to greatness , I still have to admit that I sometimes envy the folks who can manage to just not be bothered by whatever is going on at work , and who can just go home at 5 and put it out of their mind until 9 the next morning .
Are there people working big company jobs that deaden their souls ?
No doubt .
Are there startup founders who are fully alive , in all parts of their life ?
Probably .
But in both environments , there ’s a more diverse set of experiences than Graham is admitting to .
Furthermore , there ’s also a diverse set of goals — people do n’t universally agree about what living life fully means .
Failing to acknowledge that , and putting down people with different values as a result , is the fundamental flaw in Graham ’s essay , in my opinion .
(1) For a couple reasons , I ’ve chosen to keep my friend anonymous , unless , of course , he chooses to reveal his identity .
Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps Files Lawsuit Against Major ' Organic ' Cheater Brands
( Natural News ) Following the Organic Consumers Association 's revelations that so - called " organic " or " natural " product brands were actually made with toxic chemicals such as 1,4 - dioxane , Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps has sued numerous companies in the industry that it accuses of using misleading labeling to deceive consumers .
The lawsuit is meant to encourage the named companies ( see list below ) to either reformulate their products to eliminate the petrochemical materials , or to change their labeling and stop using the words " organic " or " natural " on their products .
Companies sued by Dr. Bronner 's include Estee Lauder , Ecocert , OASIS , Stella McCartney 's CARE , Jasön , Avalon Organics , Nature 's Gate , Kiss My Face , Ikove and others .
Each of the companies being sued , says Dr. Bronner 's , are using potentially dangerous chemicals that certainly do n't quality as natural or organic .
The product categories include shampoo , body wash , liquid soap , skin cleansers and other personal care products .
Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps have remained a steadfast defender of honesty and integrity in the organic products business , and NaturalNews continues to strongly recommend Dr. Bronner 's liquid soap products to its readers ( that 's the soap I use for just about everything ) .
The fact that so many other companies are acting like " organic cheaters " is sad to see in this industry , and it emphasizes the importance of defending the integrity of the organic label .
If the word " organic " is allowed to be slapped on products containing synthetic petrochemicals and potentially cancer - causing substances , then it only serves to mislead and potentially harm consumers .
Sadly , many of the companies in the " organic " products industry are flatly dishonest , and they 're jumping on the organic bandwagon as a clever tactic to make a quick buck rather than formulating their products with genuinely honest organic ingredients that put consumer health first .
NaturalNews encourages consumers to boycott all the " organic cheater " brands and choose only genuine , trusted brands that are supported by the Organic Consumers Association ( www.OrganicConsumers.org
Here is the original press release from Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps announcing this news : SAN FRANCISCO , CA - The family owned Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court today against numerous personal care brands to force them to stop making misleading organic labeling claims .
Dr. Bronner 's and the Organic Consumers Association ( OCA ) had warned offending brands that they faced litigation unless they committed to either drop their organic claims or reformulate away from main ingredients made from conventional agricultural and / or petrochemical material without any certified organic material .
OCA has played the leading role in exposing and educating consumers about deceptive organic branding .
David Bronner , President of Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps says , " We have been deeply disappointed and frustrated by companies in the ' natural ' personal care space who have been screwing over organic consumers , engaging in misleading organic branding and label call - outs , on products that were not natural in the first place , let alone organic . "
Dr. Bronner 's has determined , based on extensive surveys , that organic consumers expect that cleansing ingredients in branded and labeled soaps , shampoos and body washes that are labeled Organic " , " Organics " or " Made with Organic " will be from organic as distinct from conventional agricultural material , produced without synthetic fertilizers , herbicides or pesticides , and free of petrochemical compounds .
For example :
The major cleansing ingredient in Jason " Pure , Natural & Organic " liquid soaps , body washes and shampoos is Sodium Myreth Sulfate , which involves ethoxylating a conventional non-organic fatty chain with the carcinogenic petrochemical Ethylene Oxide , which produces caricinogenic 1,4 - Dioxane as a contaminant .
The major cleansing ingredient in Avalon " Organics " soaps , bodywashes and shampoos , Cocamidopropyl Betaine , contains conventional non-organic agricultural material combined with the petrochemical Amdiopropyl Betaine .
Nature 's Gate " Organics " main cleansers are Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate ( ethoxylated ) and Cocamidopropyl Betaine .
Kiss My Face " Obsessively Organic " cleansers are Olefin Sulfonate ( a pure petrochemical ) and Cocamidopropyl Betaine .
Juice " Organics " , Giovanni " Organic Cosmetics " , Head " Organics " , Desert Essence " Organics " , and Ikove " Organic " all use Cocamdiopropyl Betaine as a main cleansing ingredient and no cleansers made from certified organic material .
Due to the petrochemical compounds used to make the ingredient , Cocamidopropyl Betaine is contaminated with traces of Sodium monochloroacetate , Amidoamine ( AA ) , and dimethylaminopropylamine ( DMAPA ) .
Amidoamine in particular is suspected of causing skin sensitization and allergic reactions even at very low levels for certain individuals .
Organic consumers have a right to expect that the personal care products they purchase with organic branding or label claims , contain cleansing ingredients made from organic agricultural material , not conventional or petrochemical material , and thus have absolutely no petrochemical contaminants that could pose any concern .
Dr. Bronner 's products , in contrast to the brands noted above , contain cleansing and moisturizing ingredients made only from certified organic oils , made without any use of petrochemicals , and contain no petrochemical preservatives .
The misleading organic noise created by culprit companies ' branding and labeling practices , interferes with organic consumers ability to distinguish personal care whose main ingredients are in fact made with certified organic , not conventional or petrochemical , material , free of synthetic preservatives .
Ecocert is a French - based certifier with a standard that allows not only cleansing ingredients made from conventional versus organic agriculture , but also allows inclusion , in the cleansing ingredients contained in products labeled as " Made with Organic " ingredients , of certain petrochemicals such as Amidopropyl Betaine in Cocamidopropyl Betaine .
Even worse , despite Ecocert 's own regulations prohibiting the labeling as " Organic " of a product containing less than 100 % organic content , Ecocert in practice engages in " creative misinterpretation " of its own rules in order to accommodate clients engaging in organic mislabeling .
For instance , Ecocert certifies the Ikove brand 's cleansing products to contain less than 50 % organic content , noted in small text on the back of the product , where all cleansing ingredients are non-organic including Cocamidopropyl Betaine which contains petroleum compounds .
Yet the product is labeled " Organic " Amazonian Avocado Bath & Shower Gel .
Another instance is Stella McCartney 's " 100 % Organic " CARE line certified by Ecocert that labels products as " 100 % Organic " that are not 100 % Organic alongside ones that are ; the labels of products that are not 100 % organic simply insert the word " Active " before " Ingredients . "
In allowing such labeling , Ecocert simply ignores the requirements of its own certification standards .
Furthermore , the primary organic content in most Ecocert certified products comes from " Flower Waters " in which up to 80 % of the " organic " content consists merely of just regular tap water that Ecocert counts as " organic .
" Explicitly relying on the weak Ecocert standard as precedent , the new Organic and Sustainable Industry Standard ( " OASIS " ) - a standard indeed developed exclusively by certain members of the industry , primarily Estee Lauder , with no consumer input -- will permit certification of products outright as " Organic " ( rather than as " Made with Organic " ingredients ) even if such products contain hydrogenated and sulfated cleansing ingredients such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate made from conventional agricultural material grown with synthetic fertilizers , herbicides and pesticides , and preserved with synthetic petrochemical preservatives such as Ethylhexylglycerin and Phenoxyethanol .
[ Reference : OASIS Standard section 6.2 and Anti-Microbial List ]
The organic content is required to only be 85 % , which in water and detergent - based personal care products , means organic water extracts and aloe vera will greenwash conventional synthetic cleansing ingredients and preservatives .
The OASIS standard is not merely useless but deliberately misleading to organic consumers looking for a reliable indicator of true " organic " product integrity in personal care .
Organic consumers expect that cleansing ingredients in products labeled " Organic " be made from organic not conventional agriculture , to not be hydrogenated or sulfated , and to be free from synthetic petrochemical preservatives .
Surprisingly , companies represented on the OASIS board , such as Hain ( Jason " Pure , Natural & Organic " ; Avalon " Organics " ) and Cosway ( Head " Organics " , ) produce liquid soap , bodywash and shampoo products with petrochemicals in their cleansers even though use of petrochemicals in this way is not permitted even under the very permissible OASIS standard these companies have themselves developed and endorsed .
Ronnie Cummins , Executive Director of the OCA , said : " The pressure of imminent litigation outlined in cease and desist letters sent by OCA and Dr. Bronner 's in March prompted some serious discussion with some of the offending companies , but ultimately failed to resolve the core issues . "
In “ History of Beauty , ” Umberto Eco explored the ways in which notions of attractiveness shift from culture to culture and era to era .
With ON UGLINESS , a collection of images and written excerpts from ancient times to the present , he asks :
Is repulsiveness , too , in the eye of the beholder ?
And what do we learn about that beholder when we delve into his aversions ?
Selecting stark visual images of gore , deformity , moral turpitude and malice , and quotations from sources ranging from Plato to radical feminists , Eco unfurls a taxonomy of ugliness .
As gross - out contests go , it ’s both absorbing and highbrow .
F
or more than two centuries after Newton published his theories of space , time , and motion in 1687 , most physicists were Newtonians .
They believed , as Newton did , that space and time are absolute , that force causes acceleration , and that gravity is a force conveyed across a vacuum at a distance .
Since Darwin there are few professional biologists who are not Darwinians , and if most psychologists no longer often call themselves Freudians , few doubt that there is an unconscious or that sexuality plays a big role in it .
So as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Einstein ’s great discoveries , the question arises :
How many professional physicists are Einsteinians ?
The superficial answer is that we all are .
No professional physicist today doubts that quantum theory and relativity theory have stood up to experimental tests .
But the term “ Einsteinian ” does not exist .
I ’ve never heard or read it .
Nor have I ever encountered any evidence for a “ school of Einstein . ”
There is a community of people scattered around the world who call themselves relativists , whose main scientific work centers on general relativity .
But relativists make up only a tiny minority of theoretical physicists , and there is no country where they dominate the intellectual atmosphere of the field .
Strange as it may seem , Albert Einstein , the discoverer of both quantum and relativity theory , and hence clearly the preeminent physicist of the modern era , failed to leave behind a following with any appreciable influence .
Why most physicists followed other leaders in directions Einstein opposed is a story that must be told if this centennial year is to be other than an empty celebration of a myth , unconnected to the reality of who Einstein was and what he believed in .
Physicists
I ’ve met who knew Einstein told me they found his thinking slow compared to the stars of the day .
While he was competent enough with the basic mathematical tools of physics , many other physicists surrounding him in Berlin and Princeton were better at it .
So what accounted for his genius ?
In retrospect , I believe what allowed Einstein to achieve so much was primarily a moral quality .
He simply cared far more than most of his colleagues that the laws of physics have to explain everything in nature coherently and consistently .
As a result he was acutely sensitive to flaws and contradictions in the logical structure of physical theories .
Einstein ’s ability to see flaws and his fierce refusal to compromise had real repercussions .
His professors did not support him in his search for an academic job and he was unemployed until he found work as a patent inspector .
The problem was not just that he skipped classes .
He saw right through his elders ’ complacent acceptance of Newtonian physics .
The young Einstein was obsessed with logical flaws that were glaringly obvious , but only to him .
While the great English physicist Lord Rayleigh said he saw “ only a few clouds on the horizon ” remaining to be understood , the 16 - year - old Einstein wondered what would happen to his image in a mirror if he traveled faster than the speed of light .
Einstein ’s single goal in science was to discover what he called theories of principle .
These are theories that postulate general rules that all phenomena must satisfy .
If such a theory is true , it must apply universally .
In his study of physics he identified two existing theories of principle : the laws of motion set out by Galileo and Newton , and thermodynamics .
The basic principle of the first is the relativity of uniform motion , that the speed of your own motion is impossible to detect .
Einstein ’s discovery of special relativity came from 10 years of meditation on how to reconcile the relativity of motion with James Clerk Maxwell ’s theory of electromagnetism , which describes the propagation of light .
While he mused about electromagnetism , Einstein made thermodynamics the focus of his early work .
He began by following the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann who argued that the laws of thermodynamics could be derived from applying statistics to the motion of atoms .
This view was unpopular at the time because many influential professors did not believe matter was made of atoms .
They instead believed matter was continuous .
Einstein ’s work led to his demonstration in 1905 that Brownian motion — the continuous , jerky movements of pollen grains or other tiny objects immersed in liquid — offered a proof of the existence of atoms .
At the same time , Einstein applied Boltzmann ’s approach to thermodynamics to electrodynamics .
This led to his discovery of the photon , a discrete packet of electromagnetic energy , and to the realization that such a packet must be both a wave and a particle .
Although Einstein was thus the discoverer of quantum phenomena , he became in time the main opponent of the theory of quantum mechanics .
By his own account , he spent far more time thinking about quantum theory than he did about relativity .
But he never found a theory of quantum physics that satisfied him .
There are by now only a small minority of physicists who think Einstein was right to reject quantum theory as the foundation of our understanding of nature .
No theory has been more successful at explaining a vast array of experimental data .
It is the basis for our understanding of virtually all of physics , with the possible exception of gravity and cosmology .
Einstein was willing to concede that quantum mechanics explains the recorded behavior of the subatomic world , but he was convinced it had two flaws .
First , it fails to give precise predictions for the outcomes of individual processes .
Instead , it gives only statistical predictions .
To check them , one must do an experiment many times and compare the resulting distributions of outcomes with the predictions of the theory .
Second , quantum theory fails to give an objective picture of the world that is unconnected to our role as observers .
The formulas of quantum theory correspond to our actions preparing experiments and measuring their outcomes .
Einstein objected to this because he believed strongly that physics should provide a picture of nature “ as it is in itself . ”
After 1930 , virtually all of Einstein ’s colleagues were certain the revolution was over and that physics was nearly complete .
Nearly alone in his stance , Einstein saw the quantum as only a stepping stone to the real thing , which he searched for the rest of his life .
Quantum theory was not the only theory that bothered Einstein .
Few people have appreciated how dissatisfied he was with his own theories of relativity .
Special relativity grew out of Einstein ’s insight that the laws of electromagnetism cannot depend on relative motion and that the speed of light therefore must be always the same , no matter how the source or the observer moves .
Among the consequences of that theory are that energy and mass are equivalent ( the now - legendary relationship E = mc2 ) and that time and distance are relative , not absolute .
Special relativity was the result of 10 years of intellectual struggle , yet Einstein had convinced himself it was wrong within two years of publishing it .
He rejected his theory , even before most physicists had come to accept it , for reasons that only he cared about .
For another 10 years , as the world of physics slowly absorbed special relativity , Einstein pursued a lonely path away from it .
Why ?
The main reason was that he wanted to extend relativity to include all observers , whereas his special theory postulates only an equivalence among a limited class of observers — those who are n’t accelerating .
A second reason was to incorporate gravity , making use of a new principle he called the equivalence principle .
This postulates that observers can never distinguish the effects of gravity from those of acceleration so long as they observe phenomena only in their immediate neighborhood .
By this principle he linked the problem of gravity with the problem of extending relativity to all observers .
Einstein was the only one who worried about these two problems .
Meanwhile , other physicists came up with ways to incorporate gravitational phenomena directly into special relativity .
This was the reasonable thing to do , for they were building directly on the success of the new theory Einstein had invented .
And they succeeded in making the theory consistent .
Moreover , their extensions of special relativity agreed with all experiments that had been done .
So why did Einstein reject it ?
His reason was that his colleagues ’ approach — incorporating gravity into special relativity rather than crafting a whole new theory — disagreed with his equivalence principle .
Einstein understood quickly that there was a key experiment that could distinguish between the incremental approach of the other physicists and his own , radical approach .
This was to measure the bending of light by the sun ’s gravity , an effect predicted by the equivalence principle .
A reasonable person might have waited to see how the experiment came out , and indeed , an opportunity to test the theory came in 1919 .
By that time Einstein had invented his second theory of relativity , which he called general relativity .
The experiment appeared to confirm the new theory ’s predictions .
The result was announced on the front pages of the world ’s newspapers , making Einstein the first scientist to be a star .
General relativity is the most radical and challenging of Einstein ’s discoveries — so much so that I believe the majority of physicists , even theoretical physicists , have yet to fully incorporate it into their thinking .
The flashy stuff , like black holes , gravitational waves , the expanding universe , and the Big Bang are , it turns out , the easy parts of general relativity .
The theory goes much deeper :
It demands a radical change in how we think of space and time .
All previous theories said that space and time have a fixed structure and that it is this structure that gives rise to the properties of things in the world , by giving every object a place and every event a time .
In the transition from Aristotle to Newton to special relativity , that structure changed , but in each case the structure remained fixed .
We and everything that we observe live in a space - time , with fixed and unchanging properties .
That is the stage on which we play , but nothing we do or could do affects the structure of space and time themselves .
General relativity is not about adding to those structures .
It is not even about substituting those structures for a list of possible new structures .
It rejects the whole idea that space and time are fixed at all .
Instead , in general relativity the properties of space and time evolve dynamically in interaction with everything they contain .
Furthermore , the essence of space and time now are just a set of relationships between events that take place in the history of the world .
It is sufficient , it turns out , to speak only of two kinds of relationships : how events are related to each other causally ( the order in which they unfold ) and how many events are contained within a given interval of time , measured by a standard clock ( how quickly they unfold relative to each other ) .
Thus , in general relativity there is no fixed framework , no stage on which the world plays itself out .
There is only an evolving network of relationships , making up the history of space , time , and matter .
All the previous theories described space and time as fixed backgrounds on which things happen .
The point of general relativity is that there is no background .
This point is subtle and elusive .
I was very fortunate to know the great astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar during his last years .
Chandra , as we called him , was the first to discover that general relativity implied that stars above a certain mass would collapse into what we now call a black hole .
Much later , he wrote a beautiful book describing the different solutions of the equations of general relativity that describe black holes .
As I got to know him , Chandra shocked me by speaking of a deep anger toward Einstein .
Chandra was upset that Einstein , after inventing general relativity , had abandoned this masterpiece , leaving it to others to struggle through it .
I now believe that Chandra partly missed the point , and he is certainly not alone .
The deepest point of general relativity is not that the universe may expand or that there are black holes .
To think this way is to believe that general relativity is just another step in the progression of Aristotle to Newton to special relativity .
Chandra , in his interest in the solutions of the theory , was , I fear––like so many others — reaching for a beautiful flower but missing the beauty of how it is that flowers come to be .
But Chandra was right that in spite of the great triumph general relativity represented , Einstein did not linger long over it .
For Einstein , quantum physics was the essential mystery , and nothing could be really fundamental that was not part of the solution to that problem .
As general relativity did n’t explain quantum theory , it had to be provisional as well .
It could only be a step towards Einstein ’s goal , which was to find a theory of quantum phenomena that would agree with all the experiments , but satisfy his demand for clarity and completeness .
Einstein imagined for a time that such a theory could come from an extension of general relativity .
Thus he entered into the final period of his scientific life , his search for a unified field theory .
He sought an extension of general relativity that would incorporate electromagnetism , thereby wedding the large - scale world where gravity dominates with the small - scale world of quantum physics .
He tried a variety of means such as adding new dimensions of space - time or loosening somewhat the mathematical structure of general relativity .
The irony is that some of these gambits worked , but they still led nowhere .
For it turns out , that unified theories are a dime a dozen .
There are many ways to generalize general relativity so as to incorporate the laws of electromagnetism .
Nor is it much harder , as has been done recently , to extend the theory a bit further to incorporate nuclear forces , and so have a unified theory of all the forces .
Indeed , the number of such unified theories keeps increasing .
Recent estimates based on results from string theory indicate there are more than 10100 distinct unified field theories .
Thus , it is as unclear now as it was for Einstein whether pursuing a unified field theory will lead to real progress in understanding nature .
One way to understand this story is to say that theoretical physics has finally caught up to Einstein .
While he was shunned in his Princeton years as he pursued the unified field theory , the Institute for Advanced Study where he worked is now filled with theorists who search for new variants of unified field theories .
It is indeed a vindication of sorts for Einstein because much of what today ’s string theorists do in practice is play with unified theories of the kinds that Einstein and his few colleagues invented .
The problem with this picture is that by the end of his life Einstein had to some extent abandoned his search for a unified field theory .
He had failed to find a version of the theory that did what was most important to him , which is to explain quantum phenomena in a way that involved neither measurements nor statistics .
In his last years he was moving on to something even more radical .
He proposed to give up the idea that space and time are continuous .
It is fair to say that while the idea that matter is made of atoms goes back at least to the Greeks , few before Einstein questioned the smoothness and continuity of space and time .
To one friend , Walter Dallenbäch , he wrote , “ The problem seems to me how one can formulate statements about a discontinuum without calling on a continuum as an aid ; the latter should be banned from the theory as a supplementary construction not justified by the essence of the problem , which corresponds to nothing ‘ real . ’ ”
However , Einstein made no progress with this new direction .
He complained that , “ we still lack the mathematical structure , unfortunately . ”
To another friend , H. S. Joachim , he wrote : “ It would be especially difficult to derive something like a spatio - temporal quasi - order from such a schema .
I cannot imagine how the axiomatic framework of such a physics would appear , and I do n’t like it when one talks about it in dark apostrophes .
But I hold it entirely possible that the development will lead there . ”
So what is Einstein ’s real legacy ?
Are any of us his followers ?
In this centennial year , there will be many who claim the mantle .
That includes the community of relativists , but many of them rarely look beyond the theory .
Instead they study it by finding solutions on computers or by looking for gravity waves .
There are also a few physicists who follow Einstein in rejecting quantum theory and in searching for an alternative .
Einstein would have been happy that some scientists agree with him , but he likely would have been critical that most work in that area ignores the problem of unification .
Some string theorists will claim to be Einsteinians , and certainly Einstein would have approved of their search for a unification of physics .
But here is how Brian Greene , in his last book , describes the state of the field : “ Even today , more than three decades after its initial articulation , most string practitioners believe we still do n’t have a comprehensive answer to the rudimentary question , What is string theory ? . . .
Most researchers feel that our current formulation of string theory still lacks the kind of core principle we find at the heart of other major advances . ”
Einstein ’s whole life was a search for a theory of principles .
It is hard to imagine he would have sustained interest in a theory for which , after more than 30 years of intensive investigation , no one is able to put forward any core principles .
He may in this regard have been happier with approaches to quantum gravity that stay closer to the core principles of relativity .
For example , loop quantum gravity preserves his discovery that space and time have no fixed background , and it also provides an answer to Einstein ’s questions of how to go beyond the continuum .
But Einstein would have found unacceptable all approaches to quantum gravity that take quantum mechanics as fundamental , including string theory and loop quantum gravity .
Einstein never wavered from his rejection of quantum mechanics .
His motive for making a unified field theory was not to extend the domain of quantum mechanics ; it was rather to find an alternative to quantum mechanics .
No research program that accepts quantum mechanics as a given can count itself to be within Einstein ’s legacy .
I think a sober assessment is that up until now , almost all of us who work in theoretical physics have failed to live up to Einstein ’s legacy .
His demand for a coherent theory of principle was uncompromising .
It has not been reached — not by quantum theory , not by special or general relativity , not by anything invented since .
Einstein ’s moral clarity , his insistence that we should accept nothing less than a theory that gives a completely coherent account of individual phenomena , cannot be followed unless we reject almost all contemporary theoretical physics as insufficient .
So is it possible to follow the path of Einstein ?
To do so , you can not be a crank ; you must be a well - trained professional physicist , literate in current theories and aware of their limitations , as he was .
And you must insist on absolute clarity in your own work , rather than follow any fad or popular direction .
Given the pressures of competition for academic positions , to follow Einstein ’s path is to risk the price that he paid : unemployment in spite of abundant and obvious talent and skill at the craft of theoretical physics .
In my whole career as a theoretical physicist , I have known only a handful of colleagues of whom it can truly be said have followed Einstein ’s path .
They are driven , as Einstein was , by a moral need for clear understanding .
In everything they do , these few strive continually to invent a new theory of principle that could satisfy the strictest demands of coherence and consistency without regard to fashion or the professional consequences .
Most have paid for their independence in a harder career path than equally talented scientists who follow the research agendas of the big professors .
Let us be frank and admit that most of us have neither the courage nor the patience to emulate Einstein .
We should instead honor Einstein by asking whether we can do anything to ensure that in the future those few who do follow Einstein ’s path , those who approach science as uncompromisingly as he did , have less risk of unemployment of the sort he suffered at the beginning of his career and less risk of the marginalization he endured at the end .
If we can do this , if we can make the path easier for those few who do follow him , we may make possible a revolution in science that even Einstein failed to achieve .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Analysts who cover broker Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. watched closely from the sidelines Monday , loath to add to market speculation that the firm may be the next major brokerage to falter .
Maintaining investor confidence will be key to keeping Lehman LEH , afloat , at least for now , according to BMO Capital Markets analyst George Lazarevski .
" Similar to Bear Stearns , the greatest risk for Lehman Brothers is the risk that once speculation begins , it becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy , and no level of liquidity will be sufficient , " he told investors Monday .
Lehman Chief Executive Richard Fuld said the Federal Reserve 's decision to start lending directly to brokerage firms improves their liquidity .
The Fed usually lends directly only to banks , but the central bank widened its reach in a historic move on Monday to include brokerages such as Lehman as well .
" The Federal Reserve 's decision to create a lending facility for primary dealers and permit a broad range of investment - grade securities to serve as collateral improves the liquidity picture , and from my perspective , takes the liquidity issue for the entire industry off the table , " Fuld said in a statement .
“ ' It 's not clear whether Lehman is in trouble , but I do n't think there 's a fire there . ' ” — Harvard Business School
Unlike banks , brokerage firms do n't have a base of retail customers who deposit cash into accounts , and until Monday they did n't have access to the Fed as lender of last resort .
That makes them more vulnerable to the waxing and waning of risk appetite in capital markets .
They also rely on the confidence of clients and counterparties to keep trading with them .
When rival Bear Stearns Cos. BSC , - 10.00 % lost that confidence last week , the firm 's business quickly unraveled , pushing it into the arms of JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , - 0.84 % and the Fed .
See related story .
Everyone 's nervous
Similar concerns roiled Lehman shares Monday , although experts tried to limit the damage by speaking carefully , hoping not to make matters worse for the firm .
" Just commenting on it seems to give it more credence , " said Samuel Hayes , the Jacob H. Schiff professor of investment banking , emeritus , at Harvard Business School .
" It 's not clear whether Lehman is in trouble , but I do n't think there 's a fire there . "
Shares of Lehman Brothers recovered more than half of their earlier losses of more than 40 % , and ended the day off about 19 % .
The move was still the biggest one - day drop in Lehman shares since the firm went public in 1994 , and reflected just how nervous investors are after being rattled by an 11th - hour bailout of Bear .
The roller - coaster ride experienced by Lehman showed how volatile the market can be , some analysts said , a major worry just days after the storied Bear Stearns was taken down .
" If market participants begin to fear that another bank is facing a liquidity crisis , we could see another collapse , " wrote Morningstar analyst Ryan Lentell in a research note .
" Rumors of problems at Bear gained traction because of the bank 's exposure to the residential - mortgage market , which has been in turmoil , " he said .
" The investment banks all have exposure to these asset classes , and as fear over further price declines in any one asset class escalates , it could lead to a run on another bank . "
Options traders are making big bets that Lehman stock will drop an additional 24 % by Thursday , when March options expire , Dow Jones Newswires reported .
Traders also are betting that the shares will continue to plummet over the next month .
But Deutsche Bank DB , - 1.89 % analyst Mike Mayo said Monday that fears of a Bear Stearns - like meltdown for brokerage Lehman Brothers are overblown .
" Lehman is not Bear , " he commented , adding that Lehman has more liquidity , more support from counterparties , a more - diversified franchise and a " seasoned and experienced " chief executive .
" While there is a chance that we have not factored in all the needed write - downs , we believe that this difference creates a reasonable margin of safety , " Mayo wrote in a research note .
Deutsche Bank maintained its " buy " rating on the stock .
Other market players were not so optimistic about the broker .
Early Monday , Moody 's Investors Service trimmed its outlook on the investment bank 's debt rating , heightening concerns about liquidity .
The ratings agency affirmed its A1 rating on the senior long - term debt of Lehman but lowered its outlook on the ratings to stable from positive .
Moody 's said its ratings action " recognizes that Lehman has navigated quite well to date through persistently volatile and challenging financial markets , the sharp marketwide decline in valuations across numerous asset classes , tight global - liquidity conditions and the strong headwinds facing Lehman 's ( and other securities firms ' ) core - earnings drivers . "
" However , these conditions have decreased the upward pressure on Lehman 's rating , and therefore a positive outlook is no longer warranted , " according to Moody's .
UBS also downgraded Lehman to neutral on concerns that the bank will see further trouble in the capital markets .
If the current losses hold throughout Monday 's session , it would easily be the stock 's biggest one - day percentage drop since they started publicly trading in May 1994 .
Previously , the biggest one - day percentage drop for Lehman shares was 18.6 % on April 14 , 2000 , in the thick of the dot - com meltdown .
Rival brokerages Morgan Stanley MS and Goldman Sachs Group GS , - 1.14 % also saw their shares significantly lower in premarket trading -- down nearly 7 % and nearly 8 % , respectively .
Another shoe to drop ?
Touching off the shivers on Wall Street , J.P. Morgan agreed to buy struggling brokerage Bear Stearns for $ 236 million , or $ 2 a share , in an unprecedented rescue supported by the Federal Reserve .
The Fed also moved to cut the discount rate to 3.25 % .
See related story .
Market rumors have pegged Lehman as the next investment house to face the same type of withering scrutiny that Bear Stearns came under last week .
How well Lehman will survive such a storm remains to be seen , several analysts said .
" The concern is that every Wall Street firm will be viewed in light of the Bear Stearns sale price , " Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics , said Sunday evening .
“ ' As fear over further price declines in any one asset class escalates , it could lead to a run on another bank . ' ” — Ryan Lentell , Morningstar
Other analysts seconded that opinion , saying that without going into too many specifics about Lehman 's core businesses , it is easy to see why the firm will face greater obstacles in the near future .
" There is no question that they are a well - managed shop , but this problem is much larger than Lehman , " said Mark Williams , who teaches finance at Boston University School of Management and used to be an official at the Federal Reserve .
" The Fed actions were great for Bear Stearns , but they did n't address the whole industry , " he added .
" Bernanke is going to need to act a lot less like a quarterback and a lot more like a facilitator . "
Williams commented that without further intervention from the Fed , only the strongest institutions will survive because the market is " gruesomely efficient " in deciding who will survive on the capital markets .
But investor confidence and access to liquidity are only some of the obstacles Lehman may face .
" During a crisis of confidence , earnings , book value and liquidity do n't matter much , " Citigroup analyst Prashant Bhatia wrote in a note Monday .
" Client and counterparties vote with their money , and if confidence breaks down rapid deterioration will likely follow . "
These are problems endemic to the industry , analysts said .
" Wall Street CFOs have known for over 20 years that the loss of confidence is a life - threatening risk for a securities firm , " Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz told investors .
" It is not bad trading decisions or credit losses that end the life of one of these institutions ; rather , it is the inability to roll over debt when it comes due , " he said .
" As such , liquidity risk has remained the Achilles heel of the securities firms . "
But Lehman faces different challenges than its rival firms due to its large mortgage operations and broader exposure .
" Company - specific risks include subpar performance in trading - related businesses , declining business performance as a result of losing talent , risk management and lack of financial liquidity in the event of shock - type events , " Bhatia said .
The firm already has been feeling the fallout from that lack of confidence .
The firm had a scare this weekend after published reports Sunday said that the Development Bank of Singapore was discontinuing all transactions with the bank .
However , both parties said Monday that those reports were false .
“ ' Client and counterparties vote with their money , and if confidence breaks down rapid deterioration will likely follow . ' ” — Prashant Bhatia , Citigroup
Lehman got some good news Friday , when it announced that a new credit facility was " substantially oversubscribed . "
The bank replaced its existing three - year credit facility with a $ 2 billion committed unsecured facility .
It said it was particularly encouraged by the large number of banks that participated in the facility -- more than 40 -- and by the actions of co-leaders J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 %
" We are extremely pleased with the success of the syndicated facility and view this as a strong signal from the market and our key bank relationships , " said Paolo Tonucci , Lehman 's global treasurer .
Citigroup analysts rated Lehman shares as " high risk " Sunday , saying the bank is particularly vulnerable to the macroeconomic environment , including " the strength of the economy and strength of the operating environments for investment banking , trading , origination and global financial asset values . "
The market echoed those worries , with analysts looking ahead to when Lehman reports first - quarter financial results before the market opens Tuesday .
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial have been expecting earnings of 72 cents a share , on average , with revenue pegged to drop more than 60 % from a year earlier .
Some analysts remain bearish on the stock , worried about continuing write - downs and the state of global credit markets worldwide .
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Meredith Whitney , for one , slashed her first - quarter profit estimate for Lehman to 50 cents a share .
Analysts also are anticipating that revenue will fall 34 % to $ 3.35 billion for the quarter .
Messy quarterly reports
Indeed , analysts and market players surveyed by FactSet Research expect all four of the largest U.S. investment banks to have suffered mightily in the first quarter , with earnings for Morgan Stanley , Goldman , Bear Stearns and Lehman to have been halved from the same period last year .
But Lehman has attempted to stay ahead of the curve when planning for 2008 , trimming its operations wherever it can and investing heavily in a well - publicized risk - management team .
The broker also cut nearly 4,000 jobs in the last year and now has around 28,600 employees .
The bank has said it aims to trim its total workforce by 5 % globally in the next 12 months .
The trend to downsize has been a major theme for the nation 's five largest investment banks , with both Goldman Sachs streamlining its work force and Morgan Stanley laying off more than 2,000 workers this year .
As part of that downsizing , published reports said Monday , Lehman has shut down its European credit - strategy team in London -- including reassigning David Brickman , who was head of European credit strategy , as well as Ben Bennett , previously director of European credit strategy .
Despite some market stabilization Monday , Hintz said that Sanford Bernstein is advising clients to stay out of the brokerage arena , at least for now .
" We would not recommend getting into the large - capitalization names at this time .
The unfortunate events at BSC will lead to sharply increasing funding pressure on the other four large - capitalization brokers in the near term , " he commented .
" Although [ Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs , Bear Stearns and Lehman ] have strong capital bases and capable corporate treasuries and repo desks , investing in the brokers now is a bet on a recovery of confidence in credit markets that are experiencing the worst turmoil in several decades . "
It is a lesson other corporate executives need to take to heart , Boston University 's Williams said .
" If executives think they can just stand up and say everything is OK until things get better , then they are wrong .
Everything is not OK .
They need to have a broader plan . "

Differential Forms
Differential forms are important concepts in mathematics and have ready applications in physics , but their nature is not intuitive .
In contrast the concept of vectors and vector fields can be easily grasped .
The purpose of this site is to explain the nature of differential forms , both the formal definitions and how they are used .
The first step is to assert that differential forms are related to vectors in a very subtle way .
They are , in fact , dual to vectors .
The meaning of this will be explained below .
First consider a vector space .
Roughly , a vector space is a set of entities such that the sum of any vectors is also a vector and the result of multiplying a vector by a scalar is also a vector .
A vector space could be the set of arrows in space having direction and magnitude .
But the set of solutions to a linear differential equations also constitutes a vector space because the sum of any two solutions is also a solution , as is a multiple of any solution .
A remarkable fact is that any vector space has a basis , meaning that there exists a subset of vectors in the space such that any vector in the space can be represented as a linear combination of members of the basis .
Thus the vector space can be considered to be ordered n-tuples of scalars involved in the linear combinations .
Formally the vector space is a set of four things , *( V , k , + , * ) where V is the set of vectors , K is the field of scalars involved in creating multiples of vectors , + is the function involved in adding two vectors and * is the binary function involved in multiplying a vector by a scalar .
Now consider the set of functions defined on V that have values in K ; i.e. , f: V → K .
Within this set of functions there are linear functions such that if V 1 and V 2 are vectors then f*( V 1 + V 2 ) = f*( V 1 ) + f *( V 2 ) and for any scalar k and any vector V , f *( k * V ) = kf *( V ) .
Such linear functions on vector spaces are called linear functionals .
The sum of two linear functionals f 1 and f 2 can be defined by *(f 1 +f 2 ) *( V ) = f 1 *( V ) + f 2 *( V ) where the addition on the right is addition in the field of scalars , K. Likewise for any linear function f and any scalar k their product can be defined as *( kf ) * ( V ) = kf *( V ) , again where the multiplication on the right is the multiplication of the scalar field .
What these definitions of addition of linear functionals and scalar multiplication of linear functions is that the set of linear functionals , with the scalar field and the definitions of addition and multiplication constitute a vector space .
The vector space of linear functionals over V is said to be dual to the vector space involving V .
For vector spaces with finite bases the dual spaces are not very exotic ; they are essentially the same as the original spaces .
If the original space is a finite dimensional column vector then the dual space to it is a space of row vectors of the same dimension .
There some infinite dimensional vector spaces that have dual spaces that are different in nature from the original space .
Differential forms are the dual spaces to the spaces of vector fields over Euclidean spaces .
Vector fields over some space X are a bit more complex than vector spaces of n-tuples .
At each point in the space X there is a vector , say F *( x , y , z ) .
This is equivalent to functions of the form f:X→V ; i.e. , functions which map every point of the space X into the vector space V .
The vector space of linear functionals over vector fields will have a basis .
Suppose the basis for the vector space V is denoted as *( i x , i y , i z ) , where i x is a unit vector in the positive x direction and so forth .
Suppose a basis for the vector space of linear functionals over V is denoted as *(d x , d y , d z ) .
The symbol d x denotes the linear functional which selects the x-component of any vector v ; i.e. , if v = v x i x +v y i y +v z i z then d x *( v ) =v x .
Likewise for d y and d z .
The application of these linear functionals to the basis vectors of V give :
d x *( i x ) =1 , d x *( i y ) =0 , d x *( i z ) =0 ,
d y *( i x ) =0 , d y *( i y ) =1 , d y *( i z ) =0 ,
d z *( i x ) =0 , d z *( i y ) =0 , d z *( i z ) =1 .
Thus the basis of the vector space of linear functionals over the vector space V is conjugate to the basis of V. *( d x , d y , d z ) is a basis , any linear functional w may be represented as w x d x +w y d y +w z d z .
The value of w *( v ) for any v=v x i x +v y i y +v z i z is w x v x +w y v y +w z v z .
If the basis for the linear functionals is written as *(* dx , *dy , * dz ) instead of *( d x , d y , d z ) nothing has changed .
In this slightly modified notation any linear functional w can be represented as w = w x * dx + w y *dy + w z * dz .
A vector field is a function over a region of three dimensional space that gives at each point a vector .
For a point P= * ( x , y, z ) let the vector be v*( P ) = v x *( P) i x +v y *( P ) i y +v z *( P ) i z .
The corresponding dual entity is a function over the region of three dimensional space which gives a linear functional at each point ; i.e. , w *( P ) = w x *( P ) * dx+w y *( P ) * dy+w z *( P ) * dz .
This is called a 1 - form , a special case of a differential form .
Thus a 1 - form is a field of linear functionals .
The next task is to define k - forms where k can be 0 , 2 or 3 as well as 1 .
However , at this point it should be noted that there are alternative approaches to defining differential forms .
One approach defines differential forms of the various dimensions in terms of symbolic expressions .
Let P denote *( x , y , z ) .
Then :
0 - forms are scalar functions of the form f*( P )
1 - forms are expressions of the form
f*( P)*dx+g*( P)*dy+h *( P) *dz
f *( P)*dx+g*( P ) * dy+h *( P ) * dz 2 - forms are expressions of the form
f*( P ) * dx*dy+g*( P)*dy* dz+h *( P)* dz*dx
f*( P ) * dx*dy +g*( P ) * dy * dz+h *( P ) * dz*dx 3 - forms are expressions of the form
f*( P)*dx*dy*dz .
A wedge *( ^ ) product of differential forms can be defined for these symbolic expressions .
Also the differenttiation of a k - form to produce a * ( k+1 ) - form is defined for these symbolic expressions .
This approach is consistent but the lack of a geometric interpretation of the symbolic expressions destroys motivation to learn this topic .
Another approach makes use of geometric concepts as follows :
0 - forms are scalar functions of the form f*( P )
1 - forms are linear functions , line integrals , defined for all oriented closed curves C ; i.e. ,
∫ C *( f *( P) *dx+ g *( P) *dy+g *( P ) *dz )
∫ *( f*( P)*dx+g*( P ) * dy+g *( P ) * dz ) 2 - forms are linear functions , surface integrals , defined for all oriented closed surfaces S ; i.e. ,
∫*( f*( P)* dx*dy +g *( P ) * dy * dz+h *( P ) * dz*dx )
∫*( f*( P)* dx*dy +g *( P ) * dy * dz+h *( P ) * dz*dx ) 3 - forms are linear functions , volume integrals , defined over all closed volumes V ; i.e. ,
∫f *( P)*dx*dy*dz .
Symbolically 2 - forms involve expressions of the form * dx*dy .
How can the expression * dx *dy be given some concrete , geometric meaning ?
Williamson , Crowell and Trotter in their Calculus of Vector Functions provide an answer .
They assert that * dx*dy is a linear function of order pairs of vectors such that for the vector pair *( v, w ) , * dx * dy * ( v,w ) is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the projections of v and w onto the xy - plane , as shown in the diagram below .
This sounds excessively abstruse but computationally it is quite simple , being the value of the determinant of a 2x2 matrix ; i.e. ,
| * dx *( v ) * dx *( w ) | | * dy *( v ) * dy * ( w ) |
| v 1 w 1 | | v 2 w 2 |
The value of the determinant is just v 1 w 2 - v 2 w 1 .
The meaning of * dy * dz and * dz*dx is given by analogous expressions so that the general definition of
* dx i * dx j *( v 1 , v 2 ) is given by :
| *dx i *( v 1 ) * dx i *( v 2 ) | | * dx j *( v 1 ) * dx j *( v 2 ) |
| v 1i v 2i | | v 1 j v 2 j |
It immediately follows from the properties of the determinant that if i=j the determinant is equal to zero .
Thus , * dx i * dx i equals the zero functional for all values of i .
It also follows that * dx j * dx i = -* dx i * dx j .
This approach can be generalized to give the definition of other basic k - forms .
General Definition of Differential Forms
Basic Forms
A k-form * dx i 1 * dx i 2 ...* dx i k 1 is the linear function over k - tuples of vectors *( v 1 , v 2 , ... , v 1 ) equal to the determinant of the matrix whose general term is * dx i * ( v j ) ; i.e. , the element in the i-th row , j - th column is the i-th component of the j - th vector , v ji .
General Forms
Roughly a k - form is the formal sum of functions over the space f *( P ) times the basic k - forms .
More properly a k - form is a vector whose components are functions over the space and the basis of these vectors is the basic k - forms .
With this founding of differential forms in geometry and analysis the formal expression approach to differential forms becomes a valuable and powerful method of computing wedge products and derivatives of differential forms .
It is all very beautifully tied together .
The Wedge Product of Differential Forms
From the definition in terms of a determinate it is seen than any n-tuple of differentials , such as * dx i * dx j or * dx i * dx j * dx k , is the zero linear functional if any index is repeated .
Furthermore if any two indices are interchanged the sign of the n-tuple is reversed .
Thus * dx* dx=*dy * dy= * dz * dz=0 and * dy * dx= - * dx*dy and so on .
The wedge product of two differential forms can be computed by creating their formal product and reducing it using the above relations .
For example , consider the product of y * dx + x2 * dy with z * dx + * dy - x* dz .
The formal product is given by :
*(y * dx + x2 *dy ) * ( z * dx + * dy - x* dz ) = yz* dx* dx+y* dx*dy- xy* dx*dz
+ x2z*dy*dx+x2*dy*dy-x3*dy*dz
= y* dx * dy - xy * dx*dz + x2z*dy * dx-x3* dy*dz
= *(y - x2z ) * dx*dy + x3 * dy * dz - xy * dx*dz .
The use of * dx*dy , * dy * dz and * dz * dx rather than * dx*dy , * dx * dz and * dy * dz or any other variation has the virture of creating a right handed set of basis vectors .
The result is usually expressed using the wedge notation ; i.e. ,
*(y * dx +x2*dy ) ^*( z * dx + * dy - x* dz ) =
*(y - x2z ) * dx*dy + x3 * dy * dz - xy * dx*dz .
The wedge product of a 0 - form , a scalar function , with another differential form iis just the algebraic product of the function and the differential form ; i.e. ,
*( f ^ ω ) = f ω
For example , if f=xz and ω = y * dx - x*dy then *( xy ^ *( y * dx - x*dy ) ) = xyz*dx - x2z*dy .
The Derivative of Differential Forms
The operation of taking the derivative of differential forms is defined recursively .
The derivative of a 0 - form , a scalar function f*( x , y,z ) over the space , is defined as
df = *( ∂f /∂*dx ) * dx + *( ∂f/∂*dy )
*dy
+ *( ∂f/∂*dz ) *dz .
This is called the gradient of f and is the base case for the recursive definition of the derivative .
The derivative of the sum and the wedge product of two differential 1 - forms , φ and ω , is given by the rules :
d *(φ + ω ) = dφ + dω
d *(φ ^ ω ) =*( dφ ^ ω ) - *( φ ^ d ω )
From these rules we quickly find that d*( dω ) =0 for any differential 1 - form ω because it can be consider the product of the constant function equal to 1 and itself .
Thus
d *( dω ) = d *( 1d ω ) = d*( 1^ ω ) =
d *( 1 ) ^ ω - *( 1^d *( d ω ) ) = - d*( d ω )
but d*( dω ) = - d *( dω ) can only be true if d*( d ω ) =0 .
In particular , since * dx=d * ( x ) , d*( * dx ) =0 and likewise d*( * dy ) =0 and d*(* dz ) =0 .
Here is how these rules would be applied to get the derivative of ω = xz*dx - y*dy .
dω = d *( xz *dx - y*dy )
= d*( xz*dx ) - d*( y*dy )
= *( d *( xz ) ^* dx - xzd * ( * dx ) )
- *(* dy^*dy - *( y^d *( * dy ) )
= *( z* dx+x* dz ) ^*dx - 0 ) - *( 0 - 0 )
= x*dz*dx = - x* dx*dz .
Although the definition of the derivative of the wedge product of 1 - forms is as given above this is not the general formula for the derivative of the wedge product of differential forms of arbitrary degree .
In particular , it would not hold for the case of 0 - forms ; i.e. , scalar - valued functions .
For scalar functions f and g :
d *( f^g ) = d *( fg ) = *( df ) g + f *( dg ) = df^g + f^dg
Also for the wedge product of a 0 - form f and a 1 - form ω we have
d *( f^ ω ) = d *( fω ) = df^ω + fdω .
Although it is not obvious from these special cases the proper definition of the derivative of the wedge product of an i-form φ and a j - form ω is :
d *( φ^ ω ) = *( dφ ) ^ ω + *(- 1) iφ^*( d ω )
which is the same as
d *( φ^ ω ) = *( dφ ) ^ ω +
*( - 1)deg * ( φ ) φ^ *( d ω )
General Commutativity Relation for the Wedge Product
Although it was found that for two 1 - forms , φ and ω φ^ω = - ω^φ , this is not the general relation for differential forms of arbitrary degree .
For an i-form φ and a j - form ω the commutativity relation is :
φ^ω = *(- 1) ij ω ^φ ,
which is the same as
φ^ω =
*( - 1) deg * ( φ ) deg * ( ω ) ω ^φ .
This formula may be explained by considering the process involved in interchanging an i-form of the form
* dx p 1 * dx p 2 ...* dx p i
with a j - form of the form
* dx q 1 * dx q 2 ...* dx q j .
The terms of the j - form have to be passed through the i-form one by one .
Each term of the j - form has to be interchanged with successive terms of the i-form .
One cannot jump * dx q 1 to the first position because that would change the order of the terms of the terms of the i-form .
Since each interchange reverses the sign and it requires i interchanges to pass one term of the j - form through the terms of the i-form the result is :
* dx q 1 * dx p 1 * dx p 2 ...* dx p i * dx q 2 ...* dx q j =
*(- 1)i*dx p 1 * dx p 2 ...* dx p i * dx q 1 * dx q 2 ...* dx q j
Since there are j terms that must be passed through the i-form the final sign will be
*(*( - 1 ) i ) j which is equal to
* ( - 1 ) ij .
The same sign would apply to each wedge product of the product terms in the wedge product of a general i-form with a general j - form .
General Formula for the Derivative of
the Wedge Product of Two Differential Forms
Let us start with the case of the product of two simple forms .
Let one differential form be fφ = f*dx i 1 ...* dx i p and and the other gω = g*dx j 1 ......* dx j q .
Thus *( f φ ) ^*( gω ) = fg * ( φ ^ ω ) .
The derivative is therefore
d *( *( f φ ) ^*( g ω ) ) =
d *( fg ) * ( φ^ ω ) =
[ Σ*( ∂f / ∂x i ) * dx i ) g +
f *( Σ*( ∂g / ∂x j ) * dx j ) ] * ( φ^ ω ) =
[*( *( Σ∂f / ∂x i ) φ ] ^*( gω + *( fΣ *( ∂g / ∂x j ) *dx i ) * ( φ^ ω )
The problem is the last term .
To put it in proper form we must pass each of the * dx j through φ by a sequence of interchanges .
This process results in a change of sign for each interchange .
The final result is then multiplied by *( - 1) deg * ( φ ) .
The final result is thus :
d *( *( f φ ) ^*( g ω ) ) =
[ *( Σ *( ∂f / ∂x i ) * dx i ) φ ] ^*( gω ) +
*(- 1) deg * ( φ *( f φ ) *( Σ *( ∂g / ∂x j ) * dx j ) ω =
* ( d *( f φ ) ^ *( gω ) +
*( - 1)deg * ( φ ) * ( f φ ) ^*( d * ( g ω ) )

BAGHDAD , April 8 ( Reuters ) - Iraqi authorities have imposed a one - day curfew on Baghdad for Wednesday , an official in the Baghdad operations command for Iraqi security forces said .
The official said cars and motorcycles would be banned from the streets of the Iraqi capital between 5:00 a.m. and midnight ( 0200 - 2100 GMT ) on Wednesday .
Wednesday is the fifth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad to U.S. forces , and followers of Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr had announced mass anti-American demonstrations .
But Sadr called off the planned protest earlier on Tuesday for security reasons .
Sadr 's Mehdi Army militia has been clashing with U.S. and Iraqi forces in Sadr City , a vast eastern Baghdad slum , for the past three days after fighting late last month in Baghdad and the Shi'ite south .

WASHINGTON — Ron Paul failed to translate an impressive fundraising operation into widespread support for his 2008 bid for the presidency , but the Lake Jackson Republican still may end up hitting pay dirt .
To further Paul 's Libertarian - leaning agenda , his campaign is exploring a novel way to use millions of dollars in leftover donations : setting up a for - profit publishing company that would focus on free - market economics and personal liberties — causes the Texas congressman holds dear .
Political finance experts say such a business venture funded with some $ 4 million in political cash would test the bounds of federal campaign finance regulations .
" I 've never heard of anyone taking their campaign money and putting it into a for - profit corporation , " said Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21 , an organization that advocates campaign finance reform .
FEC guidelines
Federal Election Commission spokesman said that former office - seekers have some leeway in using leftover campaign money , as long as they do n't benefit financially from the venture .
" There 's a provision that says you can use the funds for any lawful purpose , so long as it's not personal use for the candidate , " said FEC spokesman Bob Biersack .
But the election watchdog agency cannot enforce its own rules because a majority of its board seats are vacant , the result of a partisan stalemate on Capitol Hill .
A supply of donors
Political professionals say Paul 's mailing list is a potential gold mine if he rents those names to interest groups or other campaigns .
Jesse Benton , a spokesman for Paul , said the campaign has the names of 160,000 donors who have given an average of about $ 100 each .
Add the number of people who have signed up to receive campaign information , but have not donated money , and the e-mail list grows to 400,000 .
On the market , the list of 160,000 donors would probably fetch about $ 135 per 1,000 names for each use , or about $ 21,600 a pop , estimated Kevin Shuvalov , a partner in Olsen & Shuvalov , an Austin firm that does fundraising and voter contact mailings , including for Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign .
It may not sound like a lot , but Stephanie Catina , director of list services for Response World , a Richardson , Texas , list - services company said that good lists can be rented over and over .
Using the mailing list
For example , the list of American Heart Association donors has been passed around for years , she said .
In the political arena , Bob Dole 's 1996 presidential campaign list remains on the market .
Shuvalov expects
Paul 's list to get bigger and better .
" He 's still a congressman , and there is a movement , because as you know , down here in Texas , the Ron Paul guys took over a lot of the ( state ) senatorial district conventions , " he said .
" So clearly , whatever this is — this movement , this revolution , whatever you want to call it — it 's not over . "
The Paul presidential campaign already has rented its list twice — once to his Texas congressional re-election committee , which raised $ 1.4 million , according to CQ Moneyline , a site that tracks FEC records ; and once to incumbent Rep. Walter B. Jones , R - N.C. , who serves with Paul on the Republican Liberty Caucus , a group of Libertarian - minded lawmakers .
Benton said the campaign is being careful with its list because of the level of trust Paul has with his donors .
" If it 's going to be used by others , " he said , " it 's going to be used by the right people . "
Presidential lists , such as Paul's , are attractive because they include donors from across the country .
Because Paul has brought so many new participants into the presidential process , his list also would offer candidates a chance to expand their money network to nontraditional givers .
Additional options
Despite single - digit polling in the majority of primary states , Paul is sitting on about $ 4 million in campaign cash , Benton said .
The campaign is evaluating what to do with the extra money .
Benton said options include supporting like - minded candidates through Paul 's Liberty PAC ; donating leftover money to Paul 's FREE Foundation , the 501 ( c ) 3 organization that publishes his newsletter ; trying to influence public policy through a 501 ( c ) 4 nonprofit group ; or creating " something inventive and entrepreneurial " like a for - profit corporation to produce publications .
Federal guidelines stipulate that campaign funds can't be used for the candidate 's personal use , specifically things such as vacations , mortgage , rent or household items .
Funds also can't be used to seed a for - profit corporation that benefits an individual or shareholder .
However , that might not preclude Paul from creating a carefully structured for - profit corporation specifically designed for educational purposes .
And even if someone were to file a complaint against a candidate for misusing campaign funds , the FEC is hamstrung because it lacks sufficient members to take any action .
" It would just have to wait until we have four members , " FEC spokesman Biersack said .

China has a plan for using industrial espionage to turn their country into the mightiest industrial and military power on the planet .
For over two decades , China has been attempting to do what the Soviet Union never accomplished ; steal Western technology , then use it to move ahead of the West .
The Soviets lacked the many essential supporting industries found in the West ( most founded and run by entrepreneurs ) , and was never able to get all the many pieces needed to match Western technical accomplishments .
Soviet copies of American computers , for example , were crude , less reliable and less powerful .
Same with their jet fighters , tanks and warships .
China believes they can avoid the Soviet error by making it profitable for Western firms to set up factories in China , where Chinese managers and workers can be taught how to make things right .
At the same time .
China allows thousands of their best students to go to the United States to study .
While most of these students will stay in America , where there are better jobs and more opportunities , some will come back to China , and bring American business and technical skills with them .
Finally , China energetically uses the " thousand grains of sand " approach to espionage .
This involves China trying to get all Chinese going overseas , and those of Chinese ancestry living outside the motherland , to spy for China , if only a tiny bit .
This approach to espionage is nothing new .
Other nations have used similar systems for centuries .
What is unusual is the scale of the Chinese effort .
Backing it all up is a Chinese intelligence bureaucracy back home that is huge , with nearly 100,000 people working just to keep track of the many Chinese overseas , and what they could , or should , be to trying to grab for the motherland .
It begins when Chinese intelligence officials examining who is going overseas , and for what purpose .
Chinese citizens cannot leave the country , legally , without the state security organizations being notified .
The intel people are not being asked to give permission .
They are being alerted in case they want to have a talk with students , tourists or business people before they leave the country .
Interviews are often held when these people come back as well .
Those who might be coming in contact with useful information are asked to remember what they saw , or bring back souvenirs .
Over 100,000 Chinese students go off to foreign universities each year .
Even more go abroad as tourists or on business .
Most of these people were not asked to actually act as spies , but simply to share , with Chinese government officials ( who are not always identified as intelligence personnel ) whatever information they obtained .
The more ambitious of these people are getting caught and prosecuted .
But the majority , who are quite casual , and , individually , bring back relatively little , are almost impossible to catch .
Like the Russians , the Chinese are also using the traditional methods , using people with diplomatic immunity to recruit spies , and offering cash , or whatever , to get people to sell them information .
This is still effective , and when combined with the " thousand grains of sand " methods , brings in lots of secrets .
The final ingredient is a shadowy venture capital operations , sometimes called Project 863 , that offers money for Chinese entrepreneurs who will turn the stolen technology into something real .
No questions asked .
If you can get back to China with the secrets , you are home free and potentially very rich .
But there are some legal problems .
When the Chinese steal some technology , and produce something that the Western victims can prove was stolen ( via patents and prior use of the technology ) , legal action can make it impossible , or very difficult , to sell anything using the stolen tech , outside of China .
For that reason , the Chinese like to steal military technology .
This kind of stuff rarely leaves China .
And in some cases , like manufacturing technology , there 's an advantage to not selling it outside of China .
Because China is still a communist dictatorship , the courts do as they are told , and they are rarely told to honor foreign patent claims .
SAO PAULO ( Reuters ) - Brazil ’s military will regulate environmental , religious and other foreign groups working in the Amazon region under a law being drafted to assert sovereignty over the often lawless rainforest , the defense minister said on Thursday .
“ There is this concept that the Amazon is some free place for anyone , but the Amazon is sovereign Brazilian territory , ” Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said at a media briefing .
Many international non-governmental organizations , such as the environmental group Greenpeace , have offices in the Amazon region and campaign to halt the destruction of the rainforest by loggers and agricultural interests .
Human rights groups work to help Indians and peasants in an vast area where violent land seizures are common .
The 7 million sq km ( 1.7 billion acre ) Amazon Basin is home to an estimated one - third of all species on Earth .
But Brazil ’s booming economy , soy farming and cattle ranching has put pressure on land prices and fueled deforestation .
Justice Minister Tarso Genro said on Wednesday that many NGOs were involved in bio-piracy and were trying to influence Indian culture to expropriate land .
The justice and defense ministries plan to send a new Foreigners Bill to Congress in June to curb NGOs from serving as fronts for illegal activities in the Amazon .
It would require foreign individuals and groups to get permission from the Justice Ministry and register with the regional military command .
If the foreigners were working without approval or in an illegal way , the Justice Ministry could revoke visas , deport and fine individuals and groups between 5,000 and 100,000 reais ( $ 3,000 and $ 60,000 ) .
Greenpeace was not immediately available to comment on the proposed law .
The Brazilian government is sensitive to outside criticism of its policy in the Amazon , where there is little law enforcement to stop deforestation , land grab schemes and the exploitation of resources .
The armed forces have also been preoccupied by hypothetical scenarios of an invasion and occupation of the Amazon by a stronger foreign power .
“ We are not aware of any pending threat .
We have no border disputes with our neighbors , ” Jobim said .
“ But why wait until after something happens ?
We need to be prepared to protect our resources . ”
To decry the upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto IV , Jack Thompson sent a message to the mother of Take - Two Chairman Strauss Zelnick , according to a report by Shacknews .
The email is provocative , to say the least .
Not only does it say Mr. Zelnick is " like the Hitler Youth , " it also attributes the deaths of three Alabama policemen and " a recent plethora of cop killings " to prior entries in the GTA series .
Game |Life contacted Mr. Thompson earlier today and were informed that the email was actually issued to Zelnick 's lawyer .
This would be in following with a prior settlement that prevents Mr. Thompson from contacting Take - Two , unless he does so through legal counsel .
" I sent it to Strauss Zelnick 's attorney .
I would never send it to his mother , " Mr. Thompson told me .
I 've specifically been avoiding passing any judgement on the email ; Instead , I offer you all the chance to form your own opinions .
The email sent by Mr. Thompson can be found verbatim directly below :
" Mrs. Zelnick
Strauss Zelnick , Take - Two Chairman ’s Mother
New York , New York Via e-mails to intermediaries
Re : Your Son , Strauss Zelnick
Dear Mrs. Zelnick :
Your son , as you may know ( or maybe you do n’t know ) , is Chairman of Take - Two Interactive Software , Inc. , whose most popular video games are the Grand Theft Auto murder simulator games banned in some countries but sold to children here .
Your son last week was reported to have said the following about Grand Theft Auto IV , due to be released Tuesday , April 29 :
" We ’ve already received numerous [ GTA IV ] reviews , and to a one , they are perfect scores .
My mom could n’t write better reviews … "
Taking your son ’s thought , I would encourage you either to play this game or have an adroit video gamer play it for you .
Some of the latter gamers are on death row , so try to find one out in the civilian population who has n’t killed someone yet .
What you will see in your son ’s game , if this iteration of GTA is anything like its predecessors , is incredible interactive violence aimed at police officers ( whom you can shoot in the head and see the blood spray ) , innocent bystanders ( whom you can run over with your car just for the heck of it ) , and of course the plentiful female prostitutes you can have sex with and then filet with a knife or stomp with your feet in order to get your money back .
Experts note that the recent plethora of cop killings is caused in part by your darling son ’s entrepreneurial energy .
There are three policemen dead in Alabama because of Grand Theft Auto .
I was on 60 Minutes about it .
I hope Strauss has provided you with a flat screen tv to see the grief of the bereaved families that fills the screen .
The pornography and violence that your son trafficks in is the kind of stuff that most mothers would be ashamed to see their son putting into the hands of other mothers ’ children , but , hey , your son Strauss has recently assured the world that he is " a Boy Scout , everybody knows that . "
I ’d love to see the merit badges that Scout Troop handed out .
Is there a Ted Bundy merit badge ?
If so , your loving son deserves one now .
It should be red and green , for obvious reasons .
With Passover having just come and gone , it is appropriate to note the following from the Old Testament , Proverbs 22:6 :
" Train up a child in the way he should go : and when he is old , he will not depart from it . "
Mrs. Zelnick , did you train up your son , Strauss , to make millions of dollars by pushing Mature - rated video games to children ?
Any kid can go right to little Strauss ’ corporate web site and buy GTA IV with no age verification .
Strauss is even marketing the new Grand Theft Auto IV on World Wrestling Entertainment tv shows seen by millions of kids .
If you trained up Strauss to do this , then shame on you .
But maybe the explanation for your son ’s corporate sociopathy is to be found in Old Testament Proverb 29:15 :
" The rod and reproof give wisdom : but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame . "
Maybe you , Mrs. Zelnick , were so taken by your handsome son that you spared the rod and spoiled the child .
That would explain why he has brought you , by the way he presently acts , " to shame . "
There ’s another mother you would do well to talk to .
Mrs. Crump in Alabama had a son who was a police officer .
He ’s now dead because a teenaged boy unwittingly trained himself to kill him on Grand Theft Auto : Vice City .
She has a grief she carries every day that only a mother can know .
There are other such mothers in the heartland of America whose inhabitants your son simply sees as commercial targets .
Your son , this very moment , is doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA IV to teen boys in the United States , a country in which your son claims you raised him to be " a Boy Scout . "
More like the Hitler Youth , I would say .
Happy Mother ’s day , Mrs. Zelnick , which this year is May 11 , two weeks after your son unleashes porn and violence upon other mothers ’ boys .
I ’m sure you ’re very proud .
Sincerely , Jack Thompson "
An hour after Mr. Thompson sent along the above message , he also pointed out to me a number of Biblical references dealing with John The Baptist 's issues with Herod in the New Testament – the same references he mentioned in his email .
According to Mr. Thompson , the following passages further illustrate his argument and draw parallels between his own actions and those of John The Baptist .
Please draw your own conclusions :

Karina ( left ) surrendered in the face of relentless army offensives A leading commander of the Farc rebels in Colombia has surrendered to the authorities , officials say .
Nelly Avila Moreno , known as Karina , was blamed for a string of murders and abductions , and for extortion in the north - western Antioquia region .
Her surrender is a coup for President Alvaro Uribe who made her a priority target for the security forces in 2002 , the BBC's Jeremy McDermott says .
Farc has been fighting to overthrow the government for more than 40 years .
Karina was " nearly dying of hunger " when she and another guerrilla , known as Michin , handed themselves in , Colombian Defence Minister Juan Manuel Santos said .
" We have been after this woman who did such damage to Antioquia and the whole region of Uraba for a long time , " Mr Santos told RCN Radio .
$ 800,000 reward Karina , who is in her 40s , had a fearsome reputation in Antioquia , and many businessmen and ranchers suffered extortion , kidnapping and murder at her hands , our correspondent says .
None doubted her fighting prowess and she has the wounds to prove it : she has lost an eye in combat , has scars across her face and a bullet wound on one of her arms .
In 2002 , a reward of more than $ 800,000 ( £ 409,000 ) was placed on her head .
Our correspondent says Karina was an example to the women in the rebel army , who make up more than a third of the ranks of Farc , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia .
Her immediate boss Ivan Rios , a member of the Farc ruling seven - man secretariat , was murdered in March by one of his bodyguards .
The bodyguard chopped off Rios 's hand in order to prove to the authorities he had killed the commander and so collected a reward in excess of $ 1 m .
Since then , Karina has been in sole command of the Farc division in Antioquia .
Colombian media reports say in the wake of Rios 's killing , this division began to disintegrate and faced a sustained army offensive .
Two weeks ago , President Uribe sent a public message to Karina in which he guaranteed her safety if she handed herself in .
The governor of Antioquia , Luis Alfredo Ramos , was quoted by local media as saying that Karina 's family had also urged her to surrender .

What are these ?
George Stephanopoulos said this morning that “ this nomination fight is over . ”
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5sX-WakFq8]
Then what the hell is Hillary doing staying in the race ?
Fighting for Florida and Michigan , even though we learned last night that even if you just give Hillary her “ wins ” in FL and MI she still loses the nationwide delegate count and vote count to Obama ?
There are simply no more excuses for why Hillary is staying in the race .
She ca n’t catch up .
Even after getting thumped with Rev Wright for two weeks , Obama still “ routed ” her in North Carolina ( that ’s ABC ’s word ) , and she only barely won Indiana , a state she was going to win handily .
It ’s now time for the SuperDelegates , and for Hillary ’s surrogates and staff , to hold an intervention .
She is in the race to hurt Obama , to make sure he does n’t win in the fall against McCain , so that she can say “ I told you so ” and then run again in 2012 .
It ’s over .
Hillary lost .
It ’s time for the SuperDs and her staff to stage a mutiny .
OLPC Faces Growing Competition , And That 's A Good Thing
from the like - it - or - not dept
The Christian Science Monitor has an interesting story looking at the rise of dirt - cheap laptops and the potential impact these laptops will have in developing countries .
It gives a fair amount of attention to the One Laptop Per Child project , which was obviously one of the early players in this space .
I 've had my share of criticisms of the OLPC project , but one thing I do have to give them credit for is that their XO laptop seems to be very competitive with the laptops being offered by commercial companies .
Most of them , such as the Asus Eee PC , are priced in the $ 299 to $ 399 range ; it appears that no one has yet figured out how to produce a full - featured laptop at that magic $ 100 price point .
The thing this article does highlight , though , is that OLPC is operating in an increasingly competitive market .
OLPC head Nicholas Negroponte says " I do n't want to compete with anyone , " but he 's going to have to compete whether he likes it or not .
One of the most intriguing competitors is Ncomputing , which is trying to resurrect the dumb terminal model for people on a shoestring budget .
Ncomputing uses a cheap ( $ 350 ) PC as a server to drive a bunch of ridiculously cheap ( $ 70 ) terminals .
Dumb terminals are almost as old as the computing industry itself , but getting the terminals to be this cheap certainly opens things up to new markets by bringing hardware costs within reach of that magic $ 100 price point .
Of course , these dumb terminals wo n't be as portable as an XO laptop , and they likely require more tech support .
Schools in developing countries will have to weigh those disadvantages against the XO 's higher price and decide what will serve their students best .
And that 's the way it should be : more competition means that end users will be able to choose the computing solution that best fits their unique circumstances and budget .

Mr Ambani is one of India 's most powerful businessmen
Anil Ambani was charged by the police in northern Uttar Pradesh state with " insulting a religion or faith " .
Mr Ambani is one of India 's most powerful businessmen .
A statement released by his mobile telephone network , Reliance Communications , said that it was not responsible for text - messaged jokes .
" SMS jokes are provided by a third party vendor to the subscribers of telecom operators on a subscription basis , " a company spokesman said .
" The vendor is responsible for the content provided .
The vendor has already apologised to the subscribers as also to the company . "
' Insulting '
A local Sikh leader filed a complaint against Mr Ambani after the joke first began to circulate .
Mr Rajendra Singh Bagga said in his complaint that the joke was being sent by text on Mr Ambani 's Reliance Communications mobile telephone network .
" We are a martial race .
We fought for defending Hinduism and this joke is very insulting , " Mr Bagga said .
A police official told the BBC that insulting a religion or faith could carry a punishment of three years in prison or a fine , if proved .
Earlier , members of the Sikh community in the city of Meerut held protests against the network allegedly circulating the joke .
Reports said that the joke had been sourced from a website well known for its collection of jokes around the Sikh community .
Community leaders say that Mr Ambani should apologise for circulating a " disgusting " joke .
But many others say that the registration of a criminal case against the businessman could have a political dimension .
Anil Ambani is known to be close to the opposition Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh , while the complainant Mr Bagga is known to be close to the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) chief minister , Ms Mayawati .
After coming to power this summer , Ms Mayawati 's government swiftly cast doubt over the future of a special economic zone Anil Ambani is planning in the state .
Mr Ambani's Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group is among India 's top three private business houses with interests in communications , financial services , electricity , infrastructure and entertainment .
A group of Israeli technology and defense firms are working on what could become the world 's first robotic aircraft for evacuating , and even treating , soldiers injured on the battlefield .
Let 's just hope the technology is a little slicker than the concept art ( right ) .
Israel 's Fisher Institute for
Air and Space Strategic Studies is working with local techies and arms - makers to build " MedUAV , " a combination of ducted - fan flying drone and robotic ambulance .
According to * Defense News ' * Barbara Opall - Rome , the Institute is hoping – hoping – to start test flights in 24 months .
Eventually , the idea is to carry up to four passengers at speeds of 150 knots and heights of up to 10,000 feet .
( If the whole thing looks retro-futuro familiar , that 's because Urban Aeronautics , makers of this concept drone , is one of the companies behind the robo- medevac . )
Six of the 119 soldiers killed in Israel's
33 - day war with Hezbollah might have survived , if the Israeli Defense Forces " had been able to evacuate casualties within the so - called ' golden hour , ' when their chances for recovery were relatively high .
But because the IDF could not thoroughly cleanse urban areas of hidden terrorists and concealed rocket - launching squads , the Israel Air Force often could not dispatch medical evacuation helicopters upon demand , " * Defense News * notes .
The Fisher Institute 's concept is to put together a relatively simple UAV , or unmanned aerial vehicle , at first – and then follow with something that can also drive around a battlefield , picking up the wounded .
The flying car becomes a robotic ambulance , in other words .
Program officials here said fast track MedUAVs will be operated in multiple modes , depending on the danger .
" The problem is that if you have one critically injured patient in the middle of a village , you have to risk the lives of at least three others to go in and evacuate , " [ the Institute 's Eran ]
Schenker said .
Historically , according to the IDF medical specialist , some 40 percent of paramedics and first responders are injured or killed en route to saving patients .
To drive down those statistics , the MedUAV will operate in conventional modes
­
with pilot , medic and assisting crew member to the outer extent of the designated secure zone .
The aircraft will then land , discharge all but a single medic , and fly the rest of the way to a forward evacuation point by remote control ...
The autonomous landing , uploading of the patient and takeoff will take no more than 45 seconds , according to
Fisher Institute officials .
In very dangerous environments , the fast - tracked MedUAV could be operated completely by remote control , with a doctor sitting at a faraway command trailer alongside the remote vehicle operator .
While the pilot operates the air vehicle , the doctor will use sensors and video and voice communications to interact with the patient .

Technical challenges include " intelligent autonomous flight behavior , sensor integrated guidance and control to enable flight in complex terrain , fully autonomous selection ... of suitable landing locations , dual mode

In short , way more than just concept art .
Last year in our Web Analytics Shootout report we discussed the effect that Javascript placement has on the collection of analytics data .
For example , you can place your analytics Javascript at the top of you page ( right after the opening < BODY > tag , or even in the header ) , or at the bottom of your page ( right before the closing </ BODY > tag ) .
Recently , we tested this again , and this article will provide the results of that test .
Shootout Results for Javascript Delay
Within the Web Analytics Shootout we conducted a test using an IndexTools tracking pixel at the top of the file and IndexTools tracking Javascript at the bottom of the file .
We observed that the tracking pixel was seeing 2 % to 4 % more traffic than the Javascript , and we measured a delay between the execution of the tracking pixel and the Javascript of 1.4 seconds .
Based on that , we theorized that a small number of people were coming to the site staying long enough for the tracking pixel to execute , but leaving before the site before the analytics Javascript executed .
It was a reasonable theory , but the test was not sufficiently rigorous , because the counting methods for the tracking pixel and the Javascript are not identical .
New Test Methodology
With the help of Dennis Mortensen and the IndexTools team , we set up a more disciplined test .
In this test , we placed Javascript both at the top and the bottom of the web pages for two sites ( Tool Parts Direct and City Town Info ) .
The scripts were basically identical , except they fed their data into 2 different IndexTools accounts .
This allowed us to more accurately measure the impact of placement on counting of visitors to the site .
While we implemented the two scripts sitewide , we focused our analysis on the Page Views to the home page .
The reason for this is that one key element of the study was to measure the delay between the execution of the two scripts .
This would be hard to do in a rigorous manner across all the pages of the two sites , each of which is quite large and has highly varied types of pages .
However , a specific high traffic page is easier to measure with some precision .
It should be noted that there are still some issues as the current traffic load on the site may also be a factor in the JavaScript delay .
We have tried to address this by measuring the Javascript delays at different times of day when the sites were under varied loads to provide for a range of times and delays .

Get Informed
Our results in this test confirmed what we saw in the initial Shootout report .
Here is the raw data for City Town Info :
Here are the raw results for Tool Parts Direct :
Here are the definitions for my cryptic labels in the results :
Bottom Page Views :
The number of page views counted by the JavaScript at the bottom of the page ( just before the </ BODY > tag ) .
Top Page Views :
The number of page views counted by the JavaScript at the top of the page ( just after the < BODY > tag ) .
Delta : Top Page Views – Bottom Page Views
Min JS Delay –
The shortest time we measured between the execution start of the top Javascript and the execution start of the bottom Javascript .
Max JS Delay –
The longest time we measured between the execution start of the top Javascript and the execution start of the bottom Javascript .
Average JS Delay –
The average time we measured between the execution start of the top Javascript and the execution start of the bottom Javascript .
As you can see , there is once again some loss of data in the results .
So we have confirmed our theory that we formulated in the original Shootout report .
In addition , with this test , you can see how the longer delay that you see on Tool Parts Direct resulted in an increase in lost page views from 2.42 % to 4.53 % .
Therefore it is reasonable to expect that a slower loading page would see a larger impact .
Significance
As any practitioner of analytics will tell you , the Data Quality Sucks , Let ’s Just Get Over it ( well maybe they wo n’t all use Avinash ’s words , but they will tell you essentially the same thing ) .
The bottom line in analytics remains that it is its relative measurement capabilities that matter the most .
In other words , you need to focus on trends in the data .
For example , if you make a set of changes to your site you want to measure the scope of the impact those changes had .
This is simply done by looking at your data before and after the changes were made .
If the metrics you chose to look at improved , then it ’s a sure bet that the changes you made will help your business .
This is what is so wonderful about web analytics – you get much richer data than is available to measure the results of traditional marketing campaigns .
However , removing sources of error is a good and smart thing to do .
An error of 4.53 % is not insignificant , and slower loading pages will likely see larger errors .
In addition , this source of error is easily eliminated , by placing your analytics Javascript at the top of your page .
One downside to this is if the web analytics vendor ’s server goes down for some period of time , it will prevent your page from loading .
While this is a rare event , it is a definite bummer when it happens .
This problem does not exist when you place the Javascript at the bottom of your page , because your page load has completed ( other than running the Javascript ) when that Javascript finally executes .
If the vendor ’s server is down , the user can still see the complete page on your site , and click on the next link , and do whatever they came to do .
Suggested Action(s )
Our suggestion would be that if your page load is normally pretty snappy ( total page load time of under 3 or 4 seconds ) , then keep your Javascript at the bottom , and remove any risk related to analytics vendor downtime .
The small loss of data you see in this scenario should not be a significant factor in the value of your analytics data .
But , if your page load time is a bit slower ( 4 seconds or more ) , you may want to consider placing your analytics Javascript at the top of your web page .
Your data loss will be larger , and also the nature of the lost data may start to differ .
When someone comes to your site , and wo n’t wait 3 or 4 seconds , this is most likely due to a complete lack of interest that the person has in what they saw there .
Of course , even pages that normally load quickly can have moments when they wo n’t load .
Your web server could be down , for example .
The nature of the lost data in this scenario is largely related to situations you ca n’t influence .
But , as the total time of delay scales up , you start getting situations where someone sees the link they want on your page while it is still partially loaded .
You might not want to lose the ability to track those people .
For example , they may be coming to your site from a PPC campaign .
These recommendations also presume that your analytics Javascript is reasonably fast in executing ( less than a second ) .
If for some reason you have analytics Javascript that normally takes more than a second to execute , you should be a lot more hesitant to move it towards the top of your page , because it can become a factor in customer perception of your site ( because they perceive responsiveness of the site based on when they begin to see the content on screen ) .
The creation of the next hot toy or snack is often a long one , involving lots of time and market research .
But did you know that the ever - popular Silly Putty , the Slinky and the Popsicle were all invented accidentally ?
Silly Putty
The invention of Silly Putty started out scientifically .
During World War II , the United States government was in dire need of a substitute for rubber to use on such things as boots and airplane tires .
They asked their engineers to experiment with silicone to find this synthetic rubber .
In 1944 , a General Electric engineer named James Wright added boric acid to silicone oil and ended up inventing what became Silly Putty .
However , before it was Silly Putty , it was nothing .
Though it was elastic and bounced , it was n't sufficient as a rubber substitute and was put aside .
It was n't until 1949 that Silly Putty realized its true potential .
It had attracted the attention of a toy store owner named Ruth Fallgatter .
She teamed up with a marketing consultant named Peter Hodgson to find a creative use for the putty .
It was first marketed to adults and then became a toy for children .
The rest is history .
Despite the rationing of silicone brought on by the Korean War , Silly Putty persevered and is now one of the world 's most popular toys .
Slinky
The Slinky was also invented by a engineer during World War II .
Richard James was a naval engineer with the US Navy .
One day in 1943 , he was working with torsion springs when one tumbled to the floor .
To James ' surprise , the spring kept moving end - over - end across the floor .
This fascinated James , and , upon returning home , he and his wife Betty decided to market this invention as a toy .
They developed a similar spring , coiling a steel ribbon into a spiral , named it " Slinky " , and began production of this newly - invented toy in 1945 .
Like Silly Putty , the Slinky is n't complicated or hard to use - a secret to its success .
More than two million toys have been sold since its invention , and the original design has only changed once .
The Popsicle
Unlike the Slinky and Silly Putty , the Popsicle was n't invented by an engineer as a byproduct of research .
The Popsicle , one of history 's favourite frozen snacks , was accidentally invented by an 11 - year - old boy .
At the turn of the 20th century , soda water powder mixed with water was a common drink .
Young Frank Epperson began to mix this drink for himself one day in 1905 , but instead of drinking it , left it on his back porch overnight .
Though he lived in California , temperatures reached a record low that night and , the next day , Epperson found his drink , frozen , with the stirring stick still inside .
This was interesting enough to a child , but it was n't until 1923 that Epperson thought he could sell his accidental invention as a snack .
He began selling his invention , then called " Epsicles " , in seven flavours .
The name was changed to the now - familiar " Popsicle " , and an estimated three million are sold each year , in more than 30 flavours .
Pretty good for a forgetful kid !

The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Fred von Lohmann sez , " Agreeing with EFF 's amicus brief , a federal court in Boston in a 52 - page ruling concludes that ' merely exposing music files to the internet is not copyright infringement . '
The Boston court disagrees with a ruling in New York on the same day , which found that a mere ' offer to distribute ' a song could violate copyright , even if no one took you up on it .
Obviously , this is a fight that 's not over yet . "
EFF filed an amicus brief in this case ( formerly known as Atlantic v. Does 1 - 21 ) , and our arguments appear to have found a more receptive audience in Boston that they did in New York City ( the judge thanks us for our participation on page 11 ) .
The 52 - page ruling is the most extensive analysis yet of the recording industry 's " making available " argument , which claims that you infringe copyright merely by having a song in your shared folder , even if no one ever downloads it .
As we discussed yesterday , a key issue is whether a mere " offer to distribute " is enough to infringe the distribution right , in light of the fact that a mere offer can be enough to constitute " publication . "
Unlike the court in Elektra v. Barker , the judge in London - Sire v. Doe concludes that " distribution " and " publication " are not identical — " even a cursory examination of the statute suggests that the terms are not synonymous . "
If you are interested in the details , the court 's analysis is highly illuminating ( p. 24 - 27 ) , touching on a number of earlier rulings , such as Hotaling v. Church of Jesus Christ of Letter - Day Saints and A &M v. Napster ( copyright nerds will recognize those as pivotal decisions in this area ) .
It is the world 's fifth poorest nation with no prisons and few police .
Now this small west African failed state has been targeted by Colombian drug cartels , turning it into a transit hub for the cocaine trade out of Latin America and into Europe .
Grant Ferrett and Ed Vulliamy tell the remarkable story of how the cocaine cavalry arrived three years ago and transformed the life of Guinea - Bissau
The roads outside the X Club nightspot in Bissau , capital of the world 's fifth poorest country , are cracked and pot-holed .
They have not been repaired since they were torn up by the tracks of military vehicles during Guinea - Bissau 's civil war of the late 1990s .
But the cars that are parked outside - Porsche and Audi four - wheel drives - would n't look out of place in the wealthiest quarters of London .
Inside , the music is thumping Europop , a beer costs more than twice the average daily income of a dollar a day .
Many of the clubbers , though , are knocking back the imported whisky , which costs up to $ 80 a bottle .
One of the regulars points out the people who represent the various stages of the cocaine supply chain from South America via Guinea - Bissau in West Africa to the UK and the rest of Europe .
' He 's a pretty big dealer , and that 's one of his security guys .
That guy there thinks he 's big news but he 's just small - time .
That woman is a mule .
She 's been to Europe a couple of times .
Down a street of elaborate colonial - style buildings is Ana 's restaurant .
Beneath red -tiled roofs , giant candles flicker in the gentle , humid evening breeze - it could be mistaken for an exotic tourist destination .
But ' the only visitors we get are the Colombians ' , sighs Ana , ' this country is being destroyed by drugs .
They 're everywhere .
A few weeks ago , the man who used to be my gardener knocked at the door and offered to sell me 7 kg of cocaine . '
Among the destitute locals are scores of wealthy , gaudy Colombian drug barons in their immodest cars , flaunting their hi-tech luxury lifestyle , with beautiful women on their arms .
Outside Bissau city are exclusive Hispanic - style haciendas with wide verandahs , turquoise swimming pools and gates patrolled by armed guards .
By day , Guinea - Bissau looks like the impoverished country it is .
Most people cannot afford a bus fare , never mind a four - wheel drive .
There is no mains electricity .
Water supplies are restricted to the wealthy few , and landmark buildings such as the presidential palace remain wrecked nine years after the end of the war .
But this wreck of a country is what the UN - which declared war last week on celebrity cocaine culture - calls the continent 's ' first narco - state ' .
West Africa has become the hub of a flow of cocaine from South America into Europe , now that other routes have become tough for the traffickers .
US drug enforcement agents report that the old cocaine channels through the Caribbean , markedly Jamaica and Panama , have become more intensively policed , forcing the Colombians to develop new routes to traffic cocaine .
The increasing might of Mexico 's powerful drug cartels has forced the South Americans to search for trafficking routes to Europe across the Atlantic rather than through Central America .
Moreover , the West African coast can be reached across the shortest transatlantic crossing from South America : either by plane from Colombia , with a re-fuelling stop in Brazil ; or by ship from Brazil or Venezuela .
The boats leaving South America travel only by night , remaining motionless by day , covered in blue tarpaulins to avoid detection from the air .
The journey can be completed in four to five nights travelling this way .
Once ravaged by the transatlantic slave trade , the West African coast is again ' under attack ' , says the Executive Director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , Antonio Maria Costa , who calls the impact on Africa of Europe 's cocaine habit an echo of that of slavery .
' In the 19th century , Europe 's hunger for slaves devastated West Africa .
Two hundred years later , its growing appetite for cocaine could do the same . '
The seizure of West Africa by Colombian and other drug cartels has happened with lightning speed .
Since 2003 , 99 per cent of all drugs seized in Africa have been found in West Africa .
Between 1998 and 2003 , the total quantity of cocaine seized each year in Africa was around 600 kg .
But by 2006 , the figure had risen five - fold and during the first nine months of last year had already reached 5.6 tonnes .
The latest seizure , from a Liberian ship - Blue Atlantic - intercepted by the French navy last month , was 2.4 tonnes of pure cocaine .
But while seizure rates globally are estimated to be 46 per cent of total traffic , the amounts found in West Africa are ' the tip of the iceberg ' , says UNODC .
Even though one recent raid in Guinea - Bissau netted 635 kg of cocaine , the traffickers were thought to have still made off with a further two tonnes .
The street value of the drugs trafficked far exceeds gross national product .
A quarter of all cocaine consumed in Western Europe is trafficked through West Africa , according to UNOCD , for a local wholesale value of $ 1.8bn and a retail value of 10 times that in Europe .
Nigerian drug gangs have always been an energetic presence on the global trafficking scene , but the target of the South American traffickers have been the ' failed states ' along the Gold Coast , where poverty is extreme , where society has been ravaged by war and the institutions of state can be easily bought off - so that instead of enforcement , there is collusion .
And no more so than Guinea - Bissau , whose weakness makes it a trafficker 's dream prey .
In Guinea - Bissau , says the UNODC , the value of the drugs trade is greater than the national income .
' The fact of the matter , ' says the Consultancy Africa Intelligence agency , is that without assistance , Guinea - Bissau is at the mercy of wealthy , well - armed and technologically advanced narcotics traffickers . '
Guinea Bissau , with a population of 1.5 million , is ranked fifth from bottom in the UN 's world development index .
Even its recent history is one of torment : after 13 years of bloody guerrilla conflict , it won independence from Portugal , spent the first years under a Marxist Leninist dictatorship , then 18 under João Bernardo Vieira , until he was ousted by a military rebellion .
Successive crises , two wars and economic collapse brought Vieira back in 2005 , with a purge of the army and deceptive stability .
The White House has singled out Guinea - Bissau as 'a warehouse refuge and transit hub for cocaine traffickers from Latin America , transporting cocaine to Western Europe .
Costa says : ' When I went to Guinea - Bissau , the drug wealth was everywhere .
From the air , you can see the Spanish hacienda villas , and the obligatory black four - wheel - drives are everywhere , with the obligatory scantily - clad girl , James Bond style .
There were certain hotels I was advised not to stay in .'
A senior official at the US's Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) with a long record of fighting transatlantic drug trafficking , explained how and why the capture of Guinea - Bissau took place , and the trail to Europe .
' Geographically , West Africa makes sense .
The logical things is for the cartels to take the shortest crossing over the ocean to West Africa , by plane - to one of the many airstrips left behind by decades of war , or by drop into the thousands of little bays - or by boat all the way .
A ship can drop anchor in waters completely unmonitored , while fleets of smaller craft take the contraband ashore .
' A place like Guinea Bissau is a failed state anyway , so it 's like moving into an empty house . '
There is no prison in Guinea - Bissau , he says .
One rusty ship patrols a coastline of 350 km , and an archipelago of 82 islands .
The airspace is un-patrolled .
The police have few cars , no petrol , no radios , handcuffs or phones .
' You walk in , buy the services you need from the government , army and people , and take over .
The cocaine can then be stored safely and shipped to Europe , either by ship to Spain or Portugal , across land via Morocco on the old cannabis trail , or directly by air using " mules " . '
One single flight into Amsterdam in December 2006 was carrying 32 mules carrying cocaine from Guinea - Bissau .
The official admitted ' this has happened quickly , and the response has been tardy .
They 're ahead of the game . '
And it did n't help that most Western diplomatic presence had left Bissau during the fighting , preferring to operate from neighbouring Senegal .
The US and Britain shut up shop in Bissau in 1998 , the Americans only last July reopening a diplomatic office in response to the cocaine raids .
Although much of the cocaine goes directly to Spain and Portugal , London is becoming an increasingly prominent final destination , says the official - because of the street prices the drug commands - yet Britain also has no permanent diplomatic presence in Bissau , and has not joined the Iberian countries and the EU in contributing to the latest UN plans to help the country .
According to the UNODC , the UK and Spain have now overtaken America in the consumption of cocaine per head .
Guinea Bissau 's cocaine Calvary began three years ago when fishermen on one island found packages of white powder washed up on the beach .
They had no idea what the mysterious substance was .
' At first , they took the drug and they put it on their bodies during traditional ceremonies , " recalls local journalist Alberto Dabo .
' Then they put it on their crops .
All their crops died because of that drug .
They even used it to mark out a football pitch ' .
The real moment of truth came when two Latin Americans arrived by chartered plane , armed with $ 1 million in ' buyback ' cash , which the locals gleefully accepted .
The two men were apprehended by police , but released .
' When people found that it was cocaine and they could sell it , ' says Dabo , ' some of those fishermen bought cars and built houses . '
As well as the favourable location , in Guinea Bissau the cocaine gangs have found a country where the rule of law barely exists .
' It 's an easy country to be active if you 're an organised crime lord , ' says the deputy regional head of UNODC , Amado Philip de Andres .
' Law enforcement has literally no control for two reasons : there is no capacity and there is no equipment ' .
A further development highlighted by the DEA and UNODC is that Guinea Bissau and other West African countries are being targeted by Asian and African cartels trafficking heroin across the Atlantic in the opposite direction , to the US .
Last year , the DEA and police in Chicago tracked nine West Africans who had moved heroin originating in South - east Asia through various West African countries , markedly Guinea - Bissau , to the central US .
Estimates vary as to the cogency of the Colombian presence , but one observer suggests there are as many as 60 Colombian drugs traffickers in Guinea - Bissau .
Colombians have bought local businesses , including factories and warehouses , and built themselves large homes protected by armed guards .
They and their local hired help flaunt their liberty to operate - and the money they make from doing so .
' We can see these people walking in complete freedom .
They are parading their wealth .
They 're showing it completely openly , ' says Jamel Handem , of a coalition of civic groups called Platform GB .
Guinea - Bissau 's armed forces and some politicians are thought to be deeply involved in the drugs trade .
Last year , two military personnel were detained along with a civilian in a vehicle carrying 635 kg of cocaine .
The army secured the soldiers ' release and so far there is no sign that they will face charges .
In his large , carpeted , air - conditioned office , a refrigerator humming quietly in the corner , the army spokesman , Colonel Arsenio Balde , brushes aside suggestions the incident proves the army 's complicity in the drugs trade .
He says the soldiers were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time : ' They were on the road hitching a ride and they saw this car driving by .
They asked for a ride and then this guy stopped , and later on this car was stopped and they were arrested .
You do n't have any evidence of high - level involvement .
Just please , bring the evidence .
That 's what we 're asking for . '
Government spokesman Pedro da Costa gives a similar response when asked if the government is involved in the drugs trade .
' I do n't have any information on that , ' he says , curtly .
He insists the authorities are keen to tackle drugs traffickers , but do n't have the resources .
Like many others in Guinea - Bissau , though , he 's worried that disputes over control of the trade could break out , pushing the country back to civil war .
' We 're worried , of course .
We 're all concerned .
If it 's going to bring consequences to our people similar to the war of 1998 - 99 , I think today the motivation would be different .
But of course , there is a danger for the country . '
Parliamentary elections , originally scheduled for this month , have been postponed until the end of the year .
The campaign could lead to heightened tension between political groups , and provide more scope for corruption .
' One of the risks now is that they will have a deep penetration of dirty money into politics that will overturn everything in the country , ' says Fafali Kudawo , rector of the country 's first university , ' because this country is very , very fragile , and he who has money can do whatever he wants .
You do not know at any given moment what will change the situation or lead the country to war or to violence ' .
The UNOCD Office has drawn up a detailed plan to help Guinea - Bissau .
In 2006 it suggested a possible budget of several hundred million dollars to potential donors .
They refused to pay .
Last year the agency came up with a far more modest programme concentrating on reform of the security services , boosting the judicial police , and building a jail .
The estimated cost was $ 19 million .
In December a donor conference in Lisbon produced pledges of $ 6.5 m .
As though the suffocation of society by the cartels were not enough , Guinea - Bissau inevitably suffers from a proliferation of addiction among its own people .
' Foot soldiers are paid in kind , ' says Antonio Maria Costa , ' and whatever is left behind is sold domestically . '
With addicts hidden away in villages , many still believe that their hallucinations are the result of evil spirits .
When United Nations workers went to the country 's only excuse for a rehabilitation unit in a mangrove swamp 30 km from the capital , they found a man called Bubacar Gano , who calls himself ' the first man to smoke pedra ' - as crack cocaine is known in the country .
He recalls the fishing boat that lost its load in the sea in 2005 , saying : ' Most of the locals who found the packages had no idea what it was or what to do with it .
But I knew .
After a while I became crazy and aggressive .
But it is a difficult thing to stop smoking pedra . '

Yet another instance of cops acting like predatory pack animals .
It should be obvious by now the police are out of control , a parasitical force unleashed on society at large .
Cops no longer help granny across the street or respond to burglary .
Cops are like the Crips , Bloods , or Mara Salvatrucha — another violent street gang , but one armed and supported by the state .
“ A half - dozen police officers kicked and beat three men pulled from a car during a traffic stop as a TV helicopter taped the confrontation , ” reports the Associated Press . ” The video , shot by WTXF - TV , shows three police cars stopping a car Monday , two days after a city officer was shot to death responding to a bank robbery . ”
In other words , after a fellow gang member was shot and killed protecting a bank , the largest gang in Philadelphia wanted revenge and blood .
Of course , that ’s the real job of the cops — protect banks , not the public at large , considered the enemy .
“ The tape shows about a dozen officers gathering around the vehicle .
About a half - dozen officers hold two of the men on the ground .
Both are kicked repeatedly , while one is seen being punched ; one also appears to be struck with a baton . ”
“ On the surface it certainly does not look good in terms of the amount of force that was used , ” Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said .
“ But we do n’t want to rush to judgment . ”
No , of course not , even though the video plainly shows there was absolutely no reason for members of the police gang to savagely beat the three hapless people pictured .
“ The officers were responding to a report of a shooting nearby , police said .
It was not immediately clear what preceded the confrontation . ”
It does not matter “ what preceded the confrontation , ” as it is obvious the motorists were not a threat .
Once upon a time , cops handcuffed and arrested people accused of crimes .
Now they are beaten to a pulp .
“ We do n’t take into consideration the emotions of police officers when it comes to the discharge of their duties …
Your emotional state , being tired , does n’t justify what ’s on that video , ” said D. Scott Perrine , an attorney who represents the three men seen in the video .
“ He said one of his clients suffered a welt on his head the size of a baseball and one of his legs was seriously injured ; he did n’t know the extent of any injuries on the other two men . ”
“ It clearly shows a lack of any reasonable investigation before these police yank these individuals out of the car and take turns delivering blows , ” he said .
“ This is a time for a thorough investigation to see what it is that happened here . ”
Sort of like the “ thorough investigation ” of the cops who shot to death Sean Bell in New York .
An unarmed Bell had fifty rounds pumped into him as he was leaving his bachelor party on his wedding day .
Three detectives were acquitted of all charges in the case last month , thus sending a message – cops are above the law , they may shoot unarmed people with immunity .
“ The defense painted the victims as drunken thugs who the officers believed were armed and dangerous .
Prosecutors sought to convince the judge that the victims had been minding their own business , and that the officers were inept , trigger - happy cowboys , ” reported the Associated Press .
Fact is , the cops involved are not “ cowboys , ” they are violent gang members , as New York has the largest cop-gang in the country .
It will only get worse .
Cops are now trained to consider citizens as the enemy and the feds are arming them like paramilitaries – or maybe that should be death squads .
Iraqi veterans , driven insane by multiple tours , are now filling their ranks .
“ Perrine said that police told him all three men would be charged with aggravated assault , ” even though it is obvious by the video here that the men did not attack the police .
Increasingly , that is the MO — victims of police violence are charged with assault and resisting arrest .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - A U.S. military report on a battle in which a U.S. soldier died in Afghanistan was altered after the fact to falsely blame a young Canadian prisoner , his lawyer said on Thursday .

A U.S. military report on a battle in which a U.S. soldier died in Afghanistan was altered after the fact to falsely blame a young Canadian prisoner , his lawyer said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Handout / Files
The report initially said the assailant who threw the fatal grenade had himself been killed in the battle near the Afghan city of Khost on July 27 , 2002 , the lawyer , Navy Lt. Cmdr.
William Kuebler , told reporters at the Guantanamo naval base .
The officer who wrote that report on July 28 , 2002 , revised it about two months later to say the grenade thrower survived , implicating Canadian prisoner Omar Khadr , said Kuebler .
He asked a judge in the Guantanamo war court to allow him to interview that officer about the contradictory accounts .
Khadr is charged with murdering U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer , a special forces medic who entered a suspected al Qaeda compound after an aerial bombing and was hit by a grenade .
No one saw who threw the grenade but the U.S. military says it must have been Khadr because he was the only person still alive inside the compound when U.S. forces entered .
“ We now know that story was false , ” Kuebler said .
“ It ’s consistent with the proposition that the government manufactured evidence to make it look like Omar was guilty . ”
Another U.S. soldier said in documents released in February that a second al Qaeda suspect was lying on the floor of the compound with an AK - 47 assault rifle at his side , injured and moaning but still alive after the grenade was thrown .
The soldier said he shot and killed that suspect , then shot Khadr twice in the back as Khadr sat on the floor .
The altered report was written by a U.S. military officer known as “ Col. W , ” who was in charge at the scene but did not see what happened inside the compound , Kuebler said .
The deputy chief prosecutor , Army Col .
Bruce Pagel , denied the government had manufactured evidence but said trial rules prohibited him from further discussion of evidence .
Khadr , now 21 and the son of an alleged al Qaeda financier , was captured at age 15 .
He is set for trial in May in the special military tribunals established by the Bush administration to try terrorism suspects at the U.S. naval base in Cuba rather than in traditional civilian or military courts .
They are the first U.S. war tribunals since World War Two .
MOVING TRIALS ALONG
The Pentagon is trying to move the Guantanamo trials along before the end of the Bush administration and charges are now pending against 13 of the 275 prisoners .
Human rights groups call the proceedings a farce as detainees do not have legal rights normally accorded U.S. citizens and prisoners of war .
Kuebler asked prosecutors to turn over U.S. and Canadian diplomatic messages about Khadr ’s case , as well as additional notes and records from interrogators who questioned Khadr at the Bagram prison in Afghanistan and later at Guantanamo .
Kuebler said “ the myth about Omar ’s participation appears to have been manufactured at Bagram , ” where Khadr was interrogated by a military unit later accused of abusing prisoners .
Prosecutors said they had already given the defense everything that could be material , helpful or exculpatory .
The judge , Army Col .
Peter Brownback , said he would rule within a few days on the defense request for more evidence .

I begin to believe that " McSame " is not the right appellation for John McCain ... he so clearly aspires to be " McWorse " .
It frightens me that he could be considered a legitimate candidate by any one with more than a two digit IQ .
Unfortunately , the Media / McCain Man-Love is so strong that rarely does any news that detracts from " Maverick / Straight Talkin ' " meme get through to the average Joe .
But Fareed Zakaria at Newsweek ( I know , I was surprised too ) broke away from the hivethink to chronicle just how dangerous McCain 's understanding of foreign policy is :
On March 26 , McCain gave a speech on foreign policy in Los Angeles that was billed as his most comprehensive statement on the subject .
It contained within it the most radical idea put forward by a major candidate for the presidency in 25 years .
Yet almost no one noticed .
In his speech McCain proposed that the United States expel Russia from the G8 , the group of advanced industrial countries .
Moscow was included in this body in the 1990s to recognize and reward it for peacefully ending the cold war on Western terms , dismantling the Soviet empire and withdrawing from large chunks of the old Russian Empire as well .
McCain also proposed that the United States should expand the G8 by taking in India and Brazil - but pointedly excluded China from the councils of power .
We have spent months debating Barack Obama 's suggestion that he might , under some circumstances , meet with Iranians and Venezuelans .
It is a sign of what is wrong with the foreign - policy debate that this idea is treated as a revolution in U.S. policy while McCain 's proposal has barely registered .
What McCain has announced is momentous - that the United States should adopt a policy of active exclusion and hostility toward two major global powers .
It would reverse a decades - old bipartisan American policy of integrating these two countries into the global order , a policy that began under Richard Nixon ( with Beijing ) and continued under Ronald Reagan ( with Moscow ) .
It is a policy that would alienate many countries in Europe and Asia who would see it as an attempt by Washington to begin a new cold war .
By what perverse metric could this possibly be seen as in our country 's best interest ?
It 's not bad enough that Bush has alienated all of the Middle East against us , now we have to piss off the entire world ?
It was really dumb of me to put a camera into a piece of checked luggage , but I did , and now an airport baggage handler somewhere is one camera richer .
It ’s my fault , of course .
My only excuse is that I almost never check bags , so when I packed this one I was thinking carry - on , not checked .
In searching around for similar cases , I found this tale of a guy who found his stolen camera on eBay , tracked down the thief , and got him arrested .
In the comments , mixed in with the debate about whether or not Delta should have granted the refund he requested ( they did n’t ) , there ’s this amazing bit of advice lifted from a comment on another blog :
One note on using TSA rules to your advantage .
Weapons that travel MUST be in a hard case , must be declared upon check - in , and MUST BE LOCKED by a TSA official .
A “ weapons ” is defined as a rifle , shotgun , pistol , airgun , and STARTER PISTOL .
Yes , starter pistols – those little guns that fire blanks at track and swim meets – are considered weapons … and do NOT have to be registered in any state in the United States .
I have a starter pistol for all my cases .
All I have to do upon check - in is tell the airline ticket agent that I have a weapon to declare …
I ’m given a little card to sign , the card is put in the case , the case is given to a TSA official who takes my key and locks the case , and gives my key back to me .
That ’s the procedure .
The case is extra - tracked … TSA does not want to lose a weapons case .
This reduces the chance of the case being lost to virtually zero .
It ’s a great way to travel with camera gear … I ’ve been doing this since Dec 2001 and have had no problems whatsoever .
What a brilliant hack !
Ron Paul ’s performance is a testament to his appeal to young voters .
Ron Paul continues to best Giuliani
Ron Paul , the Texas congressman frequently dismissed as a long shot candidate with no real chance at winning the Republican presidential nomination , has won nearly twice as many total votes to date as Rudy Giuliani , a candidate still widely viewed as a strong contender .
With his second place finish in Saturday ’s Nevada caucus , where Paul defeated Giuliani in every county in the state , the Texas congressman has now received 106,414 votes to 60,220 for Giuliani .
Both candidates have collected zero actual delegates .

Paul ’s performance is a testament to his appeal to young voters , who have disproportionately supported his candidacy .
According to exit and entrance polls , Paul came in second among 18 to 24 - year - olds in New Hampshire and finished a close third in Iowa after Mitt Romney among the 17 to 29 - year - old demographic .
“ There are a lot of things in Ron Paul ’s message that resonate with younger voters , ” said Ethan Eilon , executive director of the College Republican National Committee .
“ The anti-establishment ring to what he ’s got to say , typically younger voters tend to gravitate to that to some degree . ”
Paul ’s head - to - head success against Giuliani reflects , to a degree , the former New York City mayor ’s high - risk strategy of partially bypassing the early states and betting everything on a victory in Florida ’s Jan. 29 primary .
The Giuliani campaign contends that Paul ’s lead over Giuliani will not last through the coming avalanche of big states where Giuliani has campaigned more than most of his opponents .
“ We ’re less than seven days from Florida , where we expect the mayor to be successful , ” said Giuliani spokeswoman Maria Comella .
“ We ’ve always planned a national strategy that we have n’t wavered from . ”
But Giuliani ’s exceptionally weak performance so far , relative to Paul , whose own campaign has lagged in the polls , is nevertheless a troubling sign .
Right up until the Iowa caucuses Giuliani ran ahead of the field in national polls .
He raised more money than any other candidate except Romney .
Though he did not actively campaign in Iowa , Giuliani still aired television and radio ads there — and Paul easily bested Giuliani for fifth place with 10 percent to Giuliani ’s 4 percent .
In New Hampshire , where Giuliani trailed only Romney in the number of campaign visits to the state through the end of 2007 , Giuliani won only 9 percent , putting him in fourth place barely ahead of Paul .
But New Hampshire , it turned out , proved to be the high point of Giuliani ’s campaign thus far .
In the next two primaries , Paul doubled Giuliani ’s numbers .
In Michigan , Paul finished fourth with 6 percent while Giuliani staggered into sixth place at 3 percent .
In South Carolina , Paul again placed above Giuliani , with 4 percent of the vote to Giuliani ’s 2 percent .
Regardless of Florida plays out , the Paul campaign is ready to declare victory over Giuliani in the battle of ideas .
“ It ’s a testament to the direction the Republican Party is heading in the future , ” said Paul ’s national youth outreach director , Jeff Frazee .
He attributes the difference in Giuliani and Paul ’s youth support to their differences over issues like civil liberties , saying , “ Young people are interested in freedom .
They are not interested in more authoritarians . ”
McCain not sure how to ' pursue ' predatory lenders David Edwards
Published : Tuesday April 1 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Lenders who took advantage of people should be held accountable , Sen. John McCain told Good Morning America this morning , but he 's not sure exactly how .
" People who cashed in hundreds of millions of dollars , I do n't think they should be allowed to keep that money .
I do n't know how to pursue that , " the Republican candidate told GMA .
" I think it 's disgraceful when things like that are going on .
and American people deserve better . "
People who profited should not be rewarded , he said , but both lenders and borrowers need to agree on a new way of doing business .
" There were people who were speculators we can't reward those , " he said , suggesting that " lenders and borrowers sit down together . "
The industry not the government should be helping homeowners , he said , though he did n't rule out the possibility of government incentives .
He expects to be rolling out a more specific plan over the next few days .
No matter what the solution , the first priority is saving homeowners he said and making sure that similar problems are avoided in the future .
McCain has consistently spoken out against government intervention saying he would rather see the market solve the problem .
Any government assistance to alleviate the housing crisis must be temporary , he said , and should be accompanied by reforms that aim to make the system more transparent and accountable to prevent a repeat of the crisis .
He said no assistance should be given to speculators , or people who bought houses to rent or as second homes .
Both Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama have criticized him for his position .
Yesterday Clinton evoked one of her own campaign commercials in criticizing the Republican .
" You know , Sen . McCain recently gave speech on the economy , and best I could determine his plan was not to have a plan .
If he got the 3:00 am call on the economy , he would just let the phone ring and ring and ring , " she said .
Last week Obama said McCain would prefer to watch the economy meltdown rather than intervene .
" ( He ) said the best way for us to address the fact that millions of Americans are losing their homes is to just sit back and watch it happen .
In his entire speech yesterday , he offered not one policy , not one idea , not one bit of relief to the nearly 35,000 North Carolinians who are forced to foreclose on their dreams in the last three months , " scolded Obama .

Children were sexually abused and exploited by peacekeepers and aid workers who were to protect them in post - conflict areas , UK charity organization reported .
After the careful investigation in post - conflict areas in Ivory Coast , southern Sudan and Haiti , Save the Children was alarmed that numerous cases of sexual abuse of children went unreported .
Many children , some of them as young as six , are simply afraid to report about the abuse .
The charity organization said that international inspection is needed to examine the issue .
The UN said that the report will be taken into consideration and studied thoroughly .
One of the cases includes a 13 - year - old girl who was sexually abused by 10 peacekeepers near her home .
The girl suffered from bleeding , trembling and vomiting on the ground .
The soldiers involved in the incident were not punished .
There were also numerous cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of children by aid workers .
Save the Children said that child protection system should be reinforced and more effective reporting mechanisms used to protect the children .
Heather Kerr , a charity director in Ivory Coast said many children suffer in silence and cannot report about the abuse .
Previously , the international community claimed that a zero - tolerance policy will be applied to child sexual abuse , however no action has been done yet .
The UN officials said that in spite of the fact that the organization cannot guarantee that these incidents will not occur again , if allegations are raised , this wo n't be tolerated .

Short of " free food " and " free beer , " " free music " is one of the sweetest phrases you can hear .
But getting tunes gratis does n't have to mean ending up on the RIAA 's Most Wanted list .
These five sites will let you easily fatten up your music collection with tracks that creators and recording labels are giving away - - all in DRM - free , MP3 format .
An extra bonus : None of these sites require an e-mail address or any kind of registration .
What 's the catch ?
Well , do n't expect to find much top - 40 material here ; the four major labels are still pretty tight - fisted with their properties .
But that 's not really much of a catch : Saying good - bye to Mariah Carey and Madonna means saying hello to independent artists ( some of whom have been in the business just as long ) who will round out your most - played list quite nicely .
1. Venzero Mixtape
Some audio player manufacturers will happily give you music , on the condition that you buy their product first .
German company Venzero is a bit more generous , having launched the Venzero Mixtape : a rotating collection of MP3 tracks by " exquisite bands " that anybody can download .
Or at least that 's the theory .
Since launching the Venzero Mixtape , the company has changed the lineup only once .
The nine tracks that make up the current mixtape are a pleasure to listen to , however , so even if Venzero never gets around to picking up where it left off , you still come out ahead .
2. Epitonic
My favorite brick - and - mortar record stores -- I can call them that because they still have plenty of vinyl - - not only offer a wide variety of music but also have staff who can talk intelligently about what they offer .
Even when I walk in just to say hi , I usually end up walking out with a new CD and new knowledge .
The closest experience to that in the online world is Epitonic , where you do n't get just free music -- you get free schooling too .
The site features extensive writeups on all the featured artists ( including links to similar acts ) , streaming audio , and at least one free MP3 per album .
Unfortunately , Epitonic has n't really been updated for almost two years .
But the site has enough content that you can still spend hours , if not days , exploring new musical avenues .
[ Above : Inverse building demolition in London via Neatorama ]
Nothing last forever and that includes the most grandiose skyscrapers , luxurious hotels and beloved sports stadiums .
It seems amazing at times that so much money , energy and material is invested in structures that ultimately get torn down so quickly .
From amazing explosions to botched implosion , some of these demolitions are simply damned impressive while other instances are downright frightening .
In true Las Vegas style the New Frontier went out with ( sorry , the pun had to be made ) a huge bang .
Watch explosive fireworks shoot outward through the windows of the building – all captured in closeups as it happens .
Truly a genius way to destroy something .
Watching this one it is almost impossible to believe that it can end well : you have an extremely tall building surrounded by other structures that has nowhere to go but down .
Sure enough , though , the experts did their homework and went off quickly and without a hitch .
If you had to make a list of frightening , gigantic and durable structures that might seem impossible to destroy a nuclear cooling tower would probably be pretty high on the list .
The Trojan tower ’s destruction actually happens surprisingly fast in the first video so be sure to watch the second one to catch it in slow motion !
This stadium really goes down like dominoes on a scale you ’ve never seen before .
While the above video gives you a general idea of how it happens you should be sure to check out this video ( which could n’t be embedded here ) for a more comprehensive view of the events .
OK , so this is n’t a building demolition in the typical sense : it is just one crazy individual with a sledgehammer and no sense of self - preservation whatsoever .
It starts off a little slow but as you might guess while watching the beginning : the end is worth sticking around for .
The burning question on everyone ’s mind regarding this building is of course : was it supposed to fall on its side ?
It seems like any other implosion until a few seconds in when the building stops collapsing and begins to simply lean and then fall over still partly intact .
Was it planned that way or simply a dangerous mistake ?
Something clearly went wrong here .
Could it be that they did n’t lay out enough explosives , or that perhaps they were put in the wrong place ?
Whatever went on one has to wonder : who is going to get close enough to this half - toppled building to set up more explosives and try again !
The sequencing on this one ( with or without the background musical beats ) is pretty neat .
You can watch as they blow out each floor with bits and pieces flying from the structure before the whole thing collapses .
Also , the video ’s creator has a slow - motion version at the end .
Like the New Frontier : if you ’re going to blow up a building anyway , why not blow it up in style ?
When the infamous Stardust was destroyed they decided to do just that .
The building ’s implosion is accompanied by fireworks that mingle with the explosions as the structure breathes its last .
Many building implosions start equally all around the base of the structure or are set off in such a way that they that the structure collapses in toward the center .
This one seems to lean ominously as explosions start from one corner and the building falls slightly more to one side .
This structure and implosion are both fairly modest .
What stands out in the video is how close the onlookers seem to be and the visibility of the explosions going off inside the building .
This appears to be a big event in a small town judging from the cheers .
This one goes by extremely fast .
It sort of looks like some high - speed racer shot into the building ’s base at one side and plowed through to the other , collapsing the structure along the way .
Now this Intel building is a bit unusual : it sat idle for almost a decade , partially constructed , before they gave up on and decided to demolish it .
The net result is a somewhat strange demolition of what is essentially a collection of columns , beams and unfinished floor platforms .
The Jamestown Bridge in Rhode Island went down in what can only be described as a choreographed dance of destruction .
Almost elegantly simultaneous , the explosions help the main bridge structure shed all of its tension supports in a matter of seconds .
Beautiful .
And now for the grand finale !
The above shows a number of buildings being blown up ( or down as the case may be ) and it is still just the tip of the iceberg .

Six weeks after my international flight from Los Angeles to Australia was delayed for 24 hours , United Airlines has finally come up with a value for my inconvenience when a full Boeing 747 - load ( 400 + ) of passengers waited at the terminal for 6 hours into midnight , sent to an airport motel at 2 am , lining up half an hour to check - in ( guess what happens when 200 people enter one motel at the same time ) , sleep and wake up in the same clothes , eat 3 meals of crummy tasteless food and not to mention some LAPD cops busting in a room next door .
Four dollars and seventeen cents per hour is how much United thinks my time is worth .
Even McDonalds has higher standards .
To be blunt , all I missed was a lecturer , tutorial and some work .
I ca n’t imagine how the family of four who missed their child ’s birthday party in Sydney , or the half a dozen elderly couples who missed their retirement Pacific cruise must feel when this arrives for them .
Considering everyone paid almost $ 80 / hour for the flight , this is worse than a slap in the face .
Ouch , that payback , it can be a bitch -- Sony BMG , distributors of rootkit - installing CDs and litigious foe of P2P users worldwide , has just been busted in France for using pirated software on its servers .
And it gets even worse : Windows admin tool developer PointDev says a Sony BMG was caught when an IT staffer actually called up for support and gave a pirated license number to the phone tech .
That 's some pretty shady behavior for a company that 's rammed anti-piracy measures down its own customers ' throats -- too bad it 's probably not going to feel the hit of the € 300,000 ( $ 475,000 ) lawsuit nearly as hard as the college students it routinely sues for $ 5,000 .

U.S. Sen . John Kerry 's speech at the University of Florida came to a dramatic close Monday , shortly after a vocal audience member was hauled off by police and shot with a Taser gun .
The audience member was preliminarily identified by UF officials as Andrew Meyer , a UF student in the College of Journalism and Communications .
Toward the conclusion of Kerry 's UF forum , Meyer approached an open microphone at the University Auditorium and demanded Kerry answer his questions .
The student claimed that University Police Department officers had already threatened to arrest him , and then proceeded to question Kerry about why he did n't contest the 2004 presidential election and why there had been no moves to impeach President Bush .
A minute or so into what became a combative diatribe , Meyer 's microphone was turned off and officers began trying to physically remove him from the auditorium .
Meyer flailed his arms , yelling as police tried to restrain him .

( James Saft is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own )
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Increasing numbers of Americans are simply walking away from their houses and mortgages , increasing pressure on banks and the economy .
Rapid house price falls in many parts of the United States will soon leave as many as one in five borrowers owing more on their loan than the house will fetch , removing at a stroke the single most powerful incentive to keep up with payments .
The phenomenon of “ walk aways ” or “ jingle mail , ” so called because of the noise the house keys make in the envelope mailed to the bank , is hard to measure but shows every sign of gathering pace and having a substantial impact .
Wachovia Corp. WB.N went so far as to change its models on how quickly loans will go bad in the face of what it called " unprecedented " changes in consumer behavior .
“ I do n’t know where the tipping point is , but somewhere when a borrower crosses the 100 percent loan to value , somewhere north of that ... their propensity to just default and stop paying their mortgage rises dramatically and really accelerates up .
It ’s almost regardless of how they scored , say , on FICO or other kinds of credit characteristics , ” Wachovia chief risk officer Don Truslow told analysts on a conference call .
FICO , a credit score developed by Fair Isaac Corp. , is one of many barometers of credit worthiness used in home lending to help predict the likelihood that a borrower will repay .
Wachovia this week announced that it would make a $ 2.8 billion provision for credit losses as it posted a first quarter loss , cut its dividend and sought to raise $ 7 billion in fresh capital .
While the law varies from state to state , in many parts of the United States mortgage lenders cannot go after defaulting borrowers ’ other assets .
And even where they can , few lenders take the expensive and low - yielding option of chasing down borrowers who walk away from loans .
The scale of the potential problem is huge .
Mark Zandi of Moody ’s Economy.com estimates that 10.6 million homeowners will have zero or negative equity by the end of June , or 21 percent of first mortgage holders .
The impact of a new wave of defaults will also be potentially important .
Banks and other investors in mortgages , as has been seen , will take further hits to their already weakened capital .
While few might shed tears for banks , this means a longer and deeper credit crunch .
It will also mean a wave of new properties hitting the real estate market , driving prices lower still , as banks seize and seek to sell the houses homeowners have fled .
To give a flavor of the impact , Zandi has estimated that every foreclosure on a neighborhood block reduces the value of all homes on that block by almost 1.5 percent .
GROWING PHENOMENON
To be fair , not every loan default by someone whose house is n’t worth as much as the loan is a walk away , but the two are closely linked .
Wachovia is far from alone in feeling the impact from “ walk aways . ”
Regions Financial Corp RF.N , a large U.S. bank active in the southeast , on Tuesday announced that nonperforming assets had nearly tripled to $ 1.2 billion , driven in part by deterioration in its home equity loan portfolio .
Regions chief executive C. Dowd Ritter gave analysts a similar picture of how borrowers react when confronted with steep drops in home valuations .
“ As they started to sell it or refinance , they realized that valuation was 40 percent below what it was that 18 - 24 months ago and they are walking away from those homes in those markets , ” he said .
Data from real estate firm RealtyTrac not only shows a rapid rise in overall foreclosures , but also suggests a rising number of walk aways .
Home foreclosure filings surged 57 percent in the 12 months to March and bank repossessions soared 129 percent from a year ago , according to Realty Trac .
In most of the United States , foreclosures follow a sequence of an initial notice of default , then notice of a scheduled auction , and finally a “ REO ” filing indicating repossession .
If borrowers walk away , lenders can skip the auction notice and accelerate repossession .
“ On a year - over - year basis , default notices were up nearly 57 percent and bank repossessions were up nearly 129 percent , but auction notices were up only 32 percent , indicating that more defaulting homeowners are simply walking away and deeding their properties back to the foreclosing lender , ” said James J. Saccacio , chief executive officer of RealtyTrac .
While borrowers acting in their own best interests really should n’t shock anyone , the costs associated will be just another unwelcome drag on the economy and finance until the value of U.S. houses stops falling .

Modern interface designers hate you .
With few exceptions , the modern gadget is as impossible to navigate as were the seas before the sextant and the marine chronometer .
The reason ?
The internal functions bear no relationship to anything we might encounter in the real world , so arbitrary abstractions are needed to bridge the gap between microchip and brain .
Add to this the fact that the UI is often an afterthought in most devices and you end up with something like the RAZR , hated far and wide for its labyrinthine control layout .
It was n’t always this way .
Perhaps if today ’s designers payed a little attention to the past they might come up with something a little easier to love , and a little less frustrating to use .

Manual Cameras
Say what you like about the differences between digital and film ( and Lord knows , I have ) , an old manual camera has a superbly intuitive interface .
Sure , they did n’t have to control things like white balance or histogram displays , but the basic functions of exposure and focus were , once learned , almost invisible in use .
Take the Holy Trinity of exposure : Shutter speed , aperture and film speed .
To change the size of the hole in the lens , you twist a ring on the lens .
Ditto shutter speed – a dial around the shutter release .
And while ISO was usually only set once per film , it was , again , a simple dial .
Muscle memory meant that these could be grabbed and used with the eye to the viewfinder , and the layout of the controls quashed any ambiguity as to their purpose .
Compare that to the multibutton , menu - driven crap on the modern digicam .
Canon at least put a real ISO dial on the G9 , but why ca n’t we have an aperture ring and a shutter speed dial .
Pretty please ?

Mouse
The mouse , whether invented by Xerox , Apple , Stanford Research Institute or Walt Disney , changed computing .
The mouse , and a menu - driven , window - based desktop metaphor made it easy for anybody to work with a computer .
Point , click , drag instead of typing out arcane command lines onto a screen .
The mouse successfully bridged the gap between box and brain and also ushered in the since - abused layer of abstraction now found everywhere .
It enabled people to use complex functions without knowing how the magic happened :
The computer did the translation .

Simple , and offering exquisite feedback , the record turntable is still an example of almost perfect interface design .
As the tone - arm moves across the vinyl , you know exactly where in the record you are , even from across the room ( no squinting at an LED readout ) .
The tracks themselves are separated by lighter stripes , and muting is a matter of just lifting the needle .
Ask a DJ what is the appeal of vinyl and he wo n’t say it ’s warm sound or the 12 " of hot album art , but the fingertip control .
Lining up a track , mixing and scratching all require precision , and that ’s a lot easier with a spinning disk than with buttons and switches .

Manual Transmission Car
Perhaps the ultimate muscle - memory interface .
Hideously difficult to learn , but once you ’ve done so , you can drive a car as if it were an extension of your own body .
Everything makes sense .
The wheel controls , well , the wheels ; the clutch , which needs less finessing than the other foot pedals , is controlled with the usually less accurate left foot .
The other two pedals , the brake and accelerator , are never used at the same time and need a delicate touch .
Thus both are assigned to the right foot .
If you doubt this , try using your left foot on the brake ( a technique used in rally driving but not recommended on the road .
If you attempt it , make sure you ’re in a safe , private area ) .
Even the gear lever , although not the most obvious design to decode at first , neatly translates the needs of the gearbox into a human understandable pattern .
And if you thought that cars were always so well designed , take a look at these instructions for operating a Model T Ford ( taken from Wikipedia )
The Model T ’s transmission was controlled with three foot pedals and a lever that was mounted to the road side of the driver ’s seat .
The throttle was controlled with a lever on the steering wheel .
The left pedal was used to engage the gear .
When pressed and held forward the car entered low gear .
When held in an intermediate position the car was in neutral , a state that could also be achieved by pulling the floor - mounted lever to an upright position .
If the lever was pushed forward and the driver took his foot off the left pedal , the Model T entered high gear .
The car could thus cruise without the driver having to press any of the pedals .
There was no separate clutch pedal .
The middle pedal was used to engage reverse gear , and the right pedal operated the engine brake .
The floor lever also controlled the parking brake , which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back .
This doubled as an emergency brake .

The Knob
Almost unparalleled in its versatility , the humble knob shows up everywhere .
It can be continuous or discrete ( a volume knob or a selector switch ) , analog or digital ( volume again , or on / off ) .
It can be finely graded with a scale , used to control water flow through a faucet , shuttle through movie footage , open a door and , if it ’s Griffin ’s Powermate , it can do just about anything else .
Even the iPod ’s clickwheel is just an evolution of the knob , one which revolutionized portable music players through simplicity coupled with power .
Its strength is its simplicity .
Once you have twisted one knob , you know how every other knob works .
If it is marked , its position provides visual feedback .
If not , our brains easily associate the amount of twist with the level of the knob ’s effect .
And best of all , it ’s the only controller we know of which can go up to 11 .

You can even offer heartfelt praise .
The place ?
The comments .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he intended to become a powerful and long - serving prime minister after leaving the Kremlin but rejected suggestions he would dictate orders to his likely successor .
Putin , giving his last annual news conference before his second term ends in May , said he fully trusted the Kremlin ’s candidate for president , First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev , and would have no problems working with him .
Medvedev enjoys blanket coverage on state - controlled media and is widely expected to win a big poll victory next month .
“ Dmitry Anatolyevich ( Medvedev ) and I have worked together for 15 years and I would never have deigned to support a candidate for president if he needed coddling and advice on how to behave , ” Putin told hundreds of reporters at the Kremlin in a marathon event lasting a record 4 hours and 40 minutes .
Political analysts have questioned how Medvedev would occupy Russia ’s all - powerful presidency and work effectively with his former boss as a subordinate .
Russia ’s constitution assigns the prime minister a largely economic role , with all key security and power ministries reporting directly to the president .
Putin , 55 , said he and Medvedev would “ divide our responsibilities and I can assure you that there will be no problem here ” .
“ The highest executive power in the country is the government of the Russian Federation headed by the Prime Minister , ” he added .
Asked how long he would be premier , Putin said the post “ cannot be transitional . ”
As long as Medvedev was in the Kremlin and Putin was achieving his goals , “ I would work as long as possible , ” he said .
Putin also addressed for the first time Western news reports that he had amassed a huge personal fortune while in power , dismissing the claims as “ rubbish ” .
Using typically colorful language , he said the reports were “ just excavated from someone ’s nose and then spread on those bits of paper ” .
On foreign policy , the Kremlin leader repeated warnings that Moscow would target Russian missiles at NATO countries which hosted parts of a planned U.S. missile defence shield and would strongly oppose independence for the Serb province of Kosovo .

LESS AGGRESSIVE TONE
But overall , he struck a less aggressive tone than before , saying Moscow was more interested in dealing with social and economic problems at home than in a new Cold War .
“ To suppose that we aspire to return to the times of the Cold War is just too bold a supposition , ” Putin said .
Russia was willing to work “ towards the construction of a positive dialogue ” with whoever won the U.S. presidential election and did not intend to target any country with its nuclear missiles except in “ extreme necessity ” , he said .

At points , Putin ’s tone changed and he turned philosophical , reflecting on his time in office .
He said he had worked “ like a galley slave ” as president and was looking forward to catching up on his sleep .
Asked if he would not prefer to retire he said : “ What , you want me to just lie down and sleep ?
I think it ’s a bit early for me to do that .
Turning to his legacy from 8 years as president , he said he believed he had not let down the Russian people .
“ For me , that is the most important thing . ”
“ I do not see any serious failures , ” Putin said , sitting on a raised platform in front of a huge map of Russia in the colors of the national flag .
“ All the tasks we set ourselves have been achieved . ”
Thursday ’s news conference , broadcast live on Russian television , easily beat last year ’s three hours 32 minutes .
Russian news agencies said Putin this year fielded 100 questions .
Astronomers have known for decades that the Sun has a very dynamic atmosphere .
Huge fountains of hot gas erupt in the atmosphere , or corona , every few minutes , travelling at tens of thousands of km per hour and reaching great heights .
Now a team of scientists have used the Hinode spacecraft to find the origin and driver of these fountains - immense magnetic structures that thread through the solar atmosphere .
On April 2 at the Royal Astronomical Society National Astronomy Meeting in Belfast ( NAM 2008 ) , team leader Dr Michelle Murray from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory ( MSSL , University College London ) will present the latest results from Hinode together with computer simulations that model conditions on the Sun .
Since its launch in October 2006 , scientists have been using Hinode to examine the solar atmosphere in extraordinary detail .
One of the instruments on the space observatory , the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer ( EIS ) built by a consortium led by MSSL , generates images of the Sun and gives information on how fast its gases are moving .
Increases in pressure at the base of the Sun 's magnetic field cause enormous jets of hot gas to shoot upwards into the solar atmosphere .
Once the pressure ceases , the hot gases stop soaring into the atmosphere and fall back towards the solar surface .
The changes in pressure are caused by rearrangements of the Sun 's magnetic field , a continual process that results in looping cycles of increasing and decreasing pressure and , consequentially , intermittent solar fountains .
“ EIS has observed the Sun 's fountains in unprecedented detail and it has enabled us to narrow down the fountains ' origins for the first time ” , comments team member and MSSL postgraduate student Deb Baker .
' We have also been able to find what drives the fountains by using computer experiments to replicate solar conditions . ”
' The computer experiments demonstrate that when a new section of magnetic field pushes through the solar surface it generates a continual cycle of fountains ” , explains Dr Murray , " but new magnetic fields are constantly emerging across the whole of the solar surface and so our results can explain a whole multitude of fountains that have been observed with Hinode . ”
Appearing before a roomful of newspaper editors and publishers in Washington today , Barack Obama began with a slight ( some might say strained ) joke about the coverage he generated over the last couple of days because of his now so - well - known comments about small - town America .
As he was wrapping up , he had to parry a stumble by one of the nation 's leading news executives , who conflated his name with that of a certain terrorist .
If he 's not in the best of humor at the moment ( despite his effort at jesting ) , it 's easy to understand why .
Taking the podium at the annual meeting sponsored by the Associated Press , Obama slyly noted that he had " kept a lot of you guys busy over the weekend . "
He added , with a trace of a smile , that " some of you might even be a little bitter about that . "
Polite laughter greeted the play on words ( and Obama himself surely knows the brouhaha that continues to rage about him is no laughing matter for his political prospects ) .
In his speech , Obama made clear -- as he has repeatedly the last few days -- that he would welcome a debate with presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain over " elitism . "
And he had some mild scolding for the media , saying the propensity to get " caught up in the same cycle of political silliness " distracts from a serious focus on the nation 's problems .
" We feed on controversy .
We feed on conflict , " he told his crowd .
" It 's not that interesting to say , ' I disagree with the guy , but I see his point . ' "
Then came a brief Q & A , highlighted by a gaffe by William Dean Singleton , chairman of the AP board of directors and head of ...
Might it take a French sex symbol to teach Americans a crucial lesson about politics ?
The principles upon which this country was founded were influenced by thinkers as far afield as Britain and France , Greece and Rome .
Since then , the trade in ideas also has gone increasingly in the other direction .
So it ’s easy to forget that a principle we take for granted here often means something very different elsewhere .
Take one of the most basic tenets of public life .
America and Europe may share many of the same core values , but these days , a common understanding of free speech is not one of them .
That was thrown into high relief last week when a trial began in a Paris courtroom .
Brigitte Bardot , the 73 - year - old former actress best - known for steamy French flicks like “ And God Created Woman , ” has been charged with “ inciting racial hatred ” toward Muslims .
( Never mind that Islam is a religion , not a race . )
If she loses — the verdict is expected June 3 — she faces more than just a token penalty .
Prosecutors want a severe two - month suspended jail sentence and a 15,000 euro ( almost $ 24,000 ) fine because , assistant prosecutor Anne de Fontette says , “ I ’m a bit tired of trying Madame Bardot . ”
Miss Bardot has been convicted under the hate law four times in the past 11 years .
What did the former screen siren say to merit what that the prosecutor calls “ the most striking and remarkable ” punishment ?
Did she call on others to start persecuting Muslims ?
For pogroms ?
No , she protested their treatment of livestock .
When President Nicolas Sarkozy was the interior minister , Miss Bardot wrote a letter to him complaining about the ritual slaughter of sheep during the Muslim festival of Eid-al - Kabir .
She said the animals should be stunned before they are bled to death .
Miss Bardot retired from acting in the 1970s and focused her energies on animal rights .
In her letter , which also was published in her foundation ’s journal , she wrote , “ I ’ve had enough of being led by the nose by this whole population which is destroying us , destroying our country by imposing their ways . ”
In the past , Miss Bardot was convicted for a letter in the French daily Le Figaro decrying “ foreign overpopulation ” and complaining in one of her books about the “ Islamization of France . ”
Imagine if every American who voiced concerns about immigration faced a court hearing — our courts would n’t be able to handle the caseload .
Some readers may be surprised to learn that free speech American - style is rare , even among the select club of long - established democracies .
The First Amendment to the Constitution states , “ Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
Petition the French government , and you might find yourself paying thousands of dollars in fines .
Such prosecutions have gone on for years , but it has taken someone with the iconic fame of Miss Bardot to make many people take notice .
In France , you have to be careful what you say even in conversation .
Novelist Michel Houellebecq faced up to 18 months in prison or a 70,000 euro ( $ 111,200 ) fine when he was charged with inciting racial hatred after declaring in an interview , “ The stupidest religion , after all , is Islam . ”
He was acquitted , though .
Provocative comments about Islam are n’t the only thing that could get you in trouble .
Soon it may be a crime to publish a picture of a very skinny woman in the fashion capital of the world .
Last week , France ’s National Assembly voted to approve a bill that makes encouraging “ extreme thinness ” punishable by up to three years in prison and $ 71,000 in fines .
It targets pro-anorexia Web sites , but its author believes it ’s vague enough to be used to prosecute the fashion industry .
Milan and Madrid already have banned what they consider too - skinny models from their runways .
It ’s not that the French are particularly touchy — hate laws are the norm across Europe .
In the Netherlands , the political party Centrum Democraten and its leaders were prosecuted successfully for the party ’s extreme anti-immigration proposals .
In Sweden , a pastor was sentenced to one month ’s jail time for preaching a sermon , later published in a newspaper , that quoted biblical texts condemning homosexuality .
( Two years later , the sentence finally was overturned on appeal . )
Most surprisingly , even other countries in the Anglosphere do n’t share America ’s belief in the inviolability of freedom of speech .
The United States ’ neighbor to the north may see itself as a socially liberal haven , but I could fill this column — several columns — with stories of hate - speech prosecutions in Canada , my native land .
A private printer there had to pay a fine of $ 5,000 after he refused to print stationery for gay activists out of deference to his Christian beliefs .
Another man was fined $ 4,500 for printing an ad that listed four Bible references — not even the text — next to an equal sign and a drawing of two stickmen holding hands underneath the universal sign for “ not ” ( a red circle with a line through it ) .
The newspaper that ran the ad also was fined .
Religious freedom does n’t fare too well up north , with the Bible basically considered hate literature .
Great Britain , whose thinkers once helped inspire the American Revolution , also has a law forbidding incitement to racial hatred .
British National Party Chairman Nick Griffin was convicted under the law for handing out BNP material that denied the Holocaust .
Of course , the specter of the Holocaust is one reason many European nations adopted speech codes .
No one wants such a great evil to happen again .
The way to prevent that , though , is not to make anti-Semitic statements illegal .
All that does is drive the crazies who preach such things underground , making it harder to expose and ridicule them .
By allowing citizens to express their views in letters to the editor , interviews and newspaper ads , the rest of us can know their beliefs and , through the same channels , discredit them .
Miss Bardot is a French icon who once was the model for the Gallic national symbol Marianne .
The sad thing is , if she wants to start a debate over her growing concerns about the future of her country , she ’ll have to move to the United States to do so .

My Visions ,
My dreams , my life A journey of 1000 miles begins with a first step ( .. Not sure who said this , some say Confucius , other say King Lau Tzu .
But my Dad used to say it ALL the time ! )
The Internet has made it possible to make all of our thoughts available to everyone ... quite literally , the whole world !
In doing so , our capacity to touch lives , make friends , and share interests has been multiplied beyond anything before in history .
Well I , for one , have a lot to share .
So much in fact , that I 've avoided starting this process for a very long time , as it seemed an endless task .
But as my Father always said , a journey of 1000 miles begins with the first step !
So with that said , here is my ' home home ' page .
No , I did n't mistype .
My interests are sufficiently diverse , that this starting ' home ' page will also serve as a launch pad for many home pages .
kind of a ' site map ' to my life !
That may or may not make sense , but it will help me to organize my thinking a little !
Bear with me though , as this is a labor of love that will likely branch out a long way .
And though one of my many interests is computer programming , building web sites is something I 've still much to learn about .
Peter Pan's
Home page !
My business card says " Guitarist , Inventor , Engineer , Eternal Child " .
That last item should give you some insight into myself , and that 's what this site is about .
It may seem to be more of a vanity page than anything else , but it is more .
It is an opportunity to share my dreams and through doing so , make new friends and see just how many other " eternal children " are out there .
My Music
As a guitarist for many years , I 've done some songwriting , played in some bands , and have worked extensively with midi , electronics , and software to enhance my craft .
Recent technology certainly has made this an exciting time to be a musician !
After much encouragement from fans and friends , I 've compiled a CD with several original tunes ( plus one ' cover ' song ) ranging in style from rock / alternative to ' techno ' to latin and light jazz .
That 's the CD cover on the right , and yes , the one ' cover ' song is a Rock version of the familiar ' I wo n't Grow Up ! '
All the instrumentation , vocals , and arrangements on this CD are my own , and your purchase of this CD will aid kids charities as well !
On this page you 'll also be able to hear some of my older jazz ramblings , some with canned backgrounds and others live , in both swing / bebop styles as well as some less structured free improvisation .
Enjoy !
Through The Cracks Ministries .
I make no claim to being a prophet or special messenger of any kind , but it does n't take any special gift to see how many religious organizations are failing to represent Christ and the Love of God , and letting too many people fall " Through the Cracks " .
This is not always the case , but it happens far too often .
The Lord has asked only one thing of me , and that is to tell his children that he loves ALL of them .
So if you 've ever sought the Lord and found yourself beaten down by religion , you should definitely check into this site .

For my so called " day job " , I 've been a computer programmer and an electronic designer for many decades now ( I 'm older than I look ! ) .
Now as an independent innovator , I 've created this website to begin to inventions and home grown devices , many related to music , while offering a myriad of electronic and software design services .
While everything I do these days is a labor of love , this site will hopefully produce some revenue as well .
This site is reasonably mobile friendly , though I expect actual visitor product research will still be done best with a desktop machine , where product details and images can be better viewed .

-- By the Way ! --
It is 2015 as I write this updated note , and many pages on some of these sites were first created back around the year 2000 !
Even on some newer pages the styling is mostly " old school " , and will likely stay that way even as I update the coding .
The majority of it still displays on any browser of almost any age , which is a testament to the authors committment to compatibility and is one reason the site won a Webby Award a year after it debuted .
Note that some of it now does require Javascript and cookies to work correctly , so if you disable either and something does not work , do n't shoot the messenger !
Note too that the code was all written before smart phones or tablets , and while I am slowly making the pages more mobile friendly over time , for now expect to deal with very small text on lots of pages .
The site is huge so you 'll need to be patient about such updates .
Enjoy .

Kathmandu , Nepal ( CNN ) -- A U.S. citizen holding a " Free Tibet " banner has been turned back from the slopes of Mount Everest , a Nepalese army officer said .
The incident comes as authorities in Nepal tighten security on Mount Everest in advance of the scheduled arrival of the Olympic torch in early May .
An international torch relay has been dogged by pro-Tibet protesters in several cities around the world .
The Olympic flame arrived in Australia on Wednesday morning after a relatively incident - free run in Indonesia .
Do n't Miss Sydney bridge protests ahead of torch run
The U.S. citizen was turned back Monday , the army officer told CNN on condition of anonymity .
Nepal strictly controls anti-Chinese activity on its soil and has deployed troops on the world 's highest peak .
Organizers plan to take the Olympic torch to the summit of Everest in early to mid May .
Nepal has about 25 security personnel on the mountain , including 15 soldiers trained in mountain warfare , the army officer said .
Security forces on the mountain have permission to shoot mountaineers engaged in anti-Chinese activities , according to a Home Ministry official .

Some people are seduced by strange and exotic lands abroad , and though I admit a weakness for the faraway , I also seek out surreal -- and often overlooked -- landscapes close to home .
While back home in Southwest Florida for the holidays , I rediscovered a few .
( After you read about this one , we 'd love it if you 'd share some of your own ! )
Rotonda Sands , the " Aborted Suburb "
I grew up in Southern Florida , the land of sleepy golf communities , condo developments and down - in - the - mouth pseudo - resorts .
One of the best known such communities in my area was called " Rotonda , " the name - appropriateness of which becomes pretty obvious when the community is seen from the air ( thanks , Google Maps ) .
Founded in the 1960s , it 's about a mile in diameter and packed with golf courses and modest vacation homes -- or at least , about 3 / 4 of its pie-shaped volume is .
The other 1 / 4 pie-wedge never really came to fruition -- despite , rumor has it , investments from such high - profilers as Ed McMahon and O.J. Simpson -- and so for years the wedge , known as " Rotonda Sands , " sat undeveloped and largely untrammeled , even though overeager planners had gridded it with streets , cul - de- sacs , fire hydrants and even street signs ; all the trappings of suburbia , with none of the houses .
Needless to say , by the time my friends and I had discovered this desolate locale some 30 years later , its streets now cracked , signage faded and lots wildly overgrown by aggressive Floridian undergrowth , it had become a surreal place indeed .
Evidence of old campfires and piles of garbage made it clear that the only visitors to these empty cul - de - sacs ( pictured ) were drifters and teenagers looking for a good time away from prying eyes .
( Also , drug planes had used its long streets as landing strips back in the 70s and 80s , though we never found any bricks of heroin among the weeds . )
My friends and I graduated and left town , and until last week , it had been years since I paid a visit to our local wasteland .
Curious to see if the mid-2000s Florida housing boom had done anything to change Rotonda Sands ' state of perpetual purgatory , I drove down the other day .
To my great surprise , what had been an empty grid for nearly 30 years was suddenly pocked with houses !
But as I drove around , wondering who in their right minds would want to live way out in this peculiar boondock , it slowly dawned on me that , for the most part , the answer was nobody .
The houses were either empty or , in most cases , unfinished -- the hurricanes of 2004 and the decline in the housing market had dealt a one - two punch to the whole area , knocking Rotunda Sands back into the stone age just as it was getting to its feet .
If anything , the new ruins which now populate the Sands make it an even stranger and sadder place ; it now has the feeling of a kind of architectural mausoleum or a bombed - out city , with the few people who actually finished their houses and moved in before the crash acting as its lonely caretakers -- whereas before it had just been evidence of best - laid plans that never came to fruition .
I 'm told that the area has become a magnet for thieves ; the air conditioning units and copper wiring left in the unfinished homes tend to disappear , eventually finding their way to the resale market .
More photos : it does n't take long for nature to start reclaiming its territory .
Most of the houses are identical in design ; their only differences are the degree to which they 're unfinished .
The lizard loves his new house .
This blank billboard on the outskirts of Rotonda Sands kinda sums it up .
( For sale : nothing ! )
December 2011 Update !
Rotonda Sands is beginning to look like a normal , if somewhat sparsely built - out , housing development .
They 've replaced all the fading signs with brand new ones , finished building nearly all the half - built houses , and there are cars in driveways and kids riding their bikes around , and some new hiking trails nearby .
Not such a Strange Geography anymore , as it turns out .
So think of the above as a snapshot from history , not something you can expect to find if you visit Rotonda today .

It ’s accepted that a large meteor impact 65 million years ago was responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs .
Which opened up niches for birds and mammals .
But last week at an evolution conference at The Rockefeller University in New York City , New Zealand biologist David Penny questioned whether the dinosaurs might not have already been on their way out .
Penny concentrated on fossils of pterodactyls and birds .
Turns out that the average wing spans of pterodactyls had been getting steadily larger before the big impact .
By the time the meteor hit , pterodactyls still making a mark in the fossil record had wingspans well over 30 feet .
Meanwhile , it looks like the Cretaceous version of shore birds were becoming relatively common , based on fossil findings .
So perhaps the smaller pterodactyls had disappeared because the new kid in town , birds , were out - competing them .
Penny ’s view was certainly not uniformly accepted by other meeting attendees .
But it ’s an interesting question , whether the meteor might have been not the first strike , but the last straw .

The Air Force is tightening restrictions on which blogs its troops can read , cutting off access to just about any independent site with the word " blog " in its web address .
It 's the latest move in a larger struggle within the military over the value – and hazards – of the sites .
At least one senior Air Force official calls the squeeze so " utterly stupid , it makes me want to scream . "
Until recently , each major command of the Air Force had some control over what sites their troops could visit , the Air Force Times reports .
Then the Air Force Network Operations Center , under the service 's new " Cyber Command , " took over .
AFNOC has imposed bans on all sites with " blog " in their URLs , thus cutting off any sites hosted by
Blogspot .
Other blogs , and sites in general , are blocked based on content reviews performed at the base , command and AFNOC level ...
The idea is n't to keep airmen in the dark – they can still access news sources that are " primary , official - use sources , " said Maj .
Henry
Schott , A5 for Air Force Network Operations .
" Basically ... if it 's a place like The New York Times , an established , reputable media outlet , then it 's fairly cut and dry that that 's a good source , an authorized source , " he said ... AFNOC blocks sites by using Blue Coat software , which categorizes sites based on their content and allows users to block sub-categories as they choose .
" Often , we block first and then review exceptions , " said Tech .
Sgt. Christopher
DeWitt , a Cyber Command spokesman .
As a result , airmen posting online have cited instances of seemingly innocuous sites – such as educational databases and some work - related sites – getting wrapped up in broad proxy filters .
" A couple of years back , I fought this issue concerning the Counterterrorism Blog , " one Air Force officer tells Danger Room .
" An AF [ Air Force ] professional education course website recommended it as a great source for daily worldwide CT [ counterterrorism ] news .
However it had been banned , because it called itself a blog .
And as we all know , all blogs are bad ! "
He 's joking , of course .
But blogs and social networking sites have faced all sorts of restrictions on military networks , for all sorts of reasons .
MySpace and YouTube are officially banned , for eating up too much bandwidth .
Stringent regulations , read literally , require Army officers to review each and every item one of his soldiers puts online , in case they leak secrets .
And in televised commercials , screensavers and fliers , troops are told that blogging is a major security risk – even though official sites have proven to leak many , many more secrets .
Now there 's the Air Force 's argument , that blogs are n't legitimate media outlets – and therefore , should n't be read at work .
But this view is n't universally held in the military .
Many believe blogs to be a valuable source of information – and a way for ordinary troops to shape opinions , at home and abroad .
Gen. David Petraeus , who heads the U.S. effort in Iraq , has commended military bloggers .
Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV , who replaced Petraeus as the head of the Combined Arms Center and Fort
Leavenworth , recently wrote ( in a blog post , no less ) that soldiers should be encouraged to " get onto blogs and [ s ] end their YouTube videos to their friends and family . "
Within the Air Force , there 's also a strong contingent that wants to see open access to the sites – and is mortified by the AFNOC 's restrictions . *
*" When I hear stuff this utterly stupid , it makes me want to scream ....
Piles of torn out hair are accumulating around my desk as we speak , " one senior
Air Force official writes in an e-mail .
" I 'm certain that by blocking blogs for official use , our airmen will never , ever be able to read them on their own home computers , so we have indeed saved them from a contaminating influence .
Sorry , did n't mean to drip sarcasm on your rug . "
One of the blogs banned is In From the Cold , which examines military , intelligence and political affairs from a largely right - of - center perspective .
It 's written by " Nathan Hale , " the pseudonym for a former journalist and Air Force intelligence officer , who spent more than two decades in the service .
He tells Danger Room , " If knowledge and information are power – and no one disputes that – then why not trust your people and empower them to explore all sides of issues affecting the service , air power and national security ? "
**
Obviously , DoD [ Department of Defense ] can decide what internet content should be filtered – they spent billions on the IT architecture and billions more to maintain it .
But if it 's a matter of " ensuring worker productivity "
and deterring " wasteful surfing of the internet , " does it really make sense to block relatively small blogs ( that just happen to focus on military and security issues ) , while allowing everyone to access ESPN
or FoxSports ?
Wonder how much work time will be lost on filling out
" March Madness " brackets , versus reading a military or intelligence blog ? *
In short , there does n't seem to be any consistency in the current DoD
policy .
And that 's no surprise .
A few months ago , a senior Pentagon
P.A. [ public affairs ] official told me that his service had no plans to engage the blogosphere , because their studies showed that " people do n't rely on blogs for news and information . "
And he said it with a straight face . *
The Air Force recently launched an $ 81 million marketing campaign to convince lawmakers and average citizens of its relevance in today 's fights .
By making it harder for troops to blog , an Air Force officer says , the service had undermined " some of their most credible advocates . "
" The Air Force is n't getting the planes that they want because they are incapable of communicating their usefulness and applicability in this new war .
Because Air Force officers talk more like corporate bureaucrats than cocky war fighters , no one is inspired or convinced of their pressing ( and quite legitimate ) need to modernize the force , " he adds .
" Air Force bloggers spoke the lingo of someone heavily invested in the fight , because they operate outside the survival - minded careerist world of public affairs , with many of them penning blog posts from theater . "
Perhaps , says retired Air Force Col .
Tom Ehrhard , who 's now a Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .
But there are legitimate security reasons why blogs need to be restricted .
Adversaries may be using blogs to take advantage of airmen , he notes .
It is increasingly clear that active exploitation could take advantage of airmen and civilians who want to inform and correct the often outrageous , false assertions on these blogs .
In doing so , it is easy for well - meaning insiders to violate operational security ( OPSEC )
tenets , either directly or tangentially .
We are in a different world today when it comes to sensitive military information , and foreign intelligence operatives surely understand this and will exploit it .
As a former member of Strategic Air Command , where OPSEC was ( rightly ) an obsession , this has been obvious to me for some time in reading aerospace - oriented blogs .
This policy strikes me as a timely reminder to Air Force professionals that they should be on guard when blogging , because someone is watching .
UPDATE : I 'm getting a lot of conflicting data about exactly which blogs are blocked , and which ones are n't .
Shoot me a note if you 're currently in the Air Force , and would like to help set me straight .
All off - the - record , naturally .

Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen were all smiles in 1983 just after delivering MS Dos for the Tandy laptop and signing a contract to write MS - DOS for IBM .
Photo : Doug Wilson / Corbis __1975 : __ Bill Gates and Paul Allen create a partnership called Micro - soft .
It will grow into one of the largest U.S. corporations and place them among the world 's richest people .
Gates and Allen had been buddies and fellow Basic programmers at Lakeside School in Seattle .
Allen graduated before Gates and enrolled at Washington State University .11
They built a computer based on an Intel 8008 chip and used it to analyze traffic data for the Washington state highway department , doing business as Traf - O - Data .
Allen went to work for Honeywell in Boston , and Gates enrolled at Harvard University in nearby Cambridge .
News in late 1974 of the first personal computer kit , the Altair 8800 , excited them , but they knew they could improve its performance with Basic .
Allen spoke to Ed Roberts , president of Altair manufacturer MITS ( Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems ) , and sold him on the idea .
Gates and Allen worked night and day to complete the first microcomputer Basic .
Allen moved to Albuquerque , New Mexico , in January 1975 to become director of software for MITS .
Gates dropped out of his sophomore year at Harvard and joined Allen in Albuquerque .
Allen was 22 ; Gates was 19 .
Altair Basic was functioning by March .
The " Micro - soft " partnership was sealed in April , but would n't get its name for a few more months .
The fledgling company also created versions of Basic for the hot - selling Apple II and Radio Shack 's TRS - 80 .
Microsoft moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue , Washington , in 1979 .
It incorporated in 1981 , a few weeks before IBM introduced its personal computer with Microsoft 's 16 - bit operating system , MS - DOS 1.0 .
The thriving young company moved again in 1986 , this time to a new corporate campus in Redmond , Washington .
Microsoft stock went public in March 1986 .
Adjusting for splits , a share of that stock is worth almost 280 times its original value today ( or more than 140 times , even accounting for inflation ) .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The number of Americans who believe that the country is ready for a black president is rising , a poll released Thursday suggested .
Sen. Barack Obama campaigns Thursday in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
More than three quarters , 76 percent , of respondents in a CNN / Essence Magazine / Opinion Research Corp.
poll said the country is ready to be led by an African - American , up 14 percentage points since December 2006 .
Some of the rise can be attributed to the success of Sen. Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primaries , said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
" We 're not asking this question in a vacuum .
In many cases , respondents must have had Obama in mind when giving their answer , even though he is not mentioned anywhere in the questionnaire , " Holland said .
The senator from Illinois is locked in a battle with Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Obama leads Clinton in states won , in delegates pledged and in the overall popular vote in the primaries and caucuses held .
The poll also indicates that more whites than blacks think the country is ready for a black president .
Of the white Americans surveyed , 78 percent said the country is ready , as opposed to 69 percent of African - Americans polled .
Both numbers are up substantially from December 2006 .
Watch panel debate candidates ' campaign strategies »
" Drawing on their own life experience , blacks are a little more skeptical than whites .
But blacks , too , have come around , particularly after the Iowa caucuses demonstrated that Obama could win in an overwhelmingly white electorate , " said Bill Schneider , CNN senior political analyst .
" Among blacks , the belief that the country is ready for an African - American president is highest among blacks who share traits with Obama , " Holland said .
" Optimism about the country 's acceptance of a black president is higher among black men than among black women , higher among college - educated blacks than among those with no college degree and higher among younger blacks than older blacks , " Holland said .
The poll also suggested that more Americans think the country is ready for a black president than a female president .
Sixty - three percent of those surveyed say the country is ready for a female president , 13 points lower than those who say the country is ready for a black president .
" Do Americans see more prejudice against a woman than an African - American ?
More likely , they see more negative feelings about this woman than about this African - American .
Because it 's true .
More people have an unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton than of Barack Obama , " Schneider said .
The poll asked whether the country is ready for a black or female president , not whether respondents would vote for a black or female president .
" Few people will acknowledge their own prejudices , but they will answer whether they think the country is ready to elect a black or woman president , " Schneider said .
The poll was conducted by telephone from March 26 to April 2 , with 2,184 Americans questioned , including 1,014 blacks and 1,001 whites .
The survey is being released on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
Those polled were asked whether they felt that the U.S. has fulfilled King 's vision spelled out in his " I have a dream " speech in Washington in 1963 .
Thirty - four percent said yes ; 41 percent said no but that they believe it 's possible ; and 19 percent said no , that it is impossible .
The survey 's margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points for the overall sample and plus or minus 3 percentage points for the questions asked just to blacks or whites .

A government - appointed panel of experts is warning that the new ID cards system will be open to fraud by the people running it .
In a potentially damaging revelation , which undermines claims that the scheme will enhance national security , the group has concluded that it will be prone to corruption .
A new report by the Independent Scheme Assurance Panel ( Isap ) , set up to advise the government on the implementation of ID cards , states : ' Based on the likelihood that the scheme will aggregate a lot of valuable data , there is the risk that its trusted administrators will make improper use of this data . '
It adds : ' The scheme will be subject to data errors and errors in decisions made . '
The acknowledgements come as the government has admitted it is to contract out the taking of fingerprints and photographs of ID card applicants to the private sector to save money .
The news has alarmed opponents of the scheme , who say this will increase the risk that the data of individuals will be illegally shared with third parties .
' By cutting costs and cutting corners , the Home Office has fundamentally undermined the integrity of the scheme , ' said Phil Booth , spokesman for the campaign group , No2ID .
The Isap report goes on to warn that the scheme may not be embraced by government departments , suggesting the cards are not being well received in some Whitehall departments .
The panel also warns the initiative is struggling to fulfil its remit .
It states that the scheme lacks a ' robust and transparent operational data governance regime and clear data architecture ' , suggesting there is confusion over its roll - out .
And it goes on to say : ' Though the tender process is supposedly well advanced , requirements for information , communication and technology systems , processes and operations have still to be adequately specified and the rationale for key design decisions is unclear . '
The report is potentially damaging to the government as it battles to convince the public of the necessity for the cards .
The Conservatives have pledged to scrap the scheme and spend money on building prisons instead .
A spokesman for the Home Office said the decision to outsource the biometric part of the ID cards contract to the private sector was taken on cost grounds .
' Using the private sector to provide biometric enrolment will give applicants a choice of competing services which should maximise convenience and drive down price , ' the spokesman said .
And he said there was no risk to security .
' The private sector will provide the Immigration and Passport Service with the photograph and fingerprints of applicants but will have no decision - making powers over who is eligible for a passport or identity card , ' the spokesman said .
' This will be made by security - cleared civil servants . '
But No2ID said the sysyem was open to corruption .
' Ministers pride themselves on biometrics and security , ' Booth said .
' But now this is going out to all and sundry . '
An appeals court has upheld a lower court 's ruling that Dish Networks '
DVRs infringe on software patents held by TiVo .
In a unanimous opinion ( PDF ) issued earlier today , the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a district court jury 's verdict that DVRs made by Dish Network infringed on patent 6,233,389 for a " multimedia time warping system . "
The court also remanded the verdict on hardware patent infringements back to the district court for further proceedings .
There 's more good news for TiVo : the $ 89.6 million damage award to TiVo was also upheld , and the court left open the possibility that the lower court could award additional damages based on the time that has elapsed since the original verdict and today 's ruling .
Last , and perhaps most troubling for Dish , the company faces the very real possibility that it will be barred from selling DVRs and forced to disable the functionality on devices already in customers ' homes .
That 's because the appeals court affirmed a permanent injunction against their sale an operation and said that the stay against its enforcement will end once the appeal becomes final .
TiVo originally sued Dish Networks ( formerly known as EchoStar ) back in 2005 .
The jury 's verdict against Dish came in April 2006 , with the injunction issued in August 2006 .
Dish filed a countersuit against TiVo , but that suit was put on hold while the US Patent and Trademark Office reexamined the patents in question .
This past November , the validity of the patents was reaffirmed .
With the validity of the patents , the damage award , and the jury verdict all upheld upon appeal , Dish appears to be out of options .
The satellite TV provider is now faced with the unpleasant decision of whether to stop selling DVRs and shut off its DVR service , hope against hope that the Supreme Court decides to hear the case , or write an eight - or nine - figure check to TiVo to cover damages and license the patents .
At this point , the latter option is Dish Network 's best bet .

He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325 , 326 , 327 , 328 , 329 , and 330 .
He began , therefore , by visiting them , in order to add to his knowledge .
The first of them was inhabited by a king .
Clad in royal purple and ermine , he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic .
" Ah !
Here is a subject , " exclaimed the king , when he saw the little prince coming .
And the little prince asked himself :
" How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before ? "
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings .
To them , all men are subjects .
" Approach , so that I may see you better , " said the king , who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody .
The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down ; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king 's magnificent ermine robe .
So he remained standing upright , and , since he was tired , he yawned .
" It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king , " the monarch said to him .
" I forbid you to do so . "
" I can't help it .
I ca n't stop myself , " replied the little prince , thoroughly embarrassed .
" I have come on a long journey , and I have had no sleep . . . "
" Ah , then , " the king said .
" I order you to yawn .
It is years since I have seen anyone yawning .
Yawns , to me , are objects of curiosity .
Come , now !
Yawn again !
It is an order . "
" That frightens me . . .
I cannot , any more . . . " murmured the little prince , now completely abashed .
" Hum ! Hum ! " replied the king .
" Then I - - I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to --"
He sputtered a little , and seemed vexed .
For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected .
He tolerated no disobedience .
He was an absolute monarch .
But , because he was a very good man , he made his orders reasonable .
" If I ordered a general , " he would say , by way of example , " if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird , and if the general did not obey me , that would not be the fault of the general .
It would be my fault . "
" May I sit down ? " came now a timid inquiry from the little prince .
" I order you to do so , " the king answered him , and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle .
But the little prince was wondering . . .
The planet was tiny .
Over what could this king really rule ?
" Sire , " he said to him , " I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question - - "
" I order you to ask me a question , " the king hastened to assure him .
" Sire - - over what do you rule ? "
" Over everything , " said the king , with magnificent simplicity .
" Over everything ? "
The king made a gesture , which took in his planet , the other planets , and all the stars .
" Over all that ? " asked the little prince .
" Over all that , " the king answered .
For his rule was not only absolute : it was also universal .
" And the stars obey you ? "
" Certainly they do , " the king said .
" They obey instantly .
I do not permit insubordination . "
Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at .
If he had been master of such complete authority , he would have been able to watch the sunset , not forty - four times in one day , but seventy - two , or even a hundred , or even two hundred times , without ever having to move his chair .
And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken , he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor :
" I should like to see a sunset . . .
Do me that kindness . . .
Order the sun to set . . . "
" If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly , or to write a tragic drama , or to change himself into a sea bird , and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received , which one of us would be in the wrong ? " the king demanded .
" The general , or myself ? "
" You , " said the little prince firmly .
" Exactly .
One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform , " the king went on .
" Accepted authority rests first of all on reason .
If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea , they would rise up in revolution .
I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable . "
" Then my sunset ? " the little prince reminded him : for he never forgot a question once he had asked it .
" You shall have your sunset .
I shall command it .
But , according to my science of government , I shall wait until conditions are favorable . "
" When will that be ? " inquired the little prince .
" Hum ! Hum ! " replied the king ; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac .
" Hum !
Hum !
That will be about - - about -- that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight .
And you will see how well I am obeyed ! "
The little prince yawned .
He was regretting his lost sunset .
And then , too , he was already beginning to be a little bored .
" I have nothing more to do here , " he said to the king .
" So I shall set out on my way again . "
" Do not go , " said the king , who was very proud of having a subject .
" Do not go .
I will make you a Minister ! "
" Minister of what ? "
" Minster of - - of Justice ! "
" But there is nobody here to judge ! "
" We do not know that , " the king said to him .
" I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom .
I am very old .
There is no room here for a carriage .
And it tires me to walk . "
" Oh , but I have looked already ! " said the little prince , turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet .
On that side , as on this , there was nobody at all . . .
" Then you shall judge yourself , " the king answered .
" that is the most difficult thing of all .
It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others .
If you succeed in judging yourself rightly , then you are indeed a man of true wisdom . "
" Yes , " said the little prince , " but I can judge myself anywhere .
I do not need to live on this planet .
" Hum ! Hum ! " said the king .
" I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat .
I hear him at night .
You can judge this old rat .
From time to time you will condemn him to death .
Thus his life will depend on your justice .
But you will pardon him on each occasion ; for he must be treated thriftily .
He is the only one we have . "
" I , " replied the little prince , " do not like to condemn anyone to death .
And now I think I will go on my way . "
" No , " said the king .
But the little prince , having now completed his preparations for departure , had no wish to grieve the old monarch .
" If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed , " he said , " he should be able to give me a reasonable order .
He should be able , for example , to order me to be gone by the end of one minute .
It seems to me that conditions are favorable . . . "
As the king made no answer , the little prince hesitated a moment .
Then , with a sigh , he took his leave .
" I make you my Ambassador , " the king called out , hastily .
He had a magnificent air of authority .
" The grown - ups are very strange , " the little prince said to himself , as he continued on his journey .
Just after finishing their battle for the 75th Honinbo title Shibano Toramaru and Iyama Yuta meet again for the 45th Meijin title .
This time the role of title hlder and challenger are reversed though .
Iyama had to work hard to become challenger .
He needed to win all his league games to stay ahead of Ichiriki Ryo who ended 2nd with 7 out of 8 wins .
For both an astonishing accomplishment .
It 's just amazing : Iyama took the Honinbo title for the 9th time in a row .
The challenger , Shibano Toramaru , put up a great fight but in the end was only able to take the 4th game .
We cannot wait for the next edition of this tournament .
After a very exciting game challenger Kyo Kagen took the lead against title holder Iyama Yuta .
However , the 2nd game soon became favorable for the title holder .
Several ko fights complicated things but not the outcome .
The 3rd game showed some complicated fighting which turned out favorable for the challenger .
The 4th game again featured interesting fighting with some remarkable furikawari as a result .
So the 5th game was all deciding ...
The match everyone was waiting for : Iyama Yuta versus Shibano Toramaru .
They play for the Oza title , Iyama defending it , Shibano challenging .
One day before his 20th birthday Shibano Toramaru gave himself a great present : the 44th Meijin title .
In an exciting game with large exchanges a huge ko decided the outcome of the game .
And although Cho U played some more endgame the outcome was inevitable .
Cho U , title holder of the Meijin title faces kadoban against challenger Shibano Toramaru .
The score : 3 - 1 , so one more loss and Shibano will be the new Meijin at the age of 20 years .
Hane Naoki has taken the 44th Gosei title by winning the exciting final game of the best - of - five match .
The Gosei title match will go all the way this year .
By winning the fourth game Kyo Kagen leveled the score ( 2 - 2 ) against challenger Hane Naoki .
To be continued on the 23rd of August .
LONDON , April 29 ( Reuters ) - Lawyers for former detainees are preparing to sue the British government and intelligence services for alleged complicity in abuse of terrorism suspects by the United States and Pakistan .
The cases , if they reach court , would be among the first anywhere to examine alleged wrongdoing by spy agencies in the U.S. - led “ war on terrorism ” .
Similar lawsuits in the United States have been thrown out on grounds of national security .
Lawyers for eight former inmates of the U.S. Guantanamo
Bay prison camp in Cuba are launching proceedings to sue Britain for alleged complicity with their abduction , ill - treatment and interrogation , sources familiar with the case say .
Five are British and three are foreign nationals living in Britain .
And Salahuddin Amin , a British man who is appealing against his conviction last year for involvement in an al Qaeda - inspired bomb plot , is preparing a civil action alleging British acquiescence in what he says was torture by Pakistan ’s ISI security agency , his lawyer Tayab Ali said on Tuesday .
“ The civil action will take the form of suing members of the British government , establishment , who we feel are responsible for his treatment , or who acquiesced to it at the very least -- failed in their duty to prevent that from happening , ” Ali said .
“ We have a list of individuals , some of whom are named , that we intend to process against , ” he added in a telephone interview .
In an account of his treatment , published in The Guardian newspaper , Amin said he was held for 10 months by Pakistan ’s ISI in 2004 and subjected to repeated torture sessions , including savage beatings and being threatened with an electric drill .
These were interspersed with interviews with two members of Britain ’s MI5 intelligence service , calling themselves Matt and Chris , at which Amin said he would be asked the same questions , and give the same replies , as in the preceding torture sessions .
Britain and the United States deny allegations by human rights groups that they have “ outsourced torture ” by exploiting intelligence information extracted from terrorist suspects held in countries where prisoner abuse is rife .
British intelligence officers have questioned suspects held by third countries , but “ we never use torture under any circumstances and we never instigate others to commit it ” , a security source said .
“ We do n’t comment on individual cases but we do take our responsibilities very seriously .
All our staff ... are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working at home and overseas . ”
Amin raised the torture allegations at his London trial , which ended in April last year , but was convicted with four others .
British security agents responded to his charges but their evidence was given in camera , with the press excluded .
The Guardian said two other Britons formerly held in Pakistan on suspicion of terrorism have alleged they were tortured there .
One said he had three fingernails pulled out with a pair of pliers .

Nearly 20 percent of military service members who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan — 300,000 in all — report symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder or major depression , yet only slightly more than half have sought treatment , according to a new RAND Corporation study .
In addition , researchers found about 19 percent of returning service members report that they experienced a possible traumatic brain injury while deployed , with 7 percent reporting both a probable brain injury and current PTSD or major depression .
Many service members said they do not seek treatment for psychological illnesses because they fear it will harm their careers .
But even among those who do seek help for PTSD or major depression , only about half receive treatment that researchers consider " minimally adequate " for their illnesses .
In the first analysis of its kind , researchers estimate that PTSD and depression among returning service members will cost the nation as much as $ 6.2 billion in the two years following deployment — an amount that includes both direct medical care and costs for lost productivity and suicide .
Investing in more high - quality treatment could save close to $ 2 billion within two years by substantially reducing those indirect costs , the 500 - page study concludes .
" There is a major health crisis facing those men and women who have served our nation in Iraq and Afghanistan , " said Terri Tanielian , the project 's co-leader and a researcher at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
" Unless they receive appropriate and effective care for these mental health conditions , there will be long - term consequences for them and for the nation .
Unfortunately , we found there are many barriers preventing them from getting the high - quality treatment they need . "
The findings are from the first large - scale , nongovernmental assessment of the psychological and cognitive needs of military service members who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past six years .
The RAND study is the first to comprehensively assess the current needs of returned service members from all branches of the military .
Researchers concluded that a major national effort is needed to expand and improve the capacity of the mental health system to provide effective care to service members and veterans .
The effort must include the military , veteran and civilian health care systems , and should focus on training more providers to use high - quality , evidence - based treatment methods and encouraging service members and veterans to seek needed care .
Since October 2001 , about 1.6 million U.S. troops have deployed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , with many exposed to prolonged periods of combat - related stress or traumatic events .
Early evidence suggests that the psychological toll of the deployments may be disproportionately high compared with physical injuries .
Tanielian and project co-leader Lisa Jaycox headed a group of 25 RAND researchers who conducted a three - pronged assessment of the needs of returning service members : a national survey of those who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan to assess their psychological and cognitive injuries ; economic modeling to estimate the cost not only of providing needed treatment , as well as the costs associated with lost productivity and suicide ; and an assessment of treatment services that are available to service members , as well as barriers to treatment .
Researchers surveyed 1,965 service members from 24 communities across the country to assess their exposure to traumatic events and possible brain injury while deployed , evaluate current symptoms of psychological illness , and gauge whether they have received care for combat - related problems .
Service members reported exposure to a wide range of traumatic events while deployed , with half saying they had a friend who was seriously wounded or killed , 45 percent reporting they saw dead or seriously injured non-combatants , and over 10 percent saying they were injured themselves and required hospitalization .
Rates of PTSD and major depression were highest among Army soldiers and Marines , and among service members who were no longer on active duty ( people in the reserves and those who had been discharged or retired from the military ) .
Women , Hispanics and enlisted personnel all were more likely to report symptoms of PTSD and major depressions , but the single best predictor of PTSD and depression was exposure to combat trauma while deployed .
Researchers found many treatment gaps exist for those with PTSD and depression .
Just 53 percent of service members with PTSD or depression sought help from a provider over the past year , and of those who sought care , roughly half got minimally adequate treatment .
" If PTSD and depression go untreated or are under treated , there is a cascading set of consequences , " Jaycox said .
" Drug use , suicide , marital problems and unemployment are some of the consequences .
There will be a bigger societal impact if these service members go untreated .
The consequences are not good for the individuals or society in general . "
Service members report many reasons for not seeking treatment .
Many are worried about the side effects of medication or believe that family and friends can provide more help than a mental health professional .
Even more reported that they worried seeking care might damage their career or cause their peers to lose confidence in their abilities .
The RAND report recommends the military create a system that would allow service members to receive mental health services confidentially in order to ease concerns about negative career repercussions .
" We need to remove the institutional cultural barriers that discourage soldiers from seeking care , " Tanielian said .
" Just because someone is getting mental health care does not mean that they are not able to do their job .
Seeking mental health treatment should be seen as a sign of strength and interest in getting better , not a weakness .
People need to get help as early as possible , not only once their symptoms become severe and disabling . "
Researchers also found an urgent need to train more mental health providers throughout the U.S. health care system on delivering evidence - based treatments to service members and veterans .
While many opportunities for treatment exist for active - duty personnel , there is no system in place to monitor the quality of those services to ensure they are getting the latest science - based forms of treatment .
The Department of Defense 's newly created Defense Center for Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury may provide a historic opportunity to change the culture of psychological health within the military and to promote and monitor the use of high - quality care to service members .
The RAND report provides information that the center could use to pursue these objectives through the use of innovative care models and performance measurement techniques .
Researchers suggest special training programs are needed to instruct mental health providers in the military , veterans and civilian health systems about the type of evidence - based treatments needed by service members .
Only providers with such training should be eligible to treat service members and payment programs should be retooled to reward providers who use science - based treatments .
" It 's going to take system - level changes — not a series of small band - aids — to improve treatments for these illnesses , " Tanielian said .
The RAND study estimates the societal costs of PTSD and major depression for two years after deployment range from about $ 6,000 to more than $ 25,000 per case .
Depending whether the economic cost of suicide is included , the RAND study estimates the total society costs of the conditions for two years range from $ 4 billion to $ 6.2 billion .
The RAND study also estimates that about 320,000 service members may have experienced a traumatic brain injury during deployment — the term used to describe a range of injuries from mild concussions to severe penetrating head wounds .
Just 43 percent reported ever being evaluated by a physician for that injury .
While most civilian traumatic brain injuries are mild and do not lead to long - term impairments , the extent of impairments that service members experience and whether they require treatment is largely unknown , researchers said .
In the absence of a medical examination and prognosis , however , service members may believe that their post - deployment difficulties are due to head injuries even when they are not .
One - year estimates of the societal cost associated with treated cases of mild traumatic brain injury range up to $ 32,000 per case , while estimates for treated moderate to severe cases range from $ 268,000 to more than $ 408,000 .
Estimates of the total one - year societal cost of the roughly 2,700 cases of traumatic brain injury identified to date range from $ 591 million to $ 910 million .
The report is titled " Invisible Wounds of War : Psychological and Cognitive Injuries , Their Consequences , and Services to Assist Recovery . "
The full report and several summaries are available online .
The project , jointly conducted by RAND Health and the RAND National Security Research Division , was sponsored by a grant from the California Community Foundation .
RAND Health , a division of the RAND Corporation , is the nation 's largest independent health policy research program , with a broad research portfolio that focuses on quality , costs and health services delivery , among other topics .
The RAND National Security Research Division conducts research and analysis for the Office of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Staff , the Unified Commands , the defense agencies , the Department of the Navy , the U.S. intelligence community , allied foreign governments and foundations .
Initially questioned on suspicion of gross negligence , the photographers who pursued Diana and Dodi on the night of their deaths were later fined € 1 each for invasion of privacy
In the immediate aftermath of the Paris crash , photographers and press motorcyclists were hauled in by French police for questioning over any involvement they might have had in the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed .
The couple died barely six weeks after beginning a romance which , especially in the quiet news season of July and August , was a media sensation in 1997 .
Interest in their affair was further fuelled by rumours of an impending engagement and even a pregnancy .
The couple were relentlessly pursued while sailing on Dodi Fayed 's yacht , the Jonikal , and followed in southern France where grainy pictures of them kissing attracted bids of £ 500,000 .
The pursuit was characteristically frantic when they flew into Paris on August 30 1997 .
When the pair arrived at Le Bourget airfield in Paris , from Sardinia , Dodi told his driver on the occasion , Henri Paul , to evade the paparazzi who awaited them .
Photographers followed them from the airport to Villa Windsor , a former home of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor now owned by Mohamed Al Fayed , then to the Ritz Hotel , owned by Fayed senior at the time .
The photographers ' attentions prompted Dodi Fayed to abort an attempt to dine at the Chez Benoit bistro .
Returning to the Ritz , Fayed apparently conceived , or at least agreed to , a plan to outwit the paparazzi by sneaking out a back entrance while the regular limousine and backup car idled in front .
Stephane Darmon , a motorcycle rider for one of the paparazzi who chased the couple 's Mercedes through Paris , told the inquest that Paul had been " very joyful " as he taunted photographers outside the Ritz Hotel on the night of the crash .
" I think that he wanted to give wrong leads to photographers , " Darmon said after the crash , in a statement to police .
" He was trying to create a certain atmosphere of pressure and anticipation . "
Darmon was one of the first witnesses to arrive at the accident scene .
As his photographer , Romuald Rat , got off the bike , he opened the door of the Mercedes and said the princess was still alive .
Darmon said he expected the paparazzi to help the passengers of the vehicle but was shocked when they started taking photographs .
" I did not see the car any more because the light [ of the flashes ] was so bright .
It was continuous . "
Two witnesses , Antonio Lopes - Borges and Ana Simao , also testified that photographers climbed on to the car in which Diana , Dodi and Paul lay dying and took pictures instead of helping them .
Such statements placed the paparazzi under suspicion for gross negligence .
They were also investigated on grounds of invasion of the couple 's privacy .
Five days after the crash , French magistrates placed three more photographers under investigation for manslaughter , bringing the total number of suspects to 10 .
The role of the paparazzi has also become part of conspiracy theories .
Proponents of the latter point to CCTV footage of Paul on the night of the incident in which he is seen waving to photographers .
An Inspector Carpenter , giving evidence , said that one photographer sitting in his car near to where the couple would exit was in contact with other paparazzi across the road .
He explained to the jury : " You will see Henri Paul exit [ at the back of the hotel ] and when you watch this sequence you will see him raise his hand as if waving to the paparazzi across the road .
If you look at the paparazzi you will see one of them raises his camera . "
The images sparked beliefs that someone in the hotel was tipping off the paparazzi as to the princess 's movements .
There was also speculation that a white Fiat Uno , which was believed to have collided with the Mercedes , was driven by a photographer .
In February 1998 , private detectives working for Fayed claim to have found the mystery Fiat Uno .
They said it belonged to James Andanson , a French photographer who had been following Diana , taking pictures of her and Dodi , in the week before her death .
These claims were never proved .
What is known is that Dodi 's departure with Diana shortly after midnight was seen by at least three photographers , leading to a short , desperate chase that reached its tragic end in the underpass .
Coroner Lord Justice Scott Baker said the jury could attempt to identify photographers who might have been guilty of distracting or impeding the Mercedes , but he noted the difficulty of deciding which of the conflicting accounts of witnesses near the tunnel to believe .
He also warned the jury that the paparazzi's police statements read out in court should be treated with caution .
Many of them described Paul as being drunk but the statements came after the police had announced that the driver was above the drink - driving limit .
The witness accounts also revealed marked differences among the passers - by on the night .
The number of vehicles , whether they were cars or motorbikes , the number of people in them and what part they played in the crash were all points of contention .
All except one paparazzo refused to attend the inquest , making it even more difficult to piece together events that night .
None of them admitted seeing the Mercedes movements directly before the crash or being close enough to have any effect on it .
Rat admitted to being one of the " leading pursuers " but that he only took pictures of the crash scene after doctors arrived .
The coroner told the jury that this was not true .
Darmon , Rat 's driver , said his speed on the motorway had been about 60 mph and claimed no one had been able to keep up with the Mercedes .
Christian Martinez , another photographer who was in a black Fiat Uno , told French police : " Henri Paul was going much too fast ... maybe he swerved to avoid a vehicle that was travelling very slowly in front of him .
Then he lost control of the car . "
The coroner noted : " If you think that is what happened , you may like to ask how Martinez could have known that . "
He also noted there was evidence some had managed to get film out of the tunnel .
Serge Arnal , who also took photographs at the scene , said some of his colleagues got away before the police arrived , taking photographs with them .
Nine photographers were charged with manslaughter in France but the charges were thrown out in 2002 .
Only three photographers – Jacques Langevin , Christian Martinez and Fabrice Chassery – were convicted of invasion of privacy for taking pictures of the couple .
Each was fined € 1 in 2006 .
Some took shots from less than two metres away , with the dead and seriously injured clearly visible inside the mangled Mercedes .
According to the coroner , " there may well be " more photographs in existence that the court has not seen .
Last year , Channel 4 sparked controversy by broadcasting a documentary titled Diana : The Witnesses in the Tunnel , exploring the events of the night from the viewpoint of the photographers who surrounded her in death as well as life .
All hell broke loose at the Hollywood premiere of " Horton Hears a Who ! " today when a group of pro-lifers infiltrated the screening , then chanted anti-abortion slogans after the flick .
The theme of the movie is based on the motto : " After all , a person is a person , no matter how small . "
So the pro-lifers thought it was a good idea to use this theme to their advantage -- even though their complicated message was falling mostly on the ears of children .
The stars in attendance included Victoria Beckham and her three kids , Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy , Steve Carell and all 12 contestants from " American Idol . "
After the chanting ended , the group put red tape over their mouths that said " Life " on them , and paraded around the event .
SURE , Sarah Silverman bragged about sleeping with Matt Damon , but where ’s the love for Ben Affleck ?
Last week , Silverman surprised her boyfriend , Jimmy Kimmel , on his show with a music video called “ I ’m [ Bleep ] ing Matt Damon , ” featuring Silverman and the “ Bourne Identity ” star singing together about their faux affair .
Now Kimmel is striking back with a song called “ I ’m [ bleep ] ing Ben Affleck . ”
Our source told us the video for this song , set to the theme of “ We Are the World , ” will star Affleck , Robin Williams , Don Cheadle , Harrison Ford , Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz .
Gallup : Record number dissatisfied with US global position
According to a new Gallup poll , a record number of Americans are dissatisfied with their country 's global position .
" Americans ' view of the United States ' position in the world has undergone a complete reversal over the course of the Bush administration , " Lydia Saad writes for Gallup .
" Since February 2001 , Americans ' dissatisfaction with the country 's position in the world has more than doubled . "
Gallup asked 1,007 national adults , aged 18 and older , over the telephone the following question : " On the whole , would you say that you are satisfied or dissatisfied with the position of the United States in the world today ? "
" Public dissatisfaction with the United States ' global position was 27 % in February 2002 , shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , " Gallup reports .
" It rose to 50 % during the pre-Iraq war period in 2003 when the United States was actively lobbying its allies and other countries at the United Nations to support military action against Iraq .
It then quickly dipped to 29 % at the very beginning of the war in Iraq in March 2003 , but has risen steadily since . "
The article continues , " Today 's 68 % dissatisfaction rating is the highest Gallup has recorded on this question , including during the Vietnam War era .
At three different points in the 1960s , the public was consistently divided in its responses , with about 44 % satisfied and 46 % dissatisfied . "
This video is from USAToday.com , broadcast March 5 , 2008 .
Two hour waits , broken elevators , and 15,000 misplaced bags .
It 's just another day at London 's Heathrow Airport .
Last week , amidst much hoopla and self - congratulation , British Airwaysopened its glittering new $ 8.6 billion Terminal 5 at Heathrow .
The size of 50 football fields and capable of handling 30 million passengers a year , the modern , airy glass and steel extravaganza was supposed to be the answer to the chronic congestion that has made Heathrow one of the most detested airports in the world .
So far it has n't worked out quite as planned .
An opening day meltdown at T5 has resulted in hundreds of cancelled flights , something in the neighborhood of 15,000 lost bags , and a public relations nightmare for British Airways executives , who were said to be partying it up while chaos unfolded at their new showpiece .
According to reports from the British press ( who , by the way , are having a field day ripping British Airways to shreds ) the problems started with Terminal 5's super - high tech baggage handling system - a network of motorized carts and underground belts that can allegedly handle 12,500 bags per hour .
Many of the early shift baggage handlers reporting for work on opening day could n't find parking spaces at the new terminal or got stuck at security checkpoints , creating a huge staffing shortage .
Those who did make it in either could n't log into the computerized baggage sorting system or did n't know how it worked ( not good news if you handle baggage for a living ) .
As a result belts began jamming up , and the first three flights of the morning took off without any luggage on board at all .
Instead , those bags piled up at the terminal .
While the baggage handlers were struggling to get luggage from the terminal onto outbound flights , they also had to figure out how to deal with bags coming in on arriving flights .
This did n't go so well , with some passengers waiting 90 minutes for luggage to arrive at baggage claim .
Front line employees trying to manage the chaos claim that their desperate calls to supervisors went unanswered .
But wait , it gets better .
Planes were forced to sit idle at the T5 gates while British Airways baggage handlers struggled to get them loaded and unloaded , which meant arriving flights had no place to park and began piling up on the tarmac .
This made getting the right bag onto the right plane still more complicated , creating more delays , which in turn meant that even more bags piled up inside the sorting system .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
Finally , baggage belts and carousels became so congested that the entire system just crashed .
By late afternoon British Airways was asking passengers to fly with carry on luggage only or telling them outright that their bags would n't be traveling with them , making for a fantastic , passenger - focused travel experience all around .
Baggage was the main issue , but plenty of other stuff went wrong at Terminal 5 , too .
Check in desks were closed when the first passengers arrived on opening day .
Escalators and elevators did n't work .
Self pay kiosks in the parking garages malfunctioned .
And as icing on the cake , a flashmob of " Stop Airport Expansion " protesters descended on the terminal that morning , forming the occasional conga line and further annoying passengers who were undoubtedly already wanting to kill someone .
The final tally at the end of the weekend : 15,000 bags sitting somewhere in the bowels of Terminal 5 , hundreds of flights canceled , and a complete public relations disaster for British Airways .
The airline needs to sort things out , and fast .
It 's locked in a fierce battle for passengers with its big European competitors Lufthansa and Air France - KLM .
And while some of Europe 's other hub airports leave a little to be desired ( Frankfurt is sort of a dump ) , none of them have seen a meltdown like the one at Terminal 5 .
Graffiti found scrawled on a bathroom wall at Terminal 5 perhaps sums it up best : " Welcome to hell . "

A lot of the English language seems to have been developed as some kind of elaborate practical joke .
It 's full of little sayings and idioms that on their face make no sense at all , and if traced back to their origins are downright horrifying .
Right or wrong , these 10 sayings have some of the strangest ( and most unsettling ) histories : Advertisement
10 " Rule of Thumb " Now Means :
A common or ubiquitous benchmark .
As in , " The rule of thumb is one part tonic to four parts gin . "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Most say it came from ...
17th century English Judge Sir Francis
Buller , who allegedly ruled that it was A - OK for a husband to beat his wife with a stick , given that said stick was no wider then his thumb .
This is the stuff that white trash dreams are made of .
So is that true ?
As it turns out there is n't any record of Buller actually making this ruling , though he was known to be a big powdered wig - wearing dickhead to everyone around him regardless of sex .
Still , roughly a year after the supposed ruling , British satirist James Gillray called out Buller in this cartoon , selling his thumb - width wife beating sticks : Continue Reading Below Advertisement
So why would Gillray create this poster if the ruling it referenced did n't exist ?
Who knows .
Maybe it was already an urban legend back then .
The truth of the phrase is that it likely just refers to carpenters and tailors who , without a ruler handy , would just measure things in thumb - lengths .
We tried digging up evidence that they were using actual severed thumbs for the task , but even that turned out to be too awesome to be true .

According to calculations done by the Center for Responsive Politics , in March 113 Clinton donors switched their financial support to Barack Obama .
These donors had each given Clinton the maximum $ 2,300 individual contribution , but with the writing being on the wall , they decided that electing a Democratic president this fall is more important that standing by Hillary Clinton .
As evidence of how much this race had shifted , only 26 Obama supporters donated to Hillary Clinton .
Even before John Edwards endorsed Obama , 955 of his supporters had donated to his campaign .
Only 395 of Edwards ’s supporters donated to Clinton , and 26 people donated to both campaigns .
While this is far from rush of Clinton donors to Obama , these people are the big fish .
They are also the most committed supporters who are likely not only to donate the max on their own , but to raise money for the campaign through their connections .
The April fundraising numbers were due in to the FEC last night , but what we know so far is that Barack Obama raised $ 37 million , Hillary Clinton raised $ 22 million and John McCain $ 18 million .
Ten of Clinton ’s $ 22 million came in the 24 hours after she won Pennsylvania .
That means that she was only able to raise $ 12 million for the rest of the month , while Obama had a slow month , but raised over $ 1 million a day .
April was McCain ’s best month of the entire campaign , but Obama still doubled him up .
Advertisements
Barack Obama ’s ability to raise money without solely relying on the traditional fundraising methods is nothing short of amazing .
Future candidates will study Obama ’s success , especially with raising money on the Internet , and try to emulate it .
The problem they will face is that Obama is a special candidate at a special time in our nation ’s history .
I think that it will be a very long time before anyone else is able to do what Obama has done in terms of fundraising .

The other day , I was listening to George Reisman ’s wonderful speech , Memories of Mises , Rothbard , and Rand ( Recorded 08-02-2005 ) .
There ’s a part in it where he plays for the audience a recording of a speech he gave in the 1950s at a Roy Cohn event at which McCarthy was present .
Rothbard wrote the entire speech , and Reisman delivered it ( he told me that he made only one editorial change , which was the deletion of a reference to God ; he also thought perhaps Ralph Raico made another change ; I checked with Ralph but did not hear back yet ) .
( Raico alludes to this “ Roy Cohn ” speech too in his own talk : The Mises Circle : Memoirs of Hayek in Chicago and Rothbard in New York ( Recorded at the Mises University on 08/01/2005 ) . )
As is evident from Reisman ’s 2005 speech , the Mises Institute audience got a kick out of the recording , but it ’s too muffled to hear on the MP3 .
I asked Reisman for the original recording and he sent it to me : it ’s here .
I have been unable to get the transcript of the speech , but it ’s fairly clear .
Great stuff .

A Pizza
Hut employee from Iowa was suspended “ until police sort out the details ” in a shooting incident .
The details are pretty straight forward .
A woman , an accomplice of a criminal , placed a order for a pizza .
The delivery man , James William Spiers , attempted to deliver the pizza when he was confronted by a man who put a gun to his head .
Spiers , who has a permit to carry a handgun , grabbed the assailant ’s gun and pulled his own weapon .
The attacker was shot three times .
When police arrived at the scene Spiers placed his hands in the air and dropped to his knees and told the police that he had both weapons in his pockets .
So far no charges have been filed but Pizza Hut has suspended Spiers .
The company has a policy against carrying a weapon , even for those who have a permit to carry one .
Pizza
Hut believes that denying its employees the right to self defense is the safest policy .
As this incident shows , a no weapons policy kept Spiers from being attacked …
I understand that Pizza Hut is allowed to make policy and if Spiers broke the rule the company has a right to fire him .
I also believe that the company has a duty to keep its employees safe .
It appears that Spiers was the only one interested in his personal safety .
I rarely buy pizza from Pizza Hut .
If they end up firing Spiers I will never buy anything from them and I encourage all Second Amendment supporters to do the same .
Pizza
Hut officials would have felt better if Spiers had been shot to death so long as he was not carrying a handgun .
One of his fellow employees stated :
Howe ’s co-worker Kimberly Babis said Spiers should not have been armed on the job , no matter what the safety concern .
She said most drivers have the right to refuse a delivery if they feel it could pose danger .
“ I do n’t understand why the pizza delivery guy had a gun , ” she said .
“ And even if the other guy was trying to rob him , it ’s a measly 20 bucks .
At least that ’s how much our drivers have on them . ”
Des Moines Register
This attitude is what allows students at colleges like Virginia Tech to become victims .
It is the attitude that allows patrons of malls to become victims and it is the attitude that allows crime to blossom .
Just submit and they will leave you alone .
James Spiers is alive today because he refused to be a victim .
If he loses a job over this then at least he is still alive to find another job .

NOT all credit products are created equal .
The credit - default swap ( CDS ) market is going from strength to strength , with outstanding volumes rising from an already staggering $ 34.4 trillion at the end of 2006 to $ 62.2 trillion at the end of last year .
In contrast , issuance of collateralised - debt obligations ( CDOs ) has fallen dramatically .
It was a paltry $ 11.7 billion in the first quarter , down from a record $ 186.5 billion in the same period the year before .
At first blush , this might seem surprising .
After all , during the boom years for CDOs , the two products were closely intertwined .
Traditional CDOs bundled bonds into portfolios and then split those portfolios into tranches , depending on investors ' appetite for risk .
Some investors wanted a higher return but were willing to take the first hit from bond defaults ; other investors were more concerned about the safety of their capital and were willing to accept a lower return .
The idea was so popular that there were not nearly enough corporate bonds to go round .
So managers created so - called “ synthetic ” CDOs , in which the portfolios consisted of credit - default swaps .
In a CDS , one party agrees to insure the other in the event of a bond default , in return for a fee ( the equivalent of an insurance premium ) .
So in a synthetic CDO , those who owned the riskiest tranches got more of the premium but lost out when defaults occurred .
There is , in theory , no limit on the amount of default swaps that can be created .
So when managers wanted to sell a synthetic CDO , they simply created some more CDSs .
Now that the CDO market is in the deep freeze , thanks to all those subprime - related losses , that source of demand has dried up .
But there have been plenty of other buyers .
After all , it is only natural that , with the likelihood of bond defaults increasing , more investors should want to buy insurance against such events .
More importantly , however , the CDS has become the product of choice for those investing in credit as an asset class .
Five to ten years ago , the corporate - bond market was a lot less active ; there was little trading in the bonds themselves , which were often locked up in the portfolios of pension funds and insurance companies .
The invention of the CDS increased the liquidity of the market and , crucially , allowed investors to take a “ short ” position on bonds .
Traditionally , you would buy a corporate bond at , say , 95 cents on the dollar .
The best you could hope for was that interest would continued to be paid and that the bond would be repaid at par ; at worst , the issuer could default and you could conceivably be left with nothing .
Now investors who believe that credit conditions will deteriorate for a particular company can buy a CDS on the bond , whether or not they own it .
The value of such an insurance contract will rise if default becomes more likely .
The creation of index contracts on the market allows you to bet whether all corporate bonds ( or , indeed , different segments of the market such as investment grade and junk bonds ) will rise or fall in value .
As a result , the CDS is such a useful instrument for hedge funds and the trading desks of investment banks that it seems inconceivable it will go away .
Just as the future on the S&P 500 index is a key part of the equity market , the CDS is central to non-government debt .
But could it be the Achilles heel of the financial markets ?
One clear problem is counterparty risk ; insurance is worth nothing if the insurer cannot pay up .
The involvement of Bear Stearns in the credit - derivatives market was one reason why there was a public interest in the firm 's rescue ; a default might have caused chaos as other counterparties struggled to calculate their risk exposure .
Another problem could emerge if a sudden surge in defaults was accompanied by a further widening in spreads .
The market might become illiquid if those that had in effect sold insurance tried to exit their positions .
Market insiders are confident the CDS sector can stand up to the strain .
Ashish Shah of Lehman Brothers says that the CDS market showed itself robust in the face of the Enron and WorldCom defaults in 2001 and 2002 , and of other bankruptcies since then .
However , many market participants were equally reassuring about the health of the CDO market in early 2007 — and look how that turned out .
Independent observers will not be really reassured until the system survives the test of a big , juicy default .
Given the weakness of the American economy and the scale of the credit crunch , it probably will not be long before that test comes along .
Zuher Ismail just wants to get ahead .
The 23 - year - old lives at home with his mother in social housing , and works while attending school part - time to earn a degree in business administration .
He 's not at home entirely by choice – he tried to make it on his own , because he did n't want to be a burden , but he could n't make ends meet .
The catch is , by living at home , trying to work and go to school , both Ismail and his mother have been penalized .
Some of the money earmarked for his schooling goes to cover his mother 's subsidized rent , which has gone up by about $ 100 , to $ 400 a month , due to his income and the fact that he 's now living with her .
" That 's just the way it is I guess , " Ismail says .
" I just want to complete my studies and get on with my life . "
Escaping social assistance in Ontario is a vicious game of snakes and ladders where too often those struggling to get ahead end up further behind , says a new report on government social programs .
That 's because federal and provincial policies aimed at helping the poor too often work at cross-purposes , punishing anyone who gets a job or goes to school to try to improve their circumstances , says the report by John Stapleton , who was a policy analyst in Ontario 's social services ministry for 28 years .
" Life is tough for poor people – we know that .
Why do we develop public policies that make it even tougher ? "
Stapleton asks .
The report , funded by the privately endowed Metcalfe Foundation , lists a litany of barriers to self - reliance .
It starts with welfare , which deducts 50 cents for every dollar earned the moment a person on welfare gets a job .
Other social supports such as public housing and subsidized child care are also often slashed as income increases , leaving those on welfare little incentive to move ahead .
" Working - age social assistance recipients in Ontario , especially those who are public housing residents , live with disincentives , " the report says .
" The more they earn , the more they lose benefits ; when they tell the truth , they are penalized . "
As a result , programs encourage non-reporting , discourage work and perpetuate abject poverty , it says .
Stapleton , who hopes his report will help shape the McGuinty government 's poverty - reduction strategy , says the situation is particularly perverse for children turning 18 in poor families .
He recounts Toronto Mayor David Miller 's fury in 2005 when , after encouraging large companies to hire disadvantaged youth , parents told their sons and daughters to turn down job offers .
The reason ?
Any income these youth earned would trigger automatic rent hikes in the families ' subsidized housing and cuts to welfare cheques .
" These kids were caught in a tangle of social policies that made it worse for both themselves and their parents if they took advantage of opportunities such as Miller 's initiative , " says the report , entitled " Why is it so tough to get ahead ?
How our tangled social programs pathologize the transition to self - reliance . "
Under provincial social assistance rules , when children turn 18 they are considered adults and expected to work .
The same rule applies in public housing .
Only if they are studying full - time can children over 18 remain in the family home without causing penalties .
But if they move out , they often can't support themselves because it 's difficult for disadvantaged youth to get jobs that pay living wages .
Ismail 's story is all too common , says Stapleton , who spent the past year consulting widely with people in Toronto receiving basic welfare , called " Ontario Works , " and ODSP , the province 's disability support program .
His primary focus were first - generation immigrant adults on welfare and youth who have grown up in public housing .
Problems they encountered as they found work or enrolled in education and training included :
Cuts to income support such as Ontario Works , ODSP and the national child benefit .
Ineligibility for benefits such as prescription drugs and dental care .
Eviction notices or rent hikes for public housing .
Reduced eligibility for services such as subsidized child care .
Reduced eligibility for OSAP ( student assistance ) .
Single mom Toby Rowe , 27 , was determined to crawl out of poverty last winter by taking a part - time job at a fast - food restaurant to supplement her $ 939 welfare cheque .
Her goal was to work in the afternoons while her children , then aged 4 and 6 , were both in school .
But the restaurant , which paid her $ 8 an hour , insisted she work weekends too , forcing Rowe to hire a babysitter , which cost $ 6 an hour .
" I did it for three months and had no more money in my pocket to show for it , " Rowe says .
" Welfare took 50 cents of every dollar I made and the babysitter took the rest .
It actually cost me to work . "
Rowe , who has been completing high school one credit at a time while raising her children , hopes to complete her diploma and enrol in some form of post - secondary education or job training after her daughter starts Gr.ade 1 next year .
" I know I need more training because I 'll never get ahead working ( for ) minimum wage .
But it 's hard . "
Ultimately , Ontario 's social safety net needs to be more focused on the person seeking help , rather than on so - called " service silos . "
But in the short term , Ontario could ease the transition into self - reliance from social assistance by granting moratoriums – what Stapleton calls " time outs " – on public - housing rent hikes , welfare and child - benefit clawbacks , and cuts to child - care subsidies .
When it comes to disadvantaged youth turning 18 , he calls for a grace period of up to four years for those in school so they can prepare themselves for adulthood without triggering financial hardship .
Rules that may make sense in isolation , Stapleton says , are disastrous for struggling families when tangled together .
" These misdirected social policies perpetuate poverty and dependence into the next generation , " he says .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon said on Tuesday it dropped charges against a Saudi who U.S. officials say intended to be the “ 20th hijacker ” on September 11 but sent five others to trial on accusations they planned the 2001 attacks .

A Pentagon appointee who oversees the U.S. war court at its Guantanamo Bay military prison did not say why she rejected the charges that prosecutors sought earlier this year against Mohammed al - Qahtani .
She dismissed the charges “ without prejudice , ” a distinction that allows the U.S. government to try to bring charges against Qahtani again .
Murder and conspiracy charges against the five other men accused of planning the attacks , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , were approved , the Pentagon said .
That means the men , all held at Guantanamo , must be arraigned within 30 days .
They will be tried together in proceedings that should start within 120 days .
If convicted , they may face the death penalty .
“ What we are announcing today is the next step , which is the referral of charges , ” said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman .
U.S. military prosecutors first recommended charges in February against the detainees -- Mohammed , Qahtani , Ali Abdul Aziz Ali , Ramzi Binalshibh , Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi and Walid bin Attash .
The charges include conspiring with al Qaeda to murder civilians and 2,973 counts of murder , among others .
The Guantanamo tribunals are the first U.S. war crimes tribunals since World War Two .
They were established after September 11 to try non-American captives whom the Bush administration considers “ enemy combatants ” not entitled to the legal protections granted to soldiers and civilians .
The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the military commissions system as inherently unfair to defendants , in part because it allows the use of hearsay and secret evidence to yield convictions .
The group on Tuesday said the U.S. government had still not provided necessary security clearances to two civilian attorneys who want to represent Mohammed , better known as KSM .
“ The government ’s failure to provide the necessary clearances to lawyers who have already been cleared for other national security cases is yet another example of the government ’s obstructing this process and stacking the deck in its favor , ” said Anthony Romero , ACLU executive director .
Mohammed has said he planned every aspect of the September 11 attacks .
But his confession could be a problem if used as evidence because the CIA has admitted it subjected him to “ waterboarding ” -- an interrogation technique that simulates drowning and has been widely criticized as torture .
U.S. officials say Qahtani tried to enter the United States on August 4 , 2001 , but was stopped by immigration officials at a Florida airport and placed on a flight out of the country .
He was later captured in Afghanistan .

Formula one boss Max Mosley today failed to get a high court injunction preventing the News of the World from putting a 90 - second videoclip showing him and five prostitutes on its website .
The paper wasted no time , putting the video back on its site shortly after today 's high court ruling and challenging Mosley to answer a series of questions about its allegations .
Last week , the tabloid removed a video of Mosley - the son of British fascist Sir Oswald Mosley - from its website , pending a ruling on the high court injunction banning the tabloid from showing images from the clip .
Mr Justice Eady , in the high court in London , said the events , which were chronicled in the newspaper last month under the headline " F1 boss has sick Nazi orgy with 5 hookers " , had received massive worldwide coverage , both in newspapers and online .
Anyone who wished to access the footage could easily do so , and there was no point in barring the News of the World from showing what was already available , he added .
The judge said : " I have come to the conclusion that the material is so widely accessible that an order in the terms sought would make very little practical difference .
" One may express this conclusion either by saying that Mr Mosley no longer has any reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of this now widely familiar material or that , even if he has , it has entered the public domain to the extent that there is , in practical terms , no longer anything which the law can protect .
The dam has effectively burst .
" I have , with some reluctance , come to the conclusion that although this material is intrusive and demeaning , and despite the fact that there is no legitimate public interest in its further publication , the granting of an order against this respondent at the present juncture would merely be a futile gesture . "
Tom Crone , the News Group Newspapers legal manager , said : " Max Mosley 's attempt to suppress the News of the World 's video of his sordid activities has failed .
The film will be placed back on the News of the World website forthwith .
" As the judge acknowledged , he was able to see only ' very brief extracts ' - less than two minutes - of the very much longer video .
Had he seen it in its entirety , we are confident that he could not fail to recognise the Nazi connotation which Mr Mosley so strenuously denies . "
Crone added that the paper had six questions about the video for Mosley , who claims it does not have Nazi connotations .
" 1 . Why are German military uniforms worn ?
2 . Why does he issue orders and threats in German to women who cannot speak German ?
3 . Why does he deliver and count out beatings in German to women who cannot understand German ?
4 . Why does he put on a German accent when speaking English ? , " he said .
" 5 . Why are the victims of these beatings in German made to put on sinister striped uniforms ?
6 . Why the head lice inspections , the forced shaving of body hair and the sinister references to inmates being housed in ' facilities ' ?
We look forward to Mr Mosley 's answers to all these questions , " Crone added .
Mosley , who was not in court , is also pursuing a claim for breach of privacy against News Group Newspapers , with a five - day trial expected in July .
He has recruited former News of the World editor Phil Hall to advise on PR matters .
The News of the World has splashed with details of Mosley 's meeting with five prostitutes in London for the past two Sundays and said it would be sending videos of his visit to a Chelsea flat to the FIA , formula one 's governing body , of which he is president .
Steeles , the law firm acting for Mosley , who is under pressure to step down as president of the FIA , applied for the injunction at a hearing on Friday .
" The News of the World stands by its story and will vigorously defend all legal action from Mr Mosley , " a spokeswoman for the paper said on Monday .

There 's nothing like a warm sunny day to lift the mood and make the world look alive and vibrant .
The Sun is the benefactor of life on this planet , giving it the energy it needs to survive and grow .
Like most things in nature though , it has its good days and its bad .
Its angry moods are hidden behind a seemingly calm face of brilliant light , but they are there nonetheless and can be very harmful to our electrical equipment and lifestyles .
It ’s one of the jobs of NOAA ( the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) to observe the Sun ’s activity and try to give advance warning of solar storms to operations that can be adversely affected by them .
Someone involved in this work is NOAA physicist Janet Green .
We asked her some questions about all of this and she happily provided some illuminating answers .
Q. What is a typical day like for scientists who observe and predict space weather ?
NOAA .
A scientist at the space weather prediction center has two main roles .
One is to promote the transition of space weather models from the research community to forecast tools that will run reliably in an operational setting .
The other is to ensure that quality data , on which our forecast products rely , is available from our satellite and ground based instruments .
For example , SWPC is responsible for the Space Environment Monitors onboard NOAA ’s five Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites .
These instruments measure energetic protons and electrons that cause the aurora in the polar regions .
Scientists check calibrations , monitor the instrument health , and ensure that the data continues to flow to our most popular products and websites
http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/index.html .
We also work with the Department of Defense and NASA to develop new instruments and plan for future satellite missions so our products continue to improve .
We attend scientific meetings , and meet with researchers from around the world to learn about new techniques and scientific advances that might be beneficial to some of our space weather customers .
SWPC is currently working on implementing a new tool that describes the radiation environment near geosynchronous orbit that will help satellite operators manage their space assets more effectively and mitigate the harmful effects of space radiation .
Products that make it past a rigorous set of tests and validation are implemented in our forecast center .
Forecasters stand watch 24x7 in the center and consolidate the output from data and models into text alerts .
Q. What types of equipment are most vulnerable to solar activity and in what way ?
NOAA .
Space weather can affect a wide range of equipment and activities including satellite electronics , polar aviation communication , power grid transformers , and the global positioning system .
Satellites , on which our high - tech world has become increasingly dependent on for communication , operate in a hostile environment of very high energy particle radiation .
These particles ( mostly protons and electrons ) are confined by Earth ’s magnetic field to orbit in a doughnut shaped region from ~ 1.5 x Re ( radius of the Earth ) to ~ 10 x Re .
Engineers try to design satellites to withstand the constant barrage of particles which can penetrate through solid material .
Yet sometimes even the best designs fail .
The energetic particles can damage electronics , flip programming bits , or degrade solar cells , diminishing the function of the satellite or sometimes leaving it completely inoperable .
" The loss of one satellite due to space radiation is ~ $ 500 million . "
Airline communications are degraded by 2 different space weather phenomena : solar flares and solar energetic particle events .
A large solar flare produces X - rays that bathe the dayside of Earth and degrade HF ( high - frequency ) communication .
In response , airlines must rely instead on satellite communication which is more expensive .
For those planes not equipped with such technology , they rely on planes leap - frogging information by line of sight .
In recent years , major airlines have begun flying polar routes from North America to Asia to reduce flying time for the convenience of passengers and fuel cost savings .
Most of the time , these flights operate smoothly .
However , on occasion an explosive event at the sun releases a flood of very high energy protons that stream down magnetic field lines into the polar regions .
The deluge of particles is enough to disrupt HF signals , the only available form of communication above ~ 83 degrees latitude .
During one of these polar particle events , planes are diverted to lower latitudes often forcing additional fuel stops and delays of more than several hours for passengers .
Electrical power , which most of us take for granted , is delivered through a complex grid that remains stable only through the cooperation and constant maintenance of many different power companies .
An unexpected failure of a single component can affect a wide - sweeping area , as was seen during the Northeast power blackout of 2003 which was precipitated by a single station in Ohio .
During a geomagnetic storm , large transformers , which connect pieces of the grid at different voltages , are particularly vulnerable .
A geomagnetic storm occurs when Earth ’s magnetosphere is distorted and shaken up by energetic blobs of plasma , known as coronal mass ejections ( CME ) that are ejected from the sun .
The changes to Earth ’s magnetic field can induce large currents in the transformers and heat it to unsafe limits where the transformer performance is degraded or it is completely destroyed .
During a geomagnetic storm , power companies will take action to increase power output from many different sources to reduce the load on any one particular component and keep the transformers operating within a safe range .
GPS works by triangulating on the time it takes an electromagnetic signal to reach several orbiting satellites .
These signals must travel through Earth ’s atmosphere and ionosphere to the satellites .
During a geomagnetic storm , the ionosphere becomes disturbed with electron density bubbles and fountains .
The changing density can affect how the electromagnetic signals propagate causing significant errors in the GPS locations .
Q. We 're currently starting solar cycle # 24 .
Is this cycle starting out with unusually low sunspot activity or is it about normal ?
NOAA .
It is still too soon to say whether this cycle is starting out with unusually low sunspot activity .
The current numbers are not lower than has been observed in previous solar minimums .
However , the next 6 months or so will be very telling .
If the current low numbers continue , it may be an indication of a less active solar cycle .
Q. I read some predictions last year that this cycle could turn out to be an unusually strong one in terms of solar storms .
What are you currently expecting ?
NOAA .
A solar prediction panel was convened by NASA , NOAA , and ISES last year to reach a consensus on what might be expected from the next solar cycle .
A press release was put out on April 25 , 2007 that can be found here : http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SolarCycle/SC24/PressRelease.html.
Illustrating the complexity of long term forecasts , the panel was not able to reach a consensus with half the panel favoring a strong solar maximum peaking at ~ 140 sunspots and the other half favoring a weak solar maximum peaking near 90 sunspots .
The researchers are divided because they are uncertain about the basic physics that governs how the magnetic field of the sun changes and how that affects the solar cycle .
What is known is that the magnetic field of the sun reverses direction every 11 years from being directed primarily northward to southward and vice versa .
The flip is caused by flows of plasma at the sun .
Proponents of the weak solar maximum believe that the polar magnetic field of the sun , which can be measured today , is transported equatorward and becomes the background for magnetic activity and sunspots of the next solar maximum .
The current polar magnetic field is weak , which leads them to conclude that the next maximum will also have weak activity .
The proponents of the strong solar maximum , on the other hand , are basing their arguments on physics based models of solar flows .
They argue that the movement of plasma from the polar regions to the equator takes much longer than eleven years .
Therefore , the current polar magnetic field has little bearing on the next solar cycles activity .
The panel recently reconvened to determine whether recent observations had swayed opinions .
However , the recent sunspot counts and polar magnetic field measurements still had not changed significantly to support or deny either camps theory .
Q. Solar cycles are typically about 11 years in length .
Do you also observe longer term trends in solar activity or is the Sun relatively stable and constant beyond the 11 - year cycles ?
Above : video shows coronal mass ejections of hot plasma
Below : solar flares shaped along curved lines of magnetic flux NOAA .
Other cycles have been identified but only the 11 and 22 year cycles are very strong in the observations .
The 11 year cycle describes the variation in the number of sunspots .
The 22 year cycle describes the time it takes the Sun ’s magnetic field to reverse direction and then return to the initial orientation .
Q. Sunspots are relatively cooler areas of the Sun 's surface , yet it seems that the Sun radiates more energy when there are more of them .
Can you explain how this works ?
NOAA .
It seems counterintuitive that sunspots , which are cool and dark , actually cause the Sun to radiate more energy .
This phenomenon is explained by the fact that sunspots are typically surrounded by very hot bright fringes called faculae .
The brightness of the faculae is enough to compensate for the darkness of the sunspot leading to an overall increase in the amount of energy radiated .
Q. Since the Sun emits both energy traveling at the speed of light , and matter which would travel more slowly , what disturbances can you give advance warning of and which ones can you not ?
NOAA .
Energy from the Sun travels to Earth on timescales of minutes to days .
However , these timescales do not always dictate the advance warning times .
For some phenomena , we can increase warning time based on statistical probabilities of events occurring .
For example , X - rays , which disrupt HF ( high frequency ) communication , are emitted when a solar flare erupts from the surface of the sun and reach Earth in ~8 minutes .
Cameras onboard NOAA satellites orbiting Earth continuously image the surface of the sun .
The SWPC forecasters issue an alert every time a solar flare is observed .
In addition , SWPC also provides 3 day advance flare predictions .
These predictions are based on statistical probabilities that a sunspot region with a certain size or magnetic characteristic is likely to produce a flare .
High energy solar particles , that also disrupt HF communication over the poles , often follow a solar flare or a coronal mass ejection ( CME ) .
They may arrive at Earth in minutes , hours , or not at all .
Unlike the X - rays , these particles do not follow a straight direct path to Earth .
They are constrained to follow the magnetic field lines of the Sun which flow outward in a spiral similar to a spinning lawn sprinkler .
Like , pearls on a string , only those protons that are released on magnetic field lines that thread through Earth will have an impact .
Coronal mass ejections ( CME ) are the slowest form of energy to arrive and are responsible for the geomagnetic storms that disrupt power grids and reduce GPS accuracy .
These are large bubbles of strong magnetic field and energetic plasma that are sometimes ejected from sunspots and active regions on the sun .
They may take ~3 days to arrive or they may follow a trajectory that misses Earth completely .
They have to push through the ambient magnetic field and plasma between the Sun and Earth making their exact arrival time uncertain .
In addition , their release from the sun is difficult to observe because surprisingly , these large energy explosions leave little trace in solar images .
Sometimes they are associated with solar flares and sometimes they are not .
The best indication that a CME is coming our way is from coronagraphs that image the area around the Sun .
A CME coming are way appears as a faint halo or expanding circle .
Currently , no NOAA satellites carry coronagraphs that can be used for operations although that may change in the future .
The next best warning comes from the ACE satellite which sits upstream of Earth and provides ~ 60 minute warning .
Q. From time to time solar storms can be strong enough to induce troublesome currents into the electrical power grid .
The March 1989 Hydro - Quebec event is one example .
How frequently do these events occur , and how do you work with electric utility companies to warn them ?
NOAA .
Power grids do not often fail completely during magnetic storms .
However , recently the power companies have found that even moderate magnetic storms can induce currents that slowly degrade transformers and diminish their lifetime .
Geomagnetic storms are ultimately caused by activity at the sun which follows an 11 year cycle .
Therefore , the occurrence rate of geomagnetic storms also follows an 11 year cycle .
During solar maximum , moderate to large geomagnetic storms occur ~ 10 - 20 times per year .
During solar minimum that number is reduced to ~5 per year .
A storm the size of the March 1989 event is expected to occur about once every 60 years .
Q. NASA is ending its Polar satellite mission which looked at the auroral " crowns " at the Earth 's poles .
Was anything of major significance learned about the Sun and Earth interaction from that mission ?
NOAA .
Although the most publicly visible instruments on Polar were the cameras that took incredible images of the aurora , the satellite carried a whole host of instruments to study the physics of Earth ’s magnetic field and plasma environment .
Of particular interest to space weather , was an electron detector telescope that measured the high energy electron radiation belt particles that are so troublesome to satellites .
For decades , scientists have debated how these electrons are accelerated to such devastatingly high energies .
They had divided into two camps with one camp arguing that the electrons were pushed Earthward by fluctuating electric fields from a source outside of geosynchronous orbit ( 6.6 Earth radii ) .
The other camp argued that they were locally accelerated inside of 6.6
Re by very low frequency waves .
With Polar , scientists were able to show that indeed , the source had to be inside of 6.6 Re .
From the outside , this may seem like a trivial debate .
But already , updating data assimilation models to include this new source has greatly improved our predictive capabilities .
Interaction of the solar wind with the Earth 's magnetosphere - SOHO / NASA Q . I read a few articles last year that suggested the Earth 's magnetic core was shifting somewhat and could reverse at some point .
Is the time - scale of that too large for it to be of concern for us now , or could this present significant problems in the future ?
NOAA .
The Earth ’s magnetic field has flipped many times in the last billion years .
The flips are captured by ocean ridges where lava is continuously flowing out and cooling .
As the lava cools , the direction of the magnetic field is frozen into the rock providing a time history of the field reversals .
These flips occur at seemingly random intervals ranging from tens of thousands of years apart to many millions of years apart .
A complete reversal typically takes around 10,000 years .
Q. When the Earth 's magnetic field " flips " like that does it cause a temporary collapse of the protective magnetosphere , and if so , what consequences could that have in terms of changes to the atmosphere or genetic mutation of life forms from solar wind radiation ?
NOAA .
When Earth 's magnetic field flips , it is likely that the field strength is reduced and the structure becomes more chaotic but the field does not completely go away .
Thus , it will still provide some protection from the energetic particles streaming from the sun .
Our atmosphere also provides an additional layer of protection stopping the particles from reaching the ground .
There is not a clear correlation between magnetic field reversals and extinctions .
However , some research suggests that a combination of just the right space weather effects may have led to some extinctions noted in past records .
Our atmosphere is continuously bombarded from very high - energy nuclei , known as cosmic rays , that come from astrophysical objects outside our solar system .
These particles can effectively reduce the ozone in the atmosphere allowing more UV radiation to penetrate to Earth 's surface .
One numerical simulation shows that when a magnetic field reversal occurs while our solar system passes through an interstellar cloud , the elevated cosmic rays and reduced magnetic field results in enough UV radiation penetrating to Earth 's surface to be harmful to life .
These results have yet to be verified with observations .
Q. Does the average individual need to be concerned about space weather ?
If so , in what way ?
NOAA .
Space weather impacts many areas of the high - tech infrastructure on which we all rely but there is no space weather umbrella that the average individual can keep in their trunk just in case the sun starts acting up .
The costs of space weather are substantial and ultimately impact the tax payers .
The loss of one satellite due to space radiation is ~ $ 500 million .
The cost of diverting just one polar airplane flight is ~ $ 100 K .
The cost of delaying or redoing work because of large GPS errors ranges from $ 10 - $ 100 K per day .
The cost of a large city losing power is estimated at about $ 900 M .
THE mind wraps itself around losing a job , one of life ’s great traumas , in jagged and swerving fits .
When the call comes in , when rumor turns to reality , when it ’s not the broker in the next cubicle but you who is presented with a stack of severance papers , the psyche takes over .
It goes numb .
It goes into survival mode .
Fear quickly turns into anger .
For some , there may be relief in saying goodbye to what therapists call the “ psychological terror ” that has haunted the corridors of troubled financial institutions since last summer .
But what follows  the unknown  may be no less frightening .
Since August , banks worldwide have announced plans to eliminate as many as 65,000 jobs .
Many losing their jobs now have lived through other crises on Wall Street  the 1987 market crash , the widespread layoffs of the early 1990s and the financial upheaval of 1998 .
But investment bankers , recruiters and psychologists say the current economic downturn , the cascade of layoffs and the steady beat of grim financial news have exacted an especially daunting psychic price .
“ These are people ’s lives , ” said an investment banker in his 30s who was laid off in November from his job at a Bank of America office in New York .
“ It ’s not head count .
We ’re not cattle . ”
I 'm pretty removed from the election cycle right now .
The primaries come and go every week and I watch the results come in .
I take note of the outcome ( specifically the fact that Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee are talked about as not being in the race even though they have n't dropped out ) .
I also think deeply about what a future under Obama or Hillary will really look like .
Anyways ...
Back in August , I figured it was time to make a selection and choose to support somebody .
I did n't know who Dennis Kucinich was .
I did n't feel like being a proverbial " independent . "
I did n't wish to wait until the primary in Indiana in May to pull the lever for who might be left in the race .
I chose to watch some video footage on YouTube , do some research , and write some pieces as part of my figuring out whom to support .
Dennis ' candor and conviction won me over .
( Later , I would look at the record and find I had made the best choice any American could have made in 2008 . )
I wrote a piece that kickstarted my fight to keep Dennis Kucinich in the debates and the presidential race .
It went after George Stephanopoulos who like every moderator on these corporate media debates did a poor job of getting the candidates to address the issues and giving candidates equal time responding to questions .
The piece was titled : " Actually , George , This Debate is Insufficient "
I posted the piece on the Action Center at the Dennis4 President website .
I was told by somebody to submit this article to OpEdNews .
From that point on , I applied myself to submitting quality articles to OpEdNews for people to read about this election that always in some way had a bias in favor of Dennis Kucinich ( or a bias against the black man or white woman the Democratic Party so dearly wanted to run as THE " change " candidate ) .
My application led to me becoming a " trusted author , " a privilege I greatly cherish .
Amazingly , my articles written during the fall were noticed by a documentary filmmaker who gave me the opportunity to participate in the production of her film .
I came to Chicago for college in the fall and for Dennis Kucinich , I stepped outside of my little shell and attended a House Party for Dennis .
There I met several people who became the core group for the Greater Chicagoans for Dennis Kucinich .
This core group got me to for the first time ever go out and participate in the political process like all citizens should by petitioning for Dennis to get on the ballot in Chicago .
I talked to many wonderful people who were willing to sign .
I was introduced to the fact that Dennis was America 's best kept secret .
And I thought and imagined that what I was doing would pay off because all I wanted was to see Dennis Kucinich be a contender for the presidency .
We met weekly at a place called Mercury Cafe in Chicago not too far from the Loop .
This cafe was a great setting for members of the Chicago campaign for Kucinich to gather and talk about news , politics , and outlooks on the future of America .
We all were on the same page seeing that the deck was stacked against us but we had to fight the good fight .
I and others successfully got Dennis Kucinich on the ballot here in Chicago and the rest of Illinois .
We filled the city with stickers for Dennis that at this moment are still on lamp posts outside .
Before Dennis was on , I also had another first : I marched in my first protest march on October 27th .
I did it for Dennis Kucinich .
I got signatures for him to get on the ballot and then I took a " Bring the Troops Home " sign and taped two Dennis Kucinich campaign signs on the other side .
Walking in that march was a milestone in my history as an American .
I had a sense that I was marching with the true voice of democracy .
The march was representing all the most pressing issues : end the war , no war with Iran , 9/11 truth , health care not warfare , stop funding and occupation , end war and stop racism , etc .
And being that it was an election season we all had our signs out for various candidates ( Dennis and Ron Paul had the best showing but there were a few Obama and Richardson supporters ) .
I did not anticipate the battle Dennis would face with corporate media in the debates .
I did mention that we needed people to give us money at the October 27th march so that Dennis could stay in the debates because they had already gotten Mike Gravel out .
And once you are out , you do n't get back in .
I stood in solidarity with all the actions Dennis and the campaign took in January to try to stay afloat .
But there was something about the fight that was so disenchanting .
The fact that media could tell a judge in Nevada that he could not defend Dennis ' right to be included in the debates really bothered me .
From January to Super Duper Tuesday , I was kind of sour in a way .
I really wanted nothing to do with talking about Dennis because in my opinion , few people were in a position to talk about what had led him to drop out .
The media had not covered it accurately .
The Democratic Leadership had not stood up for one of its leaders that gets as much attention if not more than Obama on YouTube .
And people within the anti-war and impeachment movements just did n't seem to get out and stop business as usual the way they should have for Dennis .
And so the presidential campaign ended and we went to defending Dennis ' seat in Congress .
People came out and got angry with him for trying to save his seat by stalling impeachment ( for essentially a month --- because if he wins the primary on March 4th , he can do whatever he wants to do for us ) .
But some recognized that he was being " McKinneyed . "
Facing four challengers with AIPAC and corporations involved in supporting them ( not to mention Paul Hackett and others ) , we knew he needed money now to stay in Congress .
That 's the power of Dennis Kucinich .
He 's one man who gives us all hope because we see him take actions that all politicians ( especially those in the Democratic Party ) should be taking .
He put out an analysis in October 2002 to stop the Iraq invasion which got over 100 members of the House to oppose the war .
He drew up articles of impeachment for Cheney and has the articles of impeachment for Bush ready .
He voted against the PATRIOT
Act because as he said in the debates , " I read it . "
He brought up the hydrocarbon law in Congress which pertains to our stealing of Iraq 's oil when nobody else would .
He held a series of hearings on urban America that looked specifically at the subprime loan scandal in America .
He stood up and said he would not allow military recruiters to come in and harass students on school campuses when he appeared on Democracy Now !.
He has supported single - payer health care and the defunding of the Iraq war ( witness his votes against all funding for the Iraq war ) .
He gave us the most visionary ideas for changing America .
He put out REAL change , not empty rhetoric in his campaign for the presidency .
Today , I am who I am , a person who does not fear putting my ideas out in public and challenging the status quo , because I found out who Dennis Kucinich was in August .
I am a man who is connecting on campus with everyone who is inclined to act out for social change and political change because I discovered Dennis Kucinich 's Prayer for America .
I am a man who is planning to show the streaming of the " Winter Soldier " hearing on my campus in its entirety and uncensored for all students to see followed by a Town Hall Meeting on the war a couple days later because Dennis Kucinich inspired me to dig deep and find my soul .
Thank you , Dennis Kucinich .
It 's acts like this shown in the videos below that make me eternally grateful that you , as some people would put it , try to change the Democratic Party from within unsuccessfully .
You can keep trying as long as you want because if somebody does n't --- Well , the end of America may transpire .
As a follow - up to our last post on short yellow light times , a local newspaper in Denver reports that the city is reconsidering its plan to install red - light cameras after the paper ’s investigation revealed short yellow light times across the city .
Unfortunately , it ’s not uncommon for cities to install ticket cameras without implementing simple engineering changes like increasing the duration of yellow lights at intersections .
Local news media can play a key role in protecting the public by keeping city officials on their toes .
If you ’re concerned about yellow light times in your city , calling the local media and suggesting an investigation is an excellent way to force change .
An excerpt from the Rocky Mountain News story :
Denver is re-examining its plans for its first red light cameras after a Rocky Mountain News investigation found that the locations had short yellow lights , which could make the intersections ticket traps and accident hot spots .
Traffic engineers will do a quick study of the four camera locations to determine whether the yellow signal should be increased from the legal minimum of three seconds – timing that ’s considered appropriate for 25 mph traffic .
The four intersections that Denver has selected have speed limits ranging from 30 to 45 mph , with traffic going faster than that , and other conditions that call for greater yellow time , up to 4.3 seconds or more .
Denver , as a matter of policy , has used the three - second minimum at most of its 1,250 signals for decades .
Local officials have now conceded that increased yellow light times may be the best way to proceed :
[ City engineering director , Brian Mitchell ] said that Denver will select four similar intersections where yellow timing will be modified to see if that alone reduces accidents .
Denver ’s locations are all one - way , multi-lane approaches : the east end of the Sixth Avenue Freeway at Kalamath Street , eastbound Sixth at Lincoln Street , westbound Eighth Avenue at southbound Speer Boulevard and northbound Quebec Street at 36th Avenue .
All have three - second yellow lights for which the standards call for more time .
If the yellow is set too short for the existing traffic conditions , drivers must choose between braking hard or running the red .
Numerous studies on red light cameras show that while they can reduce the number of more serious T - bone type crashes , they more often result in a spike in rear - end collisions .
Aurora put them in two years ago and the number of tickets and accidents has gone up .
The article goes on to mention that increasing the yellow light time has already worked for other Colorado cities :
N ot even a month has passed since KDE 4.0 has been officially released .
Already the Windows port of KDE 4.0 is functional .
Nay , you can really install many KDE 4.0 applications on Windows 9x/2000 / XP ( Vista users please excuse ) via an installer .
The installer as such is a small piece of software which pulls the required packages from the remote repository and installs them on your Windows machine .
It also automatically downloads any packages which are required to satisfy any dependencies which makes it very user friendly .
The download for me took a long time since the installer had to pull in over 400 MB of packages .
But once all the necessary packages finished downloading , the installer then proceeded to install all the packages in the specified location .
In my case KDE 4.0 applications were installed in C:\kde4 directory .
There are a number of applications already such as the KDE games , KWrite , Konqueror , Dolphin file manager and so on and all of them worked on my machine .
I have to concede that other than the KDE games which played quite well , most other software is at the least , still buggy .
Konqueror and KWrite guzzles up memory like there is no tomorrow .
The Konsole ( KDE terminal ) has yet to be ported to Windows and so you cannot access the terminal from within Konqueror .
Dolphin complains that it cannot find the home directory each time I open it in Windows .
KWrite is a lot slow in opening up and so on .
But these chinks are sure to be ironed out soon .
The complete build system of KDE 4 is ready .
KDE 4 on Windows currently support two compilers namely Mingw and Microsoft Visual C++. Since Qt 4 is truly a cross platform library and KDE 4 being built using Qt 4 , it is only a matter of time before you see people using KDE applications on Windows .
Who knows , perhaps this could be one more reason which will prompt more and more people to embrace Linux .. or maybe not .
Check out a few screenshots of the installer and KDE 4.0 applications running on Windows .
You can download the installer from windows .

A famous New Yorker cartoon from 1993 showed two dogs at a computer , with one saying to the other , “ On the Internet , nobody knows you ’re a dog . ”
That may no longer be true .
A new analysis of online consumer data shows that large Web companies are learning more about people than ever from what they search for and do on the Internet , gathering clues about the tastes and preferences of a typical user several hundred times a month .
These companies use that information to predict what content and advertisements people most likely want to see .
They can charge steep prices for carefully tailored ads because of their high response rates .
The analysis , conducted for The New York Times by the research firm comScore , provides what advertising executives say is the first broad estimate of the amount of consumer data that is transmitted to Internet companies .

Lobbyists at Johnson , Madigan , Peck , Boland & Stewart  whose partners include another former aide in the Clinton White House , Bill Danvers  have separately met with pro-business Democrats like Representative Joseph Crowley of New York .
And Andrew Samet , a deputy secretary of labor in the Clinton administration , has been hired under yet another lobbying contract .
Mr. Penn got into trouble last week after he attended a meeting with Colombia government officials , as they prepared for the move by Mr. Bush to force a debate in Congress .
His firm had been representing the Colombian government since last April , helping it promote the deal with news media , among other tasks .
But Mr. Penn , a strategist and pollster , ended up getting blasted by both sides .
The Colombian government canceled the contract with his firm after he called the meeting an “ error in judgment . ”
Mr. Penn then stepped down from his campaign post after Mrs. Clinton was criticized for having a close adviser lobbying for a pact she opposed .
Mr. Penn ’s advocacy was particularly awkward because Mrs. Clinton increasingly has taken a stance opposing free trade during her campaign .
The ties between the lobbying firms and the Clinton campaign illustrate the complexity of Washington ’s political world , where players are often switching positions or playing multiple roles .
While Mr. Wolfson has taken a leave from Glover Park , for example , he still has equity in the firm valued at $ 500,000 to $ 1 million , according to a disclosure form .

A long list of former Clinton administration aides , including Mack McLarty , the former counsel to the president ; Donna E. Shalala , the health and human services secretary ; and Leon E. Panetta , the onetime chief of staff , also have come out in support of the deal .
It puts them in alliance with Mr. Bush and Republican leaders .
Besides the Colombian government , the Bush administration has perhaps been the most forceful player in the fight , holding more than 400 meetings or telephone conference calls with officials on Capitol Hill to push the deal , the president said Monday .
It has also paid most of the cost of the Congressional delegations , although an administration spokesman said on Monday that he could not estimate what the tab for these trips had been .
[ Post No. 2 ] Full Employment Memo for Bloggers ( and Prosecutors ? )
Marty Lederman
I wo n't have a chance until later this evening or tomorrow to start going through the numerous newsworthy substantive aspects of the Yoo memo .
( Dilan and other commentors are identifying lots of nuggets in the comments section of my previous post . )
For now , just a few themes to stress :
1 . The classification of this memo was entirely unjustifiable .
And it 's fairly outrageous that Congress did n't release it when they received it .
The classification and oversight systems are hopelessly broken .
2 . The memo cites numerous other , as - yet - unreleased memos that appear to contain equally outrageous legal analysis .
( Recall Jack Goldsmith writing about Pat Philbin presenting him with a " short stack " of egregious memos . )
Those memos should be released immediately .
More importantly , I think Congress should strongly consider NOT CONSIDERING ANY ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS UNTIL ALL OF THE MEMOS HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED AND ( APPROPRIATELY ) REPUDIATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE .
There is simply no excuse for Congress to have allowed itself to be manipulated like this , and to be kept in the dark about the extent to which the Administration has ignored legislative statutes and treaties .
They must use some of the leverage at their disposal .
3 . Did the AG , DAG , head of OLC [ correction : ( Jay Bybee ) ] even know of the existence of this 81 - page memo that was causing such heartache at the Pentagon ?
Or was John Yoo , a Deputy AAG , somehow authorized to speak for the Justice Department without any oversight or supervision ?
If so , how did anyone come to think that that was ok ?
4. Did Yoo consult with other DOJ components and other agencies with expertise on these matters ?
( A rhetorical question , to be sure . )
5 . When will Congress insist upon hearings at which Geoffrey Miller , Jim Haynes , Donald Rumsfeld , and other DOD officials , explain why they kept the Yoo memo and the Working Group Report secret -- undisclosed even to the Working Group itself -- and why they briefed Miller on Yoo 's multiple theories of legal absolution on his way out to Iraq ?
It 's no longer very hard to figure out just why , all of a sudden , as soon as Miller arrived in Iraq , everyone there just suddenly and magically came to think the Geneva Conventions , UCMJ , federal assault and torture statutes , etc. , simply no longer applied -- that Iraq was a law - free zone and that the gloves had come off .
If you were Miller and you had been briefed on the Yoo theories , would n't you feel awfully confident that you could get away with , well , murder and everything short of it , in interrogation operations in Iraq ?
This memo is the source of the Nile for the abuse that occurred in Iraq in 2003 .
And they are quite clear as to why they love what they heard :
America must " lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good . "
With those words , Barack Obama put an end to the idea that the alleged overexuberant idealism and America - centric hubris of the past six years is about to give way to a new realism , a more limited and modest view of American interests , capabilities and responsibilities .
(...)
Obama talks about " rogue nations , " " hostile dictators , " " muscular alliances " and maintaining " a strong nuclear deterrent . "
He talks about how we need to " seize " the " American moment . "
We must " begin the world anew . "
This is realism ?
This is a left - liberal foreign policy ?
Kagan is literally gleeful .
More military , more interventionism , more " values " , more preemptive attacks .
Sullivan is not far behind :
Obama 's speech ( ... ) is emphatically not against the use of military force when necessary ; it is emphatically pro-military in its call for many more troops .
On the critical issue of Iraq , Obama has taken a stand - a clear one for withdrawal , with the possibility of a strike - force over the horizon .
This is a very difficult call , and the timing and execution of withdrawal will be dispositive .
But one core strength of Obama 's candidacy is that he got this war right when many of us got it wrong .
He deserves more of a listening than many of us do .
Ditto with the Washington Post :
As an opening statement of Mr. Obama 's philosophy , there is much that we found significant -- and encouraging -- in the Chicago speech .
Acknowledging that " many Americans may find it tempting to turn inward " after the failures in Iraq and elsewhere , the senator quoted Franklin Roosevelt in saying the United States nevertheless must continue to " lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good . "
Mr. Obama called for a sizable increase in the size of the Army and for the reinforcement of NATO forces in Afghanistan .
He said that " no president should ever hesitate to use force -- unilaterally if necessary -- to protect ourselves and our vital interests when we are attacked or imminently threatened . "
To be fair , the WaPo does see him as a bit weak , or at least uncommitted , on the War on Terror :
Still , Mr. Obama ought to explain more directly how he views jihadism .
Is it an ideological challenge comparable to communism and fascism , as Mr. Bush contends , or merely an esoteric dogma held by bands of criminals , like the anarchism of the early 20th century ?
Is terrorism the central threat of the early 21st century , or , as some Democratic strategists argue , merely one of a panoply of challenges that include global warming , pandemics and the rise of China ?
And when you read the speech , it 's hard not to note the multiple references to the military , how it must be supported , increased in size , and used , preemptively if necessary ( as quoted above ) .
Even his bits about diplomacy focus on military alliances ( NATO is lenghthily mentioned , but not the EU ) , and his examples of how the US should conduct " hearts and minds " operations in various countries are , again , run by the military .
The WaPo's note that he does not explicit his position on the " war on terra " is strange , considering that most of the places mentioned in his speech are in the Muslim world , and most of the threats seem to come from there .
The only non-Muslim threat he also focuses on is loose Russian storage of nuclear material , but that 's also part of the ' war on terra ' - indeed , it is its signature threat , the one that has been used to justify most of the excesses of the past few years , and the attacks at home on civil rights - let us protect you from the mushroom cloud .
Basically , his proposal is to accept the goals of the George Bush administration , use the same tools , but run the policy competently and less boneheadedly .
To his credit , he is not proposing that for Iraq itself , which he explicitly states the US must leave ( well , except for a " few troops " ) , but in the wider picture , it 's still about bringing democracy to others , and in particular to the Muslim world , and about having the biggest , most ass - kicking military force in the world .
: : ::
Now , in the interest of fairness , I 'll add this second quote from Andrew Sullivan :
The simple existence of Obama as a new president in a new century would in itself enhance America 's soft power immeasurably , just as a clear decision to leave Iraq would provide much greater leverage for diplomacy and military force in a whole variety of new ways .
Obama would mean the rebranding of America , after a disastrous eight years .
His international heritage , his racial journey , his middle name : these are assets for this country , not liabilities .
This is the hope that with a decent , competent president , things will go back to normal , the idea of the USA will shine brightly again , and it will be able once again to fulfill its international policy objectives by leading instead of by bullying .
Barck Obama says it thus :
But if the next President can restore the American people ’s trust – if they know that he or she is acting with their best interests at heart , with prudence and wisdom and some measure of humility – then I believe the American people will be ready to see America lead again .
They will be ready to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries .
That we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with .
That we are not a country which preaches compassion and justice to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major American city .
That is not who we are .
The problem is that yes , this is precisely who America is today in the eyes of most of the world - whether the genuinely aghast or the hypocritically gleeful to have a kettle to hide their pot .
Finally stopping the most atrocious behaviour will not eliminate the fact that it took place , that it took place for a long time , and that it was supported by a surprisingly high proportion of the population - and an higher , and even more terrifying , proportion of the punditry , which should have known better than fall for the nasty propaganda and fearmongering of the Bush administration .
These were policies of a big chunk of the elite in Washington , as kossacks all know ( and despair about ) .
But I am also struck about Obama 's description of the world as a source only of threats for America - most related to terrorism one way or another , with a nod to global warming .
Opportunity is only what America can bring to the world , not the other way around .
In a word , just like with the current administration , the world has only headaches to bring to the USA .
Thus the need for a big army to wage two wars at the same time .
Thus the need to be everywhere to engage would - be terrorists before they actually turn into ones .
Thus the need to lead alliances .
The methods will be different : the relevant countries will need to be convinced rather than coerced , but the only goal is still to get them aligned behind US objectives .
And yet America will not be in a position to lead until it has atoned .
You do n't eliminate such a stain , such a loud precedent ( which many others will be all too happy to use as an excuse for their own abuses for a long time ) just by not doing it anymore .
The credibility to talk about values , about democracy , about cooperation , about peace - just is n't there .
And talking about a stronger military , more interventionism in other countries ( even of the humanitarian or modest kind ) , and bringing the American model back to the world is not going to work , because it is yet more meddling .
Oh , sure , the weak and weasely leaders of Europe will be all too happy to be seduced rather than bludgeoned into submission , and the ' international community ' will be all too happy to pretend that adults are in charge again , and that we can all go back to normal .
Cooperation between secret services .
Joint military / humanitarian missions ( like the failing Afghanistan occupation , maybe ? ) .
More police coordination - with more uncontrolled data swapping between governments ?
After all , there are still evil terrrists out there .
We can not let the guard down too much .
But at least we are all defenders of human rights and democracy again , for real this time .
Nah .
As the quote from Obama 's speech above suggests , this is a discourse for Americans , not for the rest of the world .
They do n't get to elect their overlords .
: : ::
Maybe it is too much to expect anything different , and , without the Bush / Iraq precedent , the speech would be mostly uncontroversial .
After all , anything less intervention - prone would be shot down as " weak " , " defeatist " , etc ... the whole gamut of Republican smears .
The fact is that political discourse is still dominated by the need to appear ' strong ' and to support the military without any restriction , and by the conviction that it is America 's absolutely legitimate right to intervene in any other country 's affairs because it is a model for the world and if only everybody else were in its image , all would be well .
Peddling to these deep strands in America 's psyche may be smart politics , but it is not going to change policy - and current policy is creating more threats by the minute , via the preference for ' might is right ' logic , the refusal to contemplate any leadership by example where it matters ( energy consumption and carbon emissions - Obama only talks about demanding " equal efforts " from the USA and much poorer China or India ) , and the bizarre need to turn a small band of nasty gangsters with grievances into an apocalyptic threat .
So yeah , I understand why the neocons love Obama .
He 's not really challenging the reckless policy logic they have successfully instilled in your govenrment .
Getting out of Iraq is not a proof of sanity , it 's just an absence of proof that you are insane or deluded or both .
That this is seen as progress only goes to show how low the standards have be brought down by this administration .
SARNIA–A couple was blasted with a powerful , noxious spray that left them blinded , gasping and retching beside the road in what police described yesterday as a bizarre case of road rage .
" I 've never encountered anything like this , " said veteran Lambton County OPP Const .
John Reurink of the incident that happened early Friday morning .
The OPP are seeking the public 's help to find two men who harassed the couple before attacking them with pepper spray .
" We 're still pretty shook up , " said 70 - year - old Tom Hales .
He said he and his 67 - year - old wife , Sharon , had to be treated at Sarnia General Hospital after the incident .
Hales said the attack happened as he and his wife drove south on Highway 40 toward their home near Oil Springs , southeast of Sarnia , after they had finished a midnight cleaning shift at Lambton College in Sarnia .
He said his wife was driving " pretty slow " – between 30 and 50 km/h – because there was a lot of snow on the road , when the occupants of another vehicle began harassing them .
" We noticed a car coming up behind pretty fast .
It started flashing its headlights and swerving back and forth across the road , " Hales said .
" Then it passed us , and as it went past , a person leaned out the passenger window and slapped the side of our car .
I got on my cellphone and dialed 911 right away . "
Hales gave police a running description of what was happening .
The other car then " slowed down , really slow .
It pulled over and both people got out and glared at us as we went past .
Then they started following us really close again .
" We turned off at Oil Springs Line and pulled into the driveway at Paul and Jan Smith 's farm .
We hoped they'd think we lived there and go away and leave us alone .
But they pulled right in behind us and the passenger got out and walked up to our car .
" My wife rolled her window down and told him ` We've called the police .
You 'd better get out of here . '
" He said , ` Why would you do that ?
We have n't done anything wrong . '
Then he stuck a big can into the car and sprayed my wife right in the face .
She was blinded .
I could n't breathe and was throwing up .
" The Smiths took us in and washed our faces and eyes , " Hales recalled .
" It was an awful experience .
Now it 's going to cost us $ 160 to get the car cleaned , " he said .
Recently , I was working on an application that helps helicopter maintenance engineers adjust their helicopters to fly better .
This application analyzes data collected during flight , and provides engineers with information to help them adjust the helicopter .
This is a very computationally expensive operation , with extensive use of trigonometric and exponential functions , so though the initial prototypes ran very fast on a PC , they were very slow on the target platform a handheld device running Windows CE on an ARM processor without hardware floating - point support .
After several rounds of optimization focused on improving the algorithm , reducing the use of expensive operations , adjusting the memory - allocation patterns to avoid allocating , freeing memory in a loop , and so forth , the application was running considerably faster than the initial prototype .
Unfortunately , it was still too slow , so it was time to pull out the " big guns " and use fixed - point math .
This final push doubled the speed of the application , finally bringing the performance within acceptable limits .
But it was n't easy .
In this article , I explain the fixed - point techniques we used to achieve this performance gain .
Fixed - Point Math
I had put off using fixed - point math because the application made extensive use of sines , cosines , and exponential functions that are nontrivial to implement .
However , profiling ( see sidebar ) showed that the mathematical operations were consuming a very high percentage of CPU time , and I had exhausted all other avenues .
This was relatively unsurprising , given that the target CPU did n't support floating - point operations in hardware , so all mathematical operations were performed by an emulation library .
Before proceeding , it was important to check the range of possible values the range for a double is far larger than can be represented in a simple fixed - point type .
For this application , 64 - bit fixed - point values ( 35 bits to the left of the point , 28 bits after , and one sign bit ) were sufficient as a replacement .
Initially , I hunted the Internet for a free , open - source implementation of fixed - point math .
The only implementation I found that provided all the required mathematical operations did speed up the application , as simple operations such as addition and subtraction were considerably improved .
Unfortunately , the overall gains were n't as good as had been hoped for .
However , seeing the naïve implementations of the more complex functions ( calculating sines and cosines from the Taylor series , for example ) gave me hope by improving the implementation of these functions , there was potential for much greater improvements , so I pressed on with renewed vigor .
Eventually , the whole fixed - point library was rewritten from scratch , but the final performance gain was enough to justify the time spent in doing so , and it was easier than anticipated .
( The complete source code for the fixed - point library and profiling code is available online at www.ddj.com/code/.)
Do n't Forget the Constants !
Having changed over to fixed point , the next easy gain came from replacing floating - point and integer constants involved in fixed - point calculations with fixed - point ones .
It 's easy just to use M_PI or 0 or 1 or even 0.5 in a calculation , and this is not so easy to spot when changing every use of " double " to " fixed . "
The profiler showed that these constants were responsible for quite a few calls to the converting constructor , so replacing them with fixed - point constants shaved another couple of percents off the runtime .
What ’s Next for Kenya ?
Kisii Warriors in Chepilat on Tuesday .
Â© Anne Holmes
Standing by .
That ’s what I ’m doing these days .
The negotiations with Annan have helped to quiet things down a bit in Kenya .
As we all wait for the results of the talks on Tuesday , people speculate that a power - sharing agreement breakthrough may be in the works .
This glimmer of a solution to the political standoff seems unlikely to gel as Kibaki and Odinga are sworn enemies , and everyone knows that a hand shake means nothing in the hearts of politicians .
But Nairobi residents seem hopeful that there will be peace soon .
Much of the press is set to leave this week as the story appears to be fizzling out in many people ’s minds .
But I ’m not so convinced .
For one , the conversation on the ground has changed tone since the days when I arrived in mid-January .
We heard a lot of political slogans like “ No Raila No Peace , ” “ Kibaki Must Go ” and so on , during the days of mass action in Nairobi ’s slums .
In the last ten days or so , I have heard more of “ Gives Us Guns , ” and “ We Want Weapons ! ” an indication that possibly the situation has indeed gone out of the hands of the politicians who have been pulling the violence strings up ’ til now .
One thing seems rather clear in my mind : Nakuru is a time bomb .
It is not really a question of if it will go off , but rather when .
This city is the last on the border between Central Province and Rift Valley where the population is still a mixture of Kikuyu , Kalenjin and Luo , and has been disputed territory for some time .
Nakuru lies within Rift Valley and historically is the ancestral land of the Kalenjins , but at the time of independence , Jomo Kenyatta gave this land to his fellow tribesmen , the Kikuyus , and this has been a point of contention ever since .
The Kalenjin seem rather committed to setting the land record straight .
Last week a series of purges took place in Kericho where Kalenjin attacked , evicted and burned the properties of countless Kikuyus living there , along with Kisiis who they wished to push back into their traditional homeland in Nyanza province .
I paid a visit to the Kericho IDP camp on Tuesday of last week , where an estimated 5,721 Kikuyus and Kisiis huddled around piles of furniture and plastic tents .
With Kalenjins threatening to attack the camp , an evacuation was quickly organized and all the Kikuyus I spoke to were heading back to Nakuru , which set off alarm bells in my head .
Not only are they returning to lands which the Kalenjin seem determined to evict them from , but also they will return with horror stories of attacks by Kalenjins in Kericho , which have in the past instigated revenge attacks .
My sources tell me that the Mungiki are organizing and a strike is imminent , but it remains to be seen what will happen this week .
In Chepilat , a town that borders Kisii and Kalenjin territory , some 60 kilometers west of Kericho , a battle ensued last week between young warriors from either side , armed with bows and arrows , though no one was seriously injured .
Kisiis burned Kalenjin houses and Kalenjins burned Kisii houses , making it impossible to discern who started the fight .
On Tuesday , houses still smouldered and a handful of Kisii warriors lingered in the town ’s central street .
When I arrived Wednesday morning , the town ’s people had gathered at the crossroads and lay in wait of the arrival of Nyanza and Rift Valley Provincial Commissioners ( PC’s ) to carry out peace talks between the two tribes .
A small group of Kipsigis , a subtribe of Kalenjins , sat on the hill of the field where battles had ensued as most of Chepilat ’s Kisii population slowly gathered to talk with journalists and wait for the convoy of PC ’s to arrive .
Sometime in mid-afternoon , the cars pulled in .
Out stepped Nyanza province ’s Paul Olando , and several other Nyanza MP’s , but Hasan Noor , the PC for Rift Valley was nowhere to be seen .
Franklin Bett , MP from Rift Valley was apparently the only Kalenjin representative to show up .
The dignitaries made speeches , which I could unfortunately not understand , and the Kisii crowd grew angry towards the end when Mr. Bett adressed the Kalenjins in their native tongue .
The meeting ended in failure as the small group of Kalenjins walked away saying they were not ready for peace and the Kisiis proclaiming they would prepare for battle .
The area , however , has remained calm since that day .

Meanwhile on the Western border with Uganda , trouble is brewing .
Reports of an illegal , armed militia , the Sabaot Land Defense Force ( SLDF ) , hunting and killing the aboriginal Ogiek tribe in the Mount Elgon area abound , and the IRC is sending the bulk of its security to the nearby Kitale region in expectation of attacks .
The press has tired of pictures of burning houses and men with machetes .
That ’s the sad truth of this business , but problems continue , albeit on a smaller scale , in villages throughout Western Kenya , and I do n’t see a solution to this story in the luxurious offices where Odinga , Kibaki and Annan carry out their business .
The people on the ground seem to speak very little about these negotiations .
The fear now is that the warring factions may be arming themselves with guns and grenades to take these clashes to another level , something the Kenyan government would not want the world to see as its economy depends largely on tourism , which has suffered a massive blow as a result of the post-election violence .
Wait and see is the order of the day , but I predict another eruption is on the horizon in Nakuru town soon .

Pouring molten glass on cold water , you can get Prince Rupert ’s drops , named after the fellow who discovered the process around the 17th century .
The quick solidification of the glass in the outer layers creates strong internal tension , distributed on a peculiar way and assuring the “ magic ” effect .
Drop a hammer over the bulbous end , and it will remain intact .
But create a small fracture by the thinner end , and the drop will instantly explode into glass dust .
The same principle is applied in tempered glass , which combines greater resistance with almost instant fragmentation when the internal tension is broken .

Prominent conservatives and activists are indicating they will put aside their differences with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen .
John McCain and rally their supporters to his side because of one issue : federal judgeships .
In big gatherings and small , in e-mails and one - on - one conversations , conservative opinion leaders fear a Democratic president , especially Sen.
Barack Obama , will use the presidential power to appoint federal judges who will remove references to God and religious symbols from public places .
They predict the incoming president likely will fill more vacancies on the federal bench over the next four years than at any time in recent memory , giving a Democratic administration the power to shape the courts to reflect a liberal worldview .
The American Civil Liberties Union “ has been on a national rampage to remove God from every public place : the Pledge of Allegiance , the Ten Commandments , plaques in courthouses , the Boys Scouts when they meet on public property , ” said Phyllis Schlafly , head of the Eagle Forum , a pro-family group that held a private meeting for conservatives yesterday in a Washington hotel .
“ These subjects should get out on the table so people understand what ’s going on in the courts , ” she said .
Peter J. Ferrara , general counsel to the conservative legal rights group American Civil Rights Union , said , “ McCain said he ’d appoint people like [ Supreme Court Chief Justice John ] Roberts and [ Justice Samuel ] Alito .
Obama is saying he ’d name people like [ Justices Ruth Bader ] Ginsberg and [ David ] Souter . ”
Conservatives consider the latter pair to be the two most consistently liberal Supreme Court justices .
“ Obama is swimming in a sea of left - wing extremism with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright [ Mr. Obama ’s former pastor ] and [ violent radical activist and Obama acquaintance ]
Bill Ayers and the rest of them , ” said Mr. Ferrara , a former Reagan White House aide .
With the memory in mind of President George H.W. Bush ’s failed promise to appoint a conservative to the high court and the current president ’s attempt to appoint Harriet E. Miers and brief consideration of Alberto R. Gonzales , Mr. Ferrara added : “ There are no guarantees , and you have to take your chances on whom you pick [ or president ] . ”
Jeremy Gunn , ACLU freedom of religion and beliefs director , said Mrs. Schlafly and others are playing on the ambiguity of the word “ public . ”
“ The ACLU for 60 years has been defining the right of people to express religious beliefs in the public square .
The cross on a church is constitutionally protected .
Moved to the courthouse , it is not .
She does n’t want an Islamic crescent in front of the courthouse , I do n’t think .
She would understand perfectly well why it would be wrong .
But when it comes to her own religion , she does n’t see it . ”
Mr. Obama ’s campaign did not return a call for comment , but in July , speaking to Planned Parenthood , the likely Democratic nominee presidential said he would choose judges who have “ the empathy to understand what it ’s like to be poor , or African - American , or gay , or disabled , or old . ”
Federal judgeships have become the ultimate recurring political battle .
The Senate yesterday confirmed the second appeals court nominee of the year , a far lower rate than Republicans had anticipated and underscoring the political stakes involved .
Even with Republicans in control from 2003 through 2006 they had a difficult time getting appeals court nominees passed in the face of Democratic filibusters .
Conservatives said the issue is so powerful that it could be worth looking past what they see as Mr. McCain ’s other flaws .
They have clashed with the senator on issues such as his support for strict limits on campaign finance , his teaming with Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy , Massachusetts Democrat , on immigration and his votes against President Bush ’s two major tax - cut packages .
The presidential power to appoint federal judges was also the common theme of speakers and informal discussion groups last week in St. Louis at the National Rifle Association ’s annual meeting , which drew more than 66,000 people overall , and at which Mr. McCain spoke .
Conservatives said they need to try tactics other than judicial confirmations to advance their agenda .
Mrs. Schlafly said the countermeasures discussed at yesterday ’s “ training meeting ” were Congress ’ use of the U.S. Constitution ’s Article 3 to withdraw jurisdiction from the federal courts over matters such as the Pledge of Allegiance , the Ten Commandments and the Boy Scout Oath .
She also said Congress could adopt a bill from Rep. Dan Burton , Indiana Republican , to revamp how legal fees are awarded “ to stop this racket of the ACLU ’s collecting attorney ’s fees when they win a case under the exception clause , which is intimidating to local school boards or counties which might have a cross on their seal or might have the Ten Commandments on their wall . ”
She said in many cases the school district simply removes the offending symbol rather than incur the legal and court costs of defending their right to display the symbols .

Call it a clash of competing clouds .
It seems that Google is launching an application - hosting service that appears to be going head - to - head with Amazon ’s trio of distributed computing services — the EC2 computing network , the S3 storage service and the SimpleDB database offering , all of which provide a kind of back - end in a box for companies that want to scale quickly .
So is Google ’s “ App Engine , ” which the company described at one of its invitation - only campfire events on Monday night , a real competitor for Amazon , or just a me - too knock - off ?
Aaron Brazell of Technosailor — former technology guru for b5 media — says the Google announcement is “ much to do about nothing . ”
Among other things , Aaron says that Python , the only programming language that Google ’s service currently supports , is not trivial to learn or to implement ( several commenters on the TechCrunch post also seemed to think that restricting it to Python was a big negative as well ) .
Aaron ’s other beef with Google ’s initiative is that it seems like an “ Amazon S3 me - too ” kind of product .
“ There is no innovation here , ” he says .
To be fair , however , at least some of what Aaron is skeptical about — including privacy concerns , and the wisdom of hosting applications on remote systems run by some other company — arguably apply to both Amazon ’s and Google ’s suite of services .
To me , the bigger question is whether companies will be drawn to Google as a host for their distributed services over someone like Amazon .
I think they might .
And if the Python limitation is only temporary ( as Google suggested it is ) then that could open up the doors even further for developers .
Brady Forrest of O’Reilly says that he likes the approach Google is taking .
So now we ’ve got the Google File System going up against S3 , and BigTable going up against SimpleDB , and EC2 going up against Google ’s server stack ( no cool name for that , apparently ) .
Is this the Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier fight of the tech world ?
Hulk Hogan vs. King Kong Bundy ?
Or is it Paris Hilton vs. Nicole Ritchie ?
Update : SmugMug CEO Don MacAskill ( whose service uses Amazon S3 a lot ) has a take on Google ’s App Engine — he sees it as interesting , but not much of a competitor — and he ’s also worried about lock - in .
