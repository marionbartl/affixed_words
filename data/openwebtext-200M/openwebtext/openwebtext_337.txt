Berkeley is finding that having its own foreign policy is n't cheap .
The city 's recent dustup with the U.S. Marine Corps has so far cost the city more than $ 200,000 , while businesses say they 've been slammed by related protests .
And that 's on top of the $ 1 million the city spends annually on domestic and foreign policy matters hatched by its 45 citizen commissions , which outnumber those in virtually every other city in America and debate everything from regime change in Iran to the plight of nonneutered dogs .
" We in Berkeley have one of the top universities in the world , which brings in people from more than 100 countries .
Delving into foreign policy is unavoidable , " said Mike Sherman , a longtime member of the Peace and Justice Commission , which sparked an uproar two months ago with its resolution telling the Marine Corps that its recruiting center was not welcome in the city .
But some business owners , residents and officials say the Marines dispute , which brought international headlines and boycotts , is a perfect illustration of why Berkeley should spend less money on foreign policy and more on filling potholes .
City Councilman Gordon Wozniak put forth a plan last week to make the commissions more accountable .
The plan , approved by the City Council , requires the commissions to post their full reports on the city 's Web site , to be more diligent about posting their agendas and minutes and to pass along more background information to the City Council , especially on controversial items .
" I think it 's out of hand , " Wozniak said of Berkeley 's commissions , most of which meet monthly and have two or three subcommittees that also meet regularly .
" When we spend a lot of time debating things like the Marines issue , we 're not spending time on the serious problems in this city , like fire station closures .
It 's easier to tackle international issues than deal with messy local problems . "
Lack of communication from the commissions is what caused the Marines ruckus , he said .
The Peace and Justice Commission 's proclamation called the Marines recruiting station on Shattuck Square " unwelcome " and asked the city to waive permit fees for Code Pink to hold weekly anti-war protests outside the station .
The cost of city policies
The council approved the item with little fanfare , but pro-military groups seized on the issue , calling the council 's move treasonous and demanding an apology .
The council rescinded the resolution on Feb. 13 , but protests on each side have cost the city about $ 208,000 in police overtime , city officials say .
Additional costs include city staff time to handle permits , the media , security and the thousands of e-mails that have intermittently crashed the city 's computer server .
In addition , businesses around the recruiting station have been hurt by the protests , and at least four hotels and a handful of restaurants have reported cancellations as a result of the boycott .
" The city is raising business fees and parking meter rates at the same time they 're spending all this money on international issues and handling protests .
It does n't make sense , in these difficult economic times , " said Ted Garrett , director of the Berkeley Chamber of Commerce .
" We 're very concerned about the effect this is having on business . "
An Oregon Ducks football fan club and a Lafayette golf club are among the groups that have canceled junkets to Berkeley this fall , Wozniak said .
A San Diego resort developer said he canceled three contracts with Berkeley suppliers and has persuaded other businesses to follow suit .
The boycotts have had no measurable effect on Berkeley 's economy , which is generally healthy , said the city 's economic development director , Michael Caplan .
Berkeley 's 45 boards and commissions outnumber the 44 in San Francisco and the 33 in Oakland and Los Angeles .
Animal welfare to health
Some of Berkeley 's commissions provide critical city functions , such as the zoning board and Planning Commission , while about half are devoted mostly to policy .
There are commissions on the status of women , animal welfare , aging , disability rights , labor and early - childhood education .
Three commissions deal with the environment .
Four pertain to health .
Each commission has nine members , each of whom is appointed by a council member , and meets monthly .
Many have subcommittees , such as the Peace and Justice Commission 's subcommittee on U.N. treaties .
And every commission has a city staff member assigned to compile agendas , minutes and reports , and ensure that the board complies with the state 's open meetings law and Robert 's Rules of Order .
Manuel Hector spent 10 years as secretary to the Peace and Justice Commission .
His regular job was working on employee safety and special events permits for the city 's Health and Human Services department , but as much as 25 percent of his work time was spent researching oppression in Burma or labor conditions in Liberia for the commission .
" The worst month I had seven items , " he said .
" The hard part was getting them to recognize that these are not urgent situations .
I told them , ' I do n't have time to be keeping track of everything you do .
I can't break my back over this stuff . ' "
Every few years city officials propose to rein in the commissions , either by trimming the number of meetings , merging the ones that overlap or eliminating the ones with little to do .
But such moves have not taken hold .
" It 's a formalized form of participatory democracy , " said City Manager Phil Kamlarz .
" Do the commissions detract from what the city should be doing ?
Sure , they do .
But we 've had commissions for 30 years .
They reflect the values of this city . "
WITH A POCKETFUL of superglue , anything is possible .
I am sitting with my partner , Mark , in the middle of the road outside Parliament , facing a line of police , the full moon shining over Westminster Abbey .
For the amusement of rebels , someone tows a sound system in a trolley around Parliament Square .
The police have just put in a request to the DJ to play “ Thriller , ” and there is a sinuous wave of dancing around a grandmother in a wheelchair , who is here because she is trying to get arrested .
Superglue is good for bonding , superb for attachment .
Mark and I have a bonding moment , courtesy of a few squirts from the tube , and we hold hands tightly , stuck fast .
“ We ’re literally handfasted , ” I laugh .
For me , it is the second sweetest moment of this sweet rebellion .
We are part of Extinction Rebellion , aiming to block the streets of central London .
We are rebels , gluing ourselves to almost anything so it is harder for the police to remove us .
People are glued to the headquarters of an oil company , glued to the stock exchange , glued to asphalt of the streets .
Like Antaeus with superglue , we gain our strength from ceaseless contact with this good Earth .
Love and holding fast to the ground we stand on , laying our bodies down as roadblocks , using anything — a boat , an open - sided lorry — as an impromptu stage in the middle of the streets , the rebellion is designed to block business as usual , because what passes for normal is not normal and cannot continue .
The very laws of physics preclude it .
So whereas the juggernaut of our current way of life is bearing down on us , Extinction Rebellion ( XR for short ) will stand in its way .
The Houses of Parliament are shrouded in gray veils .
This is for practical reasons , for repair work , but it has a symbolic aptness : this occluded ghost speaks of a political system that is moribund .
Rebels are using the shroud as a screen to project David Attenborough ’s film A Life on Our Planet .
As Mark and I hold hands — firmly — the film shows a father and son driving through wildfires in California , the vehicle seemingly about to explode with heat , flames leaping at them .
The film ’s message is ours : we are taking a road that leads to hell ; we have to stop and turn back .
On the first day of the rebellion , some ten thousand rebels , nervous and expectant , gather on pavement and street corners , at various prearranged sites from Oxford Circus to Waterloo Bridge , Marble Arch to Parliament Square .
At a minute before the symbolic eleventh hour , a man passes softly through the crowd .
“ In two minutes , ” he whispers , “ be ready to go . ”
As the pedestrian lights turn green , we surge onto the streets and simply stay there and , doing so , slide a new world into being .
The police , who have been openly informed of our plans , step forward to talk to drivers , beautifully conveying our message : Stop .
Turn back .
The way ahead is closed .
And closed it will remain for ten days .
The streets become a surreal theater .
Central London streams with XR flags in luminous yellow , green , blue , and pink .
Pavement , walls , and clothes are branded with the instantly iconic XR logo .
One thing is incontrovertible : this rebellion has style .
The symbol is the circle of the planet containing an hourglass , the sands of time running out .
It is edgy and exact , flexible , easily reproducible , identifiable , and simple — a cultural meme of pure genius .
The fluorescent colors have a challenger quality right up to the edge of provocation .
Skulls are used as well as bees and butterflies .
XR ’s style is psychedelic , invigorating , intoxicating , carries an electric message : this is an emergency .
At eleven minutes after eleven o’clock , a bright pink boat of pure panache is towed to the center of Oxford Circus , and a cheer goes up as its mast is raised .
Why the boat ?
Rising sea levels mean that in the future , boats may well float across central London .
More , XR stands as an ark for the more - than - human world , and its leaflets and public information offer lifeboats of ideas for addressing the real emergency we are in .
“ This Is Not a Drill ” is the deadpan title of the XR handbook .
Ceci n’est pas une pipe .
XR makes the future immediate and now .
How do you raise the alarm ?
By showing that you are alarmed .
Any self - respecting meerkat knows this .
No sensible mammal would use an impersonal , complicated data set to tell its fellows they are in terrifying danger .
Climate scientists thought their studies would be enough , that action would be taken .
The scientists had no choice but to stick to the values and register of scientific communications , but too many people in the wider world adopted not just the facts of science but its demeanor and tone : level , unemotional , flat factual .
The opposite was required .
The facts , yes , but not the voice .
What was needed was an outcry of alarm .
XR stepped up .
Some time later , having unglued ourselves from each other , Mark and I are at Waterloo Bridge .
The bridge is full of woven willow and flowers , cyclists and a pop - up kitchen .
I speak to academic Rupert Read , a key figure behind XR ’s thinking .
“ The most important thing is not to trust too much to hope , at this point .
For thirty years , campaigners have gone for passive wishing and have been set on not scaring people , ” he says .
The result is mass complacency .
Hope paralyzes .
Alarm galvanizes .
“ We need something more important than hope now , and that is the courage to look at this brutal reality of the situation we are in , and the worse reality that is coming . ”
Indeed , a 2015 meta- analysis of 152 studies in public health by communications academics Kim Witte and Mike Allen shows that fear changes attitudes .
It is also emotionally congruent to the facts .
For the facts are terrifying .
Raise the alarm for what the Smithsonian has called death “ on an unimaginable scale . ”
At a two - degree warming , island nations will be victims of genocide .
Kevin Anderson , director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , says : “ For humanity , it ’s a matter of life or death .
If you have got a population of 9 billion by 2050 , and you hit a rise of 4.5 or 6 degrees Celsius , you might have half a billion people surviving . ”
Since 1970 , humans have wiped out 60 percent of the populations of wildlife ( mammals , birds , fish , and amphibians ) .
Half of all species could be forced into extinction by 2050 .
Language buckles in this heat .
What is happening is unhallowed .
It is “ a drama unfolding at theological scale , ” says Roger Hallam , one of XR ’s cofounders .
The governments of the world are taking us to our deaths and , say many in XR , there can be no greater crime .
The grief of it all overcomes me sometimes .
When I read about the decimation of insect populations , I cried for three days .
Sometimes I feel that I am in a constant state of farewell to the living world , knowing it will not fare well at all .
XR LAUNCHED on October 31 , 2018 .
The date was chosen for its resonance with Halloween , All Souls , and the Day of the Dead to underline our lethal situation .
The October 2018 publication of the IPCC ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) report stated we have twelve years to turn things around , presenting , says Hallam , a “ new realization of immediacy .
That was the crack in the collective psyche . ”
Twelve years is also the lifetime of a young person .
The spring rebellion was chosen to coincide with the full moon of Easter and Passover and with Earth Day .
April is the time to plant seeds , the season of growth , and the young are at the heart of it .
On Waterloo Bridge , among reams of forget - me - nots , a little girl in a red cape is writing in chalk on the asphalt .
THERE IS NO PLANET B SO WE” RE ASKING FOR YOUR HEP .
She examines what she has written , then carefully adds the missing L. She walks away .
Then she stops , turns back , studies it again , kneels down , and adds please .
It is unbearably painful to see a child on her knees pleading for her life .
“ Imagine , ” says Robin Ellis - Cockcroft , twenty - five , who organized XR Youth , “ the grief of knowing that your grandchild might not exist . ”
Fellow XR
Youth rebel Savannah Lovelock , nineteen , says : “ The baby boomers literally stole our future to create their present .
They stole our dreams .
A lot of hurt comes from that .
Adults do n’t know how lucky they are to have lived their lives looking at the future and not seeing death right there . ”
Young people hold a banner that reads ARE WE THE LAST GENERATION ?
and a twenty - one - year - old says to me bluntly : “ Young people are angry with older people .
You fucked this up for us . ”
As the pedestrian lights turn green , we surge onto the streets and simply stay there and , doing so , slide a new world into being .
The young speak with defiance , at once powerful and vulnerable , and with clear - eyed courage and unimpeachable moral authority .
None is more famous than Greta Thunberg , who arrives during the spring rebellion to speak to the crowds .
Millions of young people now follow her in the Youth Strike for Climate movement , marching onto streets and demanding their primal human right : to live .
Some are going on “ birth strike , ” too frightened to even consider having children .
During the spring rebellion , crowds of children sleep in tents at Marble Arch , making this busy traffic junction a gentle but enormous impromptu campsite .
It is awash with XR flags , and I have Leonard Cohen ’s “ Hallelujah ” in my mind : “ I ’ve seen your flag on the Marble Arch . ”
On Good Friday , while arrests are being made , the children march to Oxford Circus as moral support .
Honoring the protest movements that preceded it , XR notes how the youth climate movement is this generation ’s version of the Children ’s March when , in 1963 , children and young people of Birmingham , Alabama , poured out of school and onto the streets , willing to speak their truth to power and claim their rights .
Martin Luther King Jr. is frequently quoted .
Black Lives Matter is referenced .
Like Gandhi , XR believes that civil disobedience is a “ sacred duty , ” while it learns from the anti-capitalist movement and from Occupy to stress the relationship of the 99 percent to the 1 percent .
XR has the street smarts of Adbusters as well as its détournement of the clever reversal .
There is a lot of Earth First !
courage and commitment here , as well as Greenpeace in its 1970s guise .
It takes from Climate Camp the importance of using regional gatherings and from the antiroads protests the physical defense of nature , as those ’90s protesters used treehouses and aerial walkways to block bulldozers .
From Reclaim the Streets , it learns festive blockades , with pop-up kitchens and skateboard ramps and playgrounds in the middle of the streets .
Many protest movements have been damaged by an overuse of alcohol and drugs , leading to sometimes chaotic atmospheres .
By contrast , XR bans alcohol and drugs on - site so people really get their shit together .
Literally .
At Oxford Circus , compost toilets were constructed within minutes , and if there is one single tribute to XR ’s organizational skills , it is this : in ten days of rebellion , the toilet paper never ran out .
An unmistakable edge of punk cuts through XR in its fluorescent fuck - thissery and its utter refusal to play by the conventional rule book .
It also has a strong scent of patchouli — openly delighting in its hippie roots , steeped in herbs and flower power — and takes a leaf from the book of John Lennon on the Establishment : “ The only thing they do n’t know how to handle is non-violence and humor . ”
There is a red thread that runs from the women ’s peace camp at Greenham Common , to XR Peace , campaigning against militarization .
The suffragettes influence XR not only with their gender politics but also with their illustration that society is changed through direct action , not through asking nicely .
More widely , XR pays tribute to the primal female , the divinity of Earth as Mother .
ON THE FIRST DAY of the spring rebellion , the cathedral of Notre Dame catches fire .
It is a poignant symbol of the burning of cultural beauty , for with climate collapse comes civilizational collapse .
It is grievous and uncannily apt : Notre Dame means “ Our Lady ” or “ Our Mother , ” and as the cathedral burns , so is our mothering Earth burning ; the verdant mysteries , wisdoms , and medicines of the Amazon going up in flames ; wildfires out of control in the Arctic .
One of these mothers can be rebuilt with money ; the other only with a radical change of heart , and XR dedicates itself to this , like a chivalric knight - errant to his lady .
When I first came across XR , I recognized something both ancient and strikingly new : chivalry .
Construction of Notre Dame commenced in 1160 , about the same time when the code of chivalry was created .
This code includes courage , honor , devotion , self - sacrifice , and a willingness to endure hardship , and XR follows it while serving Our Lady , the Earth .
I hear this rare but unmistakable tone of chivalry everywhere .
Rebels frequently say they are “ in service , ” talk with humility in the face of transcendence .
Ronan McNern , who leads the media team , says : “ The work I do is an honor .
It ’s about service . ”
Many speak of the importance of “ virtue ethics , ” doing the right thing , no matter the outcome .
That night , as Notre Dame burns , it is freezing cold at Oxford Circus .
A group of us are on night watch .
It ’s three in the morning , and a friend and I are cuddled together for warmth in a hammock slung between two traffic lights at the top end of Regent Street .
We are laughing in sheer amazement at the audacity of the Pink Boat .
To protect it from being towed away by the police , rebels have superglued themselves to its underside and are immediately known as “ the Barnacles . ”
With ringing simplicity , the words TELL THE TRUTH are stenciled on the side .
“ Tell the truth , and act as if that truth is real ” is XR ’s first demand , asking that we truly inhabit the horror of our situation .
XR quotes Gandhi’s “ truth - force , ” Satyagraha , firmly holding to truth in words and respecting the importance of what is real and good — “ the Force , ” in Gandhi ’s words , “ which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence . ”
Truth is central to ordinary , decent human values .
It is taught to children and encoded in spiritual law and mythic lore : the truth will set you free .
And yet , in this age of widespread advertising deceit , where both the current U.S. president and U.K. prime minister are avid liars , and where climate scientists receive death threats for their fealty to truth , in this post - truth world , where the media routinely distort or ignore both climate crisis and extinctions , truth is now a rare thing in public life , as radical and unexpected as a bright pink boat anchored in Oxford Circus .
The boat is deliberately placed within sight of the BBC ’s London headquarters , and XR ’s campaign , titled “ Media , Tell the Truth , ” includes a “ Requiem for a Dead Planet ” outside the offices of the Daily Mail , and also the Metro , Evening Standard , and Independent .
With skeletons , eulogies , and speeches about those already dying because of the climate crisis ( about 315,000 each year , according to the United Nations ) , the requiem uses a live baroque music performance , and places lilies everywhere .
Whereas the media as a whole are fascinated by intellectually feckless and factless infotainment , XR speaks otherwise .
There can be no bigger news story than the climate crisis , the potential collapse of civilizations , the extinctions of species , and the threat to humanity ’s existence .
On my second day of rebellion , I am transfixed as a troupe of Red Rebels sweep across Piccadilly Circus .
They are street theater performers dressed in red with chalk - white faces , who flow through crowds , then take up positions , forming tableaux vivants , living sculptures .
Each performer wears a headdress , a chaplet of red roses , long gloves , veils , and ribbons of scarlet at their wrists .
Red is symbolic of the spilled blood of children and other species .
Red is a warning sign of danger ahead .
Stop .
Turn back .
You are going the wrong way .
The Red Rebels perform in silence , and through silence they speak .
Scarlet lips and black eye paint against the white faces exaggerate expressions as they move slowly from one emotion to another , using bodily gestures of grief , love , justice , fear , joy , pity , or victory .
Collectively , they distill that feeling into an intensity and transcendence that one person alone cannot create .
The somber effect shudders and astonishes the crowds that gather around them .
Powerful , ambiguous , archetypal , the performance uses aspects of Japanese Butoh theater and recalls the Furies and the divinities , the mythic psyche on red alert , burning and bleeding .
Like the chorus of a Greek tragedy that represents ancestors or the unborn , the Red Rebels assume the conscience of the past and the future .
They work from a strong spiritual core , speaking from a place far beneath and a time far beyond this moment .
They are an otherworldly presence , seers whose gaze reaches to the far horizons of vision .
SPIRITUALITY motivates many within XR , including the radical Rabbi Jeffrey Newman , who was arrested in his rabbinical robes , kneeling and praying , while protesting with XR .
Imams and vicars have joined the organization ’s ranks , and supporters include Buddhists , Quakers , and the former archbishop Rowan Williams .
One of those most frequently arrested is Phil Kingston , an eighty - three - year - old grandfather who is part of Christian Climate Action .
XR ’s vision includes a core of Sufi thinking : unflinching truth , reckless beauty , and audacious love .
When I met Roger Hallam , he looked to me like a flame - eyed John the Baptist — albeit one who frequently interrupts himself with a huge and self - deprecating laugh .
Hallam uses the language of religion and refers to the nineteenth - century “ Great Awakening ” for this “ woke ” generation , conjuring a sense of religious revivalism .
Indeed , XR has an indubitable messianic quality ; how could the vital need to save humanity and the natural world not have a salvationary note ?
On the third day of rebellion , I watch from the crowds at Oxford Circus as Daiara Tukano , resplendent in beads and feathers , takes the microphone at the Pink Boat .
She is from the Tucano people of the Brazilian Amazon and speaks of the earliest Earth protectors : Indigenous people defend 80 percent of the world ’s biodiversity , they have led the resistance to climate chaos , they are disproportionately affected by it , and they are in grave danger for their protest .
More than seventeen hundred environmental activists have been murdered this century , a disproportionate number being Indigenous people .
The Pink Boat is named Berta Cáceres , after the murdered Honduran Indigenous activist , killed in 2016 for fighting for the land and water rights of the Lenca people in Honduras .
Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim , an Indigenous Chad pastoralist , says , “ I will likely be part of the last generation of Indigenous peoples . ”
Interviewed , she speaks carefully and with exactness .
Almost imperceptibly , her eyes well up with tears .
“ The third world war is the environmental one and is much more criminal than the first and second because the third extincts not only peoples but all the environment . ”
Indigenous people have suffered genocide at the hands of imperialism and colonialism and for the sake of extractive industries .
Within the climate crisis , wealthy nations continue to sow the wind and are forcing the poorest to reap the whirlwind .
One XR banner reads : STILL FIGHTING CO2ONIALISM : YOUR CLIMATE PROFITS KILL .
XR consciously seeks to educate both the public and indeed itself about the politics of the climate crisis , committed to rebelling with cause , compassion , and creativity .
Perhaps in part because of this , its rebellion is infectious .
XR has grown to over 100,000 members in the U.K. and spread internationally to fifty - five countries .
In the U.S. , rebels protest against the New York Times , and , in Washington , superglue themselves to doorways at Capitol Hill , blocking members of Congress attending a vote and seeking to direct their attention to a motion of climate emergency .
They ask ,
What other choice do we have when our politicians choose money over life ?
In Australia , XR canoeists take to the waters to draw attention to the Great Barrier Reef .
Giant XR symbols spring up around the globe : a sand sculpture in New Zealand , an XR symbol made of flowers in Medellin , Colombia , and one made of human bodies in New York .
In Zurich , XR rebels dye the Limmat River a luminous green to draw attention to the impact of climate change on global water supplies .
Across the world , people are willing to be arrested for their protest .
I spend days trying to get arrested , along with over thirteen hundred others , including a marine biologist who is seven months pregnant , carrying her own ocean inside her .
On Easter Saturday , I am lying in the middle of Oxford Circus with my arm inside a “ lock - on pipe , ” and I ’m here for the duration .
This pipe is metal , dipped in concrete , wrapped in roofing felt .
Inside is a bar , so if you have a chain around your wrist and a carabiner , you can lock yourself into the pipe , and to free you , the police will have to cut your arm out of the construction .
It is a sophisticated kind of superglue .
Around us , children are writing notes to the arrestables .
One reads : “ I do n’t know you but I love you for doing this . ”
Another : “ I ca n’t be arrested because I am only ten , but I am really grateful that you are doing this . ”
A mother comes up to me with her daughter , about five years old , who has made a colored - ribbon wristband .
“ My daughter made this for you .
Would you mind wearing it ? ”
Truth is central to ordinary , decent human values .
It is taught to children and encoded in spiritual law and mythic lore : the truth will set you free .
Sparks from the police ’s angle grinder fly around my hair , and the heat is powerful .
I am suddenly frightened that they could misjudge the blade and my right hand , my writing hand , could be damaged .
One police officer regards my situation with bewilderment .
“ You could just release yourself , ” he points out , reasonably .
“ But then I probably would n’t get arrested , ” I say .
“ Why do you want to be arrested ? ” It ’s an important question .
The willingness to be imprisoned for nonviolent civil disobedience is one of the most powerful ways to bring about change .
“ I ’ve prototyped prison as a campaign strategy , ” says Hallam .
If the police ’s strength is their ability to arrest , XR ’s strength is to say “ yes , please do , ” and immediately , by seeking it , to co-opt the strength of the police .
Nonviolence is crucial : as research shows , 54 percent of nonviolent uprisings achieve their objectives whereas only 25 percent of violent ones do .
Arrest is , says Hallam , “ the classic sacrificial move . ”
Once the public sees large numbers of people taking the climate crisis so seriously that they would give up their liberty for it , the severity of the situation is underlined .
Not everyone in XR is courting arrest : it is a sad truth that people of color have good reason to be far more cautious of any involvement with the police and justice system than whites .
I am white and middle class , and the fact that the police are likely to treat me better is an uncomfortable privilege , but the tactic itself works because the media pay attention to it , covering the climate issue as never before .
Hallam adds : “ In the U.K. , when we take to the streets , we write a solicitor ’s number on our arms .
In other countries people write their blood type .
Others just write their names .
Who are we not to act when we have the freedom to do so ? ”
In the hour it takes for the police to cut through the lock - on , I ask an officer to get a message to Mark to sing me something .
Mark , knowing the soundtrack of my mind , cups his hands and begins : “ I ’ve seen your flag at the Marble Arch / And love is not a victory march but it ’s a cold and it ’s a broken Hallelujah . ”
A policewoman is kneeling by me , asking if I am okay .
She has tears in her eyes .
“ He ’s got a beautiful voice , ” she says .
I nod .
“ He ’s a beautiful person . ”
Many in the crowd are in tears , and some sing with him , until Hallelujahs ring out beyond us , beyond the police , out into the world .
This is my sweetest moment .
CELL NUMBER 12 .
The door clangs shut .
Silence .
Solitude .
I feel like crying .
I talk to the police when I can .
One says this week has been “ rejuvenating ” for him , and another says : “ The thing is , you ’re all so nice . ”
This is at the heart of it .
XR is committed to a simple strategy : be nice to the police .
They see it immediately , as well as XR ’s strict nonviolence , organization , and tenaciousness .
On the first night of the rebellion , one officer summed it up for me : “ Your attitude is good , so our attitude is good , so your behavior is good , so our behavior is good . ”
But this is more than strategy , it is the truth : we are all in the same boat together .
The cell is square and tiled , with a toilet in one corner and a sleeping shelf along one side with a thin blue plastic mat and a blue blanket .
The door has a three - inch - diameter peephole , so officers can look in .
They slide food , water , and blankets through a rectangular letter box .
There is a strip of fluorescent light .
Extinction is like a prison cell , the bleak and lifeless tiled veneer where nothing lives .
Not a shred of earth , except a little potted plant that one of the rebels had with him when he was arrested .
The police look after it for him .
The officer doing my ID records ( I ’ve never been arrested before ) is kind and gentle as he takes mouth swabs and fingerprints .
Another asks me about my wool - plaited wristband .
A little girl gave it to me to say thank you .
“ Ah , ” he smiles warmly , “ there is a God . ”
Time goes strange in a police cell .
I lose all sense of it .
It ’s hard not to be in control of your own hours , not knowing how long this will last .
I dread being released at three in the morning .
It is hard on the psyche , no question .
I sing .
Leonard Cohen is with me .
“ Like a bird on the wire , like a drunk in a midnight choir , I have tried in my way to be free . ”
I write .
I sleep .
Then dawn breaks on Easter Sunday morning , all the light of early spring pouring across London in the sunrise , and I am released from police custody at five a.m .
The police desk sergeant refers to “ your fellow protester , ” and I correct him , saying “ fellow rebel — this is a rebellion . ”
And he says “ sorry , yes . ”
He looks a little awkward , embarrassed , as one does when using an unfamiliar — taboo — word , one that is also “ sexy and transgressive , ” according to Hallam , which is why it was chosen .
As we leave , the rebel is reunited with his little green seedling , and one of the officers smiles candidly : “ You lot have been the best bit of my job in all my life .
We ’re on your side . ”
An officer shakes my hand as I leave .
“ God bless you .
Good luck . ”
I walk to the tent village at Marble Arch where a rebel is fast asleep in a treehouse and , without the noise of traffic , I hear birds singing a dawn chorus of exuberant joy , birdsong here for the first time in decades .
It is miraculous to hear after the cold silence of the cells .
When the rebellion ends , the campsite is tidied up , so nothing remains .
Nothing , that is , except something potentially priceless : an unconfirmed Banksy artwork that miraculously appeared overnight .
In it , a little girl holds the XR symbol as she plants a tiny green seedling in a little pot .
Spray - painted words read : FROM THIS MOMENT DESPAIR ENDS AND TACTICS BEGIN .
Hallelujah to that .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House of Representatives voted Friday to back the Democratic - sponsored revisions to federal surveillance laws .
The vote was 213-197 in favor of a revision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill that was supported by the Democratic leadership .
One member voted present .
The vote came after a secret session Thursday night in the House .
It was the first time the House has met in secret since 1983 .
The Democratic plan would allow telecommunications companies to be sued for their role in the administration 's much - disputed warrantless surveillance program .
The bill now goes to the Senate , but both the Senate and President Bush have made it clear that they will not support the bill without an immunity provision .
Bush has spent weeks pressuring the House to grant retroactive legal immunity to the phone companies that took part in the program , initiated after the September 11 attacks .
Bush argues that legal protection is needed for companies to continue cooperating with the government and has vowed to veto the House Democratic proposal , which would allow the lawsuits to move forward in federal courts .
The Senate has voted to protect the phone companies from lawsuits filed by privacy advocates , who argue that the surveillance program was illegal .
The Democratic plan , however , will allow the companies to argue their cases and present classified evidence to a judge during a closed proceeding without the plaintiffs present .
On Friday , GOP members spoke out against the plan .
Democrats " know the risks they are taking on behalf of the American people and they do n't care ... and that 's what bothers me most , " Republican Rep. Heather Wilson of New Mexico said .
Rep. Adam Putnam of Florida blasted Democrats for adjourning Congress for two weeks " without having given every protection available to the American people . "
A joint statement from the Department of Justice and the office of the director of national intelligence said that based on initial reports , " We are concerned that the proposal would not provide the intelligence community the critical tools needed to protect the country . "
The statement also restates the administration 's position that immunity protection is necessary so the program can continue .
" Exposing the private sector to continued litigation for assisting in efforts to defend the country understandably makes the private sector much more reluctant to cooperate .
Without their cooperation , our efforts to protect the country cannot succeed , " it said .
Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence , warned Wednesday that the House proposal " would , in essence , shut us down " and sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a letter outlining his objections to the legislation .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers took a different angle .
" We are not going to cave into a retroactive immunity situation , " the Michigan Democrat said .
" There 's no law school example in our memory that gives retroactive immunity for something you do n't know what you are giving it for .
It just does n't work in the real world or on the Hill either . "
Bush called the plan " a partisan bill that would undermine America 's security , " and White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the Democratic bill " would hamstring the intelligence community . "
Watch Bush threaten to veto »
But Pelosi , D - California , said : " The president is wrong , and he knows it . "
Pelosi said Republicans also called for a closed session of the Senate during its debate on the bill , a move she characterized as a delaying tactic .
" But again , if there is a merit to having a closed session that is worth pushing back consideration of the bill , let 's hear what their purpose is , " she said .
Secret sessions were common in the early 1800s , but the House has held only three since 1830 , not counting Thursday's , according to the Congressional Research Service .
The third was in 1983 , to discuss U.S. support for efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua .
Rep . David Obey , a veteran Wisconsin Democrat , said he took part in that session and the two previous ones , in 1979 and 1980 .
" And I think the great utility of having another one , given the mumbo - jumbo I heard in the last three , is to demonstrate the almost total uselessness of secret sessions , " he said .

McCAIN'S CITIZENSHIP ELIGIBILITY FOR PRESIDENT IN QUESTION ?
By : Devvy
February 15 , 2008 ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com U.S. Constitution , Art. II , Sec. 1 , Clause 5 : The Presidency : " No person except a natural born citizen , or a citizen of the United States , at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States ... "
A couple of weeks ago , I began receiving quite a number of emails making this claim : " The origin of the natural - born citizen clause can be traced to a July 25 , 1787 , letter from John Jay to George Washington , presiding officer of the Constitutional Convention .
John Jay wrote : " Permit me to hint , whether it would be wise and seasonable to provide a strong check to the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our national Government ; and to declare expressly that the Commander in Chief of the American army shall not be given to nor devolve on , any but a natural born Citizen . "
There was no debate , and this qualification for the office of the Presidency was introduced by the drafting Committee of Eleven , and then adopted without discussion by the Constitutional Convention .
Legislation and legal arguments " The requirements for citizenship and the very definition thereof have changed since the Constitution was ratified in 1788 .
Congress first extended citizenship to children born to U.S. parents overseas on March 26 , 1790 , under the first naturalization law : " And the children of citizens of the United States that may be born beyond sea , or outside the limits of the United States , shall be considered as natural born citizens . "
This was addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case as a form of naturalization .
The Dred Scott case , however , was overturned by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 .
The Fourteenth Amendment mentions two types of citizenship : citizenship by birth and citizenship by law ( naturalized citizens ) : " All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . "
" All persons born in the United States , except those not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. government ( such as children of foreign diplomats ) are citizens by birth .
There is some debate over whether other persons with citizenship can also be considered citizens by birth , or whether they should all be considered citizens by law ( thus " naturalized " ) .
Current US statutes define certain individuals born overseas as citizens by birth .
One side of the argument interprets the Constitution as meaning that a person either is born in the United States or is a naturalized citizen .
Thus , to be a " natural born citizen , " a person must be born in the United States ; otherwise , they are citizens by law and are naturalized .
To others , the statute !
that grants citizenship to American children born overseas exempts them from the term " naturalized " and thus , as with the 1790 law , they are to be considered " natural born citizens " eligible for the Presidency .
Examples of persons who become citizens at birth ( whether " naturalized " or " natural born " ) would include : birth to Americans overseas , or birth on U.S. soil , territories , or military bases overseas .
Children born outside the United States to American parents .
" Three major candidates have sought the Presidency who were born outside the United States : Barry Goldwater ( ran in 1964 ) was born in Arizona while it was still a U.S. territory , George Romney ( ran in 1968 ) was born in Mexico to U.S. parents , and John McCain ( ran in 2000 and running in 2008 ) was born in the Panama Canal Zone to U.S. parents .
Barry Goldwater 's case among these three is unique in that although Arizona was not a state , it was a fully incorporated territory of the United States , making it debatable whether or not he was born " outside " the United States .
The Panama Canal Zone was under United States sovereignty between 1903 and 1979 .
None of these candidates was elected , so it has never been fully addressed whether children born to Americans overseas are " natural - born citizens " and thus eligible for the Presidency .
However , McCain is currently seeking the 2008 Republican nomination for President . "
My first reaction was that McCain , born of a parent who was on active military duty outside the country is automatically granted citizenship as if he were born at Walter Reed or a hospital in Terra Haute , Indiana .
My husband 's children were born in Germany on Army bases leased from the host countries .
They automatically became citizens .
When you think about it , how practicable would it be for the wife of a sergeant or general to have to catch a plane from Okinawa , Germany or Panama just to give birth so that child would be ' natural born ' ?
Should a child of active duty military whose parents were born inside the U.S. , be penalized for a parent 's service to this republic by denying that child the right as an American citizen to run for the highest office in the land ?
I am not an attorney , but I have learned a world of knowledge from some of the best legal minds in this country over the past 18 years .
As this is such an important question because it would be a tragedy if John McCain were to get the GOP nomination in September , I asked constitutional attorney , Larry Becraft , if he could help me on this issue .
He has spent years compiling statutes regarding the word ' citizen , ' resident alien , application and so forth .
Words have meaning in the legal world and interpretation of some words , shall , may will , have filled books found in law libraries .
Larry sent the law passed in 1790 about citizenship ; see pdf file here .
The question of citizenship regarding a presidential candidate has come up several times , including 2000 when McCain was running .
After doing a thorough search on the Internet , I did n't find any lawsuit challenging McCain 's citizenship in 2000 .
In 2004 , the issue was raised again : U.S. Congress moves to clarify the rules : Just how ' American ' must a president be ?
" His Natural Born Citizen
Act would include children born outside the United States to citizen parents or parents able to transfer their citizenship .
That would include McCain , whose parents were citizens , as well as an estimated two million others who , according to government figures , have been born to U.S. parents living and working overseas . "
Further research brought me to this web site which states the following , in part : " Who is a natural - born citizen ?
Who , in other words , is a citizen at birth , such that that person can be a President someday ?
" The 14th Amendment defines citizenship this way : " All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . "
But even this does not get specific enough .
As usual , the Constitution provides the framework for the law , but it is the law that fills in the gaps .
" Currently , Title 8 of the U.S. Code fills in those gaps .
Section 1401 defines the following as people who are " citizens of the United States at birth : " " Anyone born inside the United States
Any Indian or Eskimo born in the United States , provided being a citizen of the U.S. does not impair the person 's status as a citizen of the tribe
Any one born outside the United States , both of whose parents are citizens of the U.S. , as long as one parent has lived in the U.S .
Any one born outside the United States , if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year and the other parent is a U.S. national
Any one born in a U.S. possession , if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year
Any one found in the U.S. under the age of five , whose parentage cannot be determined , as long as proof of non-citizenship is not provided by age 21
Any one born outside the United States , if one parent is an alien and as long as the other parent is a citizen of the U.S. who lived in the U.S. for at least five years ( with military and diplomatic service included in this time )
A final , historical condition : a person born before 5/24/1934 of an alien father and a U.S. citizen mother who has lived in the U.S .
Anyone falling into these categories is considered natural - born , and is eligible to run for President or Vice President .
These provisions allow the children of military families to be considered natural - born , for example : " Many parts of the world have law to provide them with special status , to allow children born in those places to be considered natural - born .
This allows families with a long history of working in these areas without ever returning to the U.S. to be considered natural - born .
For example , the Panama Canal Zone had been in U.S. possession for a full century , and some families lived there for generations .
8 USC 1403 handles the Zone specifically , stating that anyone born in the Zone on or after 2/26/1904 , to at least one citizen - parent , is a natural - born citizen .
Similar law is in place to handle the acquisition of territories , such as Puerto Rico , Alaska , and Hawaii . "
8 USC 1403 states : TITLE 8 > CHAPTER 12 > SUBCHAPTER III >
Part I > ï¿½ 1403 Prev | Next ï¿½ 1403 .
Persons born in the Canal Zone or Republic of Panama on or after February 26 , 1904 ( b ) Any person born in the Republic of Panama on or after February 26 , 1904 , and whether before or after the effective date of this chapter , whose father or mother or both at the time of the birth of such person was or is a citizen of the United States employed by the Government of the United States or by the Panama Railroad Company , or its successor in title , is declared to be a citizen of the United States .
The question has also been raised about whether ' natural born ' applies to geographical areas ?
This from a woman who wishes to remain anonymous : " Does " natural born " also include all " American citizens " who got / have " automatic " U.S. citizenship status when born outside the geographical boundaries of the country of the United States ( because that person 's parents had citizenship roots from the 50 States or from the federal zones within the 50 States ) ?
If so , then John McCain and our son , born in England , would qualify as " natural born . "
( NOTE : I say " from the 50 States " because people born within the territories , such as Puerto Rico , Guam , etc. , also are " automatic " citizens of this country .
But there are different ways in which " automatic " citizenship is " granted , " which you 'll see as you keep reading . )
" REMEMBER , we 're dealing with TWO different issues here .
" Automatic Citizenship upon birth " does n't also automatically qualify one as the " natural born " requirement of the federal constitution .
According to that Supreme Court case , there 's the matter of " geography " involved .
And also , remember , the " birth certificate " did n't exist at the time of the adoption of the federal constitution .
Also , this country did n't have territories and military bases in other countries , nor " such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) : Article I , Section 8 . [ 17 ] " which is today 's federal District of Columbia .
The federal constitution at that time was only dealing with 13 States , each which had its own constitution , but which was considered the " country known as the United States . "
( In the Declaration of Independence the country was termed to be " the united States , " another issue , but I note it just so the reader realizes there are many side / extended / related issues in all of this . )
So I believe that " natural born " in regards to being born within the geographical boundaries of this country would be a correct interpretation by the Supreme Court in its decision . "
The question then arises : Should a change to Art. II , Sect. 1 , Clause 5 , have required a constitutional amendment ?
I am vehemently against a constitutional amendment to change the citizenship requirement to accommodate one world government advocates like Arnold Schwarzenegger becoming president .
Considering what happened with former Secretary of State , Henry Kissinger , who I consider a traitor in the strictest sense , and the line of succession should a president be unable to continue in office , this is a dangerous proposal .
One only has to do a bit of research to understand moles are groomed from toddler age to undertake becoming U.S. citizens for the sole purpose of spying and betraying America .
Never under estimate your enemies .
However , we are back to the question raised : John McCain 's eligibility to run for president based on citizenship .
Larry Becraft said this is an issue that could be challenged legally ; please note the word ' could . '
How would this get done ?
A plaintiff has to have standing for one thing .
Second , this would have to be done quickly as the clock is ticking .
There are many fine legal scholars , i.e. , Jonathan Turley ) , who could give qualified opinions on this question .
There are exceptional constitutional attorneys , i.e. , William J. Olson , Dr. Edwin Vieira , and others who could be retained for a legal challenge if they felt there was a basis for such a lawsuit .
Before one undertakes any lawsuit with such weighty legal questions , there has to be a reality check as to a successful outcome with many factors to consider .
It also takes loads of cash .
As it stands right now , unless there is a legal challenge , this is a dead issue other than wishful thinking and interesting discussion on the Internet .

Both McCain and Pastor Huckabee have the full support of the establishment and corrupt media ; both have run their campaigns on practically no money .
A text message arrives : it 's an offer of a free upgrade to your mobile phone .
The monthly line rental is lower and the package includes more calls .
You 'll even get a new handset thrown in .
So you call back and take them up on the deal .
Have you just made a mistake that will be with you for the next two years ?
Are you sure you were speaking to your mobile phone network ?
Or was it a company you have simply never heard of , selling you a deal that will land you with higher bills , a phone you wo n't like , and a contract you 're stuck with ?
You may think you 'd never fall for such a scam , but a surprising number of people do .
With 70 million mobile phones now in use in the UK , almost 25 million of them on contracts that bill monthly , the industry has been a runaway success ever since it started up the 1980s .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But more of us are feeling short - changed .
The industry 's independent regulator , Ofcom , reported a rise in complaints during 2007 from people who felt that they had been mis-sold a mobile contract by unscrupulous middlemen .
By the end of the year , complaints were running at about 400 a month .
Despite reaching an agreement last year with the networks and retailers on a code of practice , Ofcom has seen little reduction in complaints .
" We 're reviewing the whole area of mis-selling at the moment , " an Ofcom spokesman says , " and we 'll have more to say on this matter within a couple of months .
But the key aim is to make the networks far more accountable for sales practices . "
Until then , it pays to understand how the mobile sales industry works .
Take the example of Madeleine Lees .
Her continuing saga is typical .
She received a call telling her that her contract with Orange was about to run out , and that she could upgrade her phone and switch to a more suitable price plan .
She agreed .
But her bills rose sharply , and she realised that – in spite of having explained her needs clearly – the new tariff included too many minutes of call time and not enough text messages .
So she called Orange .
" Orange told me that my agreement was n't with them , but with a third party – which was news to me .
They said I needed to speak to the other company .
The third party advised me that they could n't terminate the contract unless I paid for a full 24 months – although every bill I 've received lists my contract term as 18 months .
Then , to complete the circle of blame , they told me it was up to Orange to resolve the issue . "
In the back of her mind was the knowledge that simply stopping payments would mar her credit rating .
This buck - passing is typical of many recent complaints .
Although each of the five major mobile networks – O2 , Vodafone , Orange , T - Mobile and 3 – sells phones directly , they also authorise a range of affiliate dealers to sell contracts on their behalf , in return for commission .
More than 400,000 contracts a month – that 's almost five million a year – are sold by about 4,000 of these dealers , including the major players such as Phones4u and Carphone Warehouse , and independent high - street retailers .
But right at the bottom of the heap are companies with no high - street presence .
And it 's from this sector that many of the complaints arise .
Based either online or in call centres , these companies are behind many of the unsolicited offers made by calls and text messages .
The problem is not helped by the fact that paper contracts are rarely sent out to consumers .
But the cause of these troubles can be traced back to the way the mobile sales industry works at its root .
Unsurprisingly , networks will pay out more money to dealers if they succeed in selling you a higher - value contract .
This can be achieved in two ways – by getting you to agree to a tariff with higher monthly bills , or to a contract that runs over a longer term .
A few years ago , 12 - month contracts were the norm .
Now , 18 - month contracts are standard , and some last two years .
These contract lengths are often blamed on the rising cost of more advanced handsets ; remember that the upfront cost of the phone itself is absorbed into the contract .
But in fact , the price of the phones has actually remained fairly static over the years .
The real reason for the longer contracts is simply that they increase the value of each contract sold .
On the one hand , this means that we do n't get a new phone so regularly – no bad thing , considering the environmental impact of discarded handsets .
On the other hand , it only takes a change of circumstances – losing your job , illness , a move abroad , even just the theft of your phone – for problems to start .
After agreeing terms in a single phone conversation , you are locked into a binding agreement , and the only way to get out is to pay the full cost of that contract , which can run to several hundred pounds .
Perhaps the biggest flaw in the system is that , once the middleman has secured his commission , there 's very little incentive to offer any customer care .
Indeed , many consumers can't even track down the company they 've supposedly entered into the agreement with .
And herein lies the biggest annoyance for many victims of mis-selling : that the middleman operates under a veil of secrecy , and often masquerades as the network itself .
Matthew Garrett 's experience is common .
" I was called by a company offering me a new contract , " he says .
" When I asked who was calling , they said it was Orange , but I 'd already received two text messages and two unsolicited phone calls offering me a contract from a third - party company based in Wales – and this guy had a Welsh accent .
When I suggested to him what the real name of his company was , he backed down . "
Some dealers persist to the point of harassment .
Christina McDermott tells of a company who contacted her up to 15 times a day .
" When I told them to stop , they would frequently laugh down the phone at me .
T - Mobile , with whom I had my contract , told me there was nothing they could do about it . "
If you do sign up , many customers discover that they end up with a less - than - cutting - edge handset .
Networks with a glut of handsets they can't get rid of will incentivise dealers to push those end - of - the - line models .
Kate Dornan describes how she was " stung " with an expensive 18 - month contract by a firm from Birmingham .
" My supposed upgrade turned out to be a bottom - of - the - range , frankly embarrassing , neon - blue handset that barely worked .
And it arrived when I was out of the country , so I missed the cancellation period .
They even phoned me again at the end of the 18 months to try it on a second time – when I told them about the previous fiasco they went very quiet . "
The most blatant problem , though , may be the so - called " cash back " deals .
You 're dangled the carrot of having a free mobile phone contract and handset for a year ; you 're merely required to send your mobile phone bills to the company by a certain date , and they will reward you with a cheque for the full amount .
The deadline is usually set so that it 's barely able to be met ; the firms depend on you either forgetting to send the bill , or for the postal delivery to be late .
If you follow the rules to the letter , you 'll get a free contract .
But it 's more likely that you wo n't get your money back , or the company will go bankrupt , leaving you with a costly contract and no one to get your money back from .
Chris Caudle , the chairman of the Independent Mobile Phone Dealers Association ( IMPDA ) , acknowledges that there are fly - by - night operators that the industry needs to get rid of .
But cash - back deals and the like are the result of the networks competing too hard with their own dealers , he says .
" The networks have started offering ridiculous deals – deals our dealers are n't allowed to offer – to lure customers away .
We 've asked the networks to talk to us , but they wo n't . "
Until all these issues are dealt with , and more transparent sales practices are in place , we 'll all just have to wise up .
There certainly seems to be a lack of dialogue between dealers and networks .
Many industry observers can see that there 's a desperate need for change .
Steve Warren of the price - comparison website Uswitch.com says : " More responsibility needs to be taken by the mobile networks over companies using aggressive tactics to sell as many mobile contracts as possible . "
The IMPDA has called on Ofcom to introduce statutory regulation to protect consumers and eliminate uncompetitive practices , and the Labour MP Roger Godsiff recently lent his support .
Will they have any effect in holding to account an industry that generates £ 13.9 bn a year ?
Please hold while we find out – but it 'll be a few months before we have an answer .
What to do when the middleman calls
By Henry Brennan
Packages to suit you
* If you receive a text message offering you a mobile phone upgrade , ignore it .
* If you receive a cold call , be sceptical .
If the deal sounds good , ask which company is calling , get a telephone number and a name , and call back .
* If you are using a high - street middleman , remember that the sales staff will often be given incentives to push a particular network , and that the assistants ' advice might be best for their business , not for you .
Shop around and negotiate .
* In all cases , ask explicitly about contract length and cancellation terms .
There 's often a time during the contract after which you can downgrade to a lower tariff ; check when that is , too .
* Ask about extra costs , such as itemised billing .
Remember that middlemen may also be on commission to sell insurance .
* Question anything that 's supposed to be free .
* When asked what you currently pay per month , do n't reveal the full value of your bills ; tell them the monthly contract value , before any extra charges .
Otherwise , if you tell them your bill is £ 40 a month , they might put you on a £ 40 - per- month contract , and you could have to pay all the extra charges on top of that .

The occasional user
Many pay - as - you - go packages now come with extra rewards .
Orange 's " Speak Easy Bonus Top - up " package works on a sliding scale that awards bonus credit on proportion to the amount you spend .
If you get through at least £ 10 per month , you get 300 texts at the end of the month , for free .
Alternatively , if texts are n't your thing , you can opt for a £ 1 credit instead .
The big talker
The network 3 offers an 18 - month package that provides 900 minutes of talk time , or 900 texts , or any combination of the two ( 600 minutes plus 300 texts , for instance ) for £ 24 a month , and offers a couple of decent free phones .
The network also bundles in an extra 300 minutes per month to other 3 users .
T - Mobile 's " My Faves 25 " package offers unlimited minutes and texts to five of your favourite UK numbers , plus 25 minutes of calls and 50 texts to other numbers , for £ 25 per month .
The text addict
T Mobile 's 18 - month Flext 35 package offers £ 180 - worth of calls and texts , and costs you £ 30 per month .
Calls are charged at 20 p per minute to any UK network and texts cost 10 p each .
So that 's 900 minutes or 1,800 texts – or a mixture of the two .
The deal includes free weekend calls .

We ’d love to hear about it in the comments .
A Delta High School teacher who allegedly gave his students permission to beat a classmate who was late for class has been charged with child abuse .
Brian Havel , 22 , was teaching English at the school March 14 when the boy arrived after class started .
“ In his class , the disciplinary process was X amount of sit-ups or push - ups in a certain amount of time .
He either would n’t or could n’t complete them , ” Delta interim Police Chief Roger Christian said of the punished student .
The boy ’s classmates volunteered to administer an alternate punishment .
“ The class made a suggestion that if he could n’t finish , we ought to be able to punch him , and ( Havel ) agreed .
So 10 to 15 students got to hit him , ” Christian said .
Havel has resigned and is no longer at the school , said Delta principal Delaine Hudson .
Havel could n’t be reached for comment .
The boy , who has n’t been identified , was n’t seriously hurt and did n’t require medical assistance .
Teachers at the school do n’t normally punish students by making them perform physical exercise , Hudson said .
“ We do have a letter of resignation , ” said Delta Joint School District spokesman John Jones .
Havel is due in court April 30 .
In the fall of 1974 , I returned to the University of Kansas after spending a year at the University of Illinois .
During my time at Illinois , I had sat in on a course on Topos Theory ( the most avant - garde form of category theory ) given by John Gray , and had also attended the commutative ring theory seminars led by Robert Fossum , Philip Griffith , and Graham Evans .
I had also spent a lot of time in the library , as usual reading on a large variety of topics , but most especially trying to understand the most recent commutative ring theory , especially as it related to algebraic geometry .
Back at Kansas , the ring theorists were concerning themselves with the Gilmer - style theory of non-noetherian commutative rings , and were intimidated by any homological approach at all , even the bare mention of Ext.
Paul Conrad who was the head of the algebra department ( as it were ) at Kansas suggested that I might like to teach a two - semester graduate topics course .
I suggested that Homological Algebra might be an appropriate course .
My objective was to educate the faculty as well as whatever students enrolled .
And in fact , all three rings theorists -- Brewer , Rutter , and Philip Montgomery , attended regularly .
I wanted to teach essentially everything I knew about homological algebra and category theory , with a large dose of the kind of commutative ring theory that was popular at Illinois and which was then much more fashionable than the Gilmer stuff .
I came into class every day with detailed notes , and basically read the notes aloud and copied them onto the board as fast as was physically possible .
The students coped fairly bravely with my furious pace , and at the end of the semester , the graduate students in the Mathematics Department voted to give me the award for the best graduate course taught that year .
This award had never before been given for an advanced course , and considering that it was the first graduate course I 'd ever taught , I thought I 'd done really well .
Despite my award , though , a year later the University decided , over the vociferous objections of the Mathematics Department , that I should be denied tenure on the grounds of inadequate teaching .
By the end of the course , I suppose I had about four or five hundred loose sheets of paper containing the complete notes .
I did n't save these when I left Kansas , but I did make an outline including statements of all the non-routine theorems , and proofs for the more difficult ones .
That outline is basically what I 'm making available here .
Because of the rather schematic quality of these notes , they are probably not very suitable for beginners , even though the original course was an introductory course .
( The dates indicate when the notes were put on this web page , or the date of the latest revision . )
A lot of the files listed below are in PDF ( Adobe Acrobat ) format .
Alternate versions are in DVI format ( produced by TeX ; see see here for a DVI viewer provided by John P. Costella ) and postscript format ( viewable with ghostscript . )
Some systems may have some problem with certain of the documents in dvi format , because they use a few German letters from a font that may not be available on some systems .

The word descent had been all the rage among the ring theorists at Illinois , and I had worked hard as hell to figure out what the hell it was about .
When I presented it in class though , the ring theorists at Kansas clearly thought it was far too arcane for them to even consider trying to master .

I spent an enormous amount of time in the library working my way through Bass 's fundamental paper on Gorenstein rings .
It 's the kind of paper that appeals to me because it brings some many diverse ideas together .

The Latest Data : Yes ,
It ’s a Recession
There has been a lot of hand - wringing about whether or not the U.S. economy is currently in a recession .
This morning ’s data will , I think , lead to a near - unanimous view that the U.S. economy is in a recession .
Not only was employment growth in February negative , but the B.L.S. also tells us that the previous two months were worse than originally thought .
Over the past three months , non -farm payrolls fell at an annualized rate of about 0.1 percent .
As the chart below shows , in virtually every instance in which payrolls fell over a 3 - month period , the NBER business cycle dating committee declared the U.S. economy to be in recession .
Indeed , the only exceptions to this rule occurred over 50 years ago .
A few more thoughts :
1 ) The only thing to save us now : these are preliminary data , and a big upward revision could give a different view .
But given the run of other recent economic data , it seems pretty darn clear that the macroeconomy is currently pretty grim .
2 ) What the politicos will say : given where we are in the political cycle , expect some commentators to point instead to the survey - based measure of the labor market .
These data are based on a survey of workers rather than firms , and tend to yield noisier estimates .
And when numbers can jump around a lot , it gives plenty of scope for political operatives to choose the specific numbers that support the particular story they are trying to tell .
Even so , there ’s not a lot of good news in the survey data .
3 ) What many macroeconomists will be pondering : does this second recent recession challenge the view that we are in the midst of a “ great moderation , ” in which the business cycle has been tamed ?
4 ) The chances of a recession , according to Intrade.com , have risen to somewhere around 60 percent .
But these traders are predicting the chances of two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth , rather than the decisions of the NBER business cycle dating committee .
The latter seems much more likely than the former ( although both are likely ) .
Further commentary : Paul Krugman writes ,
“ It has begun “ ; Brad DeLong warns against “ a natural human tendency to overreact to what is , after all , only a marginal data point , ” but goes on to say that “ it is time for words like `alarm ’ and `grave concern , ' ” a message consistent with this roundup of other commentary .

With solid state drive ( SSDs ) reaching ever increasing capacities , they are starting to finally match many standard hard drives .
The Memoright 128 GB 2.5 " SSD , is not only extremely fast , but also finally has the capacity to make me not worry about loading many games and videos onto my notebook .
This has n’t always been the case with 32 GB or 64GB drives , where the operating system and main applications took a massive chunk out of your free space .
With the help of the guys over at DVNation , the exclusive US distributor for Memoright , we are able to review this model today .

Setup
To get this SSD going in your notebook , it is only a matter of swapping drives and installing your software again .
This drive is compatible with a wide range of notebooks depending on chipset , and is " plug and play " with standard size 2.5 " SATA hard drives .
I chose to install Windows Vista , and I only needed about 25 minutes before I had a system that was up and running , ready to install other applications .
Performance
I was very impressed by the speed of the 128GB Memoright drive .
Reaching speeds 20 - 30 MB / s greater than my 7200rpm Seagate 7200.2 drive , it was a night and day comparison opening up applications .
Games loaded much faster , load times between levels were 1 - 2 seconds .
Windows startup was incredibly fast having very little disk trashing ( if there was any you could n’t hear it ! ) .
To give you a better understanding of how fast this thing is , look below for benchmarks between the Memoright 128GB SSD and my Seagate 7200.2 120 GB HD .

In short , you ’ll be hard - pressed to find a faster high - capacity SSD at the time of this writing .
In practical terms , as soon as you search for a file this SSD locates it .
As soon as you launch an application it ’s open and ready to use .
Think of modern SATA SSD technology as you would a Ferrari :
It ’s super fast , but expect to pay a premium .
Compatibility
Not every SATA controller I tested with the Memoright SSD recognized the drive .
Every onboard SATA controller on the desktops and laptops I tried out worked , but my Expresscard - to - SATA controller would not acknowledge the drive .
Since I do n’t have every imaginable SATA controller on hand to test , I would suggest contacting DVNation or Memoright to find out if your system is compatible before purchasing the drive .
Conclusion
Considering the MemoRight 128GB SSD costs nearly double what my Thinkpad T60 set me back , this purchase is not for the light hearted ( or light walleted ) .
The performance of this drive was what I had expected , blowing away my standard drive in almost all areas .
The only reason I do n’t think I will be picking one of these drives up anytime soon is because of its high price .
On the other hand , I ’m certain that some consumers who can afford this level of performance will purchase this SSD without a second thought .
For all of those eager buyers wanting to snatch one up right now , head over to DVNation to pick one up .
Pros
Very fast : " Conservatively " almost 50 % faster than 7200rpm notebook drive
Quiet and shock proof … no moving parts
" Plug and Play " for most notebooks
Cons

So I was at first assuming this was an April fools joke , but they do indeed claim the sign as a client .
And they do send out cease and desists and demand damage payments for using the photo .
And the Hollywood Chamber website does say you need permission to use images of the sign .
This is news to me .
Their claim is that the photo on my website " may represent an unlawful attempt to associate [ my website ] with the Property and improperly indicates the Chamber 's endorsement and / or approval of [ my website ] and their services .
" They want money .
I 'm suppose to give them all documents necessary for them to determine how much I owe them .
Now .......
It 's just a tourist photo .
And I explicitly make no copyright claims about the photo .
And it 's not used in any way that even the most determined lawyer could argue constitutes or suggests any association or endorsement .
I have Google ads , but I 'm not selling anything , and the site has nothing to do with Hollywood , movies , Los Angeles , or movie stars .
I do n't think I 'm doing anything even remotely wrong here , and I do n't want to take the photo off my website .
But there is the threat to obtain monetary damages to deal with as well .
My initial reaction is to hire a lawyer and counter sue them , but I have no idea where to go with that .
My question -
What are my options here , and my best course of action ?
I 'm not rich , so fighting this in court is n't something I can bankroll .
But if they are indeed going to try and squeeze $ 5000 from me I 'd rather use that money for a lawyer than just hand it over .
Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden speaks to reporters upon his arrival in the Capitol for a meeting with the House Appropriations Committee 's Select Intelligence Oversight Subcommittee hearing on CIA interrogation programs , in Washington December 13 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - CIA Director Michael Hayden said on Wednesday he will retire from the U.S. Air Force but continue at the intelligence agency .
“ I recently informed the Department of Defense of my intention to retire from the United States Air Force , ” Hayden , a general , said in a note to CIA employees .
“ That will take effect on the first of July , nearly 39 years after I entered on active duty . ”
Hayden , who previously served as principal deputy director of national intelligence and head of the National Security Agency , has been the top CIA official since May 2006 .
A CIA spokesman said it was not unprecedented for an active duty military officer to retire from the military and continue as CIA director .
Adm. Stansfield Turner became CIA director in 1977 , retired from the Navy in 1978 and stayed at the CIA until 1981 .
During my first few talks , I worried a lot about my performance .
Was I too boring ?
Did the doctors see me as sleazy ?
Did the Wyeth reps find me sufficiently persuasive ?
But the day after my talks , I would get a call or an e-mail message from the rep saying that I did a great job , that the doctor was impressed and that they wanted to use me more .
Indeed , I started receiving more and more invitations from other reps , and I soon had talks scheduled every week .
I learned later that Wyeth and other companies have speaker - evaluation systems .
After my talks , the reps would fill out a questionnaire rating my performance , which quickly became available to other Wyeth reps throughout the area .
As the reps became comfortable with me , they began to see me more as a sales colleague .
I received faxes before talks preparing me for particular doctors .
One note informed me that the physician we’d be visiting that day was a “ decile 6 doctor and is not prescribing any Effexor XR , so please tailor accordingly .
There is also one more doc in the practice that we are not familiar with . ”
The term “ decile 6 ” is drug - rep jargon for a doctor who prescribes a lot of medications .
The higher the “ decile ” ( in a range from 1 to 10 ) , the higher the prescription volume , and the more potentially lucrative that doctor could be for the company .
A note from another rep reminded me of a scene from “ Mission : Impossible . ”
“ Dr. Carlat : Our main target , Dr. , is an internist .
He spreads his usage among three antidepressants , Celexa , Zoloft and Paxil , at about 25 - 30 percent each .
He is currently using about 6 percent Effexor XR .
Our access is very challenging with lunches six months out . ”
This doctor ’s schedule of lunches was filled with reps from other companies ; it would be vital to make our sales visit count .+
Naïve as I was , I found myself astonished at the level of detail that drug companies were able to acquire about doctors ’ prescribing habits .
I asked my reps about it ; they told me that they received printouts tracking local doctors ’ prescriptions every week .
The process is called “ prescription data - mining , ” in which specialized pharmacy - information companies ( like IMS Health and Verispan ) buy prescription data from local pharmacies , repackage it , then sell it to pharmaceutical companies .
This information is then passed on to the drug reps , who use it to tailor their drug - detailing strategies .
This may include deciding which physicians to aim for , as my Wyeth reps did , but it can help sales in other ways .
For example , Shahram Ahari , a former drug rep for Eli Lilly ( the maker of Prozac ) who is now a researcher at the University of California at San Francisco ’s School of Pharmacy , said in an article in The Washington Post that as a drug rep he would use this data to find out which doctors were prescribing Prozac ’s competitors , like Effexor .
Then he would play up specific features of Prozac that contrasted favorably with the other drug , like the ease with which patients can get off Prozac , as compared with the hard time they can have withdrawing from Effexor .
The American Medical Association is also a key player in prescription data - mining .
Pharmacies typically will not release doctors ’ names to the data - mining companies , but they will release their Drug Enforcement Agency numbers .
The A.M.A. licenses its file of U.S. physicians , allowing the data - mining companies to match up D.E.A. numbers to specific physicians .
The A.M.A. makes millions in information - leasing money .
Once drug companies have identified the doctors , they must woo them .
In the April 2007 issue of the journal PLoS Medicine , Dr. Adriane Fugh - Berman of Georgetown teamed up with Ahari ( the former drug rep ) to describe the myriad techniques drug reps use to establish relationships with physicians , including inviting them to a speaker ’s meeting .
These can serve to cement a positive a relationship between the rep and the doctor .
This relationship is crucial , they say , since “ drug reps increase drug sales by influencing physicians , and they do so with finely titrated doses of friendship . ”
III .
Uncomfortable Moments
I gave many talks over the ensuing several months , and I gradually became more comfortable with the process .
Each setting was somewhat different .
Sometimes I spoke to a crowded conference room with several physicians , nurses and other clinical staff .
Other times , I sat at a small lunch table with only one other physician ( plus the rep ) , having what amounted to a conversation about treating depression .
My basic Effexor spiel was similar in the various settings , with the focus on remission and the Thase data .

facadeprinter.org - three stones from Facadeprinter on Vimeo .
facadeprinter.org - 5 °Asalto Zaragoza from Facadeprinter on Vimeo .
The Facadeprinter is a simple , software controlled robot .
It consits of a two axis turn table and an airpressure printhead .
The printer shoots the artwork from a distanced position dot by dot onto the chosen area .
Using this method , inaccessible and also uneven surfaces can be printed on .
Buildings can be displayed without costly scaffolding .
The Facadeprinter is a large scale communication tool .
Print - aesthetics and method are distinguishly different from conventional print - and advertising techniques .
Artworks are applied directly onto walls , like the drawings of a ' magic pen ' .
At present , the maximum print distance is 12 meters , the maximum print height is around 8 meters .
The shooting frequency is up to 5 dots per second .
The printer is equipped with an industrial PC which is running the specially programmed printing software .
The machine is operated by touchscreen .
Artworks can be loaded from USB - devices in the file format SVG .
With an integrated camera photos of the printing area can be taken and overlayered with a printing preview .
This way position and scaling can be adjusted optimally on site .
The distance to the wall is measured by infrared - meter and entered manually .
The printing software calculates the driving coordinates regarding both the perspective and the ballistic distortion .
A paintball system was converted into a printhead to shoot the colour balls onto the wall .
The two axis turn table places the paintball marker by steppermotors and gears .
Before printing an integrated laser displays a bounding box of the artwork to verify the precise position on the wall .
In case of malfunction or danger printing can be paused anytime .
A balltower conveys the gelatine encapsulated colour balls to the marker .
Here they are accelerated to a speed of 200 km / h and finally burst on contact with the wall , leaving their coloured contents .
A colour dot of 5 to 10 cm diameter occurs on the wall .
The busted gelatine shell falls down to the ground where it can be removed , or left to decompose naturally by the rain without residue .
The colour qualities differ from each other gravely considering UV stability or dripping characteristics .
So colours can be chosen which bleach out within a few hours or remains visible for several months .

Graffiti Analysis : 3D from Evan Roth on Vimeo .
Evan Roth has just launched a new project that is currently on exhibition at the Kunsthalle Museum .
It 's a 3D printed data visualization of a 7 second tag , frozen in time .
Here 's the description from Evan :
Graffiti Analysis : Sculptures is a series of new physical sculptures that I am making from motion tracked graffiti data .
New software ( GA 3D ) imports .gml files ( Graffiti Markup Language ) captured using Graffiti Analysis , creates 3D geometry based on the data and then exports a 3D representation of the tag as a .stl file ( a common file format compatible with most 3D software packages including Blender , Maya and 3DS Max ) .
Time is extruded in the Z dimension and pen speed is represented by the thickness of the model at any given point .
I then have this data 3D printed to create a physical sculpture that serves as a data visualization of the tag .
For the Street and Studio exhibition at the Kunsthalle Wein , I collaborated with an anonymous local Viennese graffiti writer and had the GA sculpture printed in ABS plastic .
Graffiti motion data of his tag was captured in the streets ( for the first time ) at various points around Vienna

" Multimedia performers Sweatshoppe have been wheat pasting buildings with moving images all over New York .
Mapping video projections to LED - lit paint rollers , Sweatshoppe lay their projections on a surface , paint - stroke by paint stroke .
They call new digital performance style " Video Painting " .
How it works :
The software controlling the video was written in Max .
The paint roller does not use any sort of paint , it simply contains green LEDs .
The software tracks the color green and outputs the x y position which are sent to drawing commands and the strokes are textured with video .
Sweatshoppe is video artists Bruno Levy and Blake Shaw .
They plan on eventually releasing the software , but only after it is much more refined , buffed up with features and is user - friendly . "

" Walls , trains or house fronts - graffiti need to be sprayed on solid , " real " backgrounds .
Does n't it ?
An answer to this is provided by the " Tagged in Motion " project , which builds a bridge between real graffiti art and its virtual depiction .
The centre of attention is the graffiti artist DAIM , who co-created the nextwall .
Equipped with the appropriate technology , DAIM sprays graffiti into empty space .
In a large hall , three cameras using Motion Capturing record DAIM 's position and the movements he executes with a virtual spray can .
The assimilated data is shown to him in real time in a pair of video glasses - as free - floating 3D graffiti in space .
In this way he can decide how and where to apply his strokes , and via a Bluetooth controller can also determine the colours , strength of brushstrokes and textures of his work . "

The Graffiti Research Lab are continuing to raise the bar on what can be done when you merge technology and graffiti .
For their latest project they 're inviting writers , street artists , pranksters , bikers , and protesters to contribute work as they take control of the Renzo Piano KPN Telecom building and the Kop Van Zuid in Rotterdam from February 7th through the 10th .
During those evenings the massive 37 x 72 meter screen will become a place to display your uncurrated animations and graphics .
The back - side of the KPN will become a giant open wall which you can write on with a GRL created " BFL ( big fucking laser ) " .
Throughout the week , the G.R.L. will venture outside the green zone on sorties to laser tag and projection bomb the city center of Rotterdam on the BORF riot bike .
Should be an amazing week .

Karolina Sobecka makes night projections of wild animals from moving cars .
The coolest thing about the project is that the movements of the animals are programmed to match the speed of the car that is projecting it .
She writes ... " as the car moves , the animal runs along it speeding up and slowing down with the car , as the car stops , the animal stops also .
The framerate of the movie corresponds to the speed of the wheel rotation , picked up by a sensor .
If the presence of a moving object ( such as another car or pedestrian ) is detected with proximity sensors , its animal " avatar " appears in the projection .

The other day we gave a short interview to Geeta Dayal at the New York Times about the amazing work that the Graffiti Research Lab at Eyebeam is doing .
The article ran today in the International Herald .
It 's fantastic to see Evan and James get the much deserved recognition .
Here 's the article in full :
Devising digital techniques for graffiti artists
By Geeta Dayal The New York Times
Published : June 23 , 2006
NEW YORK
This city may have given birth to modern - day graffiti art , but how is it keeping up with the times ?
Graffiti in its traditional form , involving aerosol cans of spray paint and an inviting flat surface , still dominates on the streets .
But online things are evolving quickly .
Techniques are debated in forums , and photos of tags , or signatures , are constantly uploaded and swapped on popular photo - sharing Web sites like flickr.com .
Sites like Wooster Collective ( woostercollective.com ) function as digital galleries and as clearinghouses for street art on an international level .
Graffiti and other forms of street art are gaining recognition in major New York museums .
The Museum of Modern
Art recently acquired three oversize woodcuts and linoleum cuts by the current street art sensation Swoon ; the pieces currently are being shown as part of the exhibition " Since 2000 : Printmaking Now . "
On Friday the Brooklyn Museum was to open " Graffiti , " a major exhibition of large - scale graffiti paintings that includes works by 1980s trailblazers like Lady Pink ( Sandra Fabara ) and NOC 167 ( Melvin Samuels Jr. ) .
Now New
York has its own center for the study of graffiti technology .
The nascent Graffiti Research Lab is masterminded by two tech - minded artists , Evan Roth and James Powderly , and run from the Eyebeam gallery , a nonprofit arts and technology center where both men are fellows .
The purpose of the project is to rethink how people make and look at graffiti and street art , not by making the stuff but by developing tools that graffiti writers could potentially use .
" I 'm not a graffiti writer , " Powderly , 29 , said .
" I like to say I 'm a graffiti engineer . "
Using their odd combination of training - Powderly 's background is in aerospace robotics , Roth 's is in coding , architecture and Web design - they develop new methods of self - expression .
These include a panoply of digital projection techniques , LED - driven light art and specially written computer programs .
" As more and more people learn to program at a younger age , and computers get cheaper , graffiti is eventually going to have these technological elements as a part of it , " Roth said .
Roth , 28 , is a wunderkind in his tiny but thriving world .
A valedictorian of the Parsons School of Design 's graduate program in design and technology , he developed a thesis project called Graffiti Analysis , which used motion - tracking techniques and custom - written code to analyze and record a graffiti writer 's hand movement over time .
Working with several graffiti writers , Roth created a series of striking digital projections of graffiti being " written " at night on various New York buildings .
No physical mark is left on the building by this ghostly process , but it looks shockingly real while it is happening .
In a related project , Graffiti Taxonomy , Roth photographed hundreds of graffiti tags on the Lower East Side , and created detailed typographic charts of various letters of the alphabet based on the visual data he collected .
A flurry of New York - based graduate thesis projects in recent years have explored new forms of technology - oriented graffiti , including John Geraci 's Grafedia , a method of creating hyperlinked graffiti on city streets , and Joshua Kinberg 's Bikes Against Bush , which uses text messaging and a custom - built dot - matrix printer connected to a bicycle to print giant chalk letters on the sidewalk .
So far the Graffiti Research Lab 's activities include the Electro - Graf , a simple method of using magnetic and conductive paint to embed LED electronics inside a graffiti piece , surrounding the graffiti with a halo of brilliant light ; LED " throwies , " tiny and colorful battery - powered lights attached to magnets , designed to be thrown onto urban surfaces ; the Night Writer , an inexpensive device that posts foot - tall messages in glowing LED lights on metallic surfaces in a single fluid motion ; and Jesus 2.0 , a recent light sculpture collaboration with the street artist Mark Jenkins of Washington .
The lab is also working to refine various digital projection ideas that Roth explored in his Graffiti Analysis project .
The Graffiti Research Lab's values follow the idea - sharing philosophy of the open source movement : Roth and Powderly provide free and detailed online documentation on their Web site ( graffitiresearchlab.com ) so that anyone can follow - and replicate - their work .
Roth also teaches a class at Parsons entitled " Geek Graffiti . "
Roth realizes that eager companies may co-opt the lab 's work , although he is strongly anticommercial .
" Marketing people went crazy over the project , " he said of Graffiti Analysis , " because it 's cool and it 's big and it 's projected in public .
They look at Graffiti Analysis and see their company 's image inserted in there . "
The projects are intentionally designed to be cheap , user - friendly and not illegal .
" The kind of stuff I 've been doing is intentionally geared to a wider audience , " Roth said .
" One of the goals with the Graffiti Research Lab is to try to remove some of the negative connotations that graffiti has . "
Roth 's interest in studying graffiti and street art blossomed after he moved to New York from Los Angeles .
A turning point , he said , was seeing the classic documentary " Style Wars , " which immortalized the 1980s face - off between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and graffiti writers .
" They were hacking the subway to transport these huge art pieces from borough to borough , " Roth said of the artists .
" That movie makes graffiti feel like such a movement . "
Studying New York 's graffiti soon became his preoccupation .
" I did get totally obsessed with it , " he said , " to the point where I could n't walk down the street and have conversations with people without having my gaze sidetracked by a tag . "
The transportation authority recently proposed a $ 25 million plan to combat acid - based window etchings , also called scratchiti , on subway cars .
The agency is also considering the use of surveillance cameras to track down graffiti writers .
" There 's a strong crackdown , and gentrification changes the streets , " said Marc Schiller , the founder of Wooster Collective .
" But it 's a great time to be creative in general .
Creativity is so accessible now .
On the street and off , on the Web , the barriers to being creative have never been lower . "

The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming places on Earth
Flyover of the breaking ice shelf
A chunk of ice the size of the Isle of Man has started to break away from Antarctica in what scientists say is further evidence of a warming climate .
Satellite images suggest that part of the ice shelf is disintegrating , and will soon crumble away .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf has been stable for most of the last century , but began retreating in the 1990s .
Six ice shelves in the same part of the continent have already been lost , says the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) .
Professor David Vaughan of BAS said : " Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened .
" I did n't expect to see things happen this quickly .
The ice shelf is hanging by a thread - we 'll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be . "
' Like an explosion ' BAS researchers were alerted to the break - up by daily monitoring of satellite images .
They sent a Twin Otter aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to video what was happening .
This is yet another indication of climate change in the Antarctic Peninsula and how it is affecting the environment
Prof David Vaughan Jim Elliott , who was on board the plane , said he had never seen anything like it before .
He said : " We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage .
" Big hefty chunks of ice , the size of small houses , look as though they 've been thrown around like rubble - it 's like an explosion . "
A huge berg appears to be breaking away , with much of the Wilkins Ice Shelf protected only by a thin strip of ice spanning two islands .
Scientists say while the break - up will have no impact on sea level , it heightens concerns over the impact of climate change on this part of Antarctica .
' Unprecedented ' warming Professor Vaughan predicted in 1993 that the northern part of the Wilkins Ice Shelf would be lost within 30 years if climate warming continued .
But he said it is happening more quickly than he expected .
He told BBC News : " What we 're actually seeing is a chunk of the ice shelf drop off in a way that suggests it is not just a normal part of iceberg formation .
" This is not a sea level rise issue , but is yet another indication of climate change in the Antarctic Peninsula and how it is affecting the environment . "
Scientists say the Antarctic Peninsula , which juts out into the Southern Ocean towards the tip of South America , has experienced unprecedented warming over the last 50 years .
Several ice shelves have retreated in the past 30 years - six of them collapsing completely .
Other researchers believe the Wilkins Ice Shelf may hang on a little longer , as Antarctica 's summer melt season draws to a close .
Dr Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado said : " This unusual show is over for this season .
But come January , we 'll be watching to see if the Wilkins continues to fall apart . "

Obama gains more ground in Texas
AUSTIN —
As the smoke cleared from this weekend 's regional Democratic conventions , Barack Obama emerged with a majority of the state 's at - large presidential nominating delegates and possibly a majority of all Texas delegates .
But Hillary Rodham Clinton 's supporters vowed Sunday to continue the fight for Texas delegates all the way to this summer 's state party convention , promising to cut his lead in delegates .
The actual number of delegates awarded to Obama and Clinton will not be official until the state party convention meets June 5 - 7 in Austin .
The results of Saturday 's regional conventions were still being tallied Sunday , but Obama was winning about 58 percent of the delegates to the state convention .
About 100,000 people turned out for about 280 county and senatorial district conventions on Saturday .
The final conventions were being held Sunday in Collin County .
While participants waited in long lines and spent hours helping to elect presidential nominating delegates , the chaos was n't nearly as bad as the March 4 caucuses , which attracted about 1 million voters , Democratic Party spokesman Hector Nieto said .
" Overall , ( the conventions ) went pretty well , " Nieto said .
" It was democracy in action . "
Clinton won the popular vote in the March 4 primaries and a majority of the primary - allotted delegates , giving her a 65 - 61 lead .
Obama 's campaign claimed he came out of this weekend 's conventions with a 38 - 29 at - large delegate lead , giving him a five - pledged - delegate lead over Clinton .
" We can confirm now that Barack Obama won Texas , " said Obama spokesman Josh Earnest .
Clinton state Chairman Garry Mauro conceded that Obama is likely to have a 37 - 30 advantage in the at - large delegates , which would give Obama a total lead of three pledged delegates over Clinton .
Mauro said Clinton may be able to take at least two national nominating convention delegates away from Obama at the state convention .
She is working on convincing a majority of the 351 automatic state convention delegates to support her , Mauro said .
" If we 're in a hot race on June 6 , we expect to pick up more delegates , " Mauro said .
" I believe at the end of the day we will run either dead even or come out ahead in the delegate count . "
In the national delegate fight , Obama is leading 1,623 to Clinton 's 1,499 , according to the Associated Press , with 2,025 needed to win .
The automatic delegates to the state convention are party leaders , the members of the State Democratic Executive Committee and county chairs who get to attend the convention as a delegate and can vote for the presidential candidate of their choice .
These automatic delegates will make up about 4 percent to 5 percent of the total state convention population .
Earnest said he hopes the automatic candidates to the state convention will reflect their constituents when they make their decisions .
Those delegates " will all make their own decisions , but we would expect them to reflect the will of the voters , especially in these caucuses , " Earnest said .
There also are a group of national superdelegates from each state who automatically attend the national convention .
Clinton has been trying to clinch the nomination by securing a majority of the superdelegates .
The national superdelegates are members of Congress , the Democratic National Committee and certain party leaders .
There are 35 superdelegates from Texas .
At present , 12 are for Clinton , 10 for Obama and 13 are uncommitted .

The state ’s largest for - profit health insurer is asking California physicians to look for conditions it can use to cancel their new patients ’ medical coverage .
Blue Cross of California is sending physicians copies of health insurance applications filled out by new patients , along with a letter advising them that the company has a right to drop members who fail to disclose “ material medical history , ” including “ pre-existing pregnancies . ”
“ Any condition not listed on the application that is discovered to be pre-existing should be reported to Blue Cross immediately , ” the letters say .
The Times obtained a copy of a letter that was aimed at physicians in large medical groups .
The letter was n’t going down well with physicians .
“ We ’re outraged that they are asking doctors to violate the sacred trust of patients to rat them out for medical information that patients would expect their doctors to handle with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality , ” said Dr. Richard Frankenstein , president of the California Medical Assn .
Patients “ will stop telling their doctors anything they think might be a problem for their insurance and they do n’t think matters for their current health situation , ” he said .
“ But they did n’t go to medical school , and there are all kinds of obscure things that could be very helpful to a doctor . ”
WellPoint Inc. , the Indianapolis - based company that operates Blue Cross of California , said Monday that it was sending out the letters in an effort to hold down costs .
“ Enrolling an applicant who did not disclose their true condition ( and the condition is chronic or acute ) , will quickly drive increased utilization of services , which drives up costs for all members , ” WellPoint spokeswoman Shannon Troughton said in an e-mail .
“ Blue Cross feels it is our responsibility to assure all records are accurate and up to date for HMO providers , ” she said .
“ We send these letters to identify members early on in the process who may not have been honest in their application . ”
Blue Cross is one of several California insurers that have come under fire for issuing policies without checking applications and then canceling coverage after individuals incur major medical costs .
The practice of canceling coverage , known in the industry as rescission , is under scrutiny by state regulators , lawmakers and the courts .
Patients in a raft of lawsuits accuse the insurers of canceling coverage over honest mistakes and minor inconsistencies on applications that they contend are purposely confusing .
Victims of cancer and other serious medical problems often are unable to get new coverage once their insurance has been rescinded and they may go without treatment when they need it most .
Suddenly swamped by medical debt , some people have lost homes and businesses .
Insurers say the cancellations are an important weapon against fraud and occur rarely .
Physician groups and doctors who received the letter told The Times they never had seen anything like it .
Also unfamiliar with such letters was Don Crane , executive director of the California Assn. of Physician Groups , which represents many of the large HMO - style medical groups .
“ I have not heard any dialogue on this business of underwriting or ferreting out existing ” conditions , Crane said .
But WellPoint ’s Troughton said this was nothing new .
“ This is something that has been in place for several years and to date we have not received any calls or letters of concern for this service , ” she said .
It was important , Troughton added , “ to note that participation in this outreach effort is voluntary on the part of the physicians . ”
The California Medical Assn. sent a letter to state regulators Friday urging them to order Blue Cross to stop asking doctors for the patient information , saying it was “ deeply disturbing , unlawful , and interferes with the physician - patient relationship . ”
The letters go out to some physicians who care for Blue Cross ’ share of the state ’s estimated 3 million people with individual policies .
Troughton said Blue Cross sent the letters to medical groups that operate , in effect , as health maintenance organizations .
Blue Cross pays such groups a set amount per patient each month .
With a few exceptions , the groups are then responsible for arranging and providing patients ’ medical care and take on a substantial piece of the risk .
Troughton said “ in the past ” physicians in such medical groups had requested information on patients ’ pre-existing medical conditions because anything that had not been disclosed could affect the medical group ’s finances .
She disputed the notion that the letters could improperly breach patient confidentiality .
She said the sharing of medical information with medical groups was within federal law because it fell under “ patient , treatment and operations ” guidelines .
Blue Cross does n’t always cancel the policies of patients with discrepancies in their applications , Troughton noted .
Sometimes it may offer them another plan , she said .
Lynne Randolph , a spokeswoman for the state Department of Managed Health Care , said the agency would review the letter .
Blue Cross is fighting a $ 1 - million fine the department imposed in March over alleged systemic problems the agency identified in the way the company rescinds coverage .
A spokesman for state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner said the Insurance Department had not received any complaints about Blue Cross ’ letter .
But because the medical association had sent a copy of its complaint to the department , the letter is “ on our radar now , ” spokesman Byron Tucker said .
The letter is “ extremely troubling on several fronts , ” Tucker said .
“ It really obliterates the line between underwriting and medical care .
It is the insurer ’s job to underwrite their policies , not the doctors ’ .
Doctors deliver medical care .
Their job is not to underwrite policies for insurers . ”
Anthony Wright , executive director of HealthAccess California , a healthcare advocacy organization , said the letter had put physicians in the “ disturbing ” position of having to weigh their patients ’ interests against a directive from the company that , in many cases , pays most of their bills .
“ They are playing a game of ‘ gotcha ’ where they are trying to use their doctors against their patients ’ health interests , ” Wright said .
“ That ’s about as ugly as it gets . ”

Using new high resolution terrain mapping data obtained by the Deep Space Network , NASA has created some new animations that take viewers to the Moon ’s south pole .
The videos include a flyover of Shackleton Crater and a very nifty animation of descent to the lunar surface of a future human lunar lander .
“ I have not been to the Moon , but this imagery is the next best thing , ” said Scott Hensley , a scientist at JPL and lead investigator for obtaining the data .
“ With these data we can see terrain features as small as a house without even leaving the office . ”
Here ’s the descent and landing animation .
Make sure you watch to the very end , because the ending is the most impressive part , when you realize where you ’ve landed .
The rim of Shackleton Crater is considered a candidate landing site for a future human mission to the moon .
And there ’s more :
The mapping data collected indicate that the region of the Moon ’s south pole near Shackleton Crater is much more rugged than previously understood .
Hereâ€™s an animation of a flyover of the lunar south pole
Another animation shows the amount of sunlight falling on the Moon ’s south pole during one lunar day .
Notice that the interior of some craters remain almost completely dark — no sunshine ever strikes these areas — and some scientists feel there could possibly be water ice inside these craters .
To create these animations scientists targeted the Moon ’s south polar region three times during a six - month period in 2006 , using Goldstone ’s 70 - meter ( 230 - foot ) radar dish .
The antenna , three - quarters the size of a football field , sent a 500 - kilowatt - strong , 90 - minute - long radar stream 373,046 kilometers ( 231,800 miles ) to the moon .
The radar bounced off the rough - hewn lunar terrain over an area measuring about 644 kilometers by 402 kilometers ( 400 miles by 250 miles ) .
Signals were reflected back to two of Goldstone ’s 34 - meter ( 112 - foot ) antennas on Earth .
The roundtrip time , from the antenna to the Moon and back , was about two - and - a - half seconds .

Print This Email This Google is selling storage and data searching equipment to U.S. Intelligence agencies giving them the power to create internal searches of government data .
The CIA , FBI and National Security Agency have all reportedly banded together to create an internal government intranet  sharing data on a system called Intellipedia .
" Each analyst , for lack of a better term , has a shoe box with their knowledge , " Sean Dennehy , chief of Intellipedia development for the CIA , told the San Francisco Chronicle Sunday .
" They maintained it in a shared drive or a Word document , but we 're encouraging them to move those platforms so that everyone can benefit . "
There are three levels of information available to users :
Top secret , secret and sensitive but unclassified .
According to numbers provided by the CIA , 37,000 accounts have been established providing access to 200,000 pages of information .
Google supplies the software , hardware and tech support .
The software and browsing giant is also licensing its mapping data to government agencies .
" We are a very small group , and even a lot of people in the federal government do n't know that we exist , " said Mike Bradshaw , who leads Google 's federal government sales team and its 18 employees , yesterday to the Chronicle .
Federal agencies are not the only government groups lining up for the Googles know how .
The U.S. Coast Guard , The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration , National Highway Safety Administration and the states of Washington and Alabama have also signed up for similar Google systems .
Googles transactions with the intelligence community have raised privacy concerns .
Questioned by CNET earlier this year , both Google and Microsoft declined to say if they have provided their users private data to federal authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
In general email and Internet data are not subject to the same privacy rules that wire , telephone and radio transmissions are .
Google told CNET : " As our privacy policy states , we comply with law enforcement requests made with proper service .
We do not discuss specific law enforcement requests and generally do not share aggregate information about them .
There are also some legal restrictions on what information we can share about law enforcement requests . "
Rick Sutcliffe ESPN Baseball Analyst Has Cancer ( Photos )
, a baseball analyst for ESPN , has issued a statement indicating that he has been diagnosed with cancer .
The 6 ' 7 " former ball player is 51 year old .
He recently had a routine test for colon cancer during his yearly physical and the result was positive for the disease .
He will undergo chemotherapy and surgery over the next few months .
Sutcliffe has been with ESPN since March of 1999 ( white shirt in photo above ) and has been doing game telecasts for the past 5 years .
In a statement by ESPN VP Tim Scanlan ( blue shirt in photo above ) said in a statement :
" Rick is an integral member of our baseball team and we wish him a full recovery .
We will keep him and his family in our thoughts and prayers . "
Prior to joining ESPN , Sutcliffe played major league ball for 15 seasons , with the LA Dodgers , Cleveland Indians , Chicago Cubs , Baltimore Orioles and the St. Louis Cardinals .
He was the NL Rookie of the Year 1979 and made All Star status in 1983 , 1987 and 1989 .
He was the NL Cy Young Award winner in 1984 .
Most of the victims died in a blast that hit a federal police office
Attack scene
A majority of the victims died in a car bomb attack that hit a federal police building in the heart of the city .
Another bomb in a suburb killed three , including two children , police say .
Shortly after the blasts , the Australian cricket team announced the cancellation of their forthcoming tour of Pakistan over security fears .
The police said the first explosion hit the Federal Investigation Agency ( FIA ) at 0925 ( 0425 GMT ) in Lahore .
It demolished part of the building , where about 250 people work , just as employees were beginning their day .

The remainder of the building was evacuated as rescue workers struggled to remove the wounded from the debris .
The second , near - simultaneous blast hit an office in a residential district of Lahore several miles away , killing three people , including two children .
President Pervez Musharraf said : " Acts of terrorism cannot deter government 's resolve to fight the scourge with full force . "
Suicide attack probe
One witness who was inside the police building at the time of the blast described what he saw .
It felt like the aftershocks of an earthquake

Eyewitnesses : Lahore blasts
" There was a huge explosion and I fell down senseless , " said FIA employee Ali Ahmed .
" For a moment , I did n't know if I was dead or alive .
When I finally came to my senses , I was able to locate a window and crawl out . "
A man who works within walking distance of the building described the intensity of the explosion .
It " was so huge that nearby buildings were shattered and we witnessed huge clouds of smoke and dust rising to the sky " , Muhammad Raza told the BBC .
The bombs have deepened Pakistan 's security crisis
" It felt like the aftershocks of an earthquake . "
At least 12 of the dead were FIA officials , says the head of the FIA 's investigation wing , Tassaduq Hussain .
Many of the injured included children from nearby schools .
At the time of the bombing , military officials in the building were investigating a 4 March suicide attack at a nearby naval college , the head of the FIA in Lahore , Mian Manzoor , told the BBC .
Sustained campaign
The country has been hit by a wave of suicide bombings in the past year , most against security targets , says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad .
It is rare for groups to claim responsibility for the attacks , but they are usually blamed on pro-Taleban militants and on elements of now banned jihadist groups nurtured by the intelligence agencies .
They are believed to be in response to army and police operations against the militants .
Most take place in the north - west of the country near the Afghan border , but many of Pakistan 's major cities have also been hit .
Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed by a suicide bomber in Rawalpindi in December .
Until recently Lahore had escaped the violence , but there have been three attacks there now in the last two months .
Four people died in last week 's attack on the naval college .
And in January , 19 people were killed in a suicide bombing near the High Court .
More than 500 people have been killed in the country since the beginning of the year in a campaign of attacks and bombings blamed on Islamist militants .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Four U.S. soldiers were blown up in Baghdad , pushing the U.S. military death toll in Iraq to 4,000 just days into the sixth year of a war that President George W. Bush says the United States is on track to win .
The U.S. military said on Monday the soldiers were killed on Sunday when a roadside bomb , the biggest killer of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since the 2003 invasion , exploded near their vehicle in southern Baghdad .
One soldier was wounded .
On the same day dozens of Iraqis were killed in rocket and mortar attacks on the U.S. - protected “ Green Zone ” government and diplomatic compound in central Baghdad , and in other bombings in the capital and elsewhere .
The White House said President George W. Bush was saddened by the loss of 4,000 troops and would focus on ensuring the United States succeeds in the conflict .
“ It ’s a sober moment , and one that all of us can focus on , ” a White House spokeswoman said .
The United States lost 58,000 troops in over a decade of fighting in Vietnam until 1975 , and 54,000 in the three - year - long Korean war that began in 1950 .
The U.S. military played down the latest Iraqi toll .
“ No casualty is more or less significant than another ; each soldier , marine , airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic , ” a spokesman said .
Anthony Cordesman , a respected Iraq analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said the 4,000th death could trigger another wave of polarized debate .
“ Those who oppose the war will see it as further reason to end it .
Those who support it will point to military progress and say that future casualties will be much lower , ” he said .
Cordesman criticized the media for focusing on the death toll when the number of wounded was “ far , far higher and has more lasting impact as a human tragedy and in terms of costs ” .
Some 29,000 U.S. troops have been wounded in the war that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis , as well as 175 British troops and 134 from other U.S. allies .
Although Americans are more preoccupied with domestic economic troubles , the Iraq war is still an important issue in the presidential campaign , with Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama calling for a timetable for withdrawal .
Bush said in a speech marking the fifth anniversary of the war on March 19 that the United States was on track for victory and said withdrawing troops , who now number about 160,000 , would embolden al Qaeda and neighboring Iran .

“ I doubt the 4,000 milestone will have the impact that the 3,000 did .
The conventional wisdom then was that things were going badly , ” said Stephen Biddle , a senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington .
The 3,000th U.S. soldier was killed in December 2006 , when Sunni Arab insurgents were battling to oust the Baghdad government and before Bush unveiled a plan to send 30,000 more troops to Iraq to quell the violence .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
“ Today , by contrast , the public ’s general perception of Iraq is less negative , and coverage for the last six months has tended to focus on the reduction in violence and U.S. casualties , ” Biddle said .
But the weekend barrages on the Green Zone , which houses the U.S. embassy , and the continued attacks on U.S. troops may indicate that Iraqi militants are trying to change that .
“ Al Qaeda and extreme elements of the ( Mehdi Army ) have every incentive to find ways to raise the U.S. casualties between now and November and will be seeking ways to use bombings to raise the rate and number , ” Cordesman said .
Fighters from the Mehdi Army militia , which the U.S. military once called the greatest threat to peace in Iraq , ordered shops to close in some Baghdad districts on Monday in what they said was the start of a “ civil disobedience campaign ” .
Authorities in the southern province of Basra imposed a night - time curfew on Monday after clashes between police and Mehdi Army militia .
The militia has kept a low profile since Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr called a ceasefire last August and extended it last month , a move U.S. commanders say has helped to sharply reduce violence between majority Shi’ites and Sunni Muslims .
Now that Apple is making a profit , pundits need something else as the target of predictions of impending doom .
Some seem to have fastened onto computer science , prompting David Chisnall to wonder if the subject really is dying .

In the late 1990s , during the first dotcom bubble , there was a perception that a computer science degree was a quick way of making money .
The dotcom boom had venture capitalists throwing money at the craziest schemes , just because they happened to involve the Internet .
While not entirely grounded in fact , this trend led to a perception that anyone walking out of a university with a computer science degree would immediately find his pockets full of venture capital funding .
Then came the inevitable crash , and suddenly there were a lot more IT professionals than IT jobs .
Many of these people were the ones that just got into the industry to make a quick buck , but quite a few were competent people now unemployed .
This situation did n’t do much for the perception of computer science as an attractive degree scheme .
Since the end of the first dotcom bubble , we ’ve seen a gradual decline in the number of people applying to earn computer science degrees .
In the UK , many departments were able to prop up the decline in local applicants by attracting more overseas students , particularly from Southeast Asia , by dint of being considerably cheaper than American universities for those students wishing to study abroad .
This only slowed the drop , however , and some people are starting to ask whether computer science is dying .
Computer Science and Telescopes
Part of the problem is a lack of understanding of exactly what computer science is .
Even undergraduates accepted into computer science courses generally have only the broadest idea of what the subject entails .
It ’s hardly surprising , then , that people would wonder if the discipline is dying .
Even among those in computing - related fields , there ’s a general feeling that computer science is basically a vocational course , teaching programming .
In January 2007 , the British Computer Society ( BCS ) published an article by Neil McBride of De Montfort University , entitled " The Death of Computing . "
Although the content was of a lower quality than the average Slashdot troll post ( which at least tries to pretend that it ’s raising a valid point ) and convinced me that I did n’t want to be a member of the BCS , it was nevertheless circulated quite widely .
This article contained choice lines such as the following : " What has changed is the need to know low - level programming or any programming at all .
Who needs C when there ’s Ruby on Rails ? "
Who needs C ? Well , at least those people who want to understand something of what ’s going on when the Ruby on Rails program runs .
An assembly language or two would do equally well .
The point of an academic degree , as opposed to a vocational qualification , is to teach understanding , rather than skills — a point sadly lost on Dr. McBride when he penned his article .
In attempting to describe computer science , Edsger Dijkstra claimed , " Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes . "
I like this quote , but it ’s often taken in the wrong way by people who have n’t met many astronomers .
When I was younger , I was quite interested in astronomy , and spent a fair bit of time hanging around observatories and reading about the science ( as well as looking through telescopes ) .
During this period , I learned a lot more about optics than I ever did in physics courses at school .
I never built my own telescope , but a lot of real astronomers did , and many of the earliest members of the profession made considerable contributions to our understanding of optics .
There ’s a difference between a telescope builder and an astronomer , of course .
A telescope builder is likely to know more about the construction of telescopes and less about the motion of stellar bodies .
But both will have a solid understanding of what happens to light as it travels through the lenses and bounces off the mirrors .
Without this understanding , astronomy is very difficult .
The same principle holds true for computer science .
A computer scientist may not fabricate her own ICs , and may not write her own compiler and operating system .
In the modern age , these things are generally too complicated for a single person to do to a standard where the result can compete with off - the - shelf components .
But the computer scientist definitely will understand what ’s happening in the compiler , operating system , and CPU when a program is compiled and run .
A telescope is an important tool to an astronomer , and a computer is an important tool for a computer scientist — but each is merely a tool , not the focus of study .
For an astronomer , celestial bodies are studied using a telescope .
For a computer scientist , algorithms are studied using a computer .
Software and hardware are often regarded as being very separate concepts .
This is a convenient distinction , but it ’s not based on any form of reality .
The first computers had no software per se , and needed to be rewired to run different programs .
Modern hardware often ships with firmware — software that ’s closely tied to the hardware to perform special - purpose functions on general - purpose silicon .
Whether a task is handled in hardware or software is of little importance from a scientific perspective .
( From an engineering perspective , there are tradeoffs among cost , maintenance , and speed . )
Either way , the combination of hardware and software is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm , allowing it to be studied .
As with other subjects , there are a lot of specializations within computer science .
I tend to view the subject as the intersection between three fields :
Mathematics
Engineering
Psychology
At the very mathematical end are computer scientists who study algorithms without the aid of a computer , purely in the abstract .
Closer to engineering are those who build large hardware and software systems .
In between are the people who use formal verification tools to construct these systems .
A computer is n’t much use without a human instructing it , and this is where the psychology is important .
Computers need to interact with humans a lot , and neither group is really suited to the task .
The reason that computers have found such widespread use is that they perform well in areas where humans perform poorly ( and vice versa ) .
Trying to find a mechanism for describing something that is understandable by both humans and computers is the role of the " human / computer interaction " ( HCI ) subdiscipline within computer science .
This is generally close to psychology .
HCI is n’t the only part of computer science related to psychology .
As far back as 1950 , Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test as a method of determining whether an entity should be treated as intelligent .
It ’s understandable that people who are n’t directly exposed to computer science would miss the breadth of the discipline , associating it with something more familiar .
One solution proposed for this lack of vision is that of renaming the subject to " informatics . "
In principle , this is a good idea , but the drawback is that it ’s very difficult to describe someone as an " informatician " with a straight face .

Exterior Lighting Implementation Issues
Many homeowners believe that the exterior lighting is an insignificant nuance that finds itself comfortably at the bottom of the priority list , though such assertion is fundamentally wrong .
Light system preparation is a very complicated process that requires a special approach in the early stages of construction works .
In order to create the right outdoor lighting at home , the experts compose a draft of underground wiring and aerial lines and , of course , determine the number of light sources and their role .

This demonstration will make more sense using a color - managed Web browsers like SAFARI 6 for Mac OS - X , newer versions of Firefox for Windows 8 7 Vista XP and OSX will also work , including Microsoft Internet Explorer IE 9 IE10 , but Safari is my favorite color - managed teaching browser because it seems to work for everyone with no special configuration or settings .
If untagged sRGB is not displaying correctly here , this tutorial will help you understand why and how to troubleshoot color on the Internet  by explaining the basic color theories in simple lay terms .
Most people will be able to compare the top , most popular color spaces side - by - side and clearly see the untagged sRGB displays most closely to the ' True Color ' ( in the left box ) .
Above , all three un - tagged files are in one box to evaluate them together .
( These are the same exact files as in the left box except these files have NO embedded ICC profile ) .
The above un - tagged files will look very differently in all Web browsers  this is BECAUSE your browser is ( in essence ) applying * the same default profile to each of the three untagged files .
Your Web browser is most likely sending the RGB ' numbers ' straight to the monitor unchanged .
In a NON - MANAGED browser , all three above tagged files ( normal / over / click ) will display very differently  exactly the same as in the right box  because the UN - MANAGED BROWSER is ignoring the profiles and ( wrongly ) applying * the same default profile to all six pics in both sets .
Above , all three tagged files are in one box to evaluate them together .
( These are the same exact files as in the right box except these files have embedded ICC profiles , and the other files do not have profiles attached ) .
If the above three rollovers look virtually identical , your Web browser is color managed  this is happening BECAUSE your color - managed browser is reading each file 's embedded profile and Converting or Mapping the colors to your monitor profile for a theoretical display of ' True Color . '
If the above three rollovers shift color - brightness - gamma , your Web browser is NOT color managed .
While my " Apply - Assume - Assign " terminology has the same end effect  a more accurate theory for this phenomenon is the unmanaged application , HTML and System colors are simply being " passed through " to the display unaltered .
For more detailed information , please review my white paper on BASIC COLOR MANAGEMENT THEORY for my terminology and meaning , and my ASSIGN - CONVERT TUTORIAL for the nuts & bolts of this phenomenon .
PLEASE stop and think about this if you do n't quite understand it yet ... it is the critical first step in understanding how color spaces and ICC profiles interact with digital imaging systems .
ALL WEB BROWSERS and applications will display the above Untagged set very differently because unmanaged browsers are assigning / assuming / applying * the same default profile to all three above Untagged photos .
They are most likely sending the RGB ' numbers ' straight to the monitor unchanged .
UNMANAGED BROWSERS and apps will display all three above Tagged photos very differently , and each Tagged - Untagged pair the same because they are assigning / assuming / applying * the same default profile to all six above test images .
They are most likely sending the RGB ' numbers ' straight to the monitor unchanged .
Software updates and user settings may change how my reference images display so be sure to perform your own tests to prove or disprove my theories on your devices .
WINDOWS " HALF " COLOR MANAGEMENT DISCLAIMER ( Source > sRGB ) :
Take notice some Windows color - managed Web browsers ( and applications ) only Convert tagged elements to sRGB ( not the monitor profile ) .
My tests ( late 2012 ) included so - called " color - managed " Windows versions of Chrome , Safari , Internet Explorer IE , which all displayed the PDI tagged reference images with oversaturated reds on a wide gamut monitor .
Firefox with its Value1 enabled was the only Windows browser that displayed with " Full Color Management " ( Source > Monitor ) .
FULLY COLOR - MANAGED BROWSERS ( Source > Monitor RGB ) and applications HONOR ( read ) the embedded ICC profiles and display all three above Tagged photos the same  they correct the source colors to the computer 's monitor profile for a theoretical ' True Color ' display .
Professional color - managment article by Gary G. Ballard , San Diego , CA - Firefox ® and Mozilla® are registered trademarks of Mozilla Foundation , Safari® is registered a trademark of Apple Computers , Inc .
This is n't hype  it 's easily proven in my : BEST FIREFOX COLOR TEST PAGE TUTORIAL ( includes simple directions and screenshots how to set up about : config " Full Color Management " Value 1 .
In essence , Firefox 's " Full Color Management " standard gives us a free real - world , high - performance professional color - managed viewing environment on our desktops that is every bit as equal to Adobe® Photoshop 's monitor proofing capabilities in this example , IMHO .
Just drag your image icon into an open Firefox window to use Firefox as a color - managed picture viewer  untagged sRGB and tagged RGB images should all display correctly .
What this Firefox standard means for color - critical webmasters ( like me ) is , I do not even have to embed profiles on the Internet BECAUSE Firefox will Assign the sRGB profile correctly to my un-tagged and un-managed color by Default , and Convert it to my monitor profile for both accuracy and consistency even on so - called wide - gamut Adobe RGB monitors .
I do not believe any other top
Web browser does that 
Defaults to sRGB AND Converts to Monitor RGB  but it certainly makes the best logic given Windows ® and Mac OS - X® ( 10.7 10.8 ) operating systems and the Internet are all based on the sRGB color standard , and probably more than 99 % of the Internet does not use embedded ICC profiles , and most Web surfers are using sRGB - compliant display monitors .
What Firefox does best is  besides reading embedded profiles and converting them to my monitor profile ( like OS - X Safari and Photoshop do ) 
Firefox goes two very intelligent steps further : 1 ) Firefox " Assigns " ( Assumes ) sRGB to untagged elements ( including HTML CSS Hex colors ) , and 2 ) Firefox then Converts them ( along with my tagged images ) to my monitor profile for a theoretical " True Color " display .
As a steadfast student of color management theory , I do not think embedding ICC profiles in Web images will be the norm anytime in the near future  moreover 
I think Mozilla Firefox FF 11 ( since FF3.6 ) " Full Color Management " ( Value 1 ) gets the theory exactly correct on the World Wide Web today without even using embedded profiles .
If you are troubleshooting why color shifts , changes or looks bad on the Web , be sure to first Convert your color to sRGB before uploading 
I generally recommend un- tagging ( stripping the profiles from ) photos and graphics on the Internet , but please check out that link for more information about how , where , when to embed or strip ICC profiles  it may be worth your time now to find and install a color - managed browser and study this color evaluation tutorial until my basic points are fully understood .
Hopefully this tutorial helps you quickly answer the question : Is my Web browser color managed ?
My color image examples have been professional setup to effectively demonstrate and troubleshoot color differences between the world 's top Web browsers like Internet Explorer IE , Safari , Firefox FF , Chrome , Opera , OmniWeb , Camino , including popular operating systems like Mac OS -X , Lion 10.7 , Snow Leopard 10.6 , 10.5 , 10.4 , Windows 8 7 , Windows Vista and XP .

It ’s hard to believe a hearing on sex could be so dull .
This morning , the vaunted Henry Waxman convened a marathon hearing before his House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to “ assess ” the evidence on abstinence - only sex education , on which the federal government has spent more than $ 1.3 billion in recent years .
The program requires states that take the money to refrain from teaching about contraception in school unless it ’s to talk about scary STDs and condom failure rates , while encouraging young people to avoid sex until marriage , an expectation that 95 percent of Americans fail to meet .
As oversight hearings go , this one turned out to be a snoozer , in large part because there ’s not much news here .
About a bazillion studies have all found that not only does abstinence - only education not work to reduce unwed pregnancy or STDs , but that it perpetuates false information about the reliability of the things that do work , disparages gays and lesbians , promotes religion in public schools , and demeans women .
The federal program has produced one major success : giving life to a bunch of loony fringe religious groups that would n’t exist but for those federal funds .
Many of these groups got their start as “ crisis pregnancy centers ” that used dubious tactics to dissuade young women from having abortions .
But their views were largely left off the panel , a fact that irked Republicans who accused Waxman of stacking the hearing solely with critics .
Indiana Rep. Mark Souder complained that Waxman had failed to invite such witnesses as the doctors who treat girls infected with STDs “ while using condoms . ”
He fumed about liberals who are promoting a “ radical sexual economy ” as part of their attack on abstinence programs , and suggested that teaching kids about birth control and condoms was part of that depraved agenda .
Despite a heavy line of up of public health officials on the schedule , Waxman kicked off the “ oversight ” hearing with testimony from two of his own colleagues , Rep. Lois Capps , a former school nurse from California who once taught sex ed , and Sen.
Sam Brownback , whose only credentials on the issue seemed to be his parenting of five children .
( Waxman even swore them in . )
Nonetheless , a surprising number of members showed up to pelt questions at the pair , including our own DC Del .
Eleanor Holmes Norton , who wasted most of her time talking about how nice it was to work with Brownback on some previous marriage issues .
( True to form , though , she also razzed Brownback for failing to vote for D.C. statehood . )
Souter managed to make Brownback look like a moderate after asking if it would be appropriate to ask 9 - year - olds whether such things as masturbation , oral sex and naked cuddling qualified as abstinence , which he claimed was common in traditional sex ed classes .
Of course , Capps and Brownback said no .
Despite attempts by Democrats to get Brownback to concede that federal dollars might be better spent , it was clear that Brownback and the other Republicans in the room were n’t going to be swayed by anything resembling science , or even their traditional opposition to federal spending .
They stayed on message , which seemed to be that abstinence - only funding ought to continue because regular sex ed does n’t work either .
“ The parents of this country want their children to be abstinent , ” Brownback insisted .
I confess to hearing the call of the “ asparagus festival ” going on in the Rayburn building cafeteria and leaving before the meatier part of the hearing began , as it took more than an hour and a half just to finish up with Brownback .
The administration witness was n’t slated to go on until the very end , which was hours away .
But it was clear from the get - go that the hearing would change few minds and produce few new pieces of information .
( A webcast of the hearing is available here . )
Democrats do n’t seem ready or able to put an end to the boondoggle on this one , despite the consensus that it is , in fact , an ideologically driven waste of money .
Instead , they have introduced legislation in both the House and Senate to provide federal funding for comprehensive sex-ed that would actually give kids something besides a virginity pledge to help them avoid early pregnancy and pernicious diseases .

Which cities have a surplus of single men ( or women ) - and what that means for the country
By Richard Florida
Which of these two decisions do you think has a bigger impact on someone 's life : finding the right job , or finding the right significant other ?
No one 's going to argue with the notion that where you live affects your employment prospects .
But the place you call home has a lot to do with your chances of finding the right partner as well .
Having an enticing " mating market " matters as much or more than a vibrant labor market .
It 's not just that some places have more singles than others .
If you 're a single man or a single woman the odds of meeting that special someone vary dramatically across the country .
By far , the best places for single men are the large cities and metro areas of the East Coast and Midwest .
The extreme is greater New York , where single women outnumber single men by more than 210,000 .
In the Philadelphia area and greater Washington , D.C. , single women outnumber single men by 50,000 .
I met my wife outside Detroit , where the odds were greatly stacked in my favor - single women outnumber single men by some 20,000 there .
In fact , single women outnumber single men in many large cities around the world , even though men outearn women at all ages , according to Lena C. Edlund , a Columbia University economist .
One reason young women in the prime marriage years - the 25 - 44 age range - flock to big cities is to compete for the most eligible men .
And smart women who gravitate to vibrant cities are more likely to stay single - for longer , at least - because they rightly refuse to settle for someone who can't keep up with them intellectually or otherwise .
But women do have an advantage in the American West and Southwest .
In greater Los Angeles , for example , there are 90,000 more single men than women .
In Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay Area , single men outnumber single women by roughly 65,000 .
There are considerably more single men than women in San Diego , Dallas , and Seattle , too .
Each of these regions has grown substantially over the past two or three decades , offering jobs in everything from high tech to construction and services .
As numerous studies of migration show , men - especially those in regions with declining economies - are initially more likely to move long distances for economic opportunity , while women are more likely to stay closer to home and family .
Being in a place where the gender odds are stacked against you can be very frustrating .
" When I was in Chicago , it was never long between dates " says one single male .
" When I 'm hanging out with friends [ in the San Francisco Bay Area ] , often times in a large room with few if any women , we routinely turn to the topic of how the dating scene sucks . "
Greater Boston is unusual among large metro areas .
It is one of the very few with a near perfect balance of singles - having just 1,600 or so more women than men - 604,960 men to 606,580 women .
And this may be part of the reason why the region ranks third for young singles on a ranking of more than 150 metro regions my team and I compiled .
The entire region surrounding Boston and its immediate suburbs does well , too .
Worcester ; Portland , Maine ; and Portsmouth - Manchester , N.H. , also score among the top five for singles among small - medium - sized regions nationwide .
This high ranking is good news , because singles attract other singles .
Numerous studies have found that young people pick where they want to live first and then search for a job in those places .
When Forbes magazine asked young singles of both genders what matters most in the places they live , more said " number of other singles " than said " great career prospects " ; things like " wild nightlife " and " low cost of living " came in much farther behind .
The ability to attract young singles also bodes well for regional economies .
Singles are a large and growing segment of the population and the workforce .
With many postponing marriage until their late 20s and 30s , and with a significant share of marriages ending in divorce , singles now make up more than half of all American households , compared with just 20 percent or so in the 1960s and 1970s .
In our highly mobile society - where 40 million Americans move every year and 15 million of us make significant moves to a new county , a different state , or a different country - younger singles are the most mobile group of all .
People in their 20s are twice as likely to move as 30 - to - 34 and 3.5 times more likely than 45 - 54 .
The end result of these millions upon millions of location decisions is likely to be a widening economic and cultural divide between the relatively small number of fortunate regions that attract singles who can choose where they want to live , and the larger number whose populations are older , less - skilled , more rooted , or even stuck .

Around that time , Senator McCain called me .
No , Mr. Crowley , he did not ask that the story be suppressed .
He did express concern that all of our digging might give rise to rumors , and he asked that we not let it drag on .
I used the opportunity to ask him about the suspicion of some of his staffers that he had a romantic or sexual relationship with Ms. Iseman .
He said he did not .
Yes , Mr. Cleary , we were aware that a reporter for The New Republic was working on some kind of " back story " about our work on this story .
No , it did not affect the timing of publication .
The latest draft of the story landed on my desk  or , more precisely , in my e-mail  Tuesday afternoon .
I thought it was excellent ( for the record , I still think so ) and we scheduled it for the Thursday paper .
David Kirkpatrick , one of the reporters who worked on the story , has filed these additional thoughts :
As far as the timing , do n’t attach too much significance to the Drudge posting .
We heard a second - hand report from a lobbyist about Senator McCain and Vicki Iseman more than a year ago .
Early last year we began making careful , quiet inquiries into the matter .
Last fall , we learned more about some of the conversations around the campaign concerning Ms. Iseman , and we kept reporting .
It is impossible for us to know who told what to Matt Drudge in December or why .
These days , journalists have to live with the possibility that a subject of their reporting or a source for their reporting might try to spread selective information over the Internet .
It could be strategic  an attempt to game journalists into publishing prematurely , or to influence their reporting , or to start counteracting the news in advance .
Who knows ?
In this case , it is worth remembering that what appeared on the Drudge Report did not accurately describe what we were working on , the identities of the reporters involved , their views of the story or their editors ’ views of the story .
So , again , who knows ?
Please trust me that none of the journalists involved in this article was dragging his or her feet .
To be honest , we wanted this to get over with .
We worked hard to prepare as fair , complete and accurate a report as possible , and to do it as soon as we could .
We tried to contact as many knowledgeable people as possible .
We gave Senator McCain , his advisers and Ms. Iseman plenty of time and opportunity to respond .
We wrestled with some pretty tricky issues about how to handle what we learned .
And we put it in the paper as soon as we could but no sooner .
Mr. Meyerhofer , thanks for the vote of confidence .
You are in a minority in defending this story , but here in the foxhole we welcome your company .
Would this story have broken somewhere else if we had not broken it ?
That 's hard to say , but my guess is that some variation of it would have emerged .
The Washington Post , which filed its own version this week after ours went up on our Web site , was clearly doing some similar reporting .
Apparently The New Republic was considering writing an account of our work on the senator and the lobbyist even if we never published the result , so the story might have emerged there , in the guise of a media story .
Who knows ?
 Bill Keller
What Was McCain 's Response ?
Q . As the story was being prepared , but before it appeared , did The Times offer Senator McCain or his staff an opportunity to comment ?
If so , what was the response ?
 Alan Bliss , Jacksonville Beach , Fla .
A . The reporting team had various conversations and e-mail exchanges with Senator McCain ’s representatives throughout the process .
The campaign denied several requests for interviews with the senator .
As the story noted , Mr. McCain contacted the newspaper once , calling Mr. Keller to complain about the reporters ’ inquiries , in December .
The first extensive interview between Mr. McCain ’s representatives and the reporting team took place at the lobbying offices of Charles Black , a senior adviser to Mr. McCain , on Dec. 14 .
In that session , the New York Times reporters requested various documentation , including phone records , office schedules and airplane manifests dating to the 1990s .
The reporters followed up with several questions about Ms. Iseman ’s lobbying efforts before the senator and his committee .
Mr. McCain ’s aides agreed to provide as much of the requested information as possible , but noted that this would take some time ( they ultimately said they could not locate some of the documentation ) .
Three of the reporters also met with Mr. McCain ’s attorney , Robert S. Bennett , at his offices later in December .
The exchange of questions and answers continued off and on until Wednesday , when the newspaper submitted another request for an interview with Senator McCain .
That request was denied .
And , through Mr. Black , Mr. McCain declined to comment on former associates ’ accounts of meetings in which he was confronted with their concerns about his ties to Ms. Iseman .
The Times also made repeated efforts to seek Ms. Iseman 's comments and responses to questions .
Beginning in December , she answered some questions by e-mail , though she declined to speak to reporters on the phone .
She again declined a phone interview the day of publication .
One of central agile programming ideas is to deliver frequently and get feedback early .
To get the full benefits of this approach , it is not enough just to make sure that we deliver often and seek feedback — it is extremely important to plan our deliveries correctly as well .
If the deliverables are not complete in the sense that they can really be used in production , then the feedback is not as relevant as we would like it to be .
Here is a situation I have seen a few times more than I would have wanted : the team and the clients split the whole project into several phases that will be shipped every few weeks ; early deliverables mostly provide the plumbing for the later ones , and have only enough user - interfacing functions for the plumbing to be tested functionally .
The clients set up and play with each new release .
They dutifully give their feedback and participate in testing each time .
When the whole thing comes together on the end , it turns out that the system still requires a lot of changes to solve the problem that it was intended for — the iterations and customer feedback failed to provide the directions .
The problem hides in way that the project was split : early deliverables mostly provide the plumbing for the later ones and the whole thing comes together on the end .
So , until very close to the end of the project , the deliverables could not really be used in production .
Unless the software is really being used , we cannot expect authoritative feedback .
The customers may be able to give us their general gut - feel and comment on functional correctness , but usability and feasibility can only be measured once the software is really actually used by people in the course of their daily business .
Technical integration issues as well as usability ( human- integration ) issues are expected and typically not problematic to solve , but we must not let them pile up .
Early feedback should allow us to solve some of those problems during the whole project , instead of finding them out on the end .
One more reason why deliverables should be used in production is that the customer ’s business will rarely stand still during the course of the project , making the end result effectively a moving target .
If the deliveries are not really used until the end of the project , then we have no idea whether they are in touch with the present business requirements .
On the other hand , if the deliverables are used every day , we will know that straight away – and most likely the clients will ask for adjustments early .
So how do we avoid this problem ?
Here are three ideas to avoid the problem :
Focus on user stories , not on technical use cases
Plan deliveries so that they are complete in the sense that they can really be used in production
Divide and conquer : Split a big project into several mini-projects , and then focus on delivering those in a sequence
Focus on user stories
User stories have emerged over the last several years as the preferred way of planning scope for agile projects .
Focusing on user stories is a great way to split the project into parts that actually bring value to the customer , since every user story should have a clearly defined customer benefit .
So planning deliverables in terms of user stories instead of technical use cases is a great first step .
A pitfall that we must avoid is to then batch stories based purely on technical dependencies .
Although it makes perfect sense to have early deliverables provide the technical infrastructure for latter ones , and that type of dependency must be taken into consideration when planning deliverables , ordering purely based on that leads to the exact problem that we are trying to avoid .
This is effectively incremental , not iterative development .
Have production - worthy deliveries
Instead of focusing on technical order , it is better to try plan deliveries so that every shipped version of the software can really be used in production .
Although it is not always possible to adhere perfectly to this idea , it is a good general rule and we should try to keep the deliveries complete in that sense .
While working on the delivery plan , just ask the clients this simple question : “ pretend it ’s magic and in a few months we give you these stories — would that piece of software be complete in the sense that it can actually be used in production ? ” .
If the answer is no , go back to the drawing board .
Doing production - worthy deliveries several times during the project might require writing some throw - away code , but that is a small price to pay for early feedback ( to programmers ) and getting business benefits early ( to customers ) .
For example , several years ago I worked on a trading system that was supposed to replace excel - based trading and distribution management .
One of the major problems that we were supposed to solve was optimising transport routes and providing transport plans to local centres .
So our first delivery was a piece of software that allowed traders to input their trading plans ( from the excel sheets ) , produced an optimised transport plan , and allowed them to export it back to excel .
The first and third part of that delivery were thrown away later , but we got good feedback on a fairly complex part of the system and solved tons of edge cases that were not identified during initial planning .
Traders were happy because this saved them a few hours of work every day , and they got that several months before the whole system was in place .
Break a big project into mini-projects
Reg Braithwaite wrote that his Golden Hammer for building software iteratively is to divide it into separate products .
This makes excellent sense for building larger systems where the software will perform a lot of functions for a lot of people on the end .
By dividing one single large product into smaller products we force ourselves to have cleaner interfaces and looser coupling between software components .
This can allow us to develop them independently , and will also reduce the risk of the whole thing missing the target on the end .
Each of those mini-products would be a deliverable , and it should be usable on its own .
I recently worked on a highly scalable e-commerce web site .
We split the project into three separate products : an e-commerce integration platform , high - performance caching system and the actual of web site .
The integration platform was delivered first , with a low - fi card processing web that was used for some 3rd party integration .
It went live a year before the rest of the system , helping us flush out any problems with transaction processing .
We had new requirements about this part of the system every few months , driven by the fact that people were actually using it .
So when the project was close to the end , this integration platform was in touch with reality .
The caching system went live next , and it was used to support a mobile content distribution application .
Both the low - fi card processing site and the mobile app were not part of the initial plan , but we were able to slot them in nicely .
The web site front end then built upon the foundations of those two systems that were in production for months .
Thinking about the whole project in terms of separate products both helped us deliver it quicker ( because we had real production feedback for parts of the system early on ) and also increased the value of what we were doing ( since the same components were used to support different applications and smaller projects that started after that big one ) .
Divide and conquer approach paid off big .
Deliveries and iterations
I know that some of you , reading this , will now start to complain how iterations should be two to four weeks long and that the business problems are often larger than what can be solved in such a short period of time .
I intentionally avoided using the word “ iteration ” in this discussion , because I do not think that every iteration needs to be delivered .
If an iteration result is not complete in the sense that it can really be used every day , then the iteration delivery will just sleep on the UAT servers after testers play with it for a while .
To get quick feedback on such iterations , I propose giving clients access to the local integration environment and letting them play with the software there .
You can avoid packaging and polishing and they do not have to update their local installations .
If an iteration produces software that can really be used every day , then ship it and make the clients use it .
It is definitely useful to get feedback early , but having something go live , even if it causes rework or throwing away parts of software later , is much much more valuable than software that is only tested .
It has more value for the customer , since they are getting a part of their problem solved earlier .
It also has more value for the development of the whole project , since it brings real , authoritative feedback from everyday use .

" We are neither a terrorist organization nor a political group , our aim is not to intimidate the society or manipulate it , which is something we witness on daily basis both in real world and in the world created by the media .
" Whether the reasons are political interests , market interests , financial interests or interests of supranational companies – we meet hidden manipulation and attempt to invade the subconscious mind of citizens with specific products or ideology , using all available means .
We do not think that a subtle distortion of such system or an appeal to pure common sense of people and their ability to remain unaffected are harmful , not even in a democratic society .
That is why , several years ago , the art group “ Ztohoven ” penetrated the public sphere of Prague , questioned the space given to advertisement generally and the space given to specific adverts .
On the 17th of June 2007 this group attacked the space of TV broadcasting .
It distorted it , questioned its truthfulness and its credibility .
It drew attention to the possibility of using images of the world created by the media in place of the existing , real world .
Is everything we see daily on our TV screens real ?
Is everything presented to us by the media , newspapers , television , Internet actually real ?
This is the concept our project would like to introduce and remind of .
We believe that even the free space of public service broadcaster is able to endure such action and such impeachment .
We hope our action will become an appeal for the future and remind the media of their duty to bring out the truth .
" Thank you for independent media and free space for our society . "

While the prank itself took place this past June , the video of a super - imposed atomic blast on a Czech Republic public television morning weather report by prank - art group ZTOHOVEN only recently took off , and is now as popular in Europe as the recent Tom Cruise Scientology video is in the US .
Attention to the ZTOHOVEN prank — as well as the group 's awe - inspiring video — has been steadily gaining momentum , to the point it is now getting international play in traditional major media media outlets such as BBC News and International Herald Tribune .
And today 's coverage in the New York Times obviously breaks even more new ground for ZTOHOVEN / teh lulz .
The group 's members now face criminal charges even after Prague 's National Gallery awarded the group the new NG 333 prize for young artists — 333,000 koruna , the equivalent of $ 18,350 .
What seems to most be capturing everyone 's attention is that provocateur 's pulled off such a silly prank without an entire nation losing their minds .
First most on everyone 's minds ?
This question : " What if this had taken place in the States ? "
In other words , there are some places in the world where people are NOT taking themselves so seriously .
In fact , if there is a point to made here , it 's that there are some places where well - thought out fun equals $ $$ and LULZ .
Here 's the group 's artistic statement :
The group still faces criminal charges in the Czech Republic , but as the anything heavier than a light fine seems unlikely .
“ It ’s not that we would not have supported this kind of art , if they had come to us , ” Ladislav Sticha , the spokesman for Czech Public Television went on the record as saying .
Former AT&T worker details federal Internet spying in S.F .
His first inkling that something was amiss came in summer 2002 when he opened the door to admit a visitor from the National Security Agency to an office of AT&T in San Francisco .
" What the heck is the NSA doing here ? "
Mark Klein , a former AT&T technician , said he asked himself .
A year or so later , he stumbled upon documents that , he said , nearly caused him to fall out of his chair .
The documents , he said , show that the NSA gained access to huge amounts of e-mail , Web search and other Internet records of more than a dozen global and regional telecom providers .
AT&T allowed the agency to hook into its network at a facility in San Francisco and , according to Klein , many of the other telecom companies probably knew nothing about it .
Klein is in Washington this week to share his story in the hope that it will persuade lawmakers not to grant legal immunity to telecommunications firms that helped the government in its anti-terrorism efforts .
Klein , 62 , said he may be the only person in the country in a position to discuss firsthand knowledge of an important aspect of the Bush administration 's domestic surveillance .
He is retired , so he is n't worried about losing his job .
He carried no security clearance , and the documents in his possession were not classified , he said .
He has no qualms about " turning in , " as he put it , the company where he worked for 22 years , until he retired in 2004 .
" If they 've done something massively illegal and unconstitutional - well , they should suffer the consequences , " Klein said .
" It 's not my place to feel bad for them .
They made their bed .
They have to lie in it .
The ones who did ( anything wrong ) , you can be sure , are high up in the company .
Not the average Joes , who I enjoyed working with . "
In an interview Tuesday , he said the NSA set up a system that vacuumed up Internet and phone - call data from ordinary Americans with the cooperation of AT&T .
Contrary to the government 's depiction of its surveillance program as aimed at overseas terrorists , Klein said , much of the data sent through AT&T to the NSA was purely domestic .
Klein said he believes the NSA was analyzing the records for usage patterns as well as for content .
He said the NSA built a special room to receive data streamed through an AT&T Internet room containing " peering links , " or major connections to other telecom providers .
The largest of the links delivered 2.5 gigabits of data - the equivalent of one - quarter of the Encyclopedia Britannica 's text - per second , said Klein , whose documents and eyewitness account form the basis of one of the first lawsuits filed against the telecom giants after the government 's warrantless - surveillance program was reported in the New York Times in December 2005 .
Claudia Jones , an AT&T spokeswoman , said she had no comment on Klein 's allegations .
The NSA and the White House declined to comment on Klein 's allegations .
Klein is urging Congress not to block Hepting vs. AT&T , a class - action suit pending in federal court in San Francisco , as well as 37 other lawsuits charging carriers with illegally collaborating with the NSA program .
He was accompanied Tuesday by lawyers for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which filed Hepting vs. AT&T in 2006 .
Together , they are urging key senators to oppose a pending White House - endorsed immunity provision that would effectively wipe out the lawsuits .
The Judiciary Committee is expected to take up the measure Thursday .
In summer 2002 , Klein was working in a Geary Street office responsible for Internet equipment when an NSA representative arrived to interview a management - level technician for a special job whose details were secret .
" That 's when my antennas started to go up , " he said .
He knew that the NSA was supposed to work on overseas signals intelligence .
The job entailed building a " secret room " in another AT&T office 10 blocks away on Folsom Street , he said .
By coincidence , in October 2003 , Klein was transferred to that office and assigned to the Internet room .
He asked a technician there about the secret room on the 6th floor , and the technician told him it was connected to the Internet room a floor above .
The technician , who was about to retire , handed him some wiring diagrams .
" That was my ' aha ' moment , " Klein said .
" They 're sending the entire Internet to the secret room . "
The diagram showed splitters , glass prisms that split signals from each network into two identical copies .
One copy fed into the secret room .
The other proceeded to its destination , he said .
" This splitter was sweeping up everything , vacuum - cleaner - style , " he said .
" The NSA is getting everything .
These are major pipes that carry not just AT&T's customers but everybody 's . "
Klein said he decided to go public after President Bush defended the NSA 's surveillance program as limited to collecting phone calls between suspected terrorists overseas and people in the United States .
Klein said the documents show that the scope was much broader .
FEMA press secretary , found responsible for fake press conference , will resign John Byrne
Published : Friday November 9 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Federal Emergency Management Agency Press Secretary Aaron Walker will resign effective Dec. 7 after being found responsible for having FEMA staff pose as reporters at a news conference surrounding the California wildfires .
The internal investigation , completed Monday , found that Walker asked aides to post as reporters , coached them clandestinely during the briefing and ended the questioning after a scripted question was asked .
The inquiry " could not corroborate accounts that the agency 's No. 2 official , Harvey E. Johnson Jr. , was told before he led the Oct. 23 briefing that FEMA staff members would pose questions , " according to the Washington Post , which reported the results of the investigation Friday .
It did not explain the event 's rushed timing either .
With reporters who called in on phone lines barred from asking questions , and the news conference scheduled just 15 minutes after it was announced , questions remain as to whether officials were being candid when they alleged that the event was staged because they had a hard time rounding up reporters .
FEMA 's number two official , Johnson , was then broadcast live on cable news channels , the Post said .
Despite not answering questions of why the event was scheduled so hastily , the review " found nothing that indicated malicious or preconceived intent to deceive the media or the public , " according to Russ Knocke , FEMA 's acting director of external affairs , the lead investigator , who spoke to the Post Wednesday .
" As an aside , the content of the press event was accurate .
It is obvious that there was a significant lack of leadership within FEMA external affairs . "
John " Pat " Philbin , the Director of Public Affairs also responsible for FEMA 's faked news conference , was set to accept a for the top PR job in the Department of National Intelligence soon after the event but lost the plum post after the scandal .
" We do not normally comment on personnel matters , " DNI spokesman Ross Feinstein told the Associated Press at the time .
" However , we can confirm that Mr. Philbin is not , nor is he scheduled to be , the director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence . "
A press release described Philbin 's new job as director of public affairs in the DNI 's office as an " amazing opportunity to head the communications shop . "
The release was sent to reporters before Philbin was kicked to the curb .

Do n't get me wrong , I like Apple .
Despite the fact that they FUCKING OVERCHARGE for all of their products , they do put out damn fine products .
In fact , I 'm typing this from my wife 's iMac , which was a mind - blowing $ 1400 even though we got it refurbished ... and it's the best desktop I 've had in a long time .
OSX has replaced Ubuntu as my OS - of - choice , and I 've rediscovered the wonders of iTunes ...
Well , you 're probably wondering what I 'm about to bitch about .
I got a $ 10 iTunes gift card for Christmas .
Now , since I generally get my music , movies , and everything else through other means ... you fill in the blanks ...
I have n't bought anything off of the iTunes music store since a copy of Sandstorm I got a few years back .
I figured I 'd go on and get the " Top 10 " episodes of South Park .
So , I redeem my card , go in and click buy now , agree to the new terms of use ... and then I get an error .
I did n't write down the error code , because I figured I 'd just repurchase the item since it did n't look like it deducted from my account .
Oh , how I was wrong .
Next thing I know , I can't repurchase the item , $ 9.90 has been deducted from my balance , and I do n't have any proof at all that I so much as looked at the page , much less actually bought the item .
No pending download , no purchase record , no nothing .
Fuck Apple .
I realize it 's stupid to get pissed about $ 9.90 , but Apple has a reputation of screwing the .001 % of their customers who have legitimate problems .
It 's a longstanding tradition that goes back to before The Steve was reincarnated as iCEO .
I shot support an email and all , did all the stupid mundane troubleshooting steps that they requested , but I 'm not going to get my money back , or get the download .
I have no proof that I purchased anything except for a $ .10 balance on my account .
Apple does n't give customers the benefit of the doubt .
It seems like the only time that happens is when I 'm at work and I 'm the one giving benefit , because I DON'T FUCK CUSTOMERS OVER .
God damn it , Apple .
Transcript : President Clinton explains Iraq strike CLINTON : Good evening .
Earlier today , I ordered America 's armed forces to strike military and security targets in Iraq .
They are joined by British forces .
Their mission is to attack Iraq 's nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors .
Their purpose is to protect the national interest of the United States , and indeed the interests of people throughout the Middle East and around the world .
Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms , poison gas or biological weapons .
I want to explain why I have decided , with the unanimous recommendation of my national security team , to use force in Iraq ; why we have acted now ; and what we aim to accomplish .
Six weeks ago , Saddam Hussein announced that he would no longer cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors called UNSCOM .
They are highly professional experts from dozens of countries .
Their job is to oversee the elimination of Iraq 's capability to retain , create and use weapons of mass destruction , and to verify that Iraq does not attempt to rebuild that capability .
The inspectors undertook this mission first 7.5 years ago at the end of the Gulf War when Iraq agreed to declare and destroy its arsenal as a condition of the ceasefire .
The international community had good reason to set this requirement .
Other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles .
With Saddam , there is one big difference :
He has used them .
Not once , but repeatedly .
Unleashing chemical weapons against Iranian troops during a decade - long war .
Not only against soldiers , but against civilians , firing Scud missiles at the citizens of Israel , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and Iran .
And not only against a foreign enemy , but even against his own people , gassing Kurdish civilians in Northern Iraq .
The international community had little doubt then , and I have no doubt today , that left unchecked , Saddam Hussein will use these terrible weapons again .
The United States has patiently worked to preserve UNSCOM as Iraq has sought to avoid its obligation to cooperate with the inspectors .
On occasion , we 've had to threaten military force , and Saddam has backed down .
Faced with Saddam 's latest act of defiance in late October , we built intensive diplomatic pressure on Iraq backed by overwhelming military force in the region .
The UN Security Council voted 15 to zero to condemn Saddam 's actions and to demand that he immediately come into compliance .
Eight Arab nations -- Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar , United Arab Emirates and Oman -- warned that Iraq alone would bear responsibility for the consequences of defying the UN .
When Saddam still failed to comply , we prepared to act militarily .
It was only then at the last possible moment that Iraq backed down .
It pledged to the UN that it had made , and I quote , a clear and unconditional decision to resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors .
I decided then to call off the attack with our airplanes already in the air because Saddam had given in to our demands .
I concluded then that the right thing to do was to use restraint and give Saddam one last chance to prove his willingness to cooperate .
I made it very clear at that time what unconditional cooperation meant , based on existing UN resolutions and Iraq 's own commitments .
And along with Prime Minister Blair of Great Britain , I made it equally clear that if Saddam failed to cooperate fully , we would be prepared to act without delay , diplomacy or warning .
Now over the past three weeks , the UN weapons inspectors have carried out their plan for testing Iraq 's cooperation .
The testing period ended this weekend , and last night , UNSCOM 's chairman , Richard Butler , reported the results to UN Secretary - General Annan .
The conclusions are stark , sobering and profoundly disturbing .
In four out of the five categories set forth , Iraq has failed to cooperate .
Indeed , it actually has placed new restrictions on the inspectors .
Here are some of the particulars .
Iraq repeatedly blocked UNSCOM from inspecting suspect sites .
For example , it shut off access to the headquarters of its ruling party and said it will deny access to the party 's other offices , even though UN resolutions make no exception for them and UNSCOM has inspected them in the past .
Iraq repeatedly restricted UNSCOM 's ability to obtain necessary evidence .
For example , Iraq obstructed UNSCOM 's effort to photograph bombs related to its chemical weapons program .
It tried to stop an UNSCOM biological weapons team from videotaping a site and photocopying documents and prevented Iraqi personnel from answering UNSCOM 's questions .
Prior to the inspection of another site , Iraq actually emptied out the building , removing not just documents but even the furniture and the equipment .
Iraq has failed to turn over virtually all the documents requested by the inspectors .
Indeed , we know that Iraq ordered the destruction of weapons - related documents in anticipation of an UNSCOM inspection .
So Iraq has abused its final chance .
As the UNSCOM reports concludes , and again I quote , " Iraq 's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in the fields of disarmament .
" In light of this experience , and in the absence of full cooperation by Iraq , it must regrettably be recorded again that the commission is not able to conduct the work mandated to it by the Security Council with respect to Iraq 's prohibited weapons program . "
In short , the inspectors are saying that even if they could stay in Iraq , their work would be a sham .
Saddam 's deception has defeated their effectiveness .
Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam , Saddam has disarmed the inspectors .
This situation presents a clear and present danger to the stability of the Persian Gulf and the safety of people everywhere .
The international community gave Saddam one last chance to resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors .
Saddam has failed to seize the chance .
And so we had to act and act now .
Let me explain why .
First , without a strong inspection system , Iraq would be free to retain and begin to rebuild its chemical , biological and nuclear weapons programs in months , not years .
Second , if Saddam can crippled the weapons inspection system and get away with it , he would conclude that the international community -- led by the United States -- has simply lost its will .
He will surmise that he has free rein to rebuild his arsenal of destruction , and someday -- make no mistake -- he will use it again as he has in the past .
Third , in halting our air strikes in November , I gave Saddam a chance , not a license .
If we turn our backs on his defiance , the credibility of U.S. power as a check against Saddam will be destroyed .
We will not only have allowed Saddam to shatter the inspection system that controls his weapons of mass destruction program ; we also will have fatally undercut the fear of force that stops Saddam from acting to gain domination in the region .
That is why , on the unanimous recommendation of my national security team -- including the vice president , the secretary of defense , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , the secretary of state and the national security adviser -- I have ordered a strong , sustained series of air strikes against Iraq .
They are designed to degrade Saddam 's capacity to develop and deliver weapons of mass destruction , and to degrade his ability to threaten his neighbors .
At the same time , we are delivering a powerful message to Saddam .
If you act recklessly , you will pay a heavy price .
We acted today because , in the judgment of my military advisers , a swift response would provide the most surprise and the least opportunity for Saddam to prepare .
If we had delayed for even a matter of days from Chairman Butler 's report , we would have given Saddam more time to disperse his forces and protect his weapons .
Also , the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins this weekend .
For us to initiate military action during Ramadan would be profoundly offensive to the Muslim world and , therefore , would damage our relations with Arab countries and the progress we have made in the Middle East .
That is something we wanted very much to avoid without giving Iraq 's a month 's head start to prepare for potential action against it .
Finally , our allies , including Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain , concurred that now is the time to strike .
I hope Saddam will come into cooperation with the inspection system now and comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions .
But we have to be prepared that he will not , and we must deal with the very real danger he poses .
So we will pursue a long - term strategy to contain Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and work toward the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people .
First , we must be prepared to use force again if Saddam takes threatening actions , such as trying to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction or their delivery systems , threatening his neighbors , challenging allied aircraft over Iraq or moving against his own Kurdish citizens .
The credible threat to use force , and when necessary , the actual use of force , is the surest way to contain Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction program , curtail his aggression and prevent another Gulf War .
Second , so long as Iraq remains out of compliance , we will work with the international community to maintain and enforce economic sanctions .
Sanctions have cost Saddam more than $ 120 billion -- resources that would have been used to rebuild his military .
The sanctions system allows Iraq to sell oil for food , for medicine , for other humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people .
We have no quarrel with them .
But without the sanctions , we would see the oil - for - food program become oil - for - tanks , resulting in a greater threat to Iraq 's neighbors and less food for its people .
The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power , he threatens the well - being of his people , the peace of his region , the security of the world .
The best way to end that threat once and for all is with a new Iraqi government -- a government ready to live in peace with its neighbors , a government that respects the rights of its people .
Bringing change in Baghdad will take time and effort .
We will strengthen our engagement with the full range of Iraqi opposition forces and work with them effectively and prudently .
The decision to use force is never cost - free .
Whenever American forces are placed in harm 's way , we risk the loss of life .
And while our strikes are focused on Iraq 's military capabilities , there will be unintended Iraqi casualties .
Indeed , in the past , Saddam has intentionally placed Iraqi civilians in harm 's way in a cynical bid to sway international opinion .
We must be prepared for these realities .
At the same time , Saddam should have absolutely no doubt if he lashes out at his neighbors , we will respond forcefully .
Heavy as they are , the costs of action must be weighed against the price of inaction .
If Saddam defies the world and we fail to respond , we will face a far greater threat in the future .
Saddam will strike again at his neighbors .
He will make war on his own people .
And mark my words , he will develop weapons of mass destruction .
He will deploy them , and he will use them .
Because we 're acting today , it is less likely that we will face these dangers in the future .
Let me close by addressing one other issue .
Saddam Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought that the serious debate currently before the House of Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to face him down .
But once more , the United States has proven that although we are never eager to use force , when we must act in America 's vital interests , we will do so .
In the century we 're leaving , America has often made the difference between chaos and community , fear and hope .
Now , in the new century , we 'll have a remarkable opportunity to shape a future more peaceful than the past , but only if we stand strong against the enemies of peace .
Tonight , the United States is doing just that .
May
God bless and protect the brave men and women who are carrying out this vital mission and their families .
And may God bless America .
CNN has a pretty extensive profile on El Jobso -- the likes of which seem to appear almost monthly these days in the mainstream media publication of your choosing -- but one of the more interesting tidbits is that apparently he sat on his pancreatic cancer for nine friggin ' months before seeking treatment back in 2004 .
To put that in perspective , although his diagnosis was curable at the time , pancreatic cancer is considered to be among the most deadly forms and despite the urgings of the very few friends , family , and associates in the know , Steve apparently sought to cure himself holistically for three quarters -- while everyone else ( including Pixar , where he was also CEO ) was in the dark .
Of course , eventually he gave in and got the surgery he so desperately needed to make his recovery ; water under the bridge now , but Apple shareholders certainly must have a feeling or two about Jobs coming so close to the brink .

Could primates have evolved into humans without knowing how to cook ?
For 10 years , Harvard University primatologist Richard Wrangham has gathered data that he says show that the discovery of cooking allowed humans to evolve .
The only snag , according to Scientific American :
He has yet to prove that humans ' ancestors could control fire , a missing link that some scientists say casts doubt on the cooking hypothesis .
Chimpanzees ' diets of raw , bitter fruits could n't provide enough energy to support humans ' relatively large brains , ...

Scientists could soon diagnose a range of diseases just from someone spitting into a test tube .
U.S researchers have identified all 1,116 unique proteins found in human saliva and they believe these may be used to identify cancer , heart disease and diabetes among other conditions , without the need for blood tests .
As many as 20 per cent of the proteins that are found in saliva are also found in blood , said lead researcher Fred Hagen , from the University of Rochester Medical Centre in New York .
" This is potentially a large field that has many clinical implications in the area of disease diagnostics , " said Hagen , whose work was published in the Journal of Proteome Research .

Spitting into a test tube could soon be all that is needed to diagnose cancer
Like a genome , which lists all of the genes in an organism , a proteome is a complete map of proteins .
While genes provide the instruction manual , proteins carry out the instructions by regulating cellular processes .
Researchers from five American universities sought to determine the complete set of proteins secreted by the major salivary glands .
They collected saliva from 23 healthy men and women of several races .
They tested saliva samples using some form of mass spectrometry , which determines the identity of proteins based on measurements of their mass and charge .
They compared their findings with recent protein maps of human blood and tears .
Early analysis has already turned up a number of proteins with known roles in Alzheimer 's , Huntington 's and Parkinson 's diseases ; breast , colorectal and pancreatic cancer and diabetes .
Most of the proteins were part of signalling pathways , which are key to the body 's response to system wide diseases .
Hagen said the work should accelerate the development of new tools for tracking disease throughout the body .
There are already saliva - based antibody tests to detect HIV and hepatitis infections , Hagen said .
He said this protein map will provide new targets .
" Monitoring disease as well as drug use could be more easily done with saliva as opposed to blood or urine , " he said .
Other groups are working on a saliva - based test for breast cancer that would detect a protein fragment from the HER2 protein .
Hagen said such tests could eventually replace uncomfortable and costly mammograms .
" We envision in the future spitting in a tube and looking for a marker like this breast cancer marker .
It would be much easier to do , potentially at home , " he said .

The issues surrounding the use of psychoactive drugs are complex .
Prohibition discourages the spread of accurate information in favor of " Just Say No " rhetoric .
But prohibition has failed and we need to move on to education .
Information sources need to prioritize accuracy rather than maintaining politically driven anti-drug messages .
Especially during Pandemic 2020 , harm reduction has lost attention .
Opioid deaths are up and a lot of psychedelic use has moved to private locations instead of festivals where there might be onsite drug checking .

OSS Operation Sauerkraut
By SGM Herbert A. Friedman ( Ret . )
I have previously written about Operations Cornflakes , a psychological warfare campaign waged by the United States Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) Morale Operations ( MO ) section in Rome during WWII .
Operation Cornflakes was designed to drop German mail sacks containing subversive material in carefully addressed envelopes inside the Reich near shot - up enemy trains .
The same people in the 2677th Regiment of the OSS ( Provisional ) who were involved in the Cornflakes operation were also preparing propaganda for use in Operation Sauerkraut , a plan to use captured German prisoners of war to distribute Allied propaganda behind enemy lines .
In fact , many of the leaflets that I have depicted in the Cornflakes article were also used in the Sauerkraut campaign .
The data below is from a large number of official Sauerkraut documents in my possession and from personal interviews with some members of the Rome OSS team .
The Sauerkraut story begins on 21 July 1944 when the German generals attempted to assassinate their Führer , Adolf Hitler .
Just hours after the first reports of the attempted coup , MO Rome was busy devising ways to capitalize on the news from Germany .
The OSS identified the situation : " The attempted assassination of Hitler provided an unusual psychological moment to attack the morale of the German Army if appropriate propaganda could be circulated without delay . "
Ordinary methods of infiltration via aircraft drops were not considered speedy enough .
Several members of the OSS staff had been meeting with " friendly , trustworthy " German prisoners over a period of several months attempting to determine their political views .
The implementation of the program was defined : " By passing agents directly through the front lines to distribute freshly - conceived rumors , leaflets , fake orders and ' official ' proclamations , as well as longer - ranged arousers of homesickness such as fake Germans women 's ' lonely hearts clubs ' . "
We know that the Morale Operations Sauerkraut unit was part of Company D of the 2677 Provisional OSS Regiment based near Siena , Italy .
We know there were 3 officers , one enlisted man and three civilians .
All used code - names that were very close to their real names , sometimes just a letter or two different .
The team members came and went so it is impossible to say with any accuracy who they were but reading secret coded reports seems to imply that the officers were ; First Lieutenant Jack Daniels ; a Major Dewart ; Captain Erik Anderson , and finally First Lieutenant Arthur Tritsch who seems to have commanded the unit at some point .
The enlisted person is more difficult .
We know that Private Barbara Lauwers of the Woman 's Army Corps was a member , but they may have put her in a different category as a female WAC member .
We know there were a Sergeant Alfio Durso who also acted as a printer and a Corporal Glass who also acted as a driver .
A Sergeant Ring is also mentioned in one report so one of the above four is the enlister person in the team .
I only found three civilians so these names could be accurate .
We know Eddie Lindner for sure , and a George Carpenter and Broch de Rotherman are also mentioned .
We assume these were the three .
The German agents started out as a small group and grew as more agents were needed and some were removed because of various security worries .
Linder mentions 20 German agents in his final report but that does not mean that they all saw action .
A 19 December 1944 report mentions the equipment that each team member carried .
I note :
Proper identification and passes ;
Berretta pistols and German rifles ;
Forty rounds of ammo each ;
American compasses ;
Italian and Swiss watches ;
3000 pieces of printed Morale Operations propaganda ;
2300 to 7800 lire in all denominations ;
German steel helmets , uniforms and field equipment ;
Italian cigarettes , matches and stationery ;
First aid packets .
Eight faked field post letters in the German language were produced by the OSS in Italy .
They were printed in Rome between the summer of 1944 and the spring of 1945 .
The total number of forged field post letters that were printed in Rome is indicated in an OSS production report .
287,000 copies were produced in the period between 15 July 1944 and the end of the war .
Of these , 257,232 copies were reportedly distributed , an average of 32,000 copies of each letter .
This " lonely hearts club " leaflet is in the form of a field post folded letter .
This letter allegedly originates from the " Verein Einsamer Kriegerfrauen ( VEK ) " ( Association of Lonely War Women ) .
This message attempts to destroy the morale of the soldier in the field by making him believe that his wife , girlfriend or sister was having casual sex while he was fighting at the front .
The text is :
Summer 1944
Dear frontline soldier !
When will you have leave again ?
When will you be able to forget your arduous soldier 's duties for a while , for a few days of joy , happiness and love ?
We at home know of your heroic struggle .
We understand that even the bravest gets tired sometime and need a soft pillow , tenderness and healthy enjoyment .
We are waiting for you :
For you who must spend your leave in a foreign town ; for you whom the war has deprived of a home ; for you who is alone in the world without a wife , fiancée or a flirt .

Association of Lonely War Women .
The League of Lonely War women was the creation of Women 's Army Corps ( WAC ) and OSS Morale Operations agent Corporal Barbara Lauwers .
The operation was so successful that the Washington Post was fooled and ran a story on 10 October 1944 entitled , " German soldiers on leave from the Italian front have only to pin an entwined heart of their lapel during furloughs home to find a girl friend . "
The newspaper got the story from a circular that was captured on the Eighth Army front .
The circular had been written by Lauwers and carried behind German lines by the Sauerkraut agents .
Lauwers later was awarded a Bronze Star for a PSYOP campaign that led to the surrender of several hundred Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been drafted into the German Army .
Barbara was a native of Czechoslovakia and spoke a number of languages fluently .
Her code name was Zuzka .
She graduated from the Masaryk University in Brno with a doctor of law degree .
In 1941 , she came to the United States and served for eighteen months in the Czechoslovak press relations office .
She joined the OSS and served in the U.S. Army for the duration of the war .
Corporal Barbara Lauwers was decorated with the Bronze Star for her black operations work for the OSS .
Her last married name was Barbara Podoski .
While assigned to interrogate prisoners a German sergeant bragged about the great number of Czechs and Slovaks that were assigned the worst missions in the German Army .
She prepared leaflets in both languages which said in part :
Shed this German yoke of shame , cross over to the partisans .
The leaflets were carried by at least 600 Czechs who had earlier joined the Wehrmacht and now decided to defect to the Allies .
In 2010 , some of the data in this section on Barbara Lauwers was used in the production of a Department of Defense sponsored TV broadcast by the American Forces Radio and Television Service entitled " American Heritage : American Patriots . "
According to the Shadow War against Hitler , Christof Mauch , Columbia University Press , NY , 1999 :
The plan that Company D hatched the night of July 21 , 1944 was surprisingly simple and seemed to solve all outstanding problems at a single stroke .
As agents for the covert actions , it would not be OSS or military people who would be recruited , but rather German prisoners of war .
An idea concocted by the philosopher Frederick Burkhardt and the Austrian aristocrat Oliver von Schneditz [ code name Oliver Rockhill ] , two Research and Development agents working in Italy .
It did not take long to come up with a name for the new OSS project .
We wanted to give the operation a title name that would be very German and at the same time widely understood .
I think it was Eddie Lindner 's idea .
" How about Sauerkraut ?
The Germans are called Krauts anyway . "
Sauerkraut seemed absolutely appropriate for the operation .
Now was the time to strike .
While two members of the team departed to the prison camp at Aversa , near Naples , to select candidates , other members were hard at work producing a series of tactical leaflets to take advantage of the situation .
The first was a special order of the day declaring that Field Marshall Walther Von Brauchitsch had taken control of Germany .
Other leaflets called on German troops to take revolutionary actions , and a special edition of the Allied black newspaper Das Neue Deutschland was printed .
Meanwhile , Captain William T. Dewart and Corporal Barbara Lauwers had recruited sixteen German prisoners who volunteered to act as American agents .
The concept of secretly sending Americans behind the wire in prisoner - of - war camps was apparently not that uncommon .
In 2011 , I was contacted by the family of Technical Sergeant ( T3 ) Werner A. Bloch , who they believed was in the OSS during the war .
Bloch was a German - Jewish refugee who arrived in the US in 1939 and was drafted into the US Army in 1940 .
He was fluent in French and Belgian and his native language was German so he was assigned to Intelligence duties .
His record shows that he was assigned in both Sicily and Rome with the military occupational specialty of Intelligence non-commissioned officer ( 631 ) .
He told his family that during the war :
I was often dressed in a German uniform and placed in a stockade of recently captured prisoners where my mission was to strike up conversations to establish which ones were candidates for coming over to our side .
Once they were selected and volunteered , I identified myself and interrogated them to glean more information .
Back at Operation Sauerkraut , another OSS officer named Ed Lindner prepared fake credentials and gathered uniforms and weapons for the agents .
The German prisoners were driven to Rome , and by the time they arrived on 23 July , the propaganda literature and leaflets were prepared and waiting .
The teams were moved close to the front lines at Sienna .
While the men were issued their uniforms and weapons , Ed Lindner schooled them on their cover stories and supplied them with documents and currency .
The teams were well equipped with uniforms , credentials , weapons , compasses , matches , and miscellaneous items .
They were issued money , Italian cigarettes , matches , stationery , and first aid kits .
Each POW carried from 2300 lire to 7800 lire in mixed denominations .
Three teams of three men each were scheduled to cross the lines at the Arno River and then be on their own .
They were to penetrate as deeply as possible , placing leaflets and proclamations on trees , buildings , into trucks , and scattering them on the streets .
The charcoal sketches in this story were prepared by German Sauerkraut agent Willy Haseneier .
Haseneier was captured 4 June 1944 .
An artist and graduate of the Düsseldorf Art Academy , we was used by his OSS handlers to forge identity papers , passes , credentials and signatures .
At the end of the war he worked for the Allies producing visual aids for the Nurnberg trials .
He immigrated to Hollywood after the war and found fame as " Will Williams , " illustrating book covers , comic books , movie posters , and portraits of actors .
Ironically , some of his drawings were called " the secret agent series , " a subject he was very familiar with .
Declassified documents show that Edmund Friedrich Linder was an Austrian born in Vienna 11 May 1908 .
His father was an American citizen working for Republic Steel in Cleveland , Ohio .
After the Germans entered Austria , Linder first went to Switzerland and later Belgium while awaiting papers to allow him to enter the United States .
He tried to join the American military but was turned down as an alien .
He was cleared to join the British Pioneers .
He eventually joined the American OSS assigned to the Algiers MO section 1 August 1943 .
An October 1944 letter to the Chief of Morale Operations describes Linder using his code name and says in part :
Eddie Zinder , Austrian , is now applying for American citizenship ...
Eddie is a remarkably versatile young man , having written many leaflets , the song " Wie Lange Noch , " acted as a doctor at various times and is the supreme master of briefing , preparation of documents and preparing prisoners of war for infiltration .
Readers might be confused by the various spelling of this agent 's name .
Understand that although he was born " Linder , " he adopted his father 's Paul Americanized name " Lindner , " and the OSS used the code name " Zinder . "
In all the correspondence I have seen the names are used interchangeably , so I have followed that pattern and used the name that appears in a specific document when talking about a specific campaign .
All the teams returned safely two days later after leaving 3000 pieces of propaganda behind the lines .
Some of the men had penetrated as far as three miles behind the German lines .
They reported that they had disseminated the propaganda and German soldiers were eagerly reading the literature .
They also brought back intelligence about defensive positions and German military movements .
As a result , the Fifth Army G2 ( Intelligence ) requested that more teams be sent behind the lines .
The Story of the Sauerkrauts , an OSS booklet printed in Rome in May 1945 gives a brief description of the operation .
Some of the comments are :
Unimpeachable credentials were vitally important .
Special documents had to be prepared to substantiate the agent 's cover stories .
After the operation started , the Germans made frequent changes in their documents and it was necessary to check and duplicate these changes .
Although the agents were accosted by German Military Police on many occasions , there was only one instance in which their credentials were questioned .
A special department was set up so that the documentation could be completed in the field .
A wide variety of official rubber stamps were manufactured in Research and development in Rome .
Every conceivable kind of insignia had to be located .
Uniforms were completed down to the last detail .
Hose of a wrong color might give a man away and destroy the entire operation .
Weapons had to be supplied .
In regard to the training of the men the report says :
Each man was interviewed thoroughly and tests of his character were made .
As each was accepted , a complete record of his past performances and his qualifications was entered in the files .
The men were trained in the use of the German light machine gun , explosives , map reading , and the operations of American and German vehicles .
They practiced the dissemination of MO material and their cover stories .
The files on some of the men are interesting .
Let 's look at one .
Hans Tappert was a 33 - year old Protestant who spoke five languages .
His family was persecuted and his father was shot by the Nazis .
His mother was placed in Bochum penitentiary for anti-Nazi activities .
She was later moved to Finsterwalde Concentration Camp where she died and was cremated in 1937 .
Tappert was tried three times for anti-Nazi activities .
He was jailed for 18 months in 1934 , but was still drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1940 .
He was confined for 6 months that year and then was sent to Greece .
In 1943 he was court - martialed again and sentenced to 18 months .
After six months he was let out and was sent to the Italian front .
He immediately deserted to the partisans and later surrendered to the Americans .
He took part in Sauerkraut missions 2 and 3 .
Clayton D. Laurie mentions the black newspaper Der Oesterreicher in The Propaganda Warriors , University Press of Kansas , 1996 .
He says that it was purported to represent a resistance group and sought to split Austria from Germany by portraying the former country as a Nazi- occupied nation .
The Sauerkraut teams also carried Italian - language newspapers such as Voice of Italy and Voice of the Patriot behind the lines .
We know that the Germans soon became aware of the American activities because they began lighting their frontlines with flares .
They had not done so previously .
The OSS semi-monthly report of 3 August 1944 says in part :
The bomb attack on Hitler was exploited as rapidly and extensively as possible by MO .
Two bogus leaflets , printed on captured German Feldpost forms were prepared and disseminated .
For the first time - it is believed - German deserters were used for the infiltration of enemy lines .
A group of 14 [ there was fear of double - agents among the group and some were returned to the prison camp ] was recruited , briefed , and given MO material , and headed for the front within 48 hours after the bomb assault .
Additional printed matter in the form of three more leaflets not yet off the press was prepared and will be ready in a day or so .
Just as in Operation Cornflakes , the printing was done by Corporal Egidio Clemente , a master printer who supervised the OSS presses .
The Sauerkraut printed material was prepared in two qualities ; very good or very crude .
There is a reason for this .
The documents , hand - stamps , Nazi Party dues stamps and identification papers that the agents carried behind the lines had to be perfect .
They had to pass inspection by the German military police .
At the same time , the leaflets , gummed labels , and posters had to look crude .
The plan was for the German soldiers to think that there was an underground anti-Nazi movement that existed all around them .
If the stickers on the wall were too good , it would be apparent that they were of Allied origin .
As a result , many of the leaflets had the appearance of crudely mimeographed sheets that had been produced in a basement on a hand - cranked machine .
A second Sauerkraut operation took place on 7 September 1944 when seven German agents in three teams were sent behind the lines northwest of Florence .
Their mission was :
To disseminate specially prepared black propaganda material throughout their itinerary , placing special emphasis on bivouac areas , installations and vehicles .
Material to be placed on the sides of buildings , fences , and trees when possible .
Material to be left lying on the floor in buildings likely to be used as headquarters and installations by retreating front line troops .
Material to be left lying on the ground and attached to trees and bushes in any places likely to be seen by troops .
If possible , material to be posted in public places in any towns entered .
The teams all returned safely and reported on the German defenses in their sector .
This was published on 10 September as an intelligence bulletin and contained such data as :
A battalion of the German 4th Parachute Division is ill - clad , poorly fed ( no rations in the past three days ) and believed that the war was lost .
A German artillery unit in L'Isola has so little ammunition that they can only fire after telephone permission from the Division Commander
Two tiger tanks and three light tanks are hidden in a group of four houses by crossroads L-712098 .
At the same time , they reported leaving MO propaganda in a German medical station .
Other material was planted on the walls of the medical station , inside officer 's quarters , in supply trucks , storage warehouses , and in six ambulances left unattended .
Some leaflets were placed in unguarded Tiger tanks , and in a mechanic 's tool kit .
A third Sauerkraut operation took place on 2 October near Florence .
Three teams were involved , now bearing the names , " Ada , " " Marie , " and " Rosie . "
This time the agents on their way to Bologna ran into German SS troops while placing propaganda on a tree near Route 64 .
A German officer read the literature , realized it was anti-Nazi and alerted his men .
A firefight ensued and the " Marie " team reported killing from three to seven of the enemy .
MO took advantage of this incident and prepared a leaflet that said , " Street fighting provoked by SS men against troops of the Wehrmacht . "
That leaflet was infiltrated on 8 October .
MO also started a rumor to be carried by the agents that Hitler had been caught at the Swiss border trying to flee Germany .
In addition , other rumors were that Field Marshall Albert Kesselring was either wounded or had tried to commit suicide , and that maps found on a Russian pilot shot down near Vienna showed local areas suitable for massed landings by airborne forces .
Once again , all items of MO material given to the team for distribution were placed as directed .
The success of this mission caused the Fifth Army to request that the operation be broadened , and another twenty German prisoners were brought into the program .
Explanatory leaflet for captured German soldiers ( To put in the pay book ! )
1 . ) Keep your soldier 's honor by behaving respectably in captivity and strengthen thus the respect of the enemy for you and the German army !
2 . ) You must only tell your a ) name b) military rank c ) day and place of birth d ) home address .
Nobody can force you to tell more !
3 . ) Answer to all further questions just with this sentence : " I do not know this ! "
4 . ) Consider always that every further statement is treason .
And Treason is murdering comrades !
By the end of October the German prisoners were being treated like honored guests and a building was put aside for them in the Fifth Army sector .
Reported problems were clothing and operational enemy equipment .
As the project grew there was need for more uniforms and more military materiel .
The OSS was also trying to open a " second front " with another holding area for German prisoner - agents in the Eighth Army sector .
Lack of transportation seems to have been a major problem .
The unit had few trucks at its disposal .
By 15 November 1944 the MO section was feeling quite confident in their Sauerkraut operation .
The Fifth Army German holding area was complete .
The area had its own mess hall and rationing system , supply room , and administrative detachment .
Agents had been recruited , screened , and in some cases replaced .
A German supply dump was found and with it rifles , bayonets , mess - kits and helmets .
Italian - language leaflets were delivered for use against the Monte Rosa Division immediately after it had appeared in the front lines in the Fifth Army 's sector .
A " black list " leaflet of wanted war criminals was printed and delivered .
There is a printed comment from a partisan leader that these " black lists " were very powerful tools and often kept the fascist leaders inside their homes for weeks after the leaflets were placed in the center of Italian towns .
Sauerkraut mission four was made up of teams " Sylvia , " " Lou , " and " Texas . "
They went behind the lines on the nights of 21 , 22 and 23 November northwest of Florence .
The teams were to split up and reconnoiter the towns of Zocca , Vergato , Sestola , and Pievepelago .
Their instructions were to disseminate MO material among German troops , place posters and leaflets wherever it might be suitable , in and around military installations , bivouac areas , supply depots and in German vehicles .
The teams returned to San Marcello on 26 November .
They reported that the propaganda had been distributed along Route 12 in the area of Abetone and along Route 64 near Bologna and Vergato .
They gathered tactical intelligence on mined areas , artillery emplacements , and identified an Alpine Division .
The fifth Sauerkraut mission consisted of one team code - named " California . "
It was to pass through the lines on 30 November , proceed through Bologna , Vergato , Casatechio , Riale - Rivabello - Montepassore and Cereglio - Vergato .
It would disseminate MO material , carry out intelligence assignments , report on German morale , and pass the following rumor :
Himmler found a " doppelganger " ( double ) for Hitler for the purpose of presenting that man as Hitler himself .
The Fuehrer has disappeared and it is possible that he is dead , seriously ill , or that he fled to some foreign country like Switzerland or Argentina .
The team returned safely on 3 December .
Their after - action report states that they left MO special toilet - paper in latrines and in bars on Route 9 .
The OSS produced a number of different types of Hitler toilet paper , all showing the Führer in embarrassing poses or with crude text attacking the Nazi Party .
Comrades !
Stop this shit !
We do not fight for Germany but only for Hitler and Himmler .
The NSDAP led us this damned way but now the bigwigs are only trying to save their own skin .
They let us die in the mud ; they want us to hold out until the last bullet .
However , we need the last bullets to free Germany from this SS - shit .
Enough !
Peace !
By 19 December the Sauerkraut teams were being used to check the " exactness and accuracy of details to be employed in writing MO material . "
Sauerkraut mission six was made up of the two - man team " Utah " and infiltrated on 23 December .
It distributed seven pounds of MO material around Marzabotto Mission in cars , houses , trees and milestone markers .
It reported on the location of the 16th SS Division , the 267th Regiment of the 94th Division , and elements of a parachute division .
The team returned safely on 25 December .
Sauerkraut mission seven was a two - man team called " Idaho . "
It was infiltrated by II Corps on the night of 23 February , and sent back a carrier pigeon with the message that it had safely crossed the lines .
The team 's route was Santa Maria , Castel D'Aiano , Villa D'Aiano , Zocca , Vignola and Vergato .
It identified German units , artillery , hospitals , dumps , and defenses .
MO material was spread along the route and placed in empty farmhouses where German soldiers sleep .
Sauerkraut mission eight was a three - man team called " Vonita , " infiltrated on 25 February .
It was to travel along highway 64 south of Vergato and proceed to the town of Montese .
The team returned safely on 28 February .
Sauerkraut mission nine was a three - man team called " Ohio . "
It crossed the lines on 26 February , proceeded to the area of Zocca , and all but one man returned safely on 1 March .
The only admitted fatality of a Sauerkraut agent occurred during mission nine .
The team 's cover story was that they were from the 232nd Infantry Division stationed near Zocca .
Upon their return , MO agent Gustav Preuss was missing .
The team members reported that he had been captured .
A 2 May 1945 letter from Ed Lindner to the Chief of the MO Branch on the subject of the agent 's death says in part :
A recent report from Mr. Halama states that he interrogated a German prisoner , Major Neubauer , who happened to be present at a German police station when our agent was brought in by a patrol .
Our agent was in possession of credentials which were issued to him by us under the name of Gustav Schalk .
His German soldbuch showed that he belonged to one of the German units in Italy .
The German MP telephoned the respective German unit listed in the agent 's soldbuch in order to check with the company commander .
The agent tried to escape and was wounded by a shot in the abdomen .
Major Neubauer does not believe that Preuss will live .
However , he was evacuated to a German field hospital in Modena .
A German document showed that the soldier who captured our agent , Candidate Schmitz , 1st Company , 194 AT Battalion , was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class by Major General Steinmetz , the Division Commander
There was a Sauerkraut mission ten but I have been unable to obtain any record of the results .
Sauerkraut mission eleven was a two - man team called " Pennsylvania . "
Its mission was to cross the lines near highway 64 towards Vergato .
As always the team would spread MO material , check the morale of the enemy troops , identify the opposing units , and discover and mark the location of gun emplacements and fortifications .
It infiltrated 18 March and returned on 21 March .
This team did exceptionally well .
The agents met a pair of German soldiers who wanted to defect but were not sure where the Americans were and were afraid to surrender without a safe conduct pass .
The Sauerkraut agents brought the two Germans back across the lines and turned them over to the American prisoner of war authorities .
The team distributed their MO material as it traveled , posted flyers on walls and trees , put some in an ox cart , and covered the back of a military bus that carried German troops from Tole to Casalecchio .
There were two more Sauerkraut missions before the operation was cancelled .
I believe the last mission was number thirteen .
The story of the fate of the German agents does not reflect pride on the United States Army .
The agents were promised preferential treatment but were eventually returned to the POW camp where they received no special treatment and were shunned by their fellow prisoners because of their contact with the Americans .
Ed Lindner fought with the American headquarters about the German agents .
He wrote a report that pointed out that their status should have been " alien civilians " and not prisoners of war since they had been released to the OSS .
He tried to get the agents paid for their services but was told , " Extra compensation for POWs is not looked upon with favor by this headquarters . "
The Sauerkraut agents never received any pay for their services .
A request for an allowance for recreational purposes was denied .
When Lindner wanted them released as alien civilians he was told " No , they are prisoners of war .
Return them with men and adequate guard to Caserta . "
This was a shameful act on the part of the American military forces .
They used these men , put them behind the lines at great personal risk , made promises to them about preferential treatment , and then tossed them back into a POW camp when they were no longer needed .
Lindner stated , " None were put on his feet by OSS or even helped in his return into civilian life .
Something could and should have been done for these men , who did an outstanding job for the OSS . "
It is hard to determine if the Sauerkraut agents were better or worse off than their comrades who stayed in the prison cages .
It is true that they lived better in the OSS compound , certainly ate better food , and apparently were able to have occasional sex with local Italian girls .
At the same time , they were in a very unclear status .
They were no longer considered prisoners of war , appeared on no official records , and were not employees of the OSS or United States government .
They received no payment , not even the small stipend given to prisoners of war , and received no mail or Red Cross parcels as did the most ardent pro-Nazi POW .
According to international law the holding power is responsible for the protection and safety of prisoners of war and expressly forbidden to put them in danger .
It is illegal to send them into dangerous or life - threatening situations , so the OSS was clearly in violation of the rules of warfare .
The agents were all made to sign waivers that stated clearly that they were volunteers and willing to go behind the lines .
Military lawyers thought that this would protect the United States from lawsuits should the prisoners ever bring their case before an international court .
All is fair in love and war , and an Army will do what is needed to win , but the Sauerkraut agents were an OSS embarrassment in 1945 and quietly returned to the prison camp and forgotten .
There is only one written record of a Sauerkraut agent being killed on a mission .
However , I interviewed an individual who was aware of a dead German being found virtually unmarked on the side of an Italian road .
He believed that the soldier had been killed by the concussion from a nearby blast .
In the German 's knapsack were a pile of gummed stickers and propaganda labels that indicate that this was a Sauerkraut agent carrying MO material behind the lines .
Some of the crude stickers show a burial cross and the word " Du ? " ( You ? ) , or a gallows with the words " Hitler , Himmler an den Galgen , " ( " Hitler , Himmler at the gallows " ) .
Others have such messages as " Bigwigs in clover , Soldiers in the mud , " " Later is too late , " " Nazis out , " " Home , " " Piss off ! , " " Freedom ! Peace ! , " and " Die for Hitler ? "
Laurie adds :
The weight and bulk of printed materials always made great distribution risky .
MO 's solution was to produce pregummed stickers and precut stencils that looked handwritten .
Agents could quickly attach stickers to any surface with little risk , and stencils came with an easy - to - use paint pen specially developed by the OSS R&D Branch .
Stickers and stencils consisted of simple anti-Nazi or defeatist slogans such as " When Hitler dies - Germany lives , " " We quit , " " Capitulate , " and " Must you be the last one to die ? "
There were also postcards from the " War Mothers Group " and faked bombing notification forms .
In all , there were several dozen different types of propaganda .
This propaganda Feldpost card is a good imitation of a genuine patriotic card showing ME - 109s on the front .
The back is inscribed in facsimile handwriting in Gothic script which was still frequently used in Germany during the war .
At the bottom right there is an emblem that represents the seal of the " Ring der Kriegermütter " ( War mother 's group ) .
The OSS wanted the finders to believe that there was an organized group of miserable , lonely mothers who asked their sons in the field to desert or surrender .
The poor handwriting is meant to convince the finder that a simple , uneducated woman wrote the card .
The message is :
At home , in the sixth winter of the war .
Dear sons in the field !
Now that Germany has become a battlefield , we mothers have joined together to beg your help .
After five years of struggle against overwhelming enemy power you have done more than your duty .
Today , the war is lost and the enemy is within our country !
We are abandoned and helpless - do not leave your mothers alone in the hour of danger !
Come home !!!
The mother is your nearest ! "
Another black postcard is a parody attacking the elderly Volkssturm called to service to protect the Reich in the last days of the war .
There is no inscription on the address side of this card .
The reverse features a caricature of two obese women on roller skates .
Both wear armbands with a swastika , and little hats with a flower or a flag .
The lady at left carries a broom as a weapon ; the lady behind her has an umbrella .
The inscription on top reads " Volkssturm " ( People 's Resistance ) , and at the bottom " Schwere Panzer " ( Heavy tanks ) .
The postcard ridicules the German attempt of autumn 1944 to mobilize military power by conscripting children and elderly people .
On September 25 , 1944 , Hitler called all male individuals between the age of 16 and 60 , who did not already serve in the Wehrmacht , to arms .
One of the artists who worked in the OSS Morale Office in Rome was Saul Steinberg of The New Yorker fame .
Steinberg drew the Schwere Panzer postcard .
In official papers such as the Semi-Monthly Report , M.O. Section , Period 15 - 31 July 1944 Steinberg was never given a code name or a duty .
It simply said " Lt. Saul Steinberg , USNR . "
Steinberg did not go behind the lines or deal in black operations so there was no need for a code name .
He was a " floater " who did illustrative work as needed such as flyers , postcards and covers for song sheets allegedly from anti-Nazi organizations .
Although Romanian by birth , Steinberg had escaped from wartime Italy in 1941 .
He had a diploma from the Reggio Politecnico , but under Italy 's new anti-Semitic laws he was identified as " Saul Steinberg , of the Hebrew race . "
By 1942 he was working for the Office of War Information and was soon commissioned an Ensign in the Naval Reserve working for Intelligence in Washington , DC .
In 1943 he was sent to Kunming , China , and by December he was in Algeria .
He was next sent to North Africa and finally to the OSS in Allied - occupied Rome .
In September , 1944 , he was ordered back to Washington .
Christof Mauch concludes :
Sauerkraut agents discovered the 4th Parachute Division , found the site of German " Tiger " tanks , and determined where infantry divisions were staying .
Colonel Kenneth Mann , who led the MO Branch since May 1944 reported that Operation Sauerkraut had been a complete success and that those skeptics who warned that the German prisoners of war would simply dispose of their propaganda material were proven wrong .
Barbara Lauwers recalls that " actually there was no security . "
The 16 German prisoners of war recruited for Sauerkraut sat down with two OSS agents in the loading space of a truck .
" The sixteen guys could have overpowered those two MPs very easily , sixteen against two , even though those two MPs had guns . "
The agents , however , proved " eager to cooperate . "
We should mention that there was also an Operation Ravioli that was supposed to be similar to Sauerkraut , but used Italian prisoners of war .
This plan seems not to have been a success .
The Italians simply did not have the drive of the Germans and failed to achieve much success .
There is one early MO comment that the Italian volunteers are " virtually worthless . "
In a 5 March 1945 memorandum entitled " Current operations and plans , " The status of Operation Ravioli is mentioned .
Some of the comments are :
Larry has been busy interviewing three couriers from the Modena area .
They are not of first rate character and could not suit our needs for Ravioli but they gave useful information .
According to your directives , we prefer to spend a little more time waiting rather than waste it completely with a second - rate job .
Still , the author is optimistic :
From all these contacts it becomes more and more evident that the Ravioli operation will be easy to conduct as soon as we have the right man to handle it across the lines .
A 15 -31 semi-monthly report states :
Lt Bruzzese interrogated 5 prospective agents at the Partisan Rest Camp … Colonel Riepe , 15th Army group gave his formal approval for the Ravioli plan .
A Ravioli mission was finally completed when three Italian partisans were sent behind the lines in Fascist uniforms on 14 April 1945 .
They were to proceed to Castelnuovo and disseminate MO material among Republican fascist troops , in and around military installations , bivouac areas , supply depots , vehicles and road houses .
Their orders were to distribute propaganda and gather intelligence on enemy strength and return on 17 April .
The team got nervous and instead of waiting for their guides to arrive and night to fall , decided to return the American lines in full daylight .
The Germans opened fire with mortars and machine guns thinking that they were Italian Army deserters , but the three agents returned safely , if breathless .
As a result , a decision was made to send partisans in civilian clothes across the lines and hold off sending agents in Italian uniforms until " some later stage in the campaign . "
Both operations are mentioned by Clayton D. Laurie :
The Sauerkraut and Ravioli missions exemplified perfectly the willingness of the OSS leadership to use whatever means were necessary to defeat the Nazis since these operations were in violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention and the U.S. Army Rules of Land Warfare , both of which applied to the OSS .
William Casey was a major proponent of using expendable POWs for MO work and for equally dangerous SO and SI missions .
He assured OSS member J. Russell Forgan of the full cooperation of the U.S. Army 's provost marshal 's office , which had guaranteed the OSS an unending supply of POWs .
This ends our brief look at the Sauerkraut operations .
It was a very daring use of enemy prisoners to distribute propaganda and gain intelligence for Allied forces .
It was extremely successful and would have certainly gone on to greater successes had the war in Europe not ended in mid-1945 .

A reader named Michael has sent me a letter yesterday :
get vlad kalashnikov to write a piece on the downfall of the whiter than white , do gooder Eliot Spitzer .
After all , isnt it a perfect euphemism for the downfall of america .
In both cases it turns out that the do - gooder who went around preaching and accusing everyone else of corruption is in fact the loser doomed to failure .
How apt .
How shakesperean
" I HATE ANY AMERICAN WHO HAS REAL SEX ! "
You have it wrong Michael .
What is so scandalous is American Puritanical mentally - sick attitude towards sex and prostitution , " the world 's oldest profession . "
In Russia , as in Europe and nearly any country in the world except for Protestant mentally - sick America , prostitution is not such a big deal , because sex is not a taboo .
Americans think it is scandalous to have sex .
In fact they are terrified of sex and completely schizophrenic about it .
That is all the Spitzer story looks like from here in Russia : just a fucked up sick decaying culture that cannot face the basic human need for sex without fear and terror .
That is why so many Americans have sick disgusting sexual fetishes , and why so many teenagers are
Here is the real perfect euphemism for America 's downfall : all American media is bawling and screaming because a man had sex , but meanwhile , in Iraq , 12 American soldiers died in the last 3 days , according to
The deaths mark a significant rise in violence over several days that included dozens of civilians dying in sectarian violence .
The bloody uptick casts doubt on the relative calm that followed a surge of U.S. forces to Baghdad last year .
According to an Associated Press count , at the height of unrest from November 2006 to August 2007 , on average approximately 65 Iraqis died each day as a result of violence .
As conditions improved , the daily death toll steadily declined .
It reached its lowest point in more than two years on January 2008 , when on average 20 Iraqis died each day .
Those numbers have since jumped .
In February , approximately 26 Iraqis died each day as a result of violence , and so far in March , that number is up to 39 daily .
Uh-oh !
So much for the Surge , losers !
What do crumbling empires do in their dying days ?
They eat their own , or in the bloodthirsty retard Bush 's case , they fire the only sane commander
DEMORALIZED AMERICAN SOLDIER REALIZES HIS COUNTRY DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT HIM
Iraq is returning to unparalleled bloody violence again , The Surge is collapsing , American soldiers are dying , but American dumbfuck sheep only care about a governor who had good sex .
In fact , Americans are getting even more stupid and ignorant , if such a thing is possible , according to a Pew Research Center
A scant three percent of news stories in February were devoted to the Iraq war , compared with around 15 percent in July last year , and the US public has not perceived the war , which began nearly five years ago , as a top news story since October , the report noted .
Meanwhile , 28 percent of 1,003 adults polled last month for Pew correctly estimated the number of US military fatalities in Iraq at around 4,000 , compared with 54 percent who got the figure right seven months ago , the report said .
More than one - third -- 35 percent -- estimated that 3,000 had been killed , 11 percent put the toll at 2,000 deaths , and just under a quarter said the number of fatalities was closer to 5,000 .
The Department of Defense confirmed the deaths of 3,974 US military personnel in Iraq as of Monday , according to Pew .
You fucking idiot Americans do n't even know how many of your soldiers die because you do n't give a fuck about them , you evil selfish ignorant pigs !
You do not know where France is on the map , you do not know what a foreign country even is , that much is given .
But you are bored with your own defeat ?
And you only want to burn some guy who had sex with a prostitute ?
You people are just psychotic sick dumbfucks .
Naturally you Americans think that fewer Americans are dying than reality .
For you , reality is always terrible , so you always put on rose - tinted glasses .
But how is it you were smarter 7 months ago than today ?
That , my dear readers , is what I mean by " American entropy " -- you believe like religious freaks you are that the war is going better than it really is , because America has its head buried deep into George Retard Bush 's sand - filled asshole !

RECALLS
At smart , your safety is our number one priority .
At any time , you can check to see if there are recalls on your vehicle , and find the proper steps to have the issue resolved .
Given Senator John McCain ’s signature stance on campaign finance reform , it was not surprising that he backed legislation last year requiring presidential candidates to pay the actual cost of flying on corporate jets .
The law , which requires campaigns to pay charter rates when using such jets rather than cheaper first - class fares , was intended to reduce the influence of lobbyists and create a level financial playing field .
But over a seven - month period beginning last summer , Mr. McCain ’s cash - short campaign gave itself an advantage by using a corporate jet owned by a company headed by his wife , Cindy McCain , according to public records .
For five of those months , the plane was used almost exclusively for campaign - related purposes , those records show .
Mr. McCain ’s campaign paid a total of $ 241,149 for the use of that plane from last August through February , records show .
That amount is approximately the cost of chartering a similar jet for a month or two , according to industry estimates .
The senator was able to fly so inexpensively because the law specifically exempts aircraft owned by a candidate or his family or by a privately held company they control .
The Federal Election Commission adopted rules in December to close the loophole  rules that would have required substantial payments by candidates using family - owned planes  but the agency soon lost the requisite number of commissioners needed to complete the rule making .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ’s positive rating has dropped to a new low of 37 percent in an NBC / Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) listens to her introduction at a campaign fundraiser at Constitution Hall in Washington , March 26 , 2008 .

According to the poll , the New York senator ’s positive rating slid 8 percentage points in two weeks and she had a negative rating of 48 percent in a week where she admitted making a mistake in claiming she had come under sniper fire during a 1996 trip to Bosnia .
Clinton ’s Democratic rival , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , also saw a slight dip in his positive rating , to 49 percent from 51 percent , the poll found .
Clinton , who would be the first female U.S. president , and Obama , who would be the first black president , are in a heated battle for the Democratic nomination to face presumptive Republican nominee John McCain in November ’s election .
The survey was taken after Obama gave a speech last week on race in America and rejected racially charged remarks by his pastor in Chicago of two decades , Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
NBC said 32 percent of respondents said Obama “ sufficiently addressed the issue ” and 26 percent said he needed to say more about the Wright controversy .
More than half of those surveyed -- 55 percent -- said they were “ disturbed ” by the videos of Wright that were widely circulated on television and the Internet , the poll found .
In head - to - head matchups , Obama and Clinton were even at 45 percent .
In general election matchups , Obama led McCain by 44 percent to 42 percent and McCain led Clinton by 46 percent to 44 percent .
When asked which candidate could unite the country if elected , 60 percent said Obama , 58 percent said McCain and 46 percent said Clinton .
The poll of 700 registered voters was conducted on Monday and Tuesday and had a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points .
NBC said its pollsters oversampled African - Americans to get a more reliable cross tabulation on questions regarding Obama ’s speech on race .
Wireless technology may be on its way to becoming ubiquitous in developed countries , but there 's a tremendous difference between having a WiFi connection on every corner and having a ( reasonably ) secure WiFi connection on every corner .
All of the modern wireless standards have their own security implementations , but the degree to which these standards are active and available can vary widely from hotspot to hotspot .
If a recent report from Codenomicon is correct , simply activating the appropriate security protocols is n't nearly enough — the company has produced a report ( PDF ) claiming that a large number of supposedly secure devices can be hacked thanks to flaws in their security implementations .
Even if security standards are correctly implemented , the inherent complexity of a given software stack can open a device to potential hackers .
Before I dig into the report itself , it 's important to note that Codenomicon is not a neutral research firm in the field of wireless security technology .
The company develops and produces a comprehensive security evaluation program called DEFENSICS .
The report 's test results were reached via the use of this tool and the company praises DEFENSICS at several points within the body of the paper .
While this does introduce the possibility of bias , the fact that the company produces security tools does not , ipso facto , disqualify it from using its own tools to document accurate wireless security test results .
Codenomicon 's tests focused on " fuzzing " the relevant wireless devices , with the goal of determining their level of robustness .
According to the paper , fuzzing is defined as " the systematic creation of a very large number of protocol messages , from thousands to several million test cases , containing exceptional elements simulating malicious attacks . "
According to the company , a large number of the security vulnerabilities that are reported are robustness failures .
Given this , robustness testing is paramount , and Codenomicon just happens to have the perfect tool for doing so — its own DEFENSICS software suite .
If the results are indicative of what other software suites would indicate , a number of vendors have shipped devices that can be fuzzed with relative ease , as illustrated in the tables below .
Table 1 gives results for the 31 Bluetooth devices that were tested , while Table 2 gives results for 7 wireless access points ( AP1 - AP7 across the top column of the table ) .

Codenomicon does n't provide any information on the specific devices tested , but the trend is not encouraging .
According to the company , one reason for the high number of security flaws in the various Bluetooth and WiFi products tested is the software stack complexity of both standards .
Although WiMAX devices are n't readily available at this point , Codenomicon implies that the same sorts of robustness and implementation flaws are likely to appear in devices based on the new standard as well .
Unsurprisingly , given that this is a paper written about their own product , Codenomicon discovers that it's a really good idea to test software robustness with a product specifically designed for that purpose before releasing it .

Saying " no " used to not be an option for me .
If a girl wanted to be with me , she was , as soon as she expressed an interest .
This was due to a need to have companionship in my life .
I went out with three or four girls in the past whom I really wanted to tell " no , " just because the desire in me to have someone to talk to was so great .
There were three or four girls whom I asked out just because I knew I could get with these girls , not because they were attractive or the kind of person I wanted to be with .
I met a girl in July of 2000 .
She was so perfect for me in hundreds of ways , but was completely wrong for me in one or two ways .
Later in July , she left for college .
She wanted to have an open relationship while she was in college , where she could date others , but I could not handle the idea because she meant so much to me .
I wanted her all to myself .
We agreed , after many very stressful discussions , to only see each other .
In December of 2000 , this girl became friends again with an ex of hers , but their relationship became much more than friends , based on conventional definitions .
They were never physically intimate , but they were emotionally and mentally intimate on a few levels .
I could not stand for this , and I broke up with this girl .
She wanted to get back together .
I could not say no .
We got back together with the contingency that she would never talk to this guy again .
She dumped me a few days later .
After a few days of time for her to find some things out for herself , she wanted to get back together .
I said no , as hard as it was , for a little under a week .
After this time , we got back together because she gave me many great things , things that I needed , things I could not say no to .
At this point I should have known that she was not the right girl for me , based on her beliefs about being intimate with others , but I could not see this .
All I could see were the times that she made me feel good .
It was like selling your soul to the devil for a new car , knowing the devil will make good on the deal in 2 weeks , and come back to make your life a living hell .
All I could see was the car ; I ignored the " life a living hell " part .
Note : I am NOT calling this girl a devil , she is a wonderful person , just not right for me .
About April , this girl became depressed .
We argued about the causes for some time , always trying small things to make the depression better .
It never worked .
In June , I moved a state away to attend college , and she dumped me for good .
After suffering my own depression because of the break - up , I turned to writing to understand some things in my head .
One of my conclusions was that by not saying no to her in December , when I should have known she was not right for me , I ruined her life for a period of time , and made mine horribly stressful at times .
Through writing and learning lessons from these events , I learned to say no , because I can now see the consequences of saying yes at inopportune times .
To anyone whom cannot say no , you need to learn to , and damn fast .
I could n't say no due to an emotional need to be with someone .
I worked through that , and am now happy on my own .
You need to work through whatever is causing you to not be able to say no , weither it is not being able to say no to sex , relationships , or seconds of ice cream .
I caused a person to come close to suicide because I could not say no .
As a human living in a free or semi - free society , it is your responsibility to make good choices .
If you cannot say no , your life will be hell like mine was for a period of time .
The real pisser is that you will not know it is hell until you work through the reason you can't say no .
Once that happens , you can take a step back and see how stupid you have been , and how you have hurt yourself and possibly others .

The Alphanum Algorithm
People sort strings with numbers differently than software does .
Most sorting algorithms compare ASCII values , which produces an ordering that is inconsistent with human logic .
Here 's how to fix it .
Download the algorithm Java : AlphanumComparator.java C# : AlphanumComparator.cs C++ : alphanum.cpp C++ , not Windows dependent : alphanum.hpp JavaScript : alphanum.js Perl : alphanum.pl Python : alphanum.py Python 2.4+ : alphanum.py_v2.4 Ruby : alphanum.rb Other : OCaml , Lua , Groovy PHP : Just use sort ( &array , SORT_STRING ) ; License : MIT License -
Free to use and distribute Special thanks to everyone who contributed fixes or new code !
Use at your own risk ...
I can personally vouch only for the Java version
The Problem
Look at most sorted list of filenames , product names , or any other text that contains alphanumeric characters - both letters and numbers .
Traditional sorting algorithms use ASCII comparisons to sort these items , which means the end - user sees an unfortunately ordered list that does not consider the numeric values within the strings .
For example , in a sorted list of files , " z100.html " is sorted before " z2.html " .
But obviously , 2 comes before 100 !
Sorting algorithms should sort alphanumeric strings in the order that users would expect , especially as software becomes increasingly used by nontechnical people .
Besides , it 's the 21st Century ; software engineers can do better than this .
The Solution
I created the Alphanum Algorithm to solve this problem .
The Alphanum Algorithm sorts strings containing a mix of letters and numbers .
Given strings of mixed characters and numbers , it sorts the numbers in value order , while sorting the non-numbers in ASCII order .
The end result is a natural sorting order .
Here 's a list of sample filenames to illustrate the difference between sorting with the Alphanum algorithm and traditional ASCII sort .
On the left is what you live with on a daily basis .
On the right is what you could have , if more developers were motivated to sort lists as people would expect .
Which list makes more sense to you ?
Which would be more comfortable to you as you 're using an application ?

How does it work ?
The algorithm breaks strings into chunks , where a chunk contains either all alphabetic characters , or all numeric characters .
These chunks are then compared against each other .
If both chunks contain numbers , a numerical comparison is used .
If either chunk contains characters , the ASCII comparison is used .
There is currently a glitch when it comes to periods / decimal points - specifically , periods are treated only as strings , not as decimal points .
The solution to this glitch is to recognize a period surrounded by digits as a decimal point , and continue creating a numeric chunck that includes the decimal point .
If a letter exists on either side of the period , or if the period is the first or last character in the string , it should be viewed as an actual period and included in an alphabetic chunk .
While I have recently figured this out in theory , I have not yet implemented it into the algorithms .
To be truly international , the solution should n't just consider periods , but should consider whatever decimal separator is used in the current language .
Currently , the algorithm is n't designed to work with negative signs or numbers expressed in scientific notation , like " 5*10e - 2 " .
In this case , there are 5 chunks : 5 , * , 10 , e- , and 2 .
The latest version of some of the code ( particularly the Java version ) compares numbers one at a time if those numbers are in chunks of the same size .
For example , when comparing abc123 to abc184 , 123 and 184 are the same size , so their values are compared digit - by - digit : 1=1 , 2 < 8 .
This was done to solve the problem of numeric chunks that are too large to fit in range of values allowed by the programming language for a particular datatype : in Java , an int is limited to 2147483647 .
The problem with this approach is does n't properly handle numbers that have leading zeros .
For example , 0001 is seem as larger than 1 because it 's the longer number .
A version that does not compare leading zeros is forthcoming .
Conclusion
Software development has matured beyond the point where simply sorting strings by their ASCII value is acceptable .
It is my hope that the Alphanum Algorithm becomes adopted by all developers so we can work together to create software applications that make sense to users .
Feel free to download and share the algorithm , place it in your program free of charge , and help spread the word .
Epilogue : Let 's see another example !
Here 's an example using fictitious product names .
Imagine you 're developing an application for a customer , and you need to instill a sense of confidence and professionalism in your product line .
Which sorted list would you most associate with those feelings ?

Exploding lithium - ion batteries in laptop computers captured the headlines in 2006 , but so far the big splash in 2007 appears to be lithium - ion batteries for electric cars .
You can thank General Motors Corp. for that .
Despite the fact that dozens of companies have for years been increasing the power punch , longevity and safety of lithium - ion technology , it was n't until the world 's largest carmaker launched its
Volt plug - in hybrid prototype earlier this month that Detroit got high on lithium .
At the same time , GM said it would partner up on two separate lithium - ion battery initiatives .
One partnership is with Johnson Controls and Saft Advanced Power Solutions , while the other is with Cobasys and A123Systems .
Both groups are specialists in battery and power systems , and both are competing with each other to win GM 's affections .
GM has called lithium - ion research a " priority program " if plug - in hybrid vehicles – that is , hybrid - electric cars that can be charged via a standard power outlet and drive 30 kilometres or so on electricity alone – are to become a commercial , mass - market reality .
The fact that GM has embraced the plug - in hybrid concept , when only a year ago it more or less ignored the idea , has energized a new generation of battery innovators and , perhaps prematurely , crowned lithium - ion technology as the winning approach .
A recent story by USA Today referred to these companies as " the new rock stars of the auto industry " that are taking an unsexy product and " revolutionizing the way that vehicles work . "
According to the article , " many see the holy grail as the lithium - ion battery . "
Last Thursday , Massachusetts - based A123Systems announced it had snagged $ 40 million ( U.S. ) more in private financing , bringing its total equity haul to $ 102 million .
Not bad for an unsexy start - up .
The excitement around new battery technology is understandable , given that energy storage is one of the biggest bottlenecks of innovation facing the planet .
What 's not as justified is the fixation on lithium - ion batteries .
Just ask William Tahil , research director with Meridian International Research , a technology consultancy based in France .
Tahil recently authored a paper titled , " The Trouble With Lithium , " in which he concludes that the rapid embrace of lithium - ion batteries is misguided and bound to backfire .
One big reason : there 's simply not enough lithium available in the Earth 's crust to stick a lithium - ion battery in the world 's 900 million cars , and at the same time expect the auto market to grow .
It 's just not sustainable .
" Analysis shows that a world dependent on lithium for its vehicles could soon face even tighter resource constraints than we face today with oil , " wrote Tahil , pointing out that lithium - rich South America would become the new Middle East .
" Concentration of supply would create new geopolitical tensions , not reduce them . "
The biggest source of lithium – either as a carbonate or chloride – is the limited number of salt pans and salt lake deposits around the world , mostly in countries such as Chile and Argentina .
The last and biggest untapped reserve of lithium salt , according to Tahil , is in the Bolivia salt pans .
" Bolivia is said to contain lithium reserves of 5.4 million tonnes or nearly 50 per cent of the global lithium metal reserve base , and an even higher percentage of the lithium salt reserves , " he writes .
And while attempts have been made to get at these reserves , " The current political situation in the country is acting as a strong disincentive for western mining companies to operate there . "
To put the situation into perspective , consider that to make 60 million plug - in hybrid vehicles a year containing a small lithium - ion battery would require 420,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate – or six times the current global production annually .
But in reality , you 'd want a decent - sized battery , so it 's more likely you 'd have to increase global production 10 - fold .
And this excludes the demand for lithium in portable electronics .
So the automakers and electric - vehicle enthusiasts have to ask themselves whether the focus on lithium - ion technology is a jump from the frying pan into the fire ; from peak oil to peak lithium .
Tahil believes so , and suggests that the industry should focus more on battery technologies based on more common metals , such as nickel or zinc .
This would include sodium nickel chloride or " Zebra " batteries and zinc air batteries .
What 's interesting is that a business group in Ontario is trying to draw attention to Zebra batteries in North America , and have explored the possibility of licensing the technology and setting up volume manufacturing in Canada .
Zebra batteries are safe to operate , tolerate the extreme cold and heat very well , and have a relatively quick charge rate .
The nickel and other materials in the battery are recyclable and inexpensive relative to most competing technologies .
The battery almost had a chance to shine in the United States .
It was going to be used in the Mercedes A Class in 1998 for the California market but the plans were scrapped after Daimler - Benz AG merged with Chrysler Corp .

" The Zebra has been used here in Europe but has never been able to break into the U.S. market , " Tahil wrote me in an email .
And even in Europe , supplies are limited .
Swiss company MES - DEA SA owns the technology and its manufacturing plant produces only 2,000 Zebra batteries a year – hardly the kind of volume required to bring down the price .
Back in July , I wrote about how Acton - based electric utility Halton Hills Hydro is testing out a Zebra system to store grid electricity during periods of low demand and discharge it during peak times .
The idea was to demonstrate and draw attention to the technology .
But its larger vision , through its subsidiary SouthWestern Energy Inc. , is to build a Zebra battery manufacturing facility in Ontario within the next five years .
The objective would be to produce the batteries in high enough volume to dramatically bring down the cost and make them affordable and available for hybrid and plug - in hybrid vehicles .
Unfortunately , finding the $ 117 million to make it happen has n't worked out so well – at least so far .
Tahil says it 's simple lack of awareness and the belief among investors that lithium - ion is where to place the biggest bets .
" It seems people do not understand the potential , " he says .
And that 's a shame .
The Zebra battery could be a dark horse in the energy storage race , if the United States could see past the white stripes .
" For manufacturing on the scale of the automobile industry , we need access to an abundant resource , over which there will be no possible supply constraints or price volatility , " continues Tahil .
" The world 's ecosystems are already overexploited .
To cause further damage to unique and irreplaceable habitats for an insufficient resource when nickel and zinc are already available in our industrial infrastructure would be irresponsible . "

At last fall 's groundbreaking ceremony for North Dakota 's 7,300 - square - foot crime laboratory , state Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said space at the existing facility was so " desperately " short , some staffers had resorted to " cutting mouse pads in half to make them fit . "
When the $ 5.3 million Bismarck facility is completed in October , the spacious quarters will easily accommodate the current staff , who soon will be asked to process and maintain an increasing amount of DNA .
A rapid expansion of DNA sampling is corresponding with a building and hiring boom in North Dakota and other states to accommodate the collection of hundreds of thousands of new genetic profiles .
Five states are slated to begin new sampling of suspects arrested for felony offenses between July and January 2009 .
Of those , North Dakota , California , Maryland and Kansas are spending millions of dollars to prepare for the additional testing .
South Dakota , which will begin additional sampling in July , built a new lab in 2006 .
" It 's a race against the clock , " says Kristen Mahoney , executive director of Maryland 's Office of Crime Control and Prevention .
Maryland officials plan to spend about $ 1.7 million to hire more scientists and fund other start - up costs to help process 31,000 new profiles it expects to add in 2009 , the first year of its expanded sampling program .
During that first year , the state will contract the additional work to an outside agency until it completes its hiring of analysts , Mahoney said .
After the first year , all of the extra work is expected to be performed at the state laboratory .
In California , a $ 10 million laboratory expansion is scheduled for completion next month to house an estimated 1 million new DNA samples .
Gareth Lacy , a spokesman for the state attorney general 's office , says state law requires anyone arrested for a felony to provide genetic material starting in January .
At least 21 other states are considering various proposals to expand sampling to include felony suspects , according to DNAResource.com , which tracks DNA - related laws .
Critics of increasing sampling
The expanded sampling , once limited to convicted felons and sex offenders , has raised questions among civil liberties advocates about the potential for privacy incursions and whether states can handle the increased sampling load .
" I wonder if the states have the resources and the ability to do this , " says Jesselyn McCurdy , legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union .
" This is a criminal database initially reserved for people convicted of crimes . "
The DNA samples , which contain an individual 's unique genetic code , are compared against nearly 4 million genetic profiles gleaned from crime scenes and other sources as part of a databank run by the FBI to help investigate crimes .
The FBI says the system has aided more than 40,000 investigations since 1990 .
As thousands of new samples begin streaming into the system , additional analysts often are required to identify the genetic profiles and upload them to the FBI 's national databank .
Provisions in most of the new laws call for destroying samples if suspects are acquitted or charges are dropped .
The responsibility for disposal also falls to the forensic laboratories .
Laboratory officials say funding has not always kept pace with the expanding workload .
" It is difficult to obtain funding to cover both the large numbers of the new cases that are being presented to our labs daily and the backlog of cases from the past that require timely review , " Peter Marone , chairman of the Consortium of Forensic Science Organizations , told a House committee last week .
Marone , who also is director of Virginia 's Department of Forensic Science , said Virginia expanded its sampling in 2003 from convicted felons to include suspects arrested , but not tried , for seven felony offenses .
Virginia lawmakers had prepared for the increased workload , Marone said , which adds about 4,000 samples a year to the database .
If the state required sampling for all felony suspects , as is planned elsewhere , he added , " I do n't think we could do it . …
It sounds really good , but you have to know what you are getting into . "
New federal rules
Last week , the federal government issued new rules for taking DNA samples from anyone arrested for a federal crime , including suspected immigration violators .
The federal sampling program , which will take effect after a 30 - day public comment period , is expected to add about 1 million new profiles when it is implemented , according to Justice Department estimates .
The FBI provided an additional $ 2 million this year to accommodate the increased workload .
In fiscal year 2009 , which begins Oct. 1 , the FBI has requested $ 20 million more and 36 new positions to assist with the work .
In preparation for the start of its expanded sampling program in July , Kansas officials moved into an enlarged lab space two weeks ago , lab director Mike VanStratton said .
The physical renovations cost about $ 375,000 , and the tab does n't include the five additional analysts , two technicians and equipment needed to process an estimated 20,000 new samples in the first year of the expanded program .
" Our Legislature was well aware of the costs associated with taking on this type of evidence , " VanStratton said .
Enlarge By Rob Carr , AP Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley gestures on Jan. 10 during a news conference where he discussed how he wants to expand the use of DNA samples to fight crime .
The news conference took place at the Maryland State Police forensic science laboratory in Pikesville .

If you 're looking for a story that shows the abysmal state of health care in America , look no further .
60 Minutes traveled to Knoxville , TN to film a free clinic set up by a charity group called Remote Area Medical Volunteer Corps , or RAM .
The charity was initially started in the 90's by it 's founder , Stan Brock , former co-star of Wild Kingdom , to give health care relief to remote areas of Latin America , but after watching this segment it 's clear that America 's health care system does n't look too much different than that of a third world country .
Brock has no family , takes no salary and has no home .
He is completely dedicated to RAM , as are the doctors and nurses who volunteer their time and expertise .
The local response to this RAM clinic in Knoxville was amazing , yet profoundly saddening .
Hundreds of people showed up for the clinic , many drove hours to get there and waited up to seven hours just to get a spot in line to be seen -- and ultimately , hundreds had to be turned away .
These were not Cadillac driving welfare queens , they were average , working Americans who are under insured or have no insurance at all .
The most disheartening part of it all is to see how many of these people had avoided seeking medical treatment for years because they could n't afford it and are now reduced to begging for help .
It 's a microcosm of our medical system and it's a damn ugly sight in the world 's wealthiest nation .

My friends and I often share tips on how we save money , and praise one another for getting good deals on everything from happy hour specials and dinners , to clothing and rental cars .
Of course , some deals are n’t hard to find – they ’re just simple ways to save every day .
Certainly , the money you save on your home energy bill may not be something you brag about over brunch with friends , but it still puts money back in your pocket .
To get started saving on all your day - to - day costs , take a look at this checklist of 31 money - saving suggestions – one for every day of the month .
Easy Ways to Be Frugal and Save Money
1. Buy and Install a Programmable Thermostat
While you ’re at work , program your thermostat to either turn off completely or adjust to a warmer or cooler temperature , depending on the time of year .
Some thermostats can be controlled remotely , so even if you forget to program your desired temperature before you leave the house , you can adjust it using an app with the touch of a button .
According to Fixr , the average cost for a programmable thermostat is $ 200 to $ 300 , and professional installation is required , which ranges from $ 300 to $ 350 , per Homewyse .
The average savings per year vary , as you control the adjustments you make , but savings in winter and summer could easily exceed $ 1,000 if you use your thermostat wisely .
For example , when you leave the house in the summer , instead of setting the thermostat at 70 degrees so you can come home to a cool house , you can set it at 80 degrees and program your A/C to cool the house down starting at 5 pm , right before you get home from work .
Instead of heating or cooling an empty house all day , your thermostat only runs when someone ’s home .
If you ’re not sure where to start when shopping for thermostats , start with a Nest Learning Thermostat .
It will adjust it ’s settings based on your habits .
This helps maximize your energy costs .
If you need it installed , Handy.com will help you find a qualified electrician in your area .
I have hired several contractors and had a great experience each time .
2. Use Coupons Wisely
Although couponing can be a great strategy to save money , be certain you ’re not overspending on unnecessary items just because you may be able to save a few dollars .
For example , if you use a coupon to purchase a bulk pack of deodorant that ’s a brand you ’ve never tried , you may be stuck with a product that ’s going to go to waste if you do n’t like it .
Clip coupons only for items that you consume on a regular basis .
With the average face value of coupons around $ 1.56 according to Inmar , your weekly and monthly savings could add up quickly if you coupon frequently .
For help finding deals at your favorite local stores , restaurants , and gas stations , check out The Coupons App , and for saving printed coupons to your phone , check out SnipSnap .
And Target shoppers may want to check out Cartwheel , an app that lets you scan the barcodes of items that you want to be notified of when discounts or special offers are available .
3. Avoid Speeding Tickets
Seriously , slow down .
The next time you have somewhere to be at a specific time , set your alarm for 15 minutes earlier than you would ordinarily .
Not only do you stand to save money by driving the speed limit , you might also save your life – or someone else’s .
In addition to the cost of the speeding ticket , which can be $ 250 or more in some states , you also have to worry about your insurance rates going up .
Depending on your car insurance plan and how many other tickets you ’ve gotten , you could get flagged as a “ reckless ” or “ unsafe ” driver and end up with higher monthly premiums for years to come .
4. Negotiate Lower Interest Rates on Your Credit Cards
If you ’ve been a loyal customer over the years , your credit card company may be willing to lower your interest rates .
There ’s no official process for requesting a lower rate – just call up and ask what can be done .
If you ’ve paid on time over the years , or if you threaten to transfer your balance over to another credit card company , your current issuer may be quick to work with you .
If they are unwilling to budge on the rate , consider a new low APR credit card instead .
5. Check Your Cell Phone Plan to Make Sure It Matches Your Use
Are you paying for unlimited data when you really do n’t need it ?
Conversely , are you running over on your plan , resulting in fees or gigabytes that are higher - priced than if you purchased them at the beginning of the month ?
For many families , text messages are one area where overspending frequently happens , especially when you share your plan with a spouse or child and everyone ’s texting habits vary from month - to - month .
If your plan is with AT&T , you can add unlimited texting to a family plan for $ 30 a month , or to an individual plan for $ 20 a month .
If your carrier is Verizon , then you can get a 500 - text - per - month bundle for $ 10 per month , per line , or a $ 5,000 text bundle for $ 20 per month , per line .
Both packages include unlimited texting to any Verizon number .
Alternatively , you could look at switching your cell phone provider altogether .
Mint Mobile has plans starting at just $ 15 per month and you can even use your current phone .
No need to purchase a brand new phone .
6. Plan Your Dinners for the Week
Whenever you go grocery shopping , do n’t just throw a bunch of random items you like into your cart .
Instead , carefully plan your dinners for the week , and make a list .
For help with affordable meal planning that includes a detailed list of necessary ingredients and instructions for preparation , check out the Budget Dinners app .
If you ’re in a rush , the ingredients listed on the app can function as your list .
Without a list , you could forget a key ingredient for a dish , and then you may find yourself calling and ordering a pizza or expensive take - out rather than eating at home .
If you do n’t have time to swing by the grocery store , check out the app Supercook that allows you to type in which ingredients you have on hand and be matched with recipes that are perfect for what ’s already in your pantry .
Not only do meals prepared at home cost less , they often have less fat and fewer calories than the dishes available at restaurants .
Do n’t forget about meal delivery services like HelloFresh .
You can have all the ingredients shipped to your door .
7. Prepare Lunch the Night Before
If you ’re like me , you typically do n’t have much time in the mornings to make lunch – especially if you hit the snooze button a few times or have kids to get ready .
Instead of making lunch prep a harried part of your morning rush , prepare a brown bag lunch at night and place it in the refrigerator until the next day .
Not only does this save valuable time , it may also prevent you from eating out for lunch quite as frequently .
8. Cut the Cable Cord in Favor of Streaming Sites and Redbox
Do you still pay for cable every month ?
If you have n’t already cut the cord , it ’s time .
You can get a Roku or Apple TV for an upfront cost of between $ 25 and $ 70 , depending on the model you choose .
These devices can be used to stream countless movies and TV shows from various providers such as Netflix ( $ 7.99 per month ) , Hulu ( as low as $ 8 per month ) , and Amazon Instant ( movies and TV shows are charged a la carte , but for $ 99 per year an Amazon Prime membership includes access to a lot of content ) .
If you like renting new release movies on demand , check out a Redbox vending machine near you instead .
Rentals are $ 1 per night , and many Walgreens pharmacies and McDonalds have machines available .
Redbox machines may also offer video games – check out the location nearest you to find out what ’s on offer .
If you prefer live TV or still want a way to access the nightly news , there are plenty of ways to do it without installing cumbersome “ bunny ears ” on top of your TV set .
Many slim - profile indoor antennas allow you to pick up all local news and TV stations , and range in price from $ 10 to $ 150 , depending on range .
The only thing to watch out for is the impact your geographical area may have on reception .
If you live in a city surrounded by tall towers or in a valley with mountains on all sides , chances are your reception may be lacking .
Another option for keeping your favorite cable channels is Sling TV .
Prices start at just $ 20 per month and you can get many of the same channels you get with high priced cable companies .
9. Dump the Gym Membership
How often are you really going to the gym every month ?
If you ’re there at least twice a week , then you ’re probably getting your money ’s worth .
However , if you only attend sporadically , you can get the same workout in by jogging around the neighborhood , riding a bike , or doing a workout video from the comfort of your living room .
It ’s important to stay healthy and active , but you do n’t have to overextend your personal budget to make it happen .
You may be able to stay fit while also making friends with people in your neighborhood by checking out running clubs or other groups that meet up during the week for exercise .
Check out Facebook or Craigslist to find meet - ups in your area .
Some of the more popular groups usually include running , tennis , softball , walking , or aerobics .
You could also look into fitness apps like Aaptiv .
Members have access to over 2,500 different fitness classes with prices starting at just under $ 9 per month .
10 . Replace the Windows in Your House
If you have an older house , your windows may have lost their seal over time , and air could be escaping through hidden gaps and cracks .
How much of your air - conditioned air is escaping during the summer , and how much of your heated air is escaping during the winter ?
Certainly , the initial outlay of cash to replace the windows is n’t be a fun expense – according to HouseLogic , estimates weigh in at $ 120 to $ 800 per installed window – you stand to save thousands of dollars on your energy bills .
For example , when you install ENERGY STAR - qualified doors and windows , you stand to save as much as $ 465 per year on heating and cooling costs .
11 . Increase Your Car Insurance Deductibles
No , it ’s not a good idea to get rid of your car insurance , but it is a good idea to increase your deductibles if you ’re a safe driver .
For example , you may be paying $ 100 per month for car insurance , but you have a $ 250 deductible to pay in the event of an accident .
If you were to increase your deductible to $ 1,000 , you might be able to bring your monthly payments down to $ 60 or $ 70 per month .
If you are n’t certain what your deductible is , call your insurance provider and ask , and find out how you can reduce your monthly burden .
It might also be worth the time to shop around and see if there are car insurance companies that have lower monthly premiums .
I recently switched to Liberty Mutual and saved a nice amount every six months .
12 . Wash Your Car Yourself
If you have soap , a bucket , and some old rags , there ’s no reason you ca n’t wash your car yourself .
Yes , going through a car wash may be quicker and easier , but a good wash and wax can be expensive , and mechanical car washes often miss hard - to - get dirty spots that a hand wash could fix in no time .
A thorough car wash and wax , plus interior detailing , can cost up to $ 200 , so those savings can add up very quickly .
13 . Have a Friend or Loved One Cut Your Hair
If you ’re just looking for a trim , there ’s no reason your spouse , parent , or friend ca n’t give you a quick cut .
People with short hair can get thousands of hair cuts out of a decent set of $ 20 clippers , and those with long hair or those who do n’t want to use clippers can enjoy countless cuts with a pair of scissors .
If you ’re looking for a designer cut with layers , precisely shaved sides , or intricate bangs , a quickie haircut might not be right for you – but for all the in - between trims , there ’s absolutely no need to head to a salon .
With salon cuts ranging in price from $ 20 to $ 200 at some salons , the savings over the course of a year certainly add up .
14 . Wear Your Clothes More Than Once Before Washing or Dry Cleaning
Do you wear undershirts under your dress shirts ?
How about hanging your dress pants up after each wearing ?
There are many steps you can take to ensure your clothes stay looking ( and smelling ) nice for several uses .
Not only do you save money on dry cleaning by getting multiple days out of your clothing , you also reduce wear and tear on your clothing that comes from repeated cleanings , keeping your wardrobe looking nice for longer .
The money you save on dry cleaning bills and detergent may be almost as exciting as the fact that your dark colors look sharp long after they would have ordinarily faded .
15 . Pay Bills and Credit Cards on Time
How many times have you been just a few hours late on a credit card payment and kissed $ 40 goodbye ?
Even if you stay on top of your bills most of the time , even just three late payments a year can cost more than $ 100 – and that ’s money your budget likely needs elsewhere .
If the immediate hit of late fees is n’t enough of a deterrent for you , then consider your credit score .
If you ’re frequently late on payments or later than 90 days on any one payment , your credit score takes a hit .
Negative reports can damage your credit for up to seven years and can make it more difficult to buy a home or purchase a car .
Do n’t let your missed payments cost you a meaningful investment later in life .
16 . Share a Meal When You ’re Out to Eat
Take a look at the average portion size that some restaurants serve as entrees .
When paired with an appetizer , it ’s often impossible for me to finish what I ordered , and leftovers do n’t always get eaten , even when I have the best of intentions .
It ’s no secret that our society is overweight , so why not help your body and your wallet the next time you ’re out by sharing a meal with your companion ?
17 . Eat Before You Go to the Movies
The concession stand calls to even the most diet - conscious of us .
The smell of hot buttered popcorn and the colorful boxes of candy are sometimes too tempting to pass up .
However , not only is movie theater food unhealthy , it ’s also incredibly expensive .
The next time you ’re headed to the theater , eat a filling meal before show time , and you ’re more likely to pass the concession stand without dropping $ 30 on sugar and fat .
18 . Buy Warrantied Items With a Credit Card
Before you buy a warrantied item like an iPhone , a TV , or an Xbox , check your wallet .
Your credit card may offer an extension of the manufacturer ’s warranty on items you purchase with the card .
All American Express cards offer extended warranties of up to one additional year on warranties of five years or less , and MasterCard offers the same extension to its Platinum , Gold , and World cardmembers .
Just remember to keep both your store receipt and the warranty when you shop with your card .
Also , note that no warranty protects you against a lost item , so if your concern is losing a valuable item or having it stolen , then an insurance policy is the way to go .
19 . Transfer Your Banking Business to a Free Checking Account
Does your checking account charge maintenance and annual fees ?
If so , it ’s time to make a switch .
Banks including Chime , Simple.com , Capital One , Ally Bank , and Charles Schwab are online - only and offer completely free checking accounts , regardless of monthly balance carried or direct deposit activity .
Other banks including Chase , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , and Citibank have physical branches and offer free checking as long as you have a monthly direct deposit of at least $ 1,500 .
There ’s no reason you should be paying maintenance and annual fees for a checking account .
20 . Buy Electronics and Computer Peripherals Online
There ’s no need to pay full retail price on your electronics or other items , such as cables and charging devices .
Rather than snapping these items up at big box electronic stores or Amazon , check out TigerDirect , Rakuten.com , or Newegg .
These sites are always running deals for computer accessories and other electronics .
Also , check out a deal aggregator , such as Ben ’s Bargains .
21 . Check Craigslist for Used Furniture , Cars , and Electronics
Craigslist users sell everything from clothing and furniture , to bicycles and cars , and often the deals are equivalent to ( or better than ) what you ’d find at a thrift store .
In some cases , people may be in a pinch to move out of an apartment or home , and they may offer furniture free of charge to whoever is able to swing by and pick it up .
Whenever you meet with someone to make a purchase , make sure you meet in a public place , in the daytime , or if you have to go to someone ’s home , always take a friend or family member with you .
22 . Buy Clothes at Consignment or Thrift Stores
If you ever shop at a consignment or thrift store , then you know they can be treasure troves of quality , affordable goods and clothing .
If you do n’t already know of stores in your neighborhood , a quick Internet search can show you what ’s available .
While chains such as Plato ’s Closet , Salvation Army , and Goodwill are great options , do n’t be afraid to check out smaller shops run by churches or other charities , or online options including eBay , Swap.com and thredUP , which all offer used clothing at a steep discount .
You never know what you might find .
23 . Get Creative With Your Recreational Activities
How many times have you gone out for a movie and a meal , only to come home $ 100 poorer , wondering why you went out in the first place ?
Instead of spending money for traditional entertainment options , try something out of the ordinary – and free .
Check out a local park , take a hike , ride a bike , or attend a free art show or exhibition .
Sometimes the most memorable forms of entertainment do n’t cost a dime .
If you ’re unsure where to start , check out Facebook , Eventbrite , or your local paper to find events near you .
24 . Buy Motion - Sensor Exterior Lights
If you ordinarily keep the lights on outside your home at night , look into a motion - activated light instead of one that stays on around the clock .
Not only does this save energy , a light flickering on when someone walks past can serve as a great security measure as well .
Incandescent flood lights cost around $ 35 per year when they ’re kept on all night , but only around $ 2 per year when a motion sensor is installed .
Prices for motion - activated lights start at around $ 9 at Home Depot , and you can install them yourself with a little electrical knowledge .
25 . Do n’t Play the Lottery
When the Powerball runs into the billions of dollars , it ’s incredibly tempting to buy a ticket and hope for a windfall .
While technically , yes , there is a chance you could win , Bay News 9 reports that your chances are much greater of being struck by lightning or getting hit by an asteroid .
Instead of throwing cash away on the lottery , invest what you would have spent into a retirement account that may really pay off one day .
If you invest just $ 20 a month every month over the next 10 years at a 6.5 % interest rate , you ’ll end up with nearly $ 10,000 at the end of 20 years , and more than $ 45,000 at the end of 40 years .
26 . Quit Smoking
If the fear of cancer were n’t enough to get you to quit smoking , then how about what the tobacco is doing to your wallet ?
A pack of cigarettes costs an average of $ 5.51 nationally , but can reach as much as $ 12.85 in New York .
This means a pack - a- day smoker in New York would spend $ 4,690.25 each year just to sustain a bad habit .
Also , remember that no matter how much it ’s costing you financially , it ’s costing you much more physically .
27 . Become a Handyman or Handywoman
Even if you are n’t very handy , there are many small repairs you can make yourself with just a few tools and a little knowledge .
YouTube videos have been a game - changer for people looking to learn the basics , and there are countless books on the market that offer step - by - step instructions for things like fixing a leak , replacing a switch plate , or repairing a door hinge .
28 . Give the Gift of Time
For holidays , birthdays , and anniversaries , do n’t worry about going all out on a lavish electronic item , costly gift card or designer clothing item .
Instead , give the gift of quality time with your loved ones .
Schedule a special dinner , picnic or day outdoors and spend time laughing and talking .
Your gift may be the most memorable and special thing they receive all year .
29 . Travel at Off - Peak Times
When you ’re booking a getaway , look to travel during off - peak months , on off - peak days of the week , and at off - peak times of day .
While sometimes you may be constrained by an event you must attend or a work schedule you have to adhere to , do your research to find out how cheaply you can get your ticket .
For example , there may be a $ 100 price difference between a plane ticket with a Saturday night departure and one with a Sunday morning departure .
A little flexibility and comparison - shopping on your part can save you hundreds of dollars on travel expenses .
30 . Avoid Gimmicky Insurances
Yes , it is possible to be over - insured or purchase polices that simply are n’t effective .
For example , many types of pet insurance cover only the basics , so you might still be on the hook for a large surgery bill or expense when disaster strikes .
With things like travel insurance and rental car insurance , it may be that your health insurance or your credit card already have you covered in the event of an accident .
Before you purchase any type of insurance , make sure you check to see what you ’re already covered for , and what the coverage you ’re considering really offers .
31 . Stick to a Written Budget
Occasionally you ’re bound to throw caution to the wind and splurge on an article of clothing , a dinner out , or a nice summer vacation – but when you do , try to ensure you can still work the expense into the confines of your budget by the end of the month .
Most of us have a little leeway built into our month , but without a written budget , it ’s hard to remember how much wiggle room you have to splurge .
When you can stick to your budget and have a little leftover every month for savings , it ’s like you ’ve given yourself an instant raise .
And if you have n’t set up a budget for yourself , now is the time to do so .
Two of my favorite budget apps are Personal Capital and Tiller .
Final Word
Planning in advance and staying organized are two of the best ways to ensure a frugal lifestyle .
If you ’re able to plan travel in advance , you can save hundreds of dollars off the cost of airline tickets or rental cars .
Likewise , if you stay organized and keep track of the groceries you have on hand , you wo n’t buy excess food that may be left to spoil .
Advance planning and organization also come in handy when saving for big annual purchases .
If you expect to have money left over for recurring expenses like back - to - school clothing or a car registration , it ’s key that you stick to a detailed budget throughout the year .
No matter your favorite strategies for spending and saving , making a list before you leave the house is the best way to stay organized – and frugal .
Can you suggest any other ways to be frugal and save money ?

news Humber ; Or , Life in the Woods
It seems that some Toronto taggers are no longer content to scrawl their own names on blank concrete canvases around the city and are trying instead to make more of a cultural statement .
Last year , references to composer Gustav Mahler popped up in several places around town .
This year , a more cryptic stencil has appeared on the Humber Bay Arch Bridge , boldly proclaiming “ ISBN 486-28495 - 6 ” for all to see and ponder .
This International Standard Book Number turns out to be a paperback edition of Henry David Thoreau ‘s Walden ; Or , Life in the Woods .
In Walden , Thoreau wrote , “ A lake is the landscape ’s most beautiful and expressive feature .
It is earth ’s eye ; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature . ”
Although he was n’t looking out over Lake Ontario from the mouth of the Humber River when he wrote that , it does n’t make the sentiment any less appropriate .

Devorah Sperber has some pretty fancy reasons for thinking that Star Trek should be converted into complicated works of abstract art — she loves the idea of the " mirror worlds " and layers of reality in classic Trek .
But seriously , Sperber , you do n't need to intellectualize with us .
We know why it 's important to have a glittery bead curtain with Spock on it .
She 's got some other cool creations as well , all part of a show opening tomorrow at Caren Golden Fine Art in NYC that the artist says is partly about her response to 9/11 .

Wired 's Sonia Zjawinski talked to Sperber about her work .
All her stuff is made from beads and spools of thread , which she turns into photomosaics of different images from Trek .
Apparently it 's only classic
Trek that makes it into her art , though she 's much more of a fan of Next Gen .
She told Zjawinski :
I realized the series offered an escape from the tumultuous post 9 - 11 world by presenting a utopian perspective of humanity at its best .
The mission of the TNG Enterprise was exploration and with the exception of the Borg ( you may recall their defining motto was ' resistance is futile ' ) , the crew 's confrontations with alien lifeforms were mostly based on misunderstandings and cultural differences vs. battles between good and evil .

Of course , part of the reason why TNG works that way is because it was made before 9/11 .
Note that Trek made after 9/11 has a much darker perspective .

Designed nearly 150 years ago but never actually built until recently , the Difference Engine No. 2 designed by Charles Babbage ( 1791 to 1871 ) is a piece of Victorian technology meant to tussle with logarithms and trigonometry long before the first modern computer .
Technophiles have a rare opportunity beginning May 10 to see one of these devices ( only two exist ) on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , Calif .
Babbage 's automatic computing engine consists of 8,000 bronze , cast iron and steel parts , weighs five tons , and measures eleven feet ( 3.4 meters ) long and seven feet ( 2.1 meters ) high .
Museum guest curator Doron Swade used Babbage 's own plans to bring the engine to life .
Babbage is also credited with inventing the cowcatcher , dynamometer , standard railroad gauge and heliograph ophthalmoscope as well as uniform postal rates , occulting lights for lighthouses and Greenwich time signals .

NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB Graphics Card
The long - awaited NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB is more than a variant of the two GeForce 8800 GTS models released over a year ago .
In fact , it is based on a totally new GPU - the G92 , which is incidentally the same GPU used in the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT .
The NVIDIA G92 GPU is based on the NVIDIA G80 GPU which not only powered the older GeForce 8800 GTS 640MB and 320 MB cards , but also the GeForce 8800 GTX .
As such , the G92 features the same massively - parallel unified architecture , as well as support for DirectX 10 .
The G92 , however , has been further improved by adding the VP2 video processor and support for PCI Express 2.0 .
It was also fabricated using a 65 nm process technology , resulting in a smaller , cooler chip .
If you have not already read about the technology behind the G80 GPU , do take a look at our NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX / GTS Tech Report .
It will give you a good grounding on the new NVIDIA unified architecture and the G80 GPU , which is the basis of the new G92 GPU .
For more details on the actual architecture of the new G92 GPU , do take a look at our NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT Tech Report .
The GeForce 8800 GT only differs from the GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB in the number of active stream processors ( 112 ) and the clock speeds at which its core and memory chips run at .

Kevin
Ham leans forward , sits up tall , closes his eyes , and begins to type — into the air .
He ’s seated along the rear wall of a packed ballroom in Las Vegas ’s Venetian Hotel .
Up front , an auctioneer is running through a list of Internet domain names , building excitement the same way he might if vintage cars were on the block .
As names come up that interest Ham , he occasionally air - types .
It ’s the ultimate gut check .
Is the name one that people might enter directly into their Web browser , bypassing the search engine box entirely , as Ham wants ?
Is it better in plural or singular form ?
If it ’s a typo , is it a mistake a lot of people would make ?
Or does the name , like a stunning beachfront property , just feel like a winner ?
When Ham wants a domain , he leans over and quietly instructs an associate to bid on his behalf .
He likes wedding names , so his guy lifts the white paddle and snags Weddingcatering.com for $ 10,000 .
Greeting.com is not nearly as good as the plural Greetings.com , but Ham grabs it anyway , for $ 350,000 .
Ham is a devout Christian , and he spends $ 31,000 to add Christianrock.com to his collection , which already includes God.com and Satan.com .
When it ’s all over , Ham strolls to the table near the exit and writes a check for $ 650,000 .
It ’s a cheap afternoon .
Just a few years ago , most of the guys bidding in this room had never laid eyes on one another .
Indeed , they rarely left their home computers .
Now they find themselves in a Vegas ballroom surrounded by deep - pocketed bankers , venture - backed startups , and other investors trying to get a piece of the action .
And why not ?
In the past three years alone , the number of dotcom names has soared more than 130 percent to 66 million .
Every two seconds , another joins the list .
But the big money is in the aftermarket , where the most valuable names — those that draw thousands of pageviews and throw off steady cash from Google ’s and Yahoo ’s pay - per - click ads — are driving prices to dizzying heights .
People who had the guts and foresight to sweep up names shed during the dotcom bust are now landlords of some of the most valuable real estate on the Web .
The man at the top of this little - known hierarchy is Kevin Ham — one of a handful of major - league “ domainers ” in the world and arguably the shrewdest and most ambitious of the lot .
Even in a field filled with unusual career paths , Ham ’s stands out .
Trained as a family doctor , he put off medicine after discovering the riches of the Web .
Since 2000 he has quietly cobbled together a portfolio of some 300,000 domains that , combined with several other ventures , generate an estimated $ 70 million a year in revenue .
( Like all his financial details , Ham would neither confirm nor deny this figure . )
Working mostly as a solo operator , Ham has looked for every opening and exploited every angle — even inventing a few of his own — to expand his enterprise .
Early on , he wrote software to snag expiring names on the cheap .
He was one of the first to take advantage of a loophole that allows people to register a name and return it without cost after a free trial , on occasion grabbing hundreds of thousands of names in one swoop .
And what few people know is that he ’s also the man behind the domain world ’s latest scheme : profiting from traffic generated by the millions of people who mistakenly type “ .cm ” instead of “ .com ” at the end of a domain name .
Try it with almost any name you can think of — Beer.cm , Newyorktimes.cm , even Anyname.cm — and you ’ll land on a page called Agoga.com , a site filled with ads served up by Yahoo .
Ham makes money every time someone clicks on an ad — as does his partner in this venture , the West African country of Cameroon .
Why Cameroon ?
It has the unforeseen good fortune of owning .cm as its country code — just as Germany runs all names that end with .de .
The difference is that hardly any .cm names are registered , and the letters are just one keyboard slip away from .com , the mother lode of all domains .
Ham landed connections to the Cameroon government and flew in his people to reroute the traffic .
And if he gets his way , Colombia ( .co ) , Oman ( .om ) , Niger ( .ne ) , and Ethiopia ( .et ) will be his as well .
“ It ’s in the works , ” Ham says over lunch in his hometown of Vancouver , British Columbia .
“ That ’s why I ca n’t talk about it . ”
He ’s nearly as reluctant to share details about his newest company , called Reinvent Technology , into which he ’s investing tens of millions of dollars to build a powerhouse of Internet businesses around his most valuable properties .
Given Ham ’s reach on the Web — his sites receive 30 million unique visitors a month — it ’s remarkable that so few people know about him .
Even in the clubby world of domainers , he ’s a mystery man .
Until now Ham has never talked publicly about his business .
You wo n’t find his name on any domain registration , nor will you see it on the patent application for the Cameroon trick .
There are practical reasons for the low profile :
For one , Ham ’s success has drawn enemies , many of them rivals .
He once used a Vancouver post office box for domain - related mail — until the day he opened a package that contained a note reading “ You are a piece of s**t , ” accompanied by an actual piece of it .
Bitter domainers are one thing , lawyers another .
And at the moment , Ham ’s biggest concern is that corporate counsels will come after him claiming that the Cameroon typo scheme is an abuse of their trademarks .
He may be right , since this is the first time he ’s been identified as the orchestrator .
When asked about the .cm play , John Berryhill , a top domain attorney who does n’t work for Ham , practically screams into the phone , “ You know who did that ?
Do you have any idea how many people want to know who ’s behind that ? ”
Kevin Ham is a boyish - looking 37 - year - old , trim from a passion for judo and a commitment to clean living .
His drink of choice : grapefruit juice , no ice .
His mild demeanor belies the aggressive , work - around - the - clock type that he is .
Ham frequently steers conversations about business back to the Bible .
Not in a preachy way ; it ’s just who he is .
The son of Korean - born immigrants , Ham grew up on the east side of Vancouver with his three brothers .
His father ran dry - cleaning stores ; his mother worked graveyard shifts as a nurse .
A debilitating illness at the age of 14 led Ham to dream of becoming a doctor .
He cruised through high school and then undergraduate work and medical school at the University of British Columbia .
Christianity had long been a mainstay with his family , but as an undergrad , he made the Bible a focal point of his life ; he joined the Evangelical Layman ’s Church and attended regular Bible meetings .
Ham recalls that it was about this time — 1992 or 1993 — that he was introduced to the Web .
A church friend told him about a powerful new medium that could be used to spread the gospel .
“ Those words really struck me , ” Ham says .
“ It ’s the reason I ’m still working . ”
After he graduated from med school in 1998 , Ham and his new bride took off for London , Ontario , for a two - year residency .
By the second year , Ham had become chief resident , and when he was n’t rushing to the emergency room , he indulged his growing fascination with the Net , teaching himself to create websites and to code in Perl .
Information about Web hosting at the time was so scattered that Ham began creating an online directory of providers , complete with reviews and ratings of their services .
He called it Hostglobal.com .
From there it was a short step to the business of buying and selling domains .
About six months after he launched Hostglobal , Ham was earning around $ 10,000 per month in ad sales .
But when one of his advertisers — a service that sold domain registrations — told him that a single ad was generating business worth $ 1,500 a month , Ham figured he could get in on that too .
It made sense : People shopping for hosting services were often interested in buying a catchy URL , so Ham launched a second directory , called DNSindex.com .
Like similar services operating at the time , it gave customers a way to register domain names .
But Ham added the one feature that early domain hunters wanted most : weekly lists of available names , compiled using free sources he found on the Web .
Some lists he gave away ; others he charged as much as $ 50 for .
In a couple of months , he had more than 5,000 customers .
By the time he finished his residency in June 2000 , his two small Web ventures were pulling in more money in a month — sometimes $ 40,000 — than Ham made that year at the hospital .
That was enough , he reasoned , to put off starting a medical practice for three more months , maybe six .
“ It just did n’t make sense not to do it , ” he says .
With a new baby in tow , Ham and his wife moved back to Vancouver , settling into a one - bedroom apartment .
Ham ’s timing , it turned out , was spot -on .
Tech stocks were tumbling , dotcoms were folding left and right , and investors were fleeing the Web .
More important to him , hundreds of thousands of valuable domain names that were suddenly considered worthless began to expire , or “ drop . ”
Ham and a handful of other trailblazers were ready to snap them up .
Figuring out when names would drop was tedious work .
At the time , Network Solutions controlled the best names ; it was for a long time the only retail company , or registrar , selling .coms .
It did n’t say when expiring names would go back on the market , but twice a day it published the master list of all registered names — the so - called “ root zone ” file ( now managed by VeriSign ( Charts ) ) .
It was a fat list of well over 5 million names that took hours to download and often crashed the under - powered PCs of the day .
So Ham wrote software scripts that compared one day ’s list with the next .
Then he tracked names that vanished from the root file .
Those names would be listed briefly as on hold , and Ham figured out that they would almost always drop five or six days later — at about 3:30 a.m. on the West Coast .
In the dark of night , Ham launched his attacks , firing up five PCs and multiple browsers in each .
Typing furiously , he would enter his buy requests and bounce from one keyboard to the next until he snagged the names he wanted .
He missed a lot of them , of course .
Ham had no clue that there were rivals out there who were way ahead him , deploying software that purchased names at a rate that Ham ’s fingers could n’t match .
Through registration data , he eventually traced many of those purchases to one owner : “ NoName . ”
Behind the shadowy moniker was another reclusive domain pioneer , a Chinese - born programmer named Yun Ye , who , according to people who know him , operated out of his house in Fremont , Calif .
By day Ye worked as a software developer .
At night he unleashed the programs that automated domain purchases .
( Ye achieved deity status among domainers in 2004 when he sold a portfolio of 100,000 names to Marchex , a Seattle - based , publicly traded search marketing firm , for $ 164 million .
He then moved to Vancouver . )
Ham went back to the keyboard , writing scripts so that he , too , could pound at the registrars .
Ham ’s track record began to improve , but he still was n’t satisfied .
“ Yun was just too good , ” he says .
Then Ham did something brash :
He bought his way to the front of the line .
Since registrars had direct connections to Network Solutions ’s servers , Ham ’s play was to cut out the middleman .
He struck deals with several discount registrars , even helping them write software to ensure that they captured the names Ham wanted to buy during the drops .
In exchange for the exclusivity , Ham offered to pay as much as $ 100 for some names that might normally go for as little as $ 8 .
Within weeks
Ham had struck so many deals that , according to rivals , he controlled most of the direct connections .
“ I kept telling them to hit them harder , ” Ham says in a rare boastful moment .
“ We brought down the servers many times . ”
During one six - month period starting in late 2000 , Ham registered more than 10,000 names .
Rival domainers , locked out of much of the action , did n’t appreciate Ham ’s tactics .
It was one of them , most likely , who sent him the turd .
“ Kevin came in and closed the door for everyone else , ” says Frank Schilling , a domainer who figured out what Ham had done and sealed similar deals .
“ There was a ton of professional jealousy . ”
Ham , in fact , owes a lot to Schilling .
Both men lived in Vancouver at the time , and after Ham sought out Schilling in November 2000 , the two met at a restaurant to compare notes .
“ How much traffic do you have ? ” Schilling asked .
An embarrassed Ham replied that he had no idea .
Schilling mentioned that he was experimenting with a new service , GoTo.com , that would populate his domains with ads .
Ham spent the next week figuring out how much traffic his sites were generating , and he was amazed by the initial tally : 8,000 unique visitors per day from the 375 names he owned at the time .
“ From then on , ” Ham says , “ I knew that what I was building would be very , very valuable . ”
He soon signed up with GoTo ( which was later purchased by Yahoo ) .
On his first day , Ham made $ 1,500 .
The system worked then as it does now : People do n’t always use Google or Yahoo to find something on the Web ; they ’ll often type what they ’re looking for into a browser ’s address bar and add “ .com . ”
It ’s a practice known as “ direct navigation , ” or type - in traffic , and millions do it .
Need wedding shoes ?
Type in “ weddingshoes.com ” — a site that Ham happens to own — and you ’ll land on what looks like a shoe - shopping portal , filled with links from dozens of retailers .
Click on any one of those links , and the advertiser that placed it pays Yahoo , which in turn pays a cut to Ham .
That single site , Ham says , brings in $ 9,100 a year .
Small change , maybe , but the name cost him $ 8 , and his annual overhead for it is about $ 7 .
Multiply that model several thousand times over , and you get a quick idea of the kind of cash machine that Ham was creating from his living room .
By early 2002 , roughly $ 1 million a year was pouring into Ham ’s operation , which he ran with the help of his high school friend and current partner , Colin Yu .
But again he felt the tug of his conscience .
He occasionally left Vancouver to do medical missionary stints , helping patients in Mexico , the Philippines , and China .
He found the experience rewarding , but the development boom he saw taking off in China just reminded him of the virtual real estate boom he was leading back home .
Soon Ham was back working full - time on the Web .
“ There was just too much more to do , ” he says .
There was no looking back .
The next few years were among Ham ’s most aggressive .
One of his most valuable tricks was one he had experimented with in the early days , a practice called domain “ tasting . ”
Tasting takes advantage of a provision that allows domain - name buyers a free five - day trial period .
Intended to protect customers who mistakenly purchase the wrong name , it handed aggressive domainers another means with which to expand — and exploit — their portfolios .
Ham cobbled together new lists of domain words in every combination , registering hundreds of thousands of new names for free , monitoring the traffic , and then returning the duds .
By 2004 , Ham had amassed such a deep portfolio that he pulled his names from third - party registrars , launched his own registrar , and then created another company , appropriately named Hitfarm , that could do a better job than Yahoo of matching ads with domain names — for himself and 100 or so other domainers .
Like any shopping spree , though , Ham ’s tasting binge did n’t last .
It brought in so many names — offbeat strings of letters , names with too many dashes , and other variations that humans would be hard - pressed to think of — that Ham saw the quality of his portfolio dropping in proportion to its growing size .
For every few thousand names he ’d register , he ’d toss back all but a hundred or so .
Tasting exacerbated another problem too : Ham ’s software grabbed all kinds of typographical variations of trademarked names .
Called typo-squatting , it ’s a practice now coming under the same intense scrutiny long faced by cybersquatters .
Microsoft and Neiman Marcus are just two companies whose lawyers have brought anti-cybersquatting lawsuits , charging domainers with intentionally profiting from variations of their trademarks .
“ Tasting changed everything , ” says Ham , who has since abandoned the practice , though he concedes that Hitfarm still holds some problematic names .
“ I said , forget it , ” he says .
“ Generic names are already too hard to come by .
And the legal risks are too great . ”
The legal risks should diminish , however , if you do n’t own the domain names at all — and that ’s the secret behind the Cameroon play .
The domain confab in Vegas is like any other trade conference :
The real intrigue happens at cocktail hour .
One subject in the air is Cameroon .
Late last summer , domainers began noticing that something odd happens to .cm traffic :
It all winds up at a site called Agoga.com .
Domainers know , of course , that .cm belongs to Cameroon .
And they know that whoever controls Agoga.com has created a potential gold mine .
What they do n’t know is who ’s behind it all .
At one of the meet - and - greets , Ham is standing drinkless , as usual , sporting a polo shirt , chatting with a few people he knows and some he ’s just met .
In this crowd , it seems , everyone wants to know Ham .
Finally , he is alone .
“ I hear you ’re the guy behind .cm ? ”
Ham looks surprised by the reporter ’s question , then flashes a big smile and says , “ I had help . ”
Over a series of conversations a few weeks later in Vancouver , Ham shares some details about a deal that , despite his innate reticence , he ’s clearly proud of .
About a year ago , he says , he worked his contacts to gain connections to government officials in Cameroon .
Then he flew several confidantes to Yaound ? , the capital , to make their pitch .
His key programmer went along to handle the technical details .
“ Hey , ” Ham says , flagging his techie down near the office elevator .
“ Did n’t you meet with the president of Cameroon ? ”
“ Nah , ” the programmer says .
“ We met with the prime minister .
But we did see the president ’s compound . ”
It ’s an odd scene to picture : a domainer ’s reps in a sit - down with Ephraim Inoni , the prime minister of Cameroon , to discuss the power of type - in typo traffic and pay - per - click ads .
And yet , as with most of the angles Ham has played , the Cameroon scheme is ingeniously straightforward .
Ham ’s people installed a line of software , called a “ wildcard , ” that reroutes traffic addressed to any .cm domain name that is n’t registered .
In the case of Cameroon , a country of 18 million with just 167,000 computers connected to the Internet , that means hundreds of millions of names .
Type in “ paper.cm ” and servers owned by Camtel , the state - owned company that runs Cameroon ’s domain registry , redirect the query to Ham ’s Agoga.com servers in Vancouver .
The servers fill the page with ads for paper and office - supply merchants .
( Officials at Yahoo confirm that the company serves ads for Ham ’s .cm play . )
It all happens in a flash , and since Ham does n’t own or register the names , he ’s not technically typo- squatting , according to several lawyers who handle Internet issues .
The method is spelled out in a patent application filed by a Vancouver businessman named Robert Seeman , who Ham says is his partner in the venture and who also serves as chief adviser at Reinvent Technology .
( Seeman declined to be interviewed for this story . )
Ham wo n’t reveal specifics but says Agoga receives “ in the ballpark ” of 8 million unique visitors per month .
Fellow domainers , naturally , are envious .
“ As soon as it started happening , there was a huge sense of ‘ Why did n’t I think of that ? ’ ” says attorney Berryhill , who represents Schilling and other domainers .
Still , several companies have already tracked down Ham ’s attorneys , claiming trademark infringement .
Ham argues that his system is legally in the clear because it treats every.cm typo equally and does n’t filter out trademarked names .
Berryhill concurs .
“ You ca n’t really say that [ wildcarding ] is targeting trade - marks , ” he says .
“ It captures all the traffic , not just trademark traffic . ”
Moreover , the anti-cybersquatting statute applies only to people who register a trademarked domain ; using a wildcard does n’t require registering names .
Clever though it may be , .cm is “ a very small part of our operations , ” Ham says .
He wo n’t disclose how much he pays to the government of Cameroon , whose officials could not be reached for comment .
The partnership has been a rocky one so far , and the system has sporadically shut down .
But .cm is only one of several country domains where the typo play can work .
According to Ham , he and his team are working with other governments .
The dream typo play — . co — belongs to Colombia , to which Ham says Seeman paid several visits long before they began working on Cameroon .
( Citing safety concerns , Ham has n’t yet made the trip .
“ I would only go if the president requests to meet me , ” he says . )
As for other countries he might soon invade , Oman ( .om ) is an obvious target .
Niger and Ethiopia are out there too , but since they would play off less lucrative .
net typos , they might not be worth the trouble .
As for Colombia , Ham says , “ we ’re making progress . ”
Ham leans over his office PC to check on a domain auction .
Steven Sacks , a domainer based in Indianapolis who works for Ham , is telling him about some names up for sale .
Ham shoots back an instant message : “ I like doctordegree.com … and rockquarry.com … sunblinds.com . ”
The days of figuring out the drop are long over .
Everything ’s open now .
Lists are easy to obtain .
You can preorder a name before it drops and hope to get it .
Or , like Ham , you can shell out five or six figures in online auctions .
The only great deals , at least for .com names , tend to happen privately , when a domainer manages to find an eager or naive seller .
Ham still buys 30 to 100 names a day , but he ’s no longer getting them on the cheap .
In fact , he and Schilling , who today maintains a $ 20 million - a - year portfolio from his home in the Cayman Islands , are often accused of driving up prices .
Take , for example , the $ 26,250 Ham paid for Fruitgiftbaskets.com , or the $ 171,250 for Hoteldeals.com .
“ The amount he will pay is crazy , ” says Bob Martin , president of Internet REIT , a domain investment firm that has raised more than $ 125 million from private investors , including Maveron , the venture firm backed by Starbucks founder Howard Schultz .
Nonsense , Ham says .
The names are expensive only if you value them the way people like Martin do .
The VCs and bankers , who were late to the domain gold rush , assess names by calculating the pay - per - click ad revenue and attaching a multiple based on how long it would take to pay off the investment .
Viewed that way , Ham ’s personal portfolio alone is worth roughly $ 300 million .
But some of Ham ’s recent domain purchases would also look silly :
They ’d take 15 or 20 years just to justify the price , and that assumes continuation of the pay - per - click model .
But Ham is taking a longer view .
The Web , he says , is becoming cluttered with parked pages .
The model is amazingly efficient — lots of money for little work –but Ham argues that Internet users will soon grow weary of it all .
He also expects Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo to find ways to effectively combat typo-squatting .
Some browsers can already fix typos ; Internet Explorer catches unregistered domains and redirects visitors to a Microsoft page — in effect controlling traffic the same way that Ham is doing with .cm .
“ The heat is rising , ” Ham says .
When Ham buys a domain now , he ’s not doing pay - per - click math but rather sizing it up as a potential business .
Reinvent Technology aims to turn his most valuable names into mini media companies , based on hundreds of niche categories .
Among the first he ’d like to launch , not surprisingly , is Religion.com .
Ham recently leased the entire 27th floor in his Vancouver building and is now hiring more than 150 designers , engineers , salespeople , and editorial folks .
Much of that effort is going into developing search tools based more on meaning and less on keywords .
“ Google is only so useful , ” Ham says .
The aim is to apply a meaning - based , or “ semantic , ” system across swaths of sites , luring customers from direct navigation and search engines alike .
Religion.com would then become an anchor to which scores of other sites would be tied .
“ It ’s time to build out the virtual real estate , ” Ham says .
“ There ’s so much more value in these names than pay - per- click . ”
Seeman ’s patent application even mentions the possibility of turning Web traffic from Cameroon and other future foreign partners into full - fledged portals .
It ’s all part of the master plan , as Ham aims to become the first domainer to move from the ranks of at - home name hunter to Internet titan .
Smaller players have been selling out to VC - backed groups , and Ham expects that the best names will eventually be owned by just a handful of companies .
If he bets right , he might very well be one of them .
“ If you control all the domains , ” he says , “ then you control the Internet . ”

Where 's the wooden helmet ?
He 's under 18 .
At least here in California ( and probably many other states ) , under 18 year olds have to wear a helmet .
Seriously though , this is an impressive piece of work .
I doubt the wooden chain would stand up to much though .
To understand the importance Dennis Kucinich places on spirituality , scan his generally spare Capitol Hill office : a white cloth from the Dalai Lama , a bust of Gandhi , and a picture representing " conscious light " – a gift from Brahma Kumaris nuns .
There 's a Tibetan dragon washbowl and , on his desk , two heavy crucifixes once worn by Catholic nuns who taught him and who , he says , " saved my life . "
" Obviously , I connect with all religions , " says Representative Kucinich ( D ) of Ohio , in the midst of his second presidential campaign .
" All manners of belief and even non -belief come from a common font , and that is the transcendent power of the human heart ....
All those things that would separate us are based on misunderstandings of our nature . "
They 're somewhat unusual religious views for someone who still considers himself essentially Roman Catholic .
But then , little about Kucinich is orthodox .
While his colleagues in Congress recently voted for more military funds for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , he is pushing for immediate withdrawal from Iraq and advocates cutting money from the defense budget .
In the middle of the war on terror , he wants to establish a Department of Peace .
He 's the only Democratic presidential candidate who wants a Medicare system for all Americans , supports gay marriage , and advocates repealing the North American Free Trade Agreement and withdrawing from the World Trade Organization .
The congressman is also , by all reckonings , a long shot for the nomination .
The latest national polls have him hovering around 1 percent .
( He often wins online polls with strong liberal leanings . )
But Kucinich , who projects supreme confidence in both his views and his abilities , is anything but discouraged .
Another item he keeps in his congressional office is an original script from " The Man of La Mancha , " a gift from a cast member .
It 's an apt memento , since Kucinich has been tilting at windmills and dreaming impossible dreams most of his life .
Quoting the romantic poets
The eldest of seven children , he grew up in a household that was chronically short of money and often had trouble finding an apartment that would accept so many children .
The family moved more than 20 times and , at one point , lived out of their 1948 Dodge .
Kucinich worked to pay his tuition to the Catholic schools he attended and was one of the first in his family to graduate from high school .
A sports lover despite his 5 - foot , 7 - inch frame , he played football and basketball – and endured brutal hazing from teammates – until he was diagnosed with a heart murmur and told to stop .
From the time he was young , Kucinich has been reading the likes of Ralph Waldo Emerson , Robert Browning , and the Romantic poets .
He still quotes them and considers many of their ideas part of his broader sense of faith .
A particular favorite is Percy Shelley 's " Prometheus Unbound " – whose final lines mirror Kucinich 's own belief that love and hope must challenge oppression .
" Tennyson – ' Come , My friends , ' Tis not too late to seek a newer world . '
Browning – ' A man 's reach should exceed his grasp , ' " Kucinich says .
" The romantic poets had this understanding of the power of the human spirit … .
That to me corresponds to religion , and to me the power of the human heart is an article of faith . "
Those sentiments – that one should strive for the impossible , and try to create something better – were also drilled into him by the nuns in Kucinich 's high school , St. John Cantius .
Those ideas influenced his desire to be a politician – and to start young .
Kucinich first ran for political office when he was 20 and nearly defeated a longtime city council incumbent in Cleveland .
He looked even younger than he was , and news stories at the time referred to him as " Dennis the Menace " and " Alfalfa . "
Two years later he ran again and won .
In his 2007 memoir , " The Courage to Survive , " Kucinich writes of telling a high school friend that he would be mayor of Cleveland by the time he was 30 .
He was n't far off ; in fact , he was elected mayor in 1977 at age 31 , the youngest mayor of a major American city .
His term lasted just two years , and it was , by all accounts , tumultuous .
" He gave the town a nervous breakdown and he wore them out , " says Brent Larkin , editorial page editor at The Cleveland Plain Dealer .
" It was unlike anything I 've seen in my rather long career of paying attention to things that happen in this city .
He was a different Dennis then .
He was extraordinarily combative . "
Kucinich was always at odds with the city council , vetoing dozens of bills it sent to him , which councilors then overrode .
He plunged the city into fiscal default when he refused to sell Muny Light , the city - owned electric utility , despite extraordinary pressure from business and a hit placed on him by organized crime , according to police .
" It was n't mine to sell .
It belonged to the people , " Kucinich says , explaining a decision that he credits with saving citizens hundreds of millions of dollars in utility rates .
Others say it 's more complicated – that the city is still paying for the decision with a poor bond rating .
One panel of experts included Kucinich in its list of the 10 worst big -city mayors of all time .
But Kucinich came back from the political wasteland – he barely survived a recall election and lost reelection in 1979 – in part based on new evidence that his stand on Muny Light was not only courageous , but , in hindsight , the best decision .
" Because he was right " was the slogan that helped him win his 1994 election to the Ohio legislature .
Two years later , he was elected to Congress .
" He is the most resilient political figure I have ever met , " says Mr. Larkin .
" I cannot overstate enough how dead he was politically in 1979 … .
He really is a tenacious guy . "
Against the mainstream
Kucinich has a less combative style these days , but he still relishes standing alone against the political mainstream .
He was the only member of Congress to vote against a bill this fall to establish Sept. 11 as a day of remembrance for those who died in the terrorist attacks and who have fought in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Because the resolution did n't make reference to " the lies that took us into Iraq , the lies that keep us there , the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against Iran , and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home , " he chose not to support it , Kucinich said in a statement at the time .
In presidential debates , he calls attention to his solo positions – as the only Democratic candidate supporting a nonprofit single - payer healthcare system , the only one calling for immediate withdrawal from Iraq , the only one who supports gay marriage and who voted against funding the war in Iraq .
This fall he introduced a bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
In one debate , Kucinich whipped out his pocket - size copy of the Constitution when questioned about his efforts .
" A lot of people do n't agree with Dennis on specific issues , but nobody ever doubts where he stands , " says Andy Juniewicz , Kucinich 's press secretary and a friend who worked as a copy boy with him at the Plain Dealer and has known him for more than 40 years .
" He 's probably the most courageous elected official I 've ever known .
Whatever the odds , if he believes he 's right , he 'll buck those odds and push for what he believes is right . "
Kucinich himself explains those positions , which often go against the political mainstream , as simply coming from his internal convictions .
" Emerson once wrote , ' Trust thyself : every heart vibrates to that iron string ….'
I 've been reading that essay since I was 10 years old . "
Still , Kucinich 's critics often question whether his views are too extreme , too lacking in nuance and understanding of complexities , or so politically unpalatable as to make his election or the success of his proposals impossible .
" You have to mix the idealism with the practicality or you 're foolish , " says Timothy Hagen , president of Cleveland 's Board of County Commissioners and chairman of the local Democratic Party when Kucinich was mayor .
" The question becomes , can you convince enough people that what you 're saying has validity and you can make it a reality .
He has n't been able to do that . "
It 's a criticism that Kucinich is used to , and one he bristles at .
A traditional politician who , colleagues say , has probably met everyone in his district three times and is effective at delivering services to his constituents , he believes his ideas are practical – even if they 're sometimes ahead of their time .
" I 'm grounded in the practical everyday experience of people , " he says .
" I see paths toward civic health that are practical ….
I feel I 'm a candidate of the mainstream because I 'm not hobbled by those who would purchase or rent my opinion . "
Kucinich still lives in the same small house he bought more than 30 years ago and still carries a union membership card – for the stagehand union – in his pocket .
His roots have helped him stay connected to the people he serves , he says .
And he credits the education he received from the Catholic nuns , and the sense of discipline his coach , Peter Pucher , instilled in him , with creating many of the bedrock values that inform his views today .
" He sincerely believes in the kinds of things he 's saying and stands for , " says Alexander Lamis , a political scientist at Case Western University in Cleveland .
Professor Lamis remembers going out to lunch with Kucinich and Carl Stokes , the first African - American mayor of a big city and a friend of Kucinich 's until his death .
The conversation turned to Tom Johnson , a Cleveland mayor at the turn of the 20th century and a leader of the Progressive movement .
" They talked about how they considered themselves the only two Cleveland mayors to follow in the Tom Johnson mayoral tradition , " says Lamis .
" Coming with that tradition is fighting against the well - to - do special interests .
It 's just what Dennis believes . "
A transformational love
But if Kucinich believes he 's a candidate of the mainstream , he 's rarely treated that way by the media , which tend to highlight some of his wackier moments – his close friendship with actress Shirley MacLaine , for instance , and the fact that he says he has seen a UFO over her house , the subject of a question Tim Russert asked in a Democratic debate this fall .
These days , his marriage is also getting as much attention as his political views .
After two failed marriages , Kucinich met Elizabeth Harper , a striking British beauty more than 30 years his junior , in 2005 when she visited his congressional office to talk about monetary policy .
He fell instantly in love .
They were married less than four months later .
Kucinich explains their meeting and their courtship in near - mystical terms , and says it has transformed his life .
" When you 're in a profound loving relationship , that 's when the heart has wings and the spirit soars and there 's a feeling of everything being right with the world , " he says .
" It 's almost a fulfillment of Spirit and some of St. Paul 's epistles when he writes about love . "
The couple recited the Prayer of Saint Francis at their wedding – the well - known verse that begins , " Lord , make me an instrument of Thy peace . "
He still hopes that his political career can be a way to work toward a larger world peace .
But is this idealistic view of human nature at odds with the realities of a world in which peace often seems impossibly distant ?
" It 's possible to have your feet on the ground and your eyes looking toward the stars , " Kucinich says , in a car rushing to an interview on Fox News to discuss his anger at being excluded from the final Democratic debate in Iowa .
" There was a time when the sailors of old sailed by the stars … .
It 's our obligation to each other to catch the rhythms of the unfolding future which exist in present time , and to call forth , to name it , to set it in motion , to be as architects of new worlds . "
Whoever buys Bob Fanning 's house will hope he dies .
And Fanning is fine with that .
Trying to separate his 5,600 square - foot western Wisconsin home from others in the real estate glut , Fanning , 69 , has come up with an odd incentive :
The buyer will be named beneficiary to a 10 - year , $ 500,000 term life insurance policy .
If Fanning dies in that time , the purchase price of the Whitehall , Wis. , home -- listed at $ 498,900 -- is covered .
" He 's an outside - the - box thinker , no question about it , " said his Realtor , Wayne Peters of Eau Claire .
Most younger sellers could n't plausibly use such a sales tactic , Peters said , but when someone is 69 " the odds are getting to the point where people realize that there 's a significant chance that they could collect . "
Fanning , who said he has taken his share of risks as a businessman , said he thinks it 's a great deal .
It would be voided if there are any shenanigans , though .
" The policy says he can't commit suicide , nor can they knock him off , " Peters said .
" The attorneys have provided for that . "
But is n't Fanning afraid of any , er , " unfortunate accidents " ?
" I had maybe a 10 - second thought about that when we signed the policy , " Fanning said .
" I 'm pretty low profile to begin with . "
His wife , Janus , said she is supportive of his entrepreneurial thinking .
" I 'm always in awe of how he comes up with a different way of doing things , " she said .
" It 's a perk for the house . "
As for the odds : Fanning said he has no health problems , though he joked that he 's " too short " for his weight .
Both his parents died before age 79 , as did a sister .
He said he'd be willing to disclose medical records to a buyer .
Without being specific , Fanning said he paid a hefty price for the insurance policy " because actuary tables show I might not reach 79 , so I think it 's a hell of an incentive to buy a home . "
In Fanning 's mind , it 's not taboo to put a price on his head , as well as on his house .
" When you get to this age , " he said , " death is something you have to start to deal with . "

James Webb and Mark Udall Pushing Bill To Prevent Attack On Iran
Just Foreign Policy :
Gen. William Fallon was , until Tuesday , the commander of U.S. Central Command .
Last week , an article in Esquire called him the Bush administration 's primary obstacle to an attack on Iran and advocate of serious diplomacy .
Now , this military voice of reason on Iran has resigned , under pressure from the White House .
There is new momentum behind legislation introduced by Senator James Webb and Rep. Mark Udall that would prevent the President from attacking Iran without Congressional authorization .
Senator Hillary Clinton , in a press release following Gen. Fallon 's resignation , urged support for the bill .
Just Foreign Policy met personally with Senator John Kerry during the Folly of Attacking Iran Tour , and he reaffirmed his active support .
The Webb / Udall bill would forbid the expenditure of money to attack Iran , which is probably the most powerful tool Congress has .
You can tell your senators and representative to support it using Just Foreign Policy 's email form here .

Brainwashing and the Cults : The Rise and Fall of a Theory
by J. Gordon Melton
Dr. J. Gordon Melton 's Introduction to the forthcoming book The Brainwashing Controversy : An Anthology of Essential Documents , edited by J. Gordon Melton and Massimo Introvigne , to be published in several languages .
Notes are at the end of the text .
In the United States at the end of the 1970s , brainwashing emerged as a popular theoretical construct around which to understand what appeared to be a sudden rise of new and unfamiliar religious movements during the previous decade , especially those associated with the hippie street - people phenomenon .
Most of the new groups were of Asian origin and located on the fringe of the evangelical Christian - based counter cultural movement , the Jesus People , although a few quasi- religious groups such as est and Lifespring were also brought into the controversy .
While there had been a few scholars interested in new religious movements over the previous decades , especially in Japan where new religions had flowered in the 1950s , with the sudden appearance of a host of new groups in the United States following the rescission of the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965 , a number of new scholars appeared ready to devote a significant amount of their research and writing to the issue of an understanding of the role of new religions in late twentieth century society .
The first academic organization to focus research primarily on the many new religious groups was incorporated in 1969 .
While these scholars explored with interest the many similarities of the new religions with older religious groupings , both familiar American groups and different groups seen in other lands , in the early 1970s movements appeared to oppose these new religions .
The leaders of these groups , primarily parents of young adults who had joined the groups , focused upon the dissimilarities they saw between these new groups and the religions with which they were familiar .
They were strange , but more than strange , they were quantitatively different , and their distinctive nature included a sinister element .
Through the 1970s , as people struggled to articulate the strangeness they felt from these new religions , the term " brainwashing " became the symbol of the threat they represented .
While many objected to their son or daughter joining any religion different from that in which they had been raised , parents were particularly upset by those new groups who sought the full - time commitment of recruits , accepting them not just into membership but into a career either as an administrator , teacher , or missionary for the group , or a resident of a commune or monastic - like community .
The brainwashing idea came as a godsend to parents who had been objecting to their offspring 's joining one of the new movements , as it offered what appeared to be a scientific rationale for their son or daughter 's actions .
Joining the new religion , at least to all outward appearances , included a radical change in lifestyle , social relationships , and career trajectory .
Joining the groups usually included the individuals ' assigning religion a significantly higher priority in their lives .
Parents were often at a loss to explain what they saw as an unexpected change , though examination of the recruits usually revealed that the visible changes had come only after a period of time in which they had felt some dissatisfaction with their life in general and their religious life in particular .
In reaching out for some reason why a young adult would radically reject the way which parents had prepared for them to fine a successful ( and by their standards , normal ) life , parents tended to place the blame upon the group that s/he had joined , and increasingly upon the leader of that group .
The several organizations founded in the early 1970s drew upon the literature developed primarily by American Evangelical Christian writers that referred to the new religions as " cults . "
( 1 ) Through the early 1970s , they began to seek the assistance of law enforcement agencies and various professionals , primarily mental health professionals , to intervene in the life of the new believers .
Police and courts were generally unable to assist parents whose child had joined a cult , a " cult " being defined as it was in Evangelical literature merely by its espousal of a radically different set of beliefs .
The situation changed in the late 1970s largely as a result of ( a ) the discovery of involuntary deprogramming as a technique that had some positive results in persuading members to drop their affiliations to new religions , ( b ) the emergence of the concept of brainwashing in the trial of millionaire heiress Patty Hearst , and ( c ) the death of some 900 people at Jonestown .
First , the original parental groups found a major ally in the person of Theodore " Ted " Patrick who stumbled upon the process of deprogramming after being alerted to the dangers of cults when one of his relatives became briefly associated with the Children of God .
In 1976 he authored a popular volume , Let Our Children Go , ( 2 ) describing his kidnapping of several people and the application of various forms of physical and emotional stress in an attempt to force them to sever their relationship to the group , be it the Unification Church , the Hare Krishna , The Divine Light Mission of Guru Maharaj Ji , or one of the several new Evangelical Christian groups .
Then , in 1975 , media - empire heiress Patty Hearst was kidnapped from her apartment in Berkeley , California , and disappeared into the Symbionese Liberation Army , a self - styled leftist revolutionary political group .
Some months later she was photographed carrying a rifle and participating in a bank robbery .
When she was finally captured by the police , she was tried for her role in the robbery , and her defense lawyers tried to argue a new concept , that she had been brainwashed by the SLA and having lost her free will was not responsible for her actions during the robbery .
As the story of her life in the SLA was revealed , it became obvious that during the weeks immediately after her capture that she had undergone a horrible ordeal that included being locked for long periods in a closet , physical rape , and a period of indoctrination into the political theories of the SLA .
Overtime , she began to identify with her captors and eventually became a convert to the SLA cause .
At her trial , several people came forward to testify on her behalf , most prominently , Louis J. West and Robert J. Lifton .
However , one more - obscure expert , Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer ( though she did not testify on brainwashing at this time ) , would later emerge as the key figure in the brainwashing debate .
(3) While the jury turned back any leniency for Hearst based on the brainwashing argument ( in spite of her case bearing some analogy to the situation of the Korean prisoners of war ) , other juries were found to be more attuned to the concept .
At the time of the Hearst case , the parental movement against the new religions seemed to be running out of steam and was splintered into a variety of independently minded local organizations .
However , in November 1978 , an event in a small South American country would change everything .
Jim Jones was the pastor of the Peoples Temple , a large California congregation of the prominent liberal Protestant denomination , the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) .
Jones had become an advocate of a radical form of Marxist liberation theology , then a popular perspective in liberal Protestantism .
However , while he was praised within his denomination and other Protestant churches , for his social outlook and work on racial harmony , he was not without his harsh critics .
In 1977 , he moved with hundreds of his church members , mostly African Americans , to Guyana , where the church had previously established a small agricultural colony .
In Guyana , a communal lifestyle emerged , and the group considered suicide as one alternative to the public 's lack of acceptance of their Marxist ideology .
Then in November 1978 , Congressman Leo Ryan visited as a response to the controversy stirred by the church .
Though seemingly completing his visit on a highly positive note , he and his party were brutally murdered just before they were to catch their plane back to the United States .
Several hours later , almost all of the residents of Jonestown were dead , some committed suicide , others were murdered .
Overnight , the Peoples Temple emerged as the epitome of the " cult . " ( 4 ) The parental groups , divided and possessed of intense local loyalties to their group , found themselves unable to make a response at the level they believed that the Jonestown event demanded .
However , over the next few years , they hammered out an national organization originally known as the Citizens Freedom Foundation ( the name of an early group in California ) and eventually assumed the name , Cult Awareness Network ( CAN ) .
CAN emerged in the early 1980s prepared to fight the cults .
It was equipped with a program to help parents who had lost a son or daughter into a cult ( i.e. , deprogramming ) and what appeared to be a secular scientific understanding of the danger that cults posed ( i.e. , brainwashing ) .
While CAN assumed the activist role serving families who desired the disassociation of one of their family members from a new religion , a sister group , the American Family Foundation ( AFF ) emerged to carry on an educational and research program designed to alert the public to the threat posed to the social order by the cults and the danger of cult life to its members .
AFF leadership was largely constituted by professionals - with mental health professionals and lawyers constituting the largest segment .
While pursuing separate roles , the efforts of the two organizations were coordinated by interlocking boards and the active role many people assumed in both CAN and AFF , and through the mid-1980s , professionals would largely replace parents on CAN 's board
By the end of decade , both organizations consisted of a small number of professionals leading a constituency of parents , anti-cult activists , and lay people concerned about the cult issue .
The Brainwashing Controversy
The idea of brainwashing came out of the misunderstanding of the Chinese indoctrination program directed at American Armed Forces prisoners during the Korean War .
Many Americans were offended that some of their soldier prisoners had made anti-American statements during their prison days and that a few had even chosen to remain behind when prisoners were liberated at the end of hostilities .
In the context of the public 's coming to grips with the insult of the prisoners ' actions , a journalist , Edward Hunter ( later revealed to have been a undercover CIA agent ) , proposed that a new process of indoctrination had been developed by the Chinese Communists , that they had discovered an intense manipulative process that has insidious power to actually alter the mental outlook of those who fell victim to it .
( 5 )
As soon as the Armistice was signed , a team of psychiatrists and psychologists were dispatched to Korea to interview the returning prisoners .
Prominent among the group were Robert J. Lifton and Edgar Schein , and several years later the results of their research began to appear .
(6 ) They concluded that in many ways the experience of the prison camps did not really test Hunter 's accusations , as the prisoners were not really subjected to a systematic re-education program .
Prisoners were subjected to pressures to engage in collaborative behavior rather than appeals to convert to Communism .
Lifton and Schein noted that the thought control process occurred in the context of the prisoners physical confinement under the harshest of conditions , conditions in which necessities such as food and warm clothing were scarce .
Positive results in the process were most often pulled out of prisoners who had faced severe deprivation and were offered such things as more comfortable sleeping quarters , better food , a sweater , or a blanket .
They also noted that the process , in spite of the publicity given several prisoners who had made " unamerican " statements , was actually quite ineffective in changing any basic attitudes .
(7) In spite of these results , the term " brainwashing " entered the public consciousness , and many people adopted Hunter 's original perspective as truth .
However , soon after the Armistice , the Chinese government also began to release a number of prisoners , Americans and other foreigners ( missionaries , students , doctors , businessmen ) caught in China when the Korean War began , as well as a few Chinese who had not been arrested but had been encouraged to attend " voluntarily " one of the thought reform institutions set up throughout this period .
When they emerged from captivity into freedom in Hong Kong , several made public statements to the effect that they had been American spies , that their arrest and detention was just , and that they deserved any punishment they had received .
Given the seeming falsity of the statements they were making , possibly they were true victims of what Hunter had called brainwashing , that the sophisticated Pavlovian process of thought reform utilized by the Chinese was so effective that the victims subjected to it had become little more than a puppet or robot .
Thus Schein , Lifton and their colleagues began a new round of research .
While some such as William Sargent ( 8 ) and Joost Merloo ( 9 ) initially accepted Hunter 's perspective , Lifton 's ( 10 ) and Schein 's ( 11 ) careful analysis of the prisoners accounts led them to reject Hunter 's view .
Lifton , Schein , and their colleagues concluded that in fact coercive persuasion , in which a mixture of social , psychological and physical pressures are applied to produce changes in an individual 's self - perception , beliefs and attitudes , does occur .
However , they also concluded that a necessary condition of its occurring was the physical element - confinement or its equivalent , As Schein put it , " ... the coercive element in coercive persuasion is paramount ( forcing the individual into a situation in which he must , in order to survive physically and psychologically , expose himself to persuasive attempts ) . "
( 12 ) They also concluded that it was successful only on a minority of those subjected to it and its end result was very unstable , the individuals so coerced tending to revert to their previous condition soon after the coercive force was removed . ( 13 )
By the time of the Hearst case , a popular anti-cult movement had been energized by the practice of deprogramming , an activity that included the forceful detention ( and occasionally an actual kidnapping ) of a member of a new religion and the subsequent application of pressure for the member to withdraw and return to a " normal " life .
When legal authorities failed to respond to their requests , deprogramming offered parents one way to intervene in their offspring 's life and hopefully end their foray in a new religious group .
During the 1970s , parents also placed their hope in a second , closely associated , tactic , the placing of their child under a court conservatorship during which time pressure for their leaving the group could be applied without the questionable coercive activity involved with deprogramming .
In the years immediately after the Hearst case , several psychiatrists , most notably UCLA Professor Louis J. West and Massachusetts psychiatrist John Clark , were active in applying theories of brainwashing to new religious movements , however , it was Margaret T. Singer , a clinical psychologist in Berkeley , California , who became the leading theoretician and the most prominent exponent of the theory in court situations .
Her position was initially established in several articles , most notably " Coming Out of the Cults , " that appeared in Psychology Today , a widely circulated newsstand periodical designed to convey psychological insights to a popular audience .
Much of the article was devoted to discussing the harm suffered by the ex-members of several of the new religions .
Symptoms included depression , indecisiveness , the blurring of mental acuity , uncritical passivity , and fear .
The discussion of the mental health of group members would be a continuing theme in the literature .
However , slipped into the discussion was the more important theme of coercive persuasion which Singer admitted needed a " long and sophisticated explanation of social and psychological coercion , influence and control procedures . "
( 14 ) However , she did accuse the " cults " of maintaining the loyalty of their members through the use of " social and psychological pressures and practices that , intentionally or not , amount to conditioning techniques that constrict attention , limit personal relationships , and devalue reasoning .
( 15 ) She also noted that even trained therapists " may fail to be aware of the sophisticated high - pressure recruitment tactics and intense influence procedures the cults use to attract and keep members , " and may rather see in the symptoms signs of a long - standing psychopathology originating in the days prior to cult involvement .
( 16 )
In several subsequent articles , Singer would develop more completely her idea of " conditioning techniques . "
For example , in 1980 , in an article co-authored with Louis J. West , she noted that cults use drastic techniques of control :
" ... techniques that in some respects resemble the political indoctrination methods prescribed by Mao Tse Tung during the communist revolution and its aftermath from 1945 to 1955 in China .
These techniques , described by the Chinese as ' thought reform " or ideological remolding were labeled " brainwashing ' by the American journalist Edward Hunter ( 1951 , 1958 ) .
Such methods were studied in depth after the Korean War by a number of Western scientists ( Lifton , 1961 ; Schiein , 1961 ) . " ( 17 )
Further she added that the use of these techniques led members to become incapable of complex , rational thought , responses to questions become stereotyped , and the ability to make decisions difficult .
Much that was asserted in articles such as these resonated with the finding of new religions scholars in general who studied what were seen as " high demand " religions within which a variety of , to borrow a phrase from Rosebeth Kantor , " commitment mechanisms " to encourage and hold group members .
( 18 ) However , critics noticed that Singer consistently employed the language of brainwashing and Pavlovian conditioning .
While quoting her mentor Edgar Schein , she largely avoided discussions of two key issues : the necessary element of coercion involved in the process of coercive persuasion and the issue of the overriding of the free will of people upon whom the persuasive techniques are used .
However , in her court testimony she consistently moved beyond her published articles to assert that social and psychological techniques had been used by the new religions on their members , and that these techniques had effected the members ability to think clearly and make decisions , but went on to asset that , in fact , the end result of the process was ( a ) the overpowering of the person 's free will in making critical decisions and ( b ) the group 's gaining control that was virtually total .
Singer 's articles offered several possibilities of interpretation .
One , the social influence approach , accepted that new religions , just as other groups , influenced members , and that cults simply did it somewhat more .
The other , known as the robot theory , from the use of that term by Edward Hunter , suggested far more .
That the free will of the person had been inhibited and that they actually remained a member of the group against their will because they were controlled by the group .
While a cursory reading of Singer 's writings through the 1980s could reach the conclusion that she was simply articulating a social influence approach , the articles served to provide a foundation from which the so - called " robot " theory could be asserted in court .
This latter assertion was essential if court cases directed against new religions were to have a claim of action that justified the multi-million dollar judgments that were being sought .
Thus , it was in the depositions and court transcripts that what became known as the " Singer hypothesis , " the application of the " robot theory " of brainwashing to cults was largely articulated , and it became necessary to consult these documents to create a full respond to her thought .
However , what Singer said in court was being said more openly in public statements by others .
For example , social worker Jean Merritt , one of the AFF 's early employees , said of members of some " authoritarian " groups she had interviewed , that " their free will has been given up by the isolation , lack of sleep , sexual acts , poor eating and the sophistication of the psychological manipulations of leaders . " ( 19 ) Among the most widely circulated statements of support for Singer came in the book Snapping , authored by Flo Conway and Jim Siegelman .
Snapping was the name they gave to the effect upon cult members when the brainwashing process took over .
As they put it :
" Inevitably , under the cumulative pressures of this sweeping physical , emotional , and intellectual blitz , self - control and personal beliefs give way .
Isolated from the world and surrounded by exotic trappings , the converts absorb the cult 's altered ways of thought and daily life .
In a very short time , before they realize what is happening , while their attention is diverted to contrived spiritual conflicts and further weakened by lack of food and sleep , the new cult members slide into a state of mind in which they are no longer capable of thinking for themselves . " ( 20 )
As these opinions became known at the end of the 1970s , they produced a storm of comment and through the mid 1980s the issues were fully aired at various scholarly gatherings , and a significant scholarly consensus that the brainwashing model used by Singer and her colleagues was woefully inadequate emerged .
That consensus , most clearly stated in the negative responses to the report that Singer and her colleagues would prepare for the American Psychological Association , would in turn be injected into the court process in the late 1980s and lead to the rejection of the " Singer hypothesis " by U.S. courts and a series of reverses by the Cult Awareness Network and indeed the whole anti-cult movement in the 1990s .
The Response to the Brainwashing Hypothesis
The articles which appear below represent the major scholarly reactions to the Singer hypothesis by social scientists ( both psychological and sociological ) .
Soon after the Hearst trial , in 1977 , a pop book advocating the use of brainwashing terminology against new religions was authored by California psychiatrist Paul A. Verdier .
( 21 ) Simultaneously , support for the application of brainwashing theory to the new religions came from legal and sociological sources . ( 22 )
In the meantime , Singer had become involved in a trial in which parents of five members of the Unification Church sought a conservatorship for purposes of " deprogramming " them from their allegiance to the Church 's belief and practice .
Singer testified that the five were in need of treatment and recommended the facilities of the Freedom of Thought Foundation , ( 23 ) an establishment that specialized in talking people out of new religious affiliations .
They had been victims of coercive persuasion ( the term she used from her former mentor Edgar H. Schein ) , and need the " reality therapy " provided by the Foundation .
The court granted the conservatorship , but in what became a landmark case , Katz v. Superior Court ( 1977 ) , the California Appeals Court reversed the decision .
This case although it largely ended the hope of using conservatorship laws in cult cases , did have the effect of publicizing the idea of cultic brainwashing to the general public .
Among the first , and certainly the most important response to the early writings of Singer and her associates came in the article by Thomas Robbins and Dick Anthony , " The Limits of ' Coercive Persuasion ' as an Explanation for Conversion to Authoritarian Sects , " the first article to appear below , ( 24 ) originally published in the Summer 1980 issue of Political Psychology .
While admitting the possible limited use of a " coercive persuasion " model in the study of new religions , Robbins and Anthony argued that the use of such arguments as a justification of deprogramming and legal action was illegitimate .
Such extended uses , they argued , ignored the significant differences between different religious movements , wrongly equate the voluntary affiliation operative in religious groups with the physical constraint working on government operated totalistic institutions ( such as prisons camps ) , lack any evidential support that persons subjected to " coercive persuasion " failed to exercise free will , and rely too heavily on the testimonies of ex-members whose account of life in the group had previously been effected by the work of deprogrammers and / or sessions with a therapist .
( Singer had noted in her Psychology Today article that her view of the new religions had been almost totally formed by her sessions with ex-members , the great majority of whom had come to her only after being deprogrammed . )
Beginning with the Robbins / Anthony article , the issue raised by Singer and her colleagues became a matter of intense debate among sociologists and religious studies scholars .
While many tried to separate that debate from the public controversy over " brainwashing " ( a term which Singer tried completely to avoid ) , such was not possible .
Singer 's most substantive presentation of her position had been placed in a newsstand publication , and legal colleague Richard Delgado followed his initial publication in a law review ( 25 ) with an article for the New York Times .
( 26 ) Those scholars who studied new religions were regularly interviewed by the press concerning their observations .
The debate took place amid the weekly occurrences of deprogrammings , a series of civil lawsuits brought by former members against several new religious groups that resulted in multi-million dollar judgments , and what appeared to be a growing popular prejudice against any group labeled a " cult . "
Those who wrote about new religions did so knowing that every word would be scrutinized for its position vis-a - vis the controversy .
Among the issues rarely discussed was the assumption that many ( hundreds if not thousands ) of the new religious movements existed but data about and attacks upon " cults " was limited to a relative few groups .
Only five groups , the Unification Church , the Divine Light Mission , The Way International , the International Society for Krishna Consciousness , and Church of Scientology , were regularly mentioned with less than twenty additional groups also cited on rare occasions .
As the controversy progressed , it was noted that primary support for the brainwashing / coercive deprogramming position came from psychological clinicians , and that they tended to bolster their attack upon the new religions with claims that cult life produced pathology .
Various reports had suggested that members of cults had inherited problems from their dysfunctional families and joined a new religion to escape from the demands of autonomy .
John Clark , one of the earliest exponents of the brainwashing perspective made broad claims that most cult members were " substantially and chronically " disturbed .
( 27 ) Clark 's claim produced two different responses .
First , those who supported such claims implied , if they did not state , that new religions were best understood as psychological phenomena rather than religious organizations .
If his perspective were to be adopted , it would be assumed that the large amount of scholarly work on new religions was as best irrelevant and in fact , worthless .
Second , others , including Singer , even though she shared a distaste for the new religions with Clark , rejected Clark 's perspective that cults recruited psychologically damaged individuals .
In 1980 , she and West asserted to the contrary that the great majority of adolescents and young adults who joined new religions were not disturbed before joining .
This position allowed them to emphasize that the symptoms which they observed in ex-members were the effect of converting and remaining in a new religion .
Others also expanded upon what they saw as group - generated pathology .
( 28 )
In 1982 , the psychological literature , both that critical of new religious groups and that more supportive , was surveyed and evaluated in an important article by professor of psychiatry Marc Galanter ( later expanded into a book ) .
( 29 ) Adopting the more neutral term " charismatic religious sects , " he discussed issues around the attraction felt by people who experience a high level of distress ( both pathological and nonpathological ) prior to joining a religious group , the process of conversion , and the effects of long - term membership and of leaving an alternative religious group .
Galanter discussed the psychological issues around new religions apart from the emotionally charged language of brainwashing and the manipulation of images of prisoner of war camps , and objectively assessed the presence of psychopathology in some potential recruits and the role that conversion , mystical experiences and group membership played in the over coming of the initial distress .
More importantly , Galanter pointed out the major problem of approaching members of new religions using categories had been developed to deal with mental illness , i.e.. the problem of medicalizing the discussion of new religious groups .
He further notes that the process of joining , being a member , and leaving a new religious group is best described not as a matter of personal pathology but of social adaptation .
For example , experiences that in a secular setting might be considered pathological are , within some religious settings , perfectly normal .
While psychological categories were created to discuss individual dysfunctional behavior , the behavior of group members must be seen in light of group norms .
Thus what may be considered disturbed behavior in a secular setting may be perfectly functional and normal within a group context .
Galanter 's analysis had the effect of reducing the significance of the observed abnormal behavior reported among former members .
He also suggested an alternative means of understanding otherwise inexplicable behavior in members and ex-members without considering them as suffering from psychopathology .
Galanter 's work , along with that of several other psychiatrists who saw members of new religions in nonpathological terms , ( 30 ) provided the substantial challenge to the Singer hypothesis from the psychological community .
While Galanter 's work was being read by psychiatrists and psychologists , on a popular level , Conway and Siegelman were making broad sweeping claims of pathology among the members of the reputed thousands of cults operating in the West .
Though lacking any medical or psychological credentials , in Snapping , they posed the existence of an as yet unknown disease caused by membership in a cult .
This " information disease , " as they termed it , was produced by the manipulation of information by cult leaders .
In essence , they suggested that the individual nervous system is fed by information flowing into it .
The practice of various spiritual disciplines ( from prayer and meditation to chanting and yoga ) shut off the flow of information for long periods of time and created a disorder of awareness .
Going even further , they suggested that the amount of time needed in rehabilitation was directly related to the amount of time a member had spent in group rituals and spiritual practices .
Conway and Siegelman stated in blatantly popular language what Singer had been saying in much more staid terms : membership in cults caused significant pathology and former members required extensive psychological therapy .
And while the approach of Galanter and others suggested nonpathological perspectives for understanding ex-members , clinicians such as Singer continued to see pathology in most ex-members .
This pathology was initially seen as an " atypical dissociative disorder " and also as similar to the " delayed stress syndrome " often experienced by Vietnam War veterans . ( 31 )
If Conway and Siegelman 's work did anything , it spurred research in that most difficult of work areas , ex-members .
While members of new religions could be contacted and studied relatively quickly , former members tended to fade into the larger population and required some effort to locate .
However , researchers quickly noted that Conway and Siegelman 's samples , like those used by Singer , had been drawn from that relatively small group of former members who had associated with the anti-cult movement , some because they had left due to a bad experience in the group , but the great majority because they had been deprogrammed .
These people constituted but a tiny percentage of former members ( 10 to 15 % ) , and were drawn from the same relatively few groups upon which the anti-cult movement was focused .
Attempts to survey and study ex-members was pioneered by J. T. Ungerleider , D. K. Wellisch , Trudy Solomon and Stuart Wright , whose works helped to break many of the stereotypes of former members .
Ungerleider and Wellisch ( 32 ) were among the first to point out significant differences between ex-members who left voluntarily and the those who were deprogrammed , the later group usually going on to become involved with the anti-cult movement and in the practice of deprogramming others .
Solomon and Wright extended the consideration pointing out that those former members involved with the anti-cult movement represented only a very small percentage of former members .
Solomon , found in her study of former members of the Unification Church , that attitude toward the Church were directly related to their method of severing membership ( voluntary or forced ) and their subsequent level of contact with the anti-cult movement ( low to high ) , with the later option correlating with a negative assessment of the Church . ( 33 )
In like measure , Wright found that those who voluntarily left the various controversial new religions rarely adopted brainwashing language to discuss their experience . ( 34 )
Then , spurred by Conway and Siegelman 's rather blatant assertions James R. Lewis and David G. Bromley took the research one step further and tested the claim of harm done to members by cults in their study of ex-members , " The Cult Withdrawal Syndrome : A Case of Misattribution of Cause " ( 1987 ) , ( 35 ) reprinted below .
This study largely laid to rest the continuing issue of pathology among former members of new religions .
Using a more representative sample of former members , Lewis and Bromley measured the presence of the various pathological symptoms that Conway and Siegelman had discovered in their sample of former members ( an extension of the symptoms discussed elsewhere by Singer ) .
While disconfirming many of Conway and Siegelman 's assertions , such as that people who had been in groups longer would show more symptoms , Lewis and Bromley were able to pinpoint the major source of dysfunctional symptoms among ex-members , the process of leaving the group .
Lewis and Bromley considered the presence of symptoms relative to the type of exit from the group .
They divided the sample into those who left voluntarily and received no counseling by individuals associated with the anti-cult movement , those who left and then received some form of voluntary deprogramming ( usually termed exit counseling ) , and those who were involuntarily deprogrammed .
While the entire sample showed significantly lower levels of dysfunctional symptoms than the one reported upon by Conway and Siegelman , it did show a dramatic relationship between the method of leave - taking and the presence of symptoms .
Those associated with the anti-cult movement had measurably higher levels of symptoms , but those who had been deprogrammed had a radically higher number of symptoms than the general sample .
The Lewis and Bromley study became a landmark study in shifting the onus of pathology experienced by former members of new religions from the religions to the coercive activity of the anti-cult movement .
In the wake of this study ( and other works that confirmed its findings ) , treating former members as people in need of psychological help has largely ceased .
The lack of any widespread expressed need for psychological help by the tens of thousands of former members of new religions in the succeeding decade has itself become the strongest evidence refuting the early sweeping condemnation of new religions as causes of psychological trauma . ( 36 )
From DIMPAC to " Fishman "
Through the early and middle 1980s , the brainwashing controversy generated hundreds of papers and several books .
After considering all of the arguments put forth by the exponents of the Singer Hypothesis , and listening to the counter arguments , one point of overwhelming consensus had emerged , that brainwashing was an inadequate model for understanding the dynamics operative in new religious movements .
That consensus was best stated in several documents that appeared as the decade drew to a close and was capped in the U. S. Federal Court decision in the case of U.S. v. Fishman .
The events leading up to Fishman were launched in 1983 when the American Psychological Association ( APA ) , the major professional body of psychologists in the United States formed a task force to study the theories of coercive persuasion as advocated by Margaret Singer .
Appropriately , Singer was selected to chair the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control ( generally referred to by its acronym , DIMPAC ) .
She in turn selected several of her most sympathetic colleagues to assist her , including Dr. Louis J. West , head of UCLA 's Psychoanalytic Institute , and Dr. Michael Langone , a psychologist , an executive with the American Family Foundation , and editor of the Cultic Studies Journal , published by the Foundation ..
As DIMPAC set about gathering the material for its report , other events were occurring on the legal front .
A number of former members , most of whom had been forcefully deprogrammed , filed suits against the more controversial of the new religions .
One of these cases began with the deprogramming of David Molko and Tracey Leal from the Unification Church .
They claimed that they had been deceptively recruited and were caught up in the brainwashing process before they really knew that it was the Unification Church with which they had become affiliated .
When the case came to court in 1986 .
The judge dismissed the case against the Unification Church , but the decision was immediately appealed .
As the case was going through the appeal process , ( 37 ) the APA , through its board , decided to become involved in the case by submitting a friend of the court ( amicus ) brief .
The brief suggested that the idea of brainwashing had no scientific backing .
By the time it was submitted early in 1987 , a number of individual scholars from a variety of academic disciplines who were knowledgeable of the issues involved also signed it .
At a later date , the American Sociological Association also submitted an additional brief .
These briefs became one symbol of the consensus that had emerged over the issue of brainwashing as it applied to new religious movements .
There was an immediate reaction by the members and supporters of the DIMPAC committee who effectively argued that it was not proper for the APA to submit a report that anticipated the finding of one of its own active committees .
APA withdrew its name from the brief ( though the brief remained as part of the court case due to the additional people who had signed it ) .
Within weeks , however , on May 11 , 1987 , the APA 's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility issued its official response to DIMPAC based upon four reviews of the last draft of its report . ( 38 ) The reviews were uniformly negative , and the resulting memorandum to Singer and her cohorts read :
" BSERP thanks the Task Force in Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for its service but is unable to accept the report of the Task Force .
In general , the report lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for the APA imprimatur .
The report was carefully reviewed by two external experts and two members of the Board .
They independently agreed on the significant deficiencies in the report .
The reports are enclosed for your information .
The Board cautions the Task Force members against using their past appointment to imply BSERP or APA support or approval of the positions advocated in the report .
BSERP requests that Task Force members not distribute or publicize the report without indicating that the report is unacceptable to the Board .
Finally , after much consideration , BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue .
The Board appreciates the difficulty in producing a report in this complex and controversial area , and again thanks the members of the Task Force for their efforts . "
( A more complete discussion of the events surrounding the APA memorandum and the memorandum itself with the two publicly released enclosures are reprinted below in this book . )
The APA documents further stated the scholarly consensus of the inadequacies of the coercive persuasion hypothesis as developed by Singer and applied to new religious movements .
By the time of the APA decision concerning the DIMPAC report , several scholars had already reached the conclusion that a more definitive refutation of the Singer hypothesis was needed especially as it had been developed in [ by that time ] her more than thirty legal depositions and court appearances .
Several researchers began to assemble a set of her testimonies .
However , it was psychologist Dick Anthony who in the end produced the most thorough study of Singer 's views and offered what has remained the most important response to them : his lengthy paper , " Religious Movements and ' Brainwashing ' Litigation : Evaluating Key Testimony " that appeared in the second edition of the textbook , In Gods We Trust : New Patterns of Religious Pluralism in America ( 1989 ) . ( 39 )
Anthony noted the problem that he and others had in attempting to refute Singer .
Her theory " has never been published and thus has not been available for scholarly evaluation and critique .
Indeed , review of her testimony in these cases reveals that her trial testimony differs quite significantly from the views expressed in her publications in this topic . "
( 40 ) As her position had evolved , Singer had come to refer to the " Systematic Manipulation of Social and Psychiatric Influence " ( SMSPI ) which , as utilized by cult groups , could deprive individuals of their free will in the absence of physical force or threats .
Singer argued this point in , for example , the Robin George case [ a case against the International Society for Krishna Consciousness ] , and grounded her testimony by reference to the body of material built up during the study of the prisoners from the Korean War and the Chinese thought reform institutions as studied by Robert J. Lifton and her own professor , Edgar Schein .
In the cases in which she testified , Singer argued that cults exerted such influence on the mental processes of their recruits that their power to exercise their free will was overridden .
It is this very idea , popularly called brainwashing , which had been discredited by the work of Lifton and Schein , and had never gained any scientific credibility .
And was this very idea that she had avoided stating in many of her published works , as had , for example Conway and Siegelman .
Anthony appears to have been the first to note the gap between her published articles and her testimony , to gather the relevant documents , and to pursue the idea in several articles and court documents .
Anthony 's article responds to Singer 's testimony in relation to the Kelley - Frye Standard , which is the rule determining the admissibility of expert testimony in the courts in California .
To meet the Standard , such testimony must be an application of a theoretical foundation which has been generally accepted in the relevant scientific community .
Previously Singer had claimed that her theory was primarily based upon the research on communist thought reform by Lifton and Schein .
Anthony argued in his article that Singer 's testimony confused two different approaches to evaluating Communist Chinese interrogation and indoctrination methods which were actually antithetical to each other , i.e. the brainwashing paradigm which had been rejected by a consensus of qualified scientists , on the one hand , and the views of Lifton , Schein and other recognized experts on the other .
According to Anthony , the brainwashing paradigm was and is actually pseudoscience .
It began as a propaganda ploy which was developed by the American CIA to counter Communist propaganda that clamed that Western POWs in Korea and civilian prisoners on the Communist mainland were converting to Communism .
The " brainwashing hoax " , as it was referred to by one researcher , claimed that the Communists had invented scientific techniques of coercive persuasion capable of forcing people to convert to Communism against their wills .
The essence of the brainwashing notion is that people are put into a hyper - suggestible altered state of consciousness through hypnosis , drugs , debilitation or other means , and then their worldviews are transformed against their wills through conditioning techniques .
Anthony demonstrated that Lifton 's and Schein 's research refuted the brainwashing paradigm in eight major respects .
For instance none of their subjects actually converted to Communism at any point .
Rather they had merely behaved as if they were being influenced by Communist propaganda because of the plausible threat of extreme physical coercion .
Moreover , those few of their subjects who had been slightly influenced by Communist indoctrination differed from the great majority of their subjects because of motives and personality characteristics that existed prior to their Communist indoctrination which predisposed them to respond favorably to totalitarian propaganda , rather than because they had been placed in an altered state of consciousness and then been conditioned to change their worldviews .
The bottom line is that the brainwashing paradigm is actually the polar opposite of the theories of Schein and Lifton in that their research indicates that the Communists did not have techniques capable of converting individuals to Communism against their wills whereas the brainwashing idea claims the opposite .
In his article , Anthony quoted repeatedly from Singer 's testimony in cultic brainwashing cases and demonstrated that her testimony was based upon the discredited brainwashing paradigm and was not based upon the views of Lifton and Schein .
Consequently , Anthony argued Singer 's testimony was not based upon a generally accepted scientific theory and thus she should be excluded under the Frye Standard from testifying in cultic brainwashing cases .
By the time Anthony 's article appeared he had used its basic arguments in a several lawsuits involving Singer 's testimony .
Actually , he had initially articulated this argument in the sections of an amicus curiae brief , written at the invitation of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion [ SSSR ] , which was submitted in 1987 in the appeal of the trial verdict in George v. ISKCON , a case in which an ex-member had initially won a $ 10,000,000 judgment largely on the basis of Singer 's testimony that she had been brainwashed .
In this effort Anthony collaborated with sociologist James T. Richardson who contributed a section comparing Singer 's research ( negatively ) to current research on new religious movements .
The appeal was largely successful , and thus Singer 's brainwashing testimony in this case was largely nullified .
Over the next few years , Anthony 's argument was used in a variety of cases as the basis for either appeal briefs or for motions in limine with the result that Singer 's testimony was largely nullified by this approach , either because the trial judgment was overturned on appeal , as in Kropinsky vs. Transcendental Meditation , or because the case was settled out of court as soon as the argument was submitted in the form of a motion in limine .
Anthony had made his assessment of Singer 's thought as the Molko / Leal case was proceeding and where it appeared that the legal status of her theoretical construct would be decided .
However , before that confrontation occurred , the Molko / Leal case was settled out of court and the scene of the critique shifted to another case , which unlike many of the previous cult - related cases was a criminal , not a civil , case .
Stephen Fishman was standing trial on charges of mail fraud .
A former member of the Church of Scientology , Fishman pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity .
He did the deeds enumerated in his indictment only because , he claimed , he had been brainwashed in Scientology .
Singer and her colleague Richard Ofshe , a professor of sociology at the University of California - Berkeley , submitted briefs on behalf of the defense .
In the Fishman case Anthony wrote several lengthy documents expanding his critique of the Singer hypothesis and the contradiction it had with its claimed theoretical foundation , i.e. , Lifton 's and Schein 's research .
Both the APA and ASA briefs originally submitted in the Molko / Leal case and the SSSR brief in the George case were also submitted .
Anthony then argued that the fact that these three leading professional organizations had produced these briefs countering Singer 's theory was additional indication that this theory was not generally accepted in the relevant scientific communities , and hence should be excluded under the Kelley - Frye Standard ..
Also submitting a declaration in U.S. v. Fishman was Perry London ( d. 1993 ) the distinguished professor of psychiatry and dean of the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychiatry at Rutgers University .
His deposition in the case , reproduced below , reaffirmed the APA response to the DIMPAC report and Anthony 's assessment of Singer and Ofshe 's use of the robot brainwashing theory which they confused with Schein 's coercive persuasion approach , but made an additional contribution in its detailing the lack of empirical evidence that had been accumulated by Singer and other proponents of her theory over the fifteen years they had been proposing it .
Singer had acknowledged in a paper submitted in the Fishman case the lack of controlled studies .
London drives home the failure to provide supporting evidence of such a unique theory as that offered by Singer and Ofshe , one that has been almost uniformly rejected in the scientific literature .
In this regard , he conducted an independent search of the previous fifteen years of psychological literature covering 1400 journals in 29 languages .
His search yielded " no empirical studies " supportive of her position and only a modest number of speculative / theoretical articles .
London 's work drove another nail in the coffin into which the Singer hypothesis had been placed by the APA and then by Anthony 's work .
Echoing
Anthony , he concludes most forcefully , " ... that what I have called the Robot Theory , meaning any theory of social influence processes and / or irreversible social influence processes and / or subversion of the will as a result of these social influence processes , does not present an argument which is generally accepted in contemporary scientific psychology .
That is the main reason I believe that this topic has not been the object of scientific study and research in general and is not widely discussed in the literature of the social , behavioral , or medical sciences . "
These closing words again states the consensus which had been reached by the scholarly community .
Based on Anthony 's several documents and London 's declaration , attorney 's representing the government moved to exclude the testimony of Ofshe and Singer .
The court granted the motion .
The complete published ruling excluding Singer 's and Ofshe 's testimony is reproduced below .
It offers both an insight into American law , and the principles upon which expert testimony is admitted into court , and the careful consideration given by the judge in making his ruling .
The court concluded :
" Although Dr. Singer and Dr. Ofshe are respected members of their fields , their theories regarding the coercive persuasion practiced by religious cults are not sufficiently established to be admitted as evidence in federal law courts . "
A further argument was introduced concerning Fishman 's reputed " diminished capacity , " an attribute that differs from insanity but also suggested that he was not totally responsible for his actions .
Again , the Court excluded Singer 's and Ofshe 's testimony as what they would offer relative to diminished capacity would be drawn from their previously rejected theory of coercive persuasion .
The 1990s
Following their exclusion from the Fishman case and the publication of the ruling , Singer and Ofshe tried to present testimony in other cases , but , with the appearance of the arguments and documents from the Fishman case , they were systematically challenged and excluded ( or in cases where a negative ruling on their appearance seemed forthcoming withdrew ) .
Both were at this time devoting a considerable amount of their work time , in Singer 's case almost all , to preparing for and testifying in various court cases .
The widely reported exclusion of Ofshe and Singer from testifying both hurt their professional standing and cut into their income .
In reaction , the pair filed a lawsuit in Federal Court charging that they had been the victims of a conspiracy by the APA and a number of individual scholars to destroy their reputations and income .
The suit was dismissed before coming to trial , but within weeks a substantially similar suit claiming defamation was filed in the state of California .
Again , the suit was dismissed at the initial hearing , however , in this case it was dismissed with prejudice and additionally , the judge accepted a counter motion , termed a SLAPP motion ) by the defendants that ordered Singer and Ofshe to pay their considerable legal fees .
SLAPP ( Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation ) laws were put in place to prevent defamation lawsuits that have no proper basis but are designed to suppress free speech because of the prohibitive cost of defending against them
In order to succeed on a SLAPP motion , the defense has to show that the grounds of the lawsuit are so far - fetched that the plaintiffs have to be aware that they could not succeed and are filing the suit only to suppress free speech ( in this case discussion of the inadequacies of the Singer hypothesis ) .
Through the 1990s , the challenges to testimony by experts on brainwashing theory has led to significant alteration in civil litigation by ex-members against new religions ( and the other organizations that , according to Singer , practiced coercive persuasion ) .
Most importantly , it ended the series of cases against New Religions that began with a member of the group being forcefully deprogrammed and then turning on the group and suing it .
After Fishman , there was a marked decline in forceful deprogramming ( it being replaced with a more acceptable non-coercive exit counseling ) and served as a warning to those organizations that supported it .
While the number of involuntary deprogrammings had dropped significantly , they still occasionally occurred .
In those cases , should a deprogramming fail , and subsequently the deprogrammers were arrested and tried , they often pleaded that their questionable actions were justified in their attempt to halt the damage being done by cult brainwashing .
However , in the wake of Fishman , any prospective deprogrammer had to face the possibility that s/he would be left without help from experts like Singer as a legal shield from criminal laws against kidnapping and confining a person and civil laws against violating that individual 's civil rights .
Deprogrammer Rick Ross found himself in just that position after he failed in his attempt to deprogram one Jason Scott , a member of the United Pentecostal Church , a large Christian denomination .
In suing Ross , Scott also named the Cult Awareness Network ( CAN ) , the major group advocating efforts against new religious movements .
Though the Cult Awareness Network publicly stated that it was not directly involved in any deprogramming activity , Scott charged it with being the referral agent that allowed his mother to get in touch with Ross .
The jury agreed and , without the ability to argue that the church had " brainwashed " Scott , both Ross and CAN received hefty judgments .
The million dollar judgment forced CAN into bankruptcy and eventually some of its assets , including its name , were purchased by a coalition of a number of the groups it had specialized in attacking .
That decision has been sustained on appeal .
That coalition now operates a new Cult Awareness Network .
( 41 ) The fall of the Cult Awareness Network was a major setback for the anti-cult movement in the English - speaking world .
Current Status ( 42 )
Since the late 1980s , though a significant public belief in cult - brainwashing remains , the academic community - including scholars from psychology , sociology , and religious studies - have shared an almost unanimous consensus that the coercive persuasion / brainwashing thesis proposed by Margaret Singer and her colleagues in the 1980s is without scientific merit .
To date , no one has come forward to refute the arguments , especially those advanced by Dick Anthony a decade ago , nor has the situation that Perry London found concerning articles providing an empirical base for the theory been reversed .
Through the 1990s , it has been difficult to locate any scholar in the English - speaking world who has been willing to attempt a defense of it , and even Singer herself has appeared to back away from her earlier position .
( 43 ) After the fall of the Cult Awareness Network , only one American organization , the American Family Foundation , continued to offer any support for the coercive persuasion argument .
Early in 1999 , a second organization , The Leo J. Ryan Foundation , has emerged to fill the vacuum left by the former CAN .
Almost all of the small cadre of scholars in North America who have persisted in their belief in the brainwashing theory are affiliated with one of these two organizations . ( 44 )
While the scholarly community largely put further discussion of the brainwashing question aside in the late 1980s , public interest and discussion has continued and it has been an issue that has continued to crept into court cases , especially family court cases .
It was most visible in media articles written by reporters unfamiliar with the history of the discussion in the 1980s who adopted the idea from their contact with anti-cult activists , most notably around the time of the tragic incidents surrounding the Branch Davidians at Waco , the deaths of the leaders of the Solar Temple , or the gassing of the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo .
These more recent incidents provided the context of a set of lectures by psychologist Newton Malony .
Malony , the senior professor at the famed Graduate School of Psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary , was invited to deliver the Seminary 's annual Integration Lectures in 1996 .
Having spent a considerable amount of time studying the issue over the previous two decades , he chose " Brainwashing and Religion " as his subject .
The complete text of the three lectures are included below , as they not only provide a fresh discussion of the case against the idea of brainwashing as applied to religious organizations , but offers a picture of the manner in which the term " brainwashing " still pops up as a label to denigrate unpopular minority religious groups .
Additionally , Malony presents a more positive psychologically - grounded perspective of the manner in which religious groups work to transform the lives of adherents ..
Malony argues , with the mass of social and psychological literature to back him up , that " social influence " occurs .
That while he personally ( along with the entire field of clinical psychology ) aims at producing individuals with strong egos , capable of individual self - determination , he cannot escape the fact that none of us can escape from the effects of personal interactions with others and social organizations ( from nations to families ) to which we belong .
There is no act that is totally autonomous .
That people have the privilege and responsibility to determine their life for themselves , complete self - determination is at best a heuristic goal .
At times , individuals make decisions which most ( family members , neighbors , friends , fellow employees ) consider unwise , including the choice to join an unpopular religious organization .
Malony goes on to emphasize that continuing problems with individuals who join new religious movements can be most fruitfully discussed in the light commonly accepted understandings of differing levels of social influence apart from any need to refer to any extraordinary theories such as brainwashing .
Malony is also aware that there is evil in the world and that religious groups ( be they old or new , mainline or fringe ) are not immune to its presence .
Thus , religious groups are not to be supported when either corporately , or through individual leaders , psychological harm or physical violence is perpetrated on group members or society .
Psychologists have been most aware of the many cases of child abuse that have come to light in a spectrum of groups ranging from the Roman Catholic Church to The Family .
However , the problem of people suffering because of evil activity by a religious organization is by no means simply a " cult " problem , as has been amply demonstrated , for example , by recent incidents of terrorism in Northern Ireland , the Islamic targeting of Salmon Rushdie , or the massacres in Rwanda .
Such activity is to be condemned wherever it occurs , but the fact that some new religions have perpetrated such acts is no justification to condemn the many others who have been free of any hint of illegal or violent activity .
By the time Malony delivered his lectures on " Brainwashing and Religion , " the issue in America had become one basically of informing a new generation of the previous debates on the subject and insuring that future generations would not repeat the mistakes of the past .
However , just as the concept of brainwashing as proposed by Singer and others in the 1980s had been largely resolved in the United States ( and simultaneously through the English - speaking world ) , several European countries were deeply affected by the violent incidents perpetrated by the Solar Temple and Aum Shinrikyo , and many were led to consider the possibility that there might be something to the old brainwashing hypothesis , now recast as a theory of " mental manipulation . "
Since the major debates had occurred in the English - speaking work , many Europeans have been unaware of the earlier debate and until now the major documents were unavailable in any but the English language .
Thus , in recent years , legislators , urged on by proponents of the " mental manipulation " theory , have been asked to create new laws , regulations , and government agencies aimed at curbing minority religious communities .
At the same time courts have been asked to bring in negative rulings based upon testimony of experts in the now rejected brainwashing or " mental manipulation " perspective .
It is to this contemporary reemergence of brainwashing theory in Europe and the possible legal implications that sociologist and lawyer James T. Richardson closes out this section of material on the brainwashing debate with his 1996 article , " Brainwashing Claims and Minority Religions Outside of the United States . "
He makes note of the status of the brainwashing theory and points out the possible dangers to religious freedom should it be utilized by governments attempting to react to the smaller religious groups in their midst .
Richardson thus points to a sense of urgency and additional rationale for the publication of this anthology .
In Conclusion
As stated earlier , the brainwashing debate in the United States produced hundreds of articles and a number of books , and this anthology does not pretend to be even a representative sample .
If space had allowed , a number of additional highly insightful papers could have been included .
However , choices had to be made , and those papers which were chosen were those that proved most important , both because of their timeliness in moving the debate forward or in their initially treating key points in the debate , or in clearly stating the position that has been assumed by the community of scholars who have given their time to the problem .
My apologies to those of my colleagues whose additional worthy papers also stand in need of translation and further circulation .
Apologies aside , it is also my hope that the selection of papers chosen will make available to our German - speaking colleagues the treatment given to the idea of brainwashing as it applies to religious groups during the last two decades .
In presenting this work , it is our hope that this anthology can provide helpful insights as the question of " sects " in Europe is pursued .
A new religious world is now being created by a new generation of religious adherents in the post - secular environment emerging at the twentieth century comes to an end .
During the last generation , the Western world has made a quantum leap beyond Christendom and the secular society that has replaced it toward the development of a new religious order that includes significant Islamic , Buddhist , and Hindu communities joining the older Jewish and Western Esoteric groupings .
The future task for cultural leaders is the creation of structures in which these very different religious communities , some large , some small , can live and work with the older Christian Churches and mutually contribute to the welfare of the nations in which they find themselves .
In such a context , freeing ourselves from labels such as " brainwashing " and the suspicions it arouses seems a necessary component of arriving at a harmonious future .

Afterword
As this anthology was being put together , sociologist Benjamin Zablocki , who had been an active participant in the discussions on brainwashing in the aftermath of the APA decision to submit a brief in Molko / Leal case , emerged with a call for a new dialogue on the issue of brainwashing and proposed what he saw was a more concise and " scientific " statement of what he termed the brainwashing conjecture .
While he has yet to offer a detailed presentation of his approach along with the empirical data to back it , he has suggested a new definition of brainwashing
As he states it ,
" The core hypothesis is that , under certain circumstances , an individual can be subject to persuasive influences so overwhelming that they actually restucture one 's core beliefs and worldview and profoundly remodel one 's self conception .
...
The more radical sort of persuasion posited by the brainwashing conjecture utilizes extreme stress and disorientation along with ideological enticement to create a conversion experience that persists for some time after the stress and pressure have been removed ... " ( 45 )
While devoid of Singer 's understanding of the importance of the recruitment process , at first reading Zablocki appears to be offering yet another restatement of the essence of the older rejected brainwashing hypothesis with a focus upon the activity of the group as a change agent operating upon an essentially passive individual .
At the same time he has specifically attempted to distance his defense of the term from Singer 's egregious statement about brainwashing overriding freewill .
( 46 ) Zablocki has subsequently authored several additional papers on the subject ( 47 ) though it is yet to be seen whether he will be able to attract any additional support within the academy .
Soon after the appearance of Zablocki 's initial article , a brief but significant statement , " On Using the Term ' Cult , " by two leading spokespersons for the American Family Foundation , Herbert Rosedale and Michael Langone ( who had set on the DIMPAC task force ) , was included in the Fall 1998 AFF Newsletter . ( 48 ) This article which quote several sociologists on the issue of cults ( including Zablocki ) offers a position striking different from that traditionally associated with AFF .
Specifically , Rosedale and Langone distanced themselves from the idea of a necessary connection between groups previously labeled as " cults " and the thought reform process .
They suggest that groups exist on a continuum from those that might practice coercive persuasion ( in the more common manner that people such as Richard Ofshe and Margaret Singer have defined it ) to those that do not .
They also suggest that groups may vary both geographically and through time .
( 49 ) That is , a group in one location may practice coercive persuasion while elsewhere it does not and a group that at one time practiced coercive persuasion may drop the practice .
The writings of Zablocki ( including his stated willingness to discard the label " brainwashing " ) and this most recent statement from the AFF suggest the possibility of a new dialogue which focuses upon what almost all would agree are the remaining important issues , the degree of danger that new religious groups pose , the nature of that danger , the ability we have to distinguish destructive groups from more benign groups , and the integration of our knowledge of newer smaller religions into our knowledge of the older larger ones .
NOTES
1 During the 1970s , concern over new religions also developed in Europe .
However , European writers have generally not worked with the two categories of " cult ' and " sect " by which to distinguish new religious movements ( " cults " ) from the older church movements that dissented from the larger mainline and state - supported churches ( " sects " ) .
Thus , all new religions have been considered as " sects " and the eighteenth and nineteenth century sectarian groups have frequently been lumped together with the newer Eastern and occult groups .
Some German writers distinguished the new groups as " youth religions , " religions that led youth on flights of fancy that would prevent their becoming contributing members of society .
However , only in the 1990s did a form of the brainwashing hypothesis gain a significant audience , primarily in French - speaking countries .

3 At the time of the Hearst case , Singer was a relatively minor figure who had previously appeared as a junior co-author on several of Edgar Schein 's articles that had drawn upon his research on the Korean prisoner 's of war .
Singer had not actually participated in direct research on the prisoners , and she moved on before Schein completed his more important research on the victims of Chinese thought reform .

7 Lifton also suggested another factor that might be working in the lives of those prisoners who gave into the thought reform process - prior ideological perspectives .
That is , those prisoners who gave in had some leftist leanings prior to their encounter with the idea that their captors wished them to adopt .

13 Lifton also studied a different phenomenon , the effect of what he called a totalistic environment ( outside direct physical coercion ) on individual beliefs and attitudes .
He studied this environment in early Red China and , later , in Nazi Germany .
He emphasized that different individuals react differently to a totalistic environment based on their character and the effects of early education .
In further works , he concluded that a totalistic environment may be replicated on a smaller scale by some religious movements or cults ( see his The Future of Immortality and Other Essays for a Nuclear Age , New York : Basic Books , 1987 : 209-219 ) , and even agreed to write a cautious preface to Margaret Singer 's book ( written with Janja Lalich ) , Cults in Our Midst : The Hidden Menace in our Everyday Life ( San Francisco : Jossey - Bass Publishers , 1995 ) .
Whatever his sympathies for various figures in the anti-cult camp , Lifton was , however , always careful not to lend support to any " robot " or " crude " theory of brainwashing , as such theories directly contradict his original research findings .

36 In relieving groups of the stigma from early psychological condemnations does not , of course , find them guiltless of occasionally causing harm to members that might later manifest as a need for counseling .
For example , as with some of the larger religions , some new religions have been the sight of cases of both physical and sexual child abuse .
Victims of such behavior , no matter where they have experienced it , may often require some extended counseling to recover .
37 In the end , the case was settled out of court when the Church produced strong evidence refuting the plaintiffs ' claim that they did not know that they were joining in a Unification Church activity .
38 Singer and other members of the committee later claimed that the APA 's rejection of the DIMPAC report was invalid as they had examined an early draft rather than the final draft that would have been much better .
In fact , this was not the case .
The reviewers did examine the final draft of the text that was missing only a few additional references .

41 Officially , the Coalition that formed after the Scott decision pursued ( and continues to pursue ) the purchase of the assets of the bankrupt Cult Awareness Network and established the board that now controls the new CAN .
However , it is also the case that the Church of Scientology has been the most powerful member of this coalition .
Following the resolution of its problems with the American Internal Revenue Service , Scientology 's leaders targeted the Cult Awareness Network .
In this regard they supported individual church members who filed a variety of lawsuits against CAN , and through the many depositions taken in these suits acquired considerable data as to the internal workings of the network , especially the manner in which referrals were made to deprogrammers .
Following the filing of the Scott case , the Church encouraged one of the attorneys who had been active in a number of Scientology lawsuits , and who had taken many of the depositions in the recent CAN cases , to offer his service to Scott .
He tried and won the case and has actively continued to participate in the on - going litigation growing out of it .
Additionally , although all members of the coalition have financially supported the new CAN , Scientology has been the largest financial backer .
CAN operates in offices near to Scientology headquarters in Hollywood , California , and its new director is also a Scientologist .
42 Although this essay has focused upon the brainwashing debate in the United States , the debate was occurring in Canada , the United Kingdom , and Australia at the same time , and scholars from each of these countries also contributed their effort toward its final resolution .
It was the case , however , that it was in American based professional groups ( the American Psychological Association , the American Sociological Association , and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion ) that the scholarly consensus were definitively stated and in an American court that the key decision on brainwashing theory published .
43 See the very weak presentation of a position on brainwashing developed in Singer 's 1995 book written with Janja Lalich , Cults in Our Midst : The Hidden Menace in our Everyday Life .
44 Through the 1990s , a few articles have appeared in professional sources restating Singer 's thesis , usually in the more ambiguous manner that typified her own published writings .
Cf. , Doni P. Whitsett , " A Self Psychological Approach to the Cult Phenomenon , " Clinical Social Work Journal 20 , 4 ( Winter 1992 ) : 363-74 .
45 He goes on to add : " The brainwashing conjecture attempts to explain the life style modifications of a NRM participant as the behavioral result of an intensely focused and highly structured process of manipulative influence .
The influencing agent is a cohesive normative group with total or near total control of the social and physical environment ( often although not always communal in organization ) acting at the behest of a charismatic leader .
The target of the influence is always an isolated individual , frequently an adolescent or young adult . "

48 " On Using the term ' Cult " is taken from an AFF " Resource Guide , " the complete text of which can be found on the AFF website : www.csj.org.
49 The obvious implication of the position articulated by Rosedale and Langone , that groups previously called cults exist along a continuum , is that prior to labeling any group a destructive cult , some actual study of the group has to be made .
Given the fact that only a small percentage of the several hundred new religions have been studied at any depth , sweeping charges about all new religions being " destructive cults , " or the assembling of a list of such groups based purely upon their unfamiliarity or minority status in the culture ( as recently occurred in France ) are meaningless and should be dropped .

David Garrett faces an anxious wait
to the violinist
To drop a much - loved instrument is accident enough .
But when it is a violin worth a cool million - and it's the tool of your trade as a virtuoso - it is unfortunate indeed .
This is the fate that befell David Garrett after performing in London in December .
The German musician slipped down a flight of stairs and landed on his violin case , badly cracking the fiddle inside - a 1772 violin made by Giovanni Guadagnini , who called himself an " alumnus of Stradivarius " .
A violin case acts like a skull , protecting what 's inside .
But if too badly shaken , the violin - like a brain - can be damaged .
THE ANSWER Collect all pieces and fragments Restorer takes months to ease these back into place Cracks invisible after repair
Fall destroys rare violin
" You have to very carefully make sure that the broken parts match up perfectly , so any slivers of wood that came loose are put into place , " says David Morris , director of restorers J&A Beare , whose colleague in New York has seen the broken violin .
" There 's a very famous Stradivarius cello that had its front replaced by a notable Spanish maker .
That 's the old way of restoration , to throw away the broken part and make your own replacement .
Today we would piece it back together again from the original fragments . "

" If you walked into our workshop today , it would look like the set of a film about a violin - maker from several hundred years ago , " says Mr Morris .
" But we also use ultra-violet light and endoscopes , which allow you to see inside and take photos , rather than take the top off the instrument . "
He likens this to keyhole surgery - where once surgeons opened up a patient , some procedures are now possible via tiny incisions .
Crack 'd side to side
The broken violin will take at least eight months to repair .
" There are two major cracks on the top on the table where the f - holes are .
And two went straight through the soundpost , which is always the bad spot to hit , " Garrett says .
" There are three major cracks from the top to the bottom , as well as a couple of cracks on the side , which do n't really affect the sound that much , but they look very ugly . "
What makes repairing a violin so fiddly is its arched body .
Once the broken fragments are eased back into place , the next step is to apply pressure so the glue holds .
" You ca n't let the pieces slip out of alignment .
The restorer will take days and days and months and months on this , " says Mr Morris .
GUADAGNINI 1711 - 86 Student of Antonio Stradivari Himself a great violin maker Sale prices up to £ 1 m , while Strads can fetch $ 5 m +
" The soundpost is vulnerable as there is so much pressure on it from the weight of the bridge , which holds up the taut strings .
I 'd say 80 % of violins today have a patch under the soundpost .
It 's a weak point , " says Mr Morris .
And whereas joins were once smoothed then revarnished , today the aim is to disturb as little of the original varnish as possible .
There has never been a conclusive answer as to what gives a Stradivarius its distinctive bright sound , but one widely - held theory emphasises the role of the varnish .
So can an extensively repaired violin still be claimed as a Guadagnini or Stradivarius ?
" It depends how much has had to be replaced , rather than restored , " says Mr Morris .
" If someone has a liver transplant , who are they ?
A Stradivarius violin with one rib of the six replaced is still a Strad .
That said , the necks of all Stradivariuses are relatively new as these wear out - and they are not intrinsic to the sound . "
As for Garrett , he now plays a replacement Stradivarius supplied by Mr Morris 's firm , but eagerly awaits the return of his patched - up Guadagnini .

The test chamber is one of the biggest in Europe Engineer Neil Wallace peers into a huge vacuum chamber designed to replicate - as far as possible - the conditions of space .
Cryogenic pumps can be heard in the background , whistling away like tiny steam engines .
Using helium gas as a coolant , they can bring down the temperature in the vacuum chamber to an incredibly chilly 20 Kelvin ( - 253C ) .
The pressure , meanwhile , can drop to a millionth of an atmosphere .
This laboratory in a leafy part of Hampshire is where defence and security firm Qinetiq develops and tests its ion engines - a technology that will take spacecraft to the planets , powered by the Sun .
Ion engines are an " electric propulsion system " .
They make use of the fact that a current flowing across a magnetic field creates an electric field directed sideways to the current .
This is used to accelerate a beam of ions ( charged atoms ) of xenon away from the spacecraft , thereby providing thrust .
Neil Wallace , technical lead of the electrical propulsion team at Qinetiq , winds open the door of the testing chamber .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He points to some large metal blocks at the bottom of the chamber .
" These are the xenon pumps and these are cooled down by the helium compressors to approximately 20 degrees Kelvin , " he explains .
" So any gas atoms that strike those panels , they freeze .
After you 've been running the engines for a number of hours you can see a frost - it looks like snow - which is actually frozen air and xenon . "
During testing , the engine fires ions towards the opposite end of the chamber , which has a protective coating of graphite .
" The ions are travelling very fast , at approximately 50 km a second , " he says .
" When they strike the other end of the chamber , they actually knock atoms off the surfaces they strike ; it 's analogous to sand - blasting on an atomic level . "
Cruise control
The ion engine developed by Qinetiq , the T5 , will be flown for the first time on the European Space Agency 's Goce spacecraft .
The mission will fly just 200 - 300 km above the Earth , mapping the tiny variations in its gravity field .
GOCE - EUROPE'S GRAVITY EXPLORER 1 .
The 1,100kg Goce is built from rigid materials and carries fixed solar wings .
The gravity data must be clear of spacecraft ' noise '
2 . Solar cells produce 1,300W and cover the Sun- facing side of Goce ; the near side ( as shown ) radiates heat to keep it cool 3 .
The 5 m - by - 1 m frame incorporates fins to stabilise the spacecraft as it flies through the residual air in the thermosphere 4 .
Goce 's accelerometers measure accelerations that are as small as 1 part in 10,000,000,000,000 of the gravity experienced on Earth 5 .
The UK - built engine ejects xenon ions at velocities exceeding 40,000 m /s ; Goce 's mission will end when the 40kg fuel tank empties 6 . S Band antenna : Data downloads to the Kiruna ( Sweden ) ground station .
Processing , archiving is done at Esa 's centre in Frascati , Italy 7 .
GPS antennas : Precise positioning of Goce is required , but GPS data in itself can also provide some gravity field information

A replica of the T5 engine sits in the test facility at Qinetiq .
It is tiny - weighing 3kg , and looks rather like the oil filter of a car .
Yet despite this humble appearance , it took 20 to 30 years to develop , at a cost of tens of millions of pounds .
In space , ion engines will draw electric power from solar panels , generating a thrust equivalent to the weight of a postcard .
This incredibly gentle thrust could , in theory , take a spacecraft beyond our Solar System , if sustained for long enough .
Goce is staying very close to Earth , flying in an ultra - low orbit , where it will encounter wisps of air .
The benefit of an ion engine on this mission is to provide drag compensation , or cruise control .
" This spacecraft is [ travelling ] at a speed of about eight and a half kilometres per second , " says Neil Wallace .
" As it travels around the Earth , it 's going through the upper atmosphere and it experiences a buffeting .
" They need to compensate that buffeting very accurately and that 's what we 're doing , so we 're actually providing cruise control for that spacecraft . "
Real flight Ion engines of various types are becoming increasingly common on space missions , including Smart - 1 , the European mission to the Moon , and Nasa 's Deep Space 1 , which flew by a comet .
The T5 ion engine being tested Future Esa missions such as BepiColombo , bound for the innermost planet , Mercury , will also use the technology .
Qinetiq gets to test its T5 engine for real this summer , when Goce is launched from the Russian space port of Plesetsk .
It will go up on the same type of rocket that failed three years ago , destroying Europe 's Cryosat ice mission .
Neil Wallace says the nature of the space business makes watching any launch a dramatic event .
" You spend 10 years working on a mission , treating the components and equipment like a newborn baby .
You never take it out of the clean room , and then you put in on the top of 100 tonnes of high explosive and set light to it , " he says , laughing nervously .
" But no , the most exciting time for us will be when that spacecraft comes over the horizon and the ground station picks it up , and you can see the engines are doing what we 've always said they will do . "

What are these ?
The Nobel Prize - winning economist Milton Friedman once said , " One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results . "
When Congress passed legislation to greatly expand America 's commitment to biofuels , it intended to create energy independence and protect the environment .
But the results have been quite different .
America remains equally dependent on foreign sources of energy , and new evidence suggests that ethanol is causing great harm to the environment .
In recent weeks , the correlation between government biofuel mandates and rapidly rising food prices has become undeniable .
At a time when the U.S. economy is facing recession , Congress needs to reform its " food - to - fuel " policies and look at alternatives to strengthen energy security .
On Dec. 19 , 2007 , President Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act .
This legislation had several positive features , including higher fuel standards for cars and greater investment in renewable energies such as solar power .
However , the bill required a huge spike in the biofuel production requirement , from 7.5 billion gallons in 2012 to 36 billion in 2022 .
This was a well - intentioned measure , but it was also impractical .
Nearly all our domestic corn and grain supply is needed to meet this mandate , robbing the world of one of its most important sources of food .
We are already seeing the ill effects of this measure .
Last year , 25 % of America 's corn crop was diverted to produce ethanol .
In 2008 , that number will grow to 30 % - 35 % , and it will soar even higher in the years to come .
Furthermore , the trend of farmers supplanting other grains with corn is decreasing the supply of numerous agricultural products .
When the supply of those products goes down , the price inevitably goes up .
Subsequently , the cost of feeding farm and ranch animals increases and the cost is passed to consumers of beef , poultry and pork products .
Since February 2006 , the price of corn , wheat and soybeans has increased by more than 240 % .
Rising food prices are hitting the pockets of lower - income Americans and people who live on fixed incomes .
While the blame for higher costs should n't rest exclusively with biofuels — drought and rising oil costs are contributing factors — the expansion of biofuels has been a major source of the problem .
The International Food Policy Research Institute estimates that biofuel production accounts for between one - quarter and one - third of the recent spike in global commodity prices .
For the first time in 30 years , food riots are breaking out in many parts of the globe , including major countries such as Mexico , Pakistan and Indonesia .
The fact that America 's energy policies are creating global instability should concern the leaders of both political parties .
Restraining the dangerous effects of artificially inflated demand for ethanol should be an issue that unites both conservatives and progressives .
As a recent Time cover story pointed out , biofuel mandates increase greenhouse gasses and create incentives for global deforestation .
In the Amazon basin , huge swaths of forest are being cleared to meet the growing hunger for biofuels .
In addition , relief organizations are facing gaping shortfalls as the cost of food outpaces their ability to provide aid for the 800 million people who lack food security .
The recent food crisis does not mean we should entirely abandon biofuels .
The best way to lower energy prices , and reduce our dependence on foreign oil , is to accelerate production of all forms of domestic energy .
Expanding biofuels while refusing to take other measures , such as lifting the ban on oil and natural gas production in Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf , is counterproductive .
We should be tapping into a broad portfolio of energy options , including clean coal , nuclear power and wave energy .
The key is increasing energy supply .
By taking these measures , we can enable biofuels to be part of the energy solution , instead of contributing to the energy problem .
Congress must take action .
I am introducing legislation that will freeze the biofuel mandate at current levels , instead of steadily increasing it through 2022 .
This is a common - sense measure that will reduce pressure on global food prices and restore balance to America 's energy policy .
As the Senate debates this issue , we must remain focused on the facts .
At one point , expanding biofuels made sense for America 's energy security .
But the recent surge in food prices has forced us to adapt .
The global demand for energy and food is expected to rise about 50 % in the next 20 years , and the U.S. is well - positioned to be a leader in both areas .
That will require a careful , finely tuned approach to America 's farm products .
By freezing the biofuel mandate at current levels , we will go a long way to achieving that goal .
If Rod Serling were alive and writing episodes for “ The Twilight Zone , ” odds are he would have leaped on the true story of Anne Adams , a Canadian scientist turned artist who died of a rare brain disease last year .
Trained in mathematics , chemistry and biology , Dr. Adams left her career as a teacher and bench scientist in 1986 to take care of a son who had been seriously injured in a car accident and was not expected to live .
But the young man made a miraculous recovery .
After seven weeks , he threw away his crutches and went back to school .
According her husband , Robert , Dr. Adams then decided to abandon science and take up art .
She had dabbled with drawing when young , he said in a recent telephone interview , but now she had an intense all - or - nothing drive to paint .
“ Anne spent every day from 9 to 5 in her art studio , ” said Robert Adams , a retired mathematician .
Early on , she painted architectural portraits of houses in the West Vancouver , British Columbia , neighborhood where they lived .
As the battle over reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act rages in Congress , civil libertarians warn that legislation sought by the White House could enable spying on “ ordinary Americans . ”
Others , like Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) , counter that only those with an “ irrational fear of government ” believe that “ our country ’s intelligence analysts are more concerned with random innocent Americans than foreign terrorists overseas . ”
But focusing on the privacy of the average Joe in this way obscures the deeper threat that warrantless wiretaps poses to a democratic society .
Without meaningful oversight , presidents and intelligence agencies can -- and repeatedly have -- abused their surveillance authority to spy on political enemies and dissenters .
The original FISA law was passed in 1978 after a thorough congressional investigation headed by Sen. Frank Church ( D - Idaho ) revealed that for decades , intelligence analysts -- and the presidents they served -- had spied on the letters and phone conversations of union chiefs , civil rights leaders , journalists , antiwar activists , lobbyists , members of Congress , Supreme Court justices -- even Eleanor Roosevelt and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The Church Committee reports painstakingly documented how the information obtained was often “ collected and disseminated in order to serve the purely political interests of an intelligence agency or the administration , and to influence social policy and political action . ”
Political abuse of electronic surveillance goes back at least as far as the Teapot Dome scandal that roiled the Warren G. Harding administration in the early 1920s .
When Atty . Gen. Harry Daugherty stood accused of shielding corrupt Cabinet officials , his friend FBI Director William Burns went after Sen. Burton
Wheeler , the fiery Montana progressive who helped spearhead the investigation of the scandal .
FBI agents tapped Wheeler ’s phone , read his mail and broke into his office .
Wheeler was indicted on trumped - up charges by a Montana grand jury , and though he was ultimately cleared , the FBI became more adept in later years at exploiting private information to blackmail or ruin troublesome public figures .
( As New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer can attest , a single wiretap is all it takes to torpedo a political career . )

In 1945 , Harry Truman had the FBI wiretap Thomas Corcoran , a member of Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s “ brain trust ” whom Truman despised and whose influence he resented .
Following the death of Chief Justice Harlan
Stone the next year , the taps picked up Corcoran ’s conversations about succession with Justice William O. Douglas .
Six weeks later , having reviewed the FBI ’s transcripts , Truman passed over Douglas and the other sitting justices to select Secretary of the Treasury ( and poker buddy ) Fred Vinson for the court ’s top spot .
“ Foreign intelligence ” was often used as a pretext for gathering political intelligence .
John F. Kennedy ’s attorney general , brother Bobby , authorized wiretaps on lobbyists , Agriculture Department officials and even a congressman ’s secretary in hopes of discovering whether the Dominican Republic was paying bribes to influence U.S. sugar policy .
The nine - week investigation did n’t turn up evidence of money changing hands , but it did turn up plenty of useful information about the wrangling over the sugar quota in Congress -- information that an FBI memo concluded “ contributed heavily to the administration ’s success ” in passing its own preferred legislation .
In the FISA debate , Bush administration officials oppose any explicit rules against “ reverse targeting ” Americans in conversations with noncitizens , though they say they ’d never do it .
But Lyndon Johnson found the tactic useful when he wanted to know what promises then - candidate Richard Nixon might be making to our allies in South Vietnam through confidant Anna Chenault .
FBI officials worried that directly tapping Chenault would put the bureau “ in a most untenable and embarrassing position , ” so they recorded her conversations with her Vietnamese contacts .

Johnson famously heard recordings of King ’s conversations and personal liaisons with various women .
Less well known is that he received wiretap reports on King ’s strategy conferences with other civil rights leaders , hoping to use the information to block their efforts to seat several Mississippi delegates at the 1964 Democratic National Convention .
Johnson even complained that it was taking him “ hours each night ” to read the reports .
Few presidents were quite as brazen as Nixon , whom the Church Committee found had “ authorized a program of wiretaps which produced for the White House purely political or personal information unrelated to national security . ”
They did n’t need to be , perhaps .
Through programs such as the National Security Agency ’s Operation Shamrock ( 1947 to 1975 ) , which swept up international telegrams en masse , the government already had a vast store of data , and presidents could easily run “ name checks ” on opponents using these existing databases .
It ’s probably true that ordinary citizens uninvolved in political activism have little reason to fear being spied on , just as most Americans seldom need to invoke their 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech .
But we understand that the 1st Amendment serves a dual role :
It protects the private right to speak your mind , but it serves an even more important structural function , ensuring open debate about matters of public importance .
You might not care about that first function if you do n’t plan to say anything controversial .
But anyone who lives in a democracy , who is subject to its laws and affected by its policies , ought to care about the second .
Harvard University legal scholar William Stuntz has argued that the framers of the Constitution viewed the 4th Amendment as a mechanism for protecting political dissent .
In England , agents of the crown had ransacked the homes of pamphleteers critical of the king -- something the founders resolved that the American system would not countenance .

In that light , the security - versus - privacy framing of the contemporary FISA debate seems oddly incomplete .
Your personal phone calls and e-mails may be of limited interest to the spymasters of Langley and Ft. Meade .
But if you think an executive branch unchecked by courts wo n’t turn its “ national security ” surveillance powers to political ends -- well , it would be a first .
Study says many studies suck / Research shows we are far too drunk on stupid studies that tell us what research shows
Here is this lovely questionnaire .
It is part of a big national study designed by a major medical clinic / university / government body and it is therefore presumably quite important and serious and high - minded and its conclusions might very well go a long way toward telling us a great deal more about who we are as a people , as a species , as a weird semi-intelligent flesh - eating creature of this vast and impenetrable galaxy .
Please respond accordingly .
Question No. 1 ( please be as specific as possible ) : Exactly how much of an idiot are you ?
More to the point :
How arrogant and ignorant and out of touch with your body , your heart , your mind , your divine sense of self do you feel you are on a day to day basis ?
Are you , in short , a moron ?
How much of a moron ?
Too much of a moron to actually understand this paragraph ?
Please check the little box on the right .
No , the other right .
Thank you .
From what I have gleaned from glancing through a whole slew of recent studies , these are , apparently , the questions we most need answered .
These are the questions that plague us and torment us and , oh my God , if we only had the answers to these questions and the many , many other urgent queries like them , such as : Is sunlight necessary ?
Is breathing compulsory ?
Is having a dog around sort of nice ?
If you eat less crap , will you feel better ?
Sleep :
Who cares ?
Should humans move ?
God : WTF ? — we might just figure out how to live long enough to , you know , accidentally stab ourselves in the eye with a fork and bleed to death .
Which is perhaps an overly snarky way of saying : Many of these studies are getting dangerously inane .
And insulting .
And actually harmful .
Because if you believe many of these deceptive factoids that fill our newspapers and magazines and universities , if you take them as they 're meant to be taken , as helpful guidelines for behavior or even as some sort of serious demarcation of human understanding , well , we are doomed indeed .
Why ?
Just look .
Here is a nice study , from just recently .
It concluded that if men between the ages of 40 - 70 get even a tiny bit of moderate exercise a few days a week — and by " tiny bit " we mean merely getting their beer - bellied Cheetos - sagged asses off the couch and away from the plasma for a meager half an hour a day just to walk down the street at a pace only slightly faster than a tree sloth — they will " halve the risk of premature death from all causes . "
Is this not incredibly helpful ?
At long last , humanity shall no longer believe that fat , lazy , stupid older men who never ambulate are actually fit and healthy and will live to be 100 .
What 's more , it turns out actually moving the human meatsack in a vertical , mobile manner appears to be moderately beneficial to the various biological systems that struggle every single minute to keep us from falling over and dying .
Wow .
Who knew ?
Here is another , along with its actual headline : " A Little Wine , Sunlight Help Boost Women 's Health . "
Well , grab my brain stem and yank it like a weed , really ?
This hunk of genius reporting was , in truth , the combination of two astonishing studies , one that found women who drink 6.8 ounces of wine per day ( i.e. ; two glasses ) might boost their " good " cholesterol , and another that says getting a bit of sunshine cranks up your vitamin D and hey gosh we all need a little vitamin D and therefore after one million years of human evolution we can finally say that a little wine and sunshine might be good for oh my God just kill me now with the relentless mind - numbing inanity of it all .
OK fine , one more : " Spouses Who Fight Live Longer . "
Cute .
Pithy .
Bordering on mildly interesting , something about how letting off steam makes you healthier in a relationship and duh duh duh THIS IS A TOTAL INSIDIOUS BULLS - LIE !
Whoops , sorry .
But really now .
Let us examine this for a sec :
Sure , couples who can discuss their issues and share emotions and who actually respect their mates , yes , they might live longer because , well , they 're healthier overall than the numb thick dolts who repress their rage and beat the dog and then get sick all the time and suffer depression and alcoholism because they 're shut down miserable meatwads and oh by the way THIS ALL HAS ABSOLUTELY ZERO TO DO WITH COUPLEHOOD OR FIGHTING and everything to do with whether or not you 're a tolerable and decent and somewhat emotionally open person regardless of marital status or whether you scream at your husband about the dishes , and therefore " Spouses Who Fight Live Longer " is complete misleading crap and it should be " Emotionally Functional Humans Are Better Off Than Repressed Stunted Time Bombs Gosh What A Shock But We Had To Make Something Up To Get Our Goddamn Funding . "
Look , I know .
Studies rule .
Studies are our cultural cocaine .
We can not get enough .
I cite them all the time myself in this very column .
Many studies are incredibly helpful and informative , and without the trillions of formal scientific studies we 've enjoyed to date we would know precious little about everything from medicine to human behavior to how many orgasms a woman can have in a day ( unlimited ! ) to the average number of erections a healthy male gets in his sleep ( 5.3 ! ) and the exact number of times George W. Bush and his scabrous lizards lied to the nation so as to lead us into a disgusting and horrid war ( 935 ! ) and , well , a million other Very Important Things .
Then again , maybe not .
Maybe we have reached — or rather , far surpassed — Inane Study Saturation .
Maybe the scientific method we rely on so desperately to illuminate every single microfacet of our lives has become far too much of a fanatical religion unto itself , a bloody altar of ostensibly infallible truth to which we have gladly sacrificed the nubile virgins of common sense and intuition and consciousness and spiritual intelligence .
You think ?
This , then , is the danger : Despite the frequent inanity , despite the insulting silliness of much of the information , we 've been led to believe that it is only through a relentless obsession with tiny , data - driven studies that we can obtain real knowledge , real understanding of what we 're about and how we should eat , sleep , screw , breathe .
As such , we risk perhaps the most vital and precious aspect of human understanding , our innate sense that everything is far , far more complicated and messy and juicy and fluidly interconnected , far more non-dissectible than we like to imagine , and in fact trying to dismember human experience into its drab components merely destroys the holistic integrity of the whole damnable circus .
Look at it this way :
It 's a bit like touching your lover softly , carefully on the lips .
It 's either a dry , mappable array of specific nerve endings and chemicals and saliva glands and swarms of bacteria and random synapses screaming their desperate need to procreate , or it's , well , pure goddamn poetry .

The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Fred von Lohmann has weighed in on the controversy surrounding the expected Warner Music proposal to allow ISPs to pay a license fee in exchange for the unlimited right of their customers to download music , in any format , using any protocol .
In a nutshell , the proposal is fair and works if ISPs can sign up voluntarily because they want to offer a " download all the music ever made " service ; it 's a problem if the ISPs are forced to pay a tax , whether or not they want to offer the service .
Voluntary for Music Fans .
People who do not share music should n't have to pay for a license they do n't need .
After all , we do n't have a " music tax on restaurants . "
Restaurants are free to experiment with no music , public domain music , or CC music , as they see fit .
Internet users should have the same freedom .
But this means that there will still be some enforcement against those who do n't pay but keep downloading .
That seems fair , and enforcement to get people to become paying subscribers will look very different from today 's " mount a few heads on spikes to scare the rest " approach being used by the RIAA and MPAA .
Voluntary for Artists .
Artists should n't be forced to participate if they do n't want to .
That said , the vast majority of creators and rightsholders will likely opt in , rather than opt to sue individual Internet users .
After all , 99 % of all songwriters are members of one of the three performing rights organizations ( PROs ) we have today .
It sure beats having to find and sue every radio station every time it plays your song .
Not a Collecting Society , but Collecting Societies .
Freedom of choice for artists only means something if they have options to choose among .
Competition is critical to keeping collecting societies honest and transparent .
If you compare the three PROs that service songwriters in the US to the unitary , government - backed collecting societies in the rest of the world , our system wins hands down on these fronts .
Voluntary for ISPs .
There is no need to force ISPs to offer blanket sharing licenses to music fans .
Some ISPs will voluntarily bundle the license with their offerings ( " buy the all - you - can - eat music package for $ 5 more " ) , some ISPs may choose not to .
Universities might choose to buy campus - wide licenses in bulk in order to stop the RIAA 's college litigation campaign .
Software companies like LimeWire might choose to bundle the license fee into their software , paid either by subscription fees or advertising .
At the end of the day , it 's the individual fan who needs the license , and she should have lots of ways to buy it .

Join the debate on 606 1313 : There we are then .
You 've got to pleased with that if you 're a Rangers fan .
Sporting , against a below - strength Bolton , did n't look all that to me .
As I said before , avoiding Bayern Munich was the main aim .
1309 : The Kinder Eggs are given a quick stir by Law and we 're under way .
1307 : It 's an all - Scottish draw in Nyon as Denis Law arrives to help Dave with the balls .
1306 : Of course the Uefa Cup final heads to Manchester this year and the City of Manchester Stadium ...
1303 : More dramatic music .
Let 's be honest seven teams have a very simple aim in this draw : avoid Bayern Munich .
Same deal as the Champions League , by the way .
Follow the draw at the top of the page , teams drawn out first will play the first leg at home .
And stay tuned for the semi-final draw too .
1301 : Just what I did n't need .
Another speech from secretary Dave ( see 1203 ) .
Still , it gives me the chance to tell you that there are seven countries represented in the Uefa Cup draw .
Very cosmo .
1258 : " What a draw , it shows what a great contest the Champions League really is .
The all - English final is still on .
My money is on Man Utd to win it . "

If you did n't see the Rangers v Werder Bremen match last night , it was a thriller .
The Germans , 2 - 0 down from the first leg , had 35 shots on goal , while Rangers managed four .
The Rangers keeper Allan McGregor was absolutely magnificent - scoring a phenomenal 9.45 on the BBC Sport Player Rater .
1251 : " If Rangers avoid Bayern , we will win this Uefa Cup ! "
Derek and Arlene Forres , via text on 81111 1248 : Apparently , the Champions League draw - on this very page - just crashed the entire BBC News website .
I told you this would shake the world to its core .
I bet Colin ( see 1145 ) is feeling pretty embarrassed right about now .
1241 : The draw excitement is not over .
Oh no .
In a little over 15 minutes , Rangers will find out their quarter - final opponent in the Uefa Cup so stay tuned ....
1237 : An anonymous texter points out that as well as those three matches against Liverpool , Arsenal face Chelsea and Manchester United in the league in the next seven games .
1234 : Kenyon , the old smoothie , dodges the Frank Lampard issue .
" We 're not going to play that out in public ...
Both parties have made it clear we want it sorted sooner or later ... I do n't want to add to the speculation ... "
You know the chat .

In contrast to a very downcast Rick Parry , Manchester United representative Ken Ramsden is very chipper .
He reckons Roma is a " good draw " .
As well as that drubbing last season in the quarter - finals , United have faced Roma twice this season , winning 1 - 0 at home and drawing 1 - 1 away - a match marred by some ugly scenes on the terraces .
1218 : Liverpool chief exec Rick Parry says he 's disappointed with the draw - especially as it means his club will face Arsenal three times in a week with a league match sandwiched in between the two legs of the quarter - finals .
1216 : Pick the bones out of that then .
Arsenal meet Liverpool in the only English tie .
Manchester United might not be too disappointed about facing Roma having thrashed them 7 - 1 last season .
And if Chelsea beat Fenerbahce , we are guaranteed an English finalist .
1209 : We 're under way .
1208 : Now we are treated to a short of video of Moscow - the venue for this year 's final .
The Luzhniki Stadium will be the host .
It looks very nice .
Moscow ambassador Rinat Dasaev is introduced .
We must be getting close now .
Surely .
1206 : More from Dave .
He 's certainly milking his big moment .
Meanwhile , Chelsea chief exec Peter Kenyon looks nervous .

If you were hoping for a bit of glamour at the draw in Nyon , you 're going to be disappointed I think .

I picked the home teams and the dashing Sam Lyon the away teams .
I reckon Manchester United and Liverpool will be quite pleased , Chelsea and Arsenal less so .
Cheesy 's Champions League draw :
Roma v Barcelona
Chelsea v Arsenal
Man Utd v Fenerbahce
Liverpool v Schalke 1100 : I love football .
But if there 's one thing I love more than football , it 's a football draw .
And I do n't think I 'm exaggerating when I say today 's will shake the world to its very core .

Hello !!!
We have made a safe return from Africa .
I had an amazing experience and would love to go back sometime in the near future .
I experienced more of a culture shock coming home than I did when entering Ghana .
The people living in Ghana are truly some of the most amazing people I have ever met .
My Coordinator Elvis especially was an excellent host .
I will miss him a great deal .
He showed us around and provided emotional support when needed – which was very comforting , considering meeting the children for the first time was very emotional for me .
I enjoyed living with a host family .
Both families we stayed with were supportive and friendly .
With both families we ate well .
It only took a couple days to learn that you do not share your hard boiled egg in Ghana .
Again – both families were very accommodating and took good care of us .
Elvis was able to be our tour guide .
We saw Cape Coast ( which is simply amazing ) and the Volta Region ( Ho Hoe ) – which was probably my favorite place .
The town that sat on the side of the mountain in Ho Hoe was breathtaking .
We hiked back to Wli Falls which was just sublime .
The people that reside in Ho Hoe are true survivors , as they thrive in their primitive community .
I pay so much respect to all those who live in Ghana .
They are the hardest working people I have ever met .
I have never seen so many smiles from people that have to work so hard for everything they have .
We take so much for granted here in the US .
It was difficult to see how many children are sent to work rather than going to school .
I felt horrible when I was not in a position to buy whatever the children were selling ( i.e. pure water , tooth paste , fried plantains … ) .
It was also difficult to see families sleeping on the streets and people with disabilities having no adaptive equipment .
This trip definitely changed me in so many ways and I expect it to continue doing so as I reflect on this experience .
My perspective and outlook on life is much broader now .
I view my community on a much larger scale and realize that we have it rather good here in the US .
I am not proud to be an American but I feel fortunate to have access to resources and have many accommodations readily available .
I feel as though I have only scratched the surface - but I definitely want to go back to Ghana someday – I fell in love with the people , country , and most of all the culture .
Thank you for all that you guys and gals did to make this dream of mine a reality .
When I return to Ghana I will be arranging my visit through Cosmic Volunteers , will highly recommended your services to friends and family who are interested in volunteering in the future .
Truly , Kristine

Pentagon Papers leaker calls Iraq invasion ' supreme war crime ' John Byrne
Published : Wednesday April 2 , 2008

The man who leaked secret documents about the US war in Vietnam has a name for the invasion of Iraq .
" Supreme war crime . "
He also has appellations for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney : " domestic enemies of the Constitution " and " war criminals . "
Speaking at a church in San Francisco Saturday , Daniel Ellsberg bemoaned the Administration 's war and Iraq and cautioned about the dangers of a future war in Iran , according to a report in the local Golden Gate Express .
Ellsberg leaked a sheaf of documents that would become known as the " Pentagon Papers " in 1971 , a secret history of the war in Vietnam in which the Pentagon conceded the war was unlikely to be won .
At the time , Ellsberg worked as a Pentagon consultant .
Ellsberg used his talk this weekend to focus on how he feels the Administration has drifted from the constitution , the Express said .
He attacked Congress , too , saying its 2002 authorization of force for the war was unconstitutional .
 We have gone far from the Constitution ,  he said .
Staying true to constitutional values are not synonymous with obeying the president .
Later , he assailed those who've ruled out impeaching Bush and Cheney .
Both Democratic leaders in Congress -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) have said they wo n't consider impeaching Bush .
 To rule impeachment off the table is very much like ruling the constitution off the table ,  Ellsberg said .
He also asserted that the Administration 's use of torture was illegal under international law --  not just waterboarding , but the whole slew of inhumane procedures that has gone on for seven years now . 
Ellsberg compared the Administration 's warrantless eavesdropping program to tactics used by the Nixon Administration after he leaked the Pentagon Papers to the press .
Nixon went so far as to break into his psychiatrist 's office , using a dark unit known as the " plumbers . "
Ellsberg also praised Lt. Ehren Watada , who refused return to Iraq in 2006 citing moral opposition to the war , and criticized any preemptive attack on Iran .
 Iran has not attacked us , and does not have a nuclear weapon ,  he said , adding that a pre-emptive attack on Iran would be nothing but a crime against humanity and a crime against the people . 

How many people does it take to envision , design and build a typical building ?
Architects , builders , carpenters , laborers are often just the beginning of a long list of co-creators .
Well , these bizarre exceptions were each primarily the work of a single eccentric individual and in many cases took decades ( or even lifetimes ) to construct .
From wooden skyscrapers to recycled wonderlands , despite having this essential factor in common , the ultimate built outcomes of these incredible projects range significantly in style , execution , materiality and purpose .
Hauterives , France : Facteur Cheval was a mild - mannered mailman by day and a wildly inspired pseudo - architect and builder by night .
His strange architectural masterpiece , the so - called Perfect Palace ( Palais Ideal ) took him decades to construct and was finished in the early 1900s .
He had no formal design or construction training and learned as he went , day by day , for over 10,000 days with few people aware of his creation until it was completed .
Archangelsk , Russia : Nikolai Sutyagin started this amazing wooden skyscraper as a simple two - story structure , then just kept building .
The building now stands 13 stories ( 144 feet ) tall and is under threat of demolition out of safety concerns by authorities .
Taking what he learned ( and earned ) as the owner of a small construction company he built this masterpiece .
While in jail for supposedly imprisoning a worker in part of the building his business went to pieces .
Now the strange wooden skyscraper is all they have left .
Los Angeles , California : Simon Rodia was an Italian immigrant who moved all around the United States before settling in LA .
What started out as a few random art projects became a vast and semi-abstract architectural masterpiece known as the Watts Towers , complete with a gazebo , fountain , bird baths and other assorted structures reaching up to 100 feet in height .
These were comprised of shells , scrap metal , pottery shards , rocks , glass and pretty much any other random material he could find .
For the main structural elements he employed steel , cement , mortar and wire mesh and assembled all of his creations without the assistance of scaffolding .
Mejorada del Campo , Spain : Justo Gallego Martinez was a Spanish monk who was forced to leave his order after taking ill .
His radically individualistic cathedral was built without sanction from the local government , let alone the Catholic Church .
At over 100 feet high he has managed this remarkable accomplishment with some assistance from nephews and with revenues from his farmland as well as private donations .
He also accepts donated and recycled building materials .
Baraboo , Wisconsin : Tom Avery ( aka Dr. Evermore ) is responsible for the world ’s largest scrap-metal architectural sculpture known as Foreverton .
Weighing in at over 300 tons this amazing structure climbs 50 feet in the air and reaches 60 to 120 feet in either direction .
Once the owner of a salvage business , Avery began turning his talents to this bizarre architectural pursuit over two decades ago and ( supposedly ) believes a spaceship contained within will launch him eventually into supernatural world beyond our own and bring him into contact with the Divine .

A delegation of Lakota leaders delivered a message to the State Department on Monday , announcing they were unilaterally withdrawing from treaties they signed with the federal government of the United States , some of them more than 150 years old .
They also visited the Bolivian , Chilean , South African and Venezuelan embassies , and will continue on their diplomatic mission and take it overseas in the coming weeks and months , they told the news conference .

Gov. Crist : Florida primary was fair to Obama David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday March 6 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Florida 's Republican governor does n't think his taxpayers should pay for a Democratic party do - over of its presidential primary , and he insisted the results of January 's non-election was fair to Barack Obama .
Obama lost Florida 's Jan. 29 primary to the then - higher - profile candidate Hillary Clinton after all Democratic candidates agreed not to campaign there .
The vote allocated no delegates to the Democratic convention after state officials violated party rules in moving up the state 's primary .
( Ironically , if Florida had played by the rules it would have voted Tuesday along with hotly contested Texas and Ohio , a role in which its results could have had substantial impact . )
Party leaders are discussing the possibility of a re-vote in Florida and Michigan , which also moved up its primary in violation of party rules .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist says the previous election should count in light of the record turnout it inspired .
" We want them all to be seated because democracy matters .
...
The people should be heard , " Crist said .
Asked whether an election in which both candidates agreed to stay on the sidelines really was a fair election .
" We think so , " he said , noting that the Obama campaign ran a national ad that also ran in Florida before the primary .
The battle over Michigan and Florida delegations could continue to divide the Democratic party for months , or even bubble into an intractable split at the convention .
Crist , a supporter of GOP nominee John McCain , acknowledged his partisan bias but said that had nothing to do with whether to seat Florida 's Democrats .
" I want the next president to be a Republican , he said , but " I 'm the governor for all the people in Florida . "
Crist insisted that Florida was right to deliberately defy party rules in moving up its election , even knowing that such defiance would result in its losing delegates .
" Moving up the election is the right thing to do .
Democracy is always the right thing to do , " he said .
Earlier in the program , Crist defended the moved primary with flowing invocations of the American Revolution and Cuba in a single thought .
" What matters is that we set a date for the people to be able to vote ... to put Florida at the forefront of choosing the next leader of the free world .
That 's our right that our Founding Fathers put forward when the founded this country .
So many Americans have fought for that precious right , " Crist said , pivoting to Cuba .
" You know , in Florida , just 90 miles south of Key West there 's an island called Cuba where they do n't have that precious right . "

— To cut down on sewer back - ups , the Raleigh City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to prohibit new garbage disposals from being installed or connected to the municipal sewer system .
The new ordinance takes effect March 17 for customers in Raleigh , Garner , Knightdale , Rolesville , Wake Forest , Wendell and Zebulon .
Violators face fines of up to $ 25,000 a day and the loss of their water service .
Homeowners and businesses can continue using existing disposals – city officials have encouraged them to voluntarily disconnect the devices – but they cannot be replaced under the ordinance if they conk out .
" Food and grease in the sewer lines is not acceptable for environmental reasons , " City Manager Russell Allen said , noting the ordinance reinforces rules against sending food scraps down the drain .
Raleigh has had 99 sewer overflows since 2005 that were caused by grease clogging sewer lines , according to state environmental officials .
Sewage from the overflows can run into nearby streams , creating environmental problems .
The state Division of Water Quality has threatened to fine the city for sewer overflows of more than 1,000 gallons .
The ban on new disposals was included in a wastewater management plan presented to the City Council in 1999 .
The council approved some recommendations in the plan but never acted on the disposal installation prohibition .
One of the earlier recommendations created the character of " Neusie the Fish " for an advertising campaign to remind people not to dump grease down the drain .
Although they signed off on the disposal ordinance Tuesday , some council members questioned how it could be enforced .
" When one goes out of service , you can go pick one up .
It 's not rocket science , " Councilman Thomas Crowder said .
Allen said he plans to work with local plumbers and contractors to make sure the new rules are enforced .
Home inspections also will catch some violators , he said .
Russ Buxton , a manager at a Lowe 's Home Improvement store , said he doubts the ordinance will prevent people from putting grease down the drain ..
He said he expects residents will fight to keep their garbage disposal .
" A lot of us are used to modern conveniences .
It 's like saying , ' You ca n't use your dishwasher .
You 'll have to hand - wash your dishes , ' " Buxton said , noting his store sells 10 to 40 disposals a week .
It is the Great Green Betrayal .
With environmental issues becoming ever more critical , the green policies of Gordon Brown 's government are standing still or even going backwards , it became clear last night .
On the day of a major warning that time is running out to solve the problems caused by climate change , it emerged that Britain 's own green policies are stalled or backsliding in three crucial areas .
First , environmental taxation , which could help curb greenhouse gas emissions and much other pollution , is actually falling rather than rising – and falling substantially , a powerful all - party group of MPs revealed .
Second , the Government has no plans to intervene in the aviation sector to cut rapidly growing emissions , Ruth Kelly , the Transport Secretary , made clear .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And third , national road pricing as a means of curbing traffic and cutting down emissions from cars is similarly not on the agenda , Ms Kelly disclosed .
It all made for a picture of a government which talks a lot but does little to help the environment – and it came on a day when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) gave a formal warning that the " window of opportunity " to tackle the world 's global warming problem will not be open for long .
Green groups reacted fiercely to the Government 's apparent lack of drive to tackle the issues , piling pressure on the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , to produce a radical green - friendly Budget next week .
" The Government is simply failing to take the decisive decisions necessary to secure a safe future for our children in the coming decades , " said John Sauven , executive director of Greenpeace UK .
" Considering all the fine words that have come from them on the importance of acting on climate change , this is a huge betrayal . "
The OECD 's Environmental Outlook to 2030 said that , without concerted and immediate global action , countries will suffer significant negative impacts of climate change , loss of biodiversity , water scarcity and threats to human health from pollution and chemicals .
By 2030 , it said , half of the world 's population will live in areas suffering from severe water stress – where people are using 40 per cent of the total available – ranging from Africa to south - east England .
And , without action to stop them , global greenhouse gases will grow by 37 per cent from current levels .
Yet , as the OECD report was being issued in Paris , the MPs of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee ( EAC ) released their own verdict on Britain 's green policies , savaging the Government and ministers for not doing enough .
In its report on the 2007 pre-Budget report and Comprehensive Spending Review , the committee attacked Labour for failing to meet the challenge of climate change .
Revealing that environmental taxes had dropped from a peak of 9.7 per cent of all taxes in 1999 to 7.3 per cent in 2006 , the committee demanded a big increase in green taxes from Mr Darling 's first Budget .
Indeed , in lambasting what they saw as an inadequate British response to the threat posed by global warming , the MPs focused on the Treasury as their main target .
It had , said Tim Yeo , the committee 's chairman , failed to respond to environmental challenges " with the scale and urgency " recommended by Lord Stern 's ground - breaking review , 18 months ago , of the economic impacts of climate change .
Mr Yeo said it had demonstrated " a lack of ambition and imagination " on green taxation , adding : " The Treasury must be bolder in raising green taxes once again .
It should sell these tax rises to the public by linking them to increased spending on the environment and reductions in other taxes . "
The MPs said that there should be a " significant increase " in all rates of taxation on flights , and that in the forthcoming Budget the Treasury must not defer its planned rises in fuel duty .
The committee said environmental issues were being " ghettoised " , with departments lacking clear targets on reducing emissions , and the Government must do more to bring the environment into the mainstream .
Ms Kelly also came in for strong criticism after her disclosure of future inaction on two fronts – road pricing and curbing emissions from aircraft .
The Transport Secretary ruled out a national road - pricing scheme as a means to curb traffic growth and cut down greenhouse gas emissions – her officials said it would be " many years down the line " .
Instead , she indicated that motorways would be broadened by allowing drivers to use the hard shoulder .
Earlier , she had similarly indicated that a government curb on carbon emissions from aviation in the UK , which are set to soar , was not on the agenda .
If Britain acted unilaterally to reduce flights , airlines from other countries would step in and take advantage , she said .
But campaigners attacked this response .
" Ruth Kelly seems to be living in a parallel universe , " said John Stewart , chair of Hacan , the main group campaigning against future expansion at Heathrow airport .
" With protests happening all around her , she seems determined to plough on with her policies of aggressive airport expansion regardless . "
Friends of the Earth 's transport campaigner , Tony Bosworth , said : " Ruth Kelly 's plans for extra motorway lanes are not the answer to Britain 's transport problems .
Real choice and real solutions to congestion and transport 's contribution to climate change can be achieved by improving alternatives to car use and reducing the need to travel . "
The Government 's failure to produce a joined - up transport policy also came under fire from the Environmental Audit Committee .
While welcoming the Government 's decision to reform Air Passenger Duty ( APD ) from a tax per passenger to a levy per flight , the report said the doubling of APD rates from February 2007 had only restored for most flights the rate of tax Labour had inherited .
In addition to the different short - haul and long - haul tax bands now introduced , the MPs called for a third , higher , rate for " very long haul " flights .
" Above all , it is vital that all rates of aviation tax are significantly increased , so as to stabilise demand and resulting emissions , " the report said .
The committee said that with a 12 per cent increase in carbon emissions in road transport between 1997 and 2006 in England , the forthcoming Budget would be " a test of the Treasury 's environmental credibility : it must not defer its planned rises in fuel duty " .
Despite rises in the price of crude oil pushing up fuel prices , the demand for road fuel was still strong , the EAC said .
The report also urged the Treasury to spend more to encourage carbon capture and storage schemes which aim to trap the emissions from fossil - fuelled power stations .

It ’d be great for our nominee to hit John McCain on his refusal to release his taxes , but , oh , that ’s right , we ca n’t because Hillary is doing the McSame old thing .
Hillary likes to tell us that she ’s been “ fully vetted ” before , so there will be no more surprises if she becomes our nominee .
Really ?
Putting aside her husband for a moment , let ’s talk about her taxes .
Hillary and McCain are both refusing to release their tax returns .
( Obama released his returns last April , 2007 . )
Hillary says she ’ll release hers once she becomes the nominee .
And McCain wo n’t make any promises at all .
What is Hillary afraid that we ’ll find in her returns ?
The candidates preceding Hillary released their returns before they were the nominee .
According to the Washington Post , “ Sen. John F. Kerry released his returns in December 2003 , long before winning the nomination ; Vice President Al Gore ’s returns , of course , were already public . ”
And Kucinich , Dean , Clark , Gephardt , and even evil Joe Lieberman released his returns .
Then there ’s Bill Clinton .
In 1992 , Bill Clinton made his tax returns public during the primaries .
But , there was a catch .
He did n’t release his 1979 and 1978 tax returns .
Those were the returns showing that Hillary had made a 10,000 % cattle - futures profit that raised a few eyebrows .
So is that why Hillary is n’t releasing her returns ?
Because she knows that sometimes tax returns hide things that might appear ( or be ) scandalous ?
But even that argument does n’t make sense since Hillary has promised to release her returns AFTER she becomes the nominee .
That means that she has no privacy interest in her tax returns , she ’s going to let the public see them soon anyway , but she simply does n’t want Democratic voters to get the chance to have her tax returns inform their vote during the primaries .
See , here ’s how it works .
Hillary ’s tax returns could have something foul - smelling in them , like her 10,000 % profit on the cattle - futures .
If she releases her returns now , it gives you and me and every other Democratic voter the chance to judge her on what ’s in her returns , and vote accordingly .
But if she waits until after she becomes the nominee , she knows she has us by the , uh , cattle - futures .
As a Democrat , I might not vote for Hillary in the primary if I see something fishy in her tax returns .
But in the general election , of course I ’m going to vote for Hillary , regardless of what ’s in her returns .
At that point , only Republicans will hold Hillary accountable for something fishy in her returns so she mitigates the damage by releasing them later rather than sooner .
So in a nutshell , Hillary says she ’s been fully vetted , that there are no more surprises in her life .
But Hillary does n’t want you to know what surprises might be in her tax returns , lest it influence your vote .
But she does n’t care if you see her tax returns a few months from now , when it ’s too late to influence your vote .
That means that privacy is n’t Hillary ’s concern here , since she ’s pledged to release the returns eventually .
Her concern is that she has n’t yet been fully vetted , and she wants to keep it that way until it ’s too late for us to get buyer ’s remorse , or at least act on such remorse if we get it .
There may be another cattle - futures type scandal in her current returns , for all we know .
And were she to release her tax returns now , Democratic primary voters and super delegates might not like what they find , and vote accordingly .
And we ca n’t have that .
People with nothing to hide do n’t usually hide .
Danish Nursing Homes Provide ' Call Girls ' for Male Residents
The Danes have always been considered a progressive lot .
In keeping with that mind set , Kildegaarden nursing home directorhas instructed her nursing staff to call in the prostitutes when their male residents exhibit behavior that suggests a need for such services .
When indecent sexual proposals are bestowed upon staff members and female residents , the staff knows that the situation calls for extraordinary measure .
In such cases the professionals are just a phone call away .
Kildegaarden nursing home is located 100 miles west of Copenhagen in the town of Skanderborg .
The facility provides health care services to 100 residents with conditions that include Alzheimer 's and stroke .
The staff has only arranged for call girl services three times in the past three years but they wo n't hesitate to arrange such services when the need arises .
The staff reports that the change in the male residents after they have received a visit from a paid prostitute is remarkable .
According to Kildegaarden 's director Kristensen , " Basically this is a matter of respecting the elderly and their needs . "
The sex trade has been legal in Denmark since 1999 .
The country estimates that they have 6,000 working girls .
The country appears to be divided on the issue of making prostitutes available to vulnerable adults .
Copenhagen has banned their nursing homes from arranging call girl services .
Denmark officials are rethinking the entire sex trade issue .
A women 's group who call themselves Denmark 's Society of Women , started a campaign in March called Take a Position , Man .
They are urging men to sign up in protest against prostitution .
At last count they had 1,887 signatures , according to Bloomberg .
Building on his extensive resumé of ambush journalism , Bill O'Reilly sends one of his flunkees " producers " to confront Arianna Huffington over cherry - picked comments left by an anonymous person on HuffPo .

Arianna responds :
I find it laughable to be lectured on hate speech by Bill O'Reilly , who has done as much if not more than anyone else in the media to debase the public dialogue .
He spews hate as readily as he breathes .
It 's his lifeblood .
O'Reilly 's relentless crusade to smear Arianna should finally leave no doubt that he has absolutely zero journalistic standards and / or shame .
As John Amato just documented with some original reporting , FOX News allows hate - filled - racist comments on their own website .
You know , the kind BillO says is ruining our country .
We 're still waiting for O'Reilly to clarify those comments or deem them really not hateful at all .
Will Howard Kurtz include them in his next column also ?

Twenty years ago my high school biology teacher drew a leafless tree of life on the blackboard .
At the base of its trunk were single - celled protists , and as the tree extended upward , it forked into the plant and animal kingdoms .
The limbs of each kingdom quickly subdivided into phyla : ferns and flatworms , conifers and echinoderms .
Toward the top of the tree , a branch was labeled " chordates , " and at the very top of that branch 's mess of twigs , our teacher labeled the highest shoot " human beings . "
This sort of diagram is called a phylogenetic tree and offers a succinct representation of the diversity of life .
It beautifully illustrates the genetic connections between organisms as disparate as a cheetah and an eelworm .
It says : We are all cousins .
Darwin used the analogy in " The Origin of Species " ; international biologists are currently assembling an amazing example at www.tolweb.org.
What I 've been realizing lately , though , is that by placing humans at the very top of the tree , my high school teacher may have done his students a mild disservice .
The implication was that big - brained Homo sapiens , perched at the top of the topmost twig , formed the pinnacle of evolution .
This is a fallacy .
Evolution proceeds by blind chance , not by design .
We are adapted creatures , but we are not optimized creatures .
As counterintuitive as it might seem , it 's inaccurate to suggest that humans are more evolved than , say , horseshoe crabs , which have been living and dying for 400 million years .
Two esteemed brain scientists , Gary Lynch and Richard Granger , in their new book , " Big Brain , " call the top - of - the - tree paradigm " species chauvinism . "
" We often , " they write , " fall into a fallacy of thinking - an almost irresistible fallacy - imagining that a feature or characteristic that we possess must have been carefully built that way , just for us . "
In " Big Brain , " the authors reintroduce the Boskops : an extinct , controversial , 10,000 - year - old African hominid that possessed a brain about 30 percent larger than ours is now .
The Boskops had little frames and massive heads , and their mere presence in the fossil record throws the idea of unidirectional evolutionary progress into question .
Were the Boskops more intelligent than we are now ?
More capable ?
If they were , why did they die out ?
Lynch and Granger offer up several theories .
Ultimately they conclude that the Boksops " would far exceed contemporary people in at least some mental capacities . "
" Big Brain " is about more than the fossil remains of a few large - headed ancestral relatives .
Sometimes dry , sometimes riveting , the book tracks the evolutionary development of the human brain and ultimately argues that pure chance , in concert with natural selection , has given us our currently unmatched cognitive powers .
Along the way , the authors are exceedingly careful to point out that evolution never proceeds in a straight line but rather takes a path " of apparently aimless wandering interrupted by surprising leaps . "
One in ten girls were found to have hyperactivity problems
A study of more than 800 girls up to the age of 21 found hyperactivity was linked to poor job prospects , abusive relationships and teenage pregnancy .
Previous research on the lasting impact of childhood hyperactivity has focused on boys , who are more likely to be diagnosed and treated .
The Canadian and UK study is reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
Young girls with high levels of hyperactivity should be targeted early in life to help them achieve better at school , the researchers concluded .
There are very few interventions targeting females so we do n't know exactly what to do and that needs to be looked at in more detail
Study leader , Dr Nathalie Fontaine
The study , which assessed girls yearly between the age of six and 12 , looked for signs of restlessness , jumping up and down , not keeping still , and being fidgety .
Researchers also assessed physical aggression such as fighting , bullying , kicking , biting or hitting .
One in 10 showed high levels of hyperactive behaviour , while another one in 10 showed both high levels of hyperactive and physically aggressive behaviour .
Those who were the most hyperactive or aggressive were more than twice as likely to be addicted to smoking , fall into mentally abusive relationships and four times more likely to do poorly at school .
However , only girls with both hyperactivity and physical aggression were found to report later problems of physical as well as psychological aggression towards their partner , along with early pregnancy and dependency on welfare .
A quarter of girls with hyperactivity had no problems in adulthood .
School achievement
Study leader , Dr Nathalie Fontaine , a researcher at University College London , said there had been very little research on hyperactivity in girls .
" Hyperactivity is less common in girls than in boys but there are girls with this behaviour which can lead to serious problems in later life . "
She said the findings were not unexpected as many of the problems stemmed from poorer achievement at school .
" We need more research to understand the factors that prevent or trigger the development of such problems .
" There are very few interventions targeting females so we do n't know exactly what to do and that needs to be looked at in more detail . "
Dr Morris Zwi , consultant in child and adolescent psychiatry at South West London and St Georges Mental Health Trust , said similar outcomes had been shown in hyperactive boys .
" Hyperactivity is diagnosed more commonly in boys and we do n't know the reason for that .
" Girls tend to be more inattentive so they 're just left to get on with things because they 're not causing so much trouble . "
He said schools did not have the skills to deal with children with hyperactivity problems but there were programmes which could help children , including psychological therapies .
" The key thing is having someone who understands but also just a sensitive human being who can have a conversation with a young person . "
Estimated fire damage stands at more than $ 1bn .
Raging wildfires
Forecasters say the Santa Ana winds , which fuelled the spread of the flames and had reached hurricane strength , are just starting to die out .
But correspondents say firefighters still face a huge task in controlling the fires , as no rain is expected .
President George W Bush is flying to the area to see the damage for himself .
Speaking before he left , he assured California residents that the federal government would provide the resources , manpower and equipment needed to fight the fires .
" It 's a sad situation out there in Southern California , " he said .
" I fully understand that the people have got a lot of anguish in their hearts , and they just need to know a lot of folks care about them . "
Mr Bush has declared seven counties in the state as a major disaster area .
About one million people have had to leave their homes , officials say .
Among the worst affected areas is around San Diego , where evacuation centres are struggling to provide shelter for more than 300,000 people .
San Diego police said on Thursday that two bodies had been found in the burned ruins of a house in Poway .
One death directly linked to the fires was reported on Sunday and authorities say there have been several other deaths during the evacuations .
The fires have destroyed more than 1,600 homes and the material damage is estimated to have risen to more than $ 1bn .
Police say at least one of the larger fires may have been started deliberately .
Mixed picture
One arson suspect was shot dead by police after a pursuit and another was arrested , police said , although neither man has been connected with any major fire .
The fires have ravaged at least 674 sq miles ( 1,745 sq km ) of land from Santa Barbara down to the Mexican border .
In some areas , wind speeds on Wednesday were down to 21 - 36 mph ( 34 - 58 km / h ) , from highs of 100 mph earlier in the week .
Helicopters and air tankers took advantage of the weather to drop 30 to 35 loads of water on two fires that have burned hundreds of homes in the San Bernardino Mountains , near Lake Arrowhead .
Several major fires were contained in Los Angeles County .
Maurice Luque , spokesman for the San Diego Fire Rescue Department , told the BBC that while the crisis was easing in urban San Diego , some rural areas were still under threat .
" The weather has turned a little more calm , there 's no winds , the humidity is up , the temperatures are down a little bit in some areas , " he said .
" However , in other areas ... [ the fires ] keep spotting ahead of each other , and there 's a number of fires that are burning now , and requiring evacuation , and there are homes that continue to burn , mostly in the outlying areas of San Diego , out in the more rural areas . "
There were also reports that power lines connecting San Diego to the national grid were under threat .
Mr Schwarzenegger praised the " great co-ordination " and " immediate response " of federal , state and local government agencies to the fires .
He also thanked President Bush for signing the disaster declaration , which will free federal funds to help governments , families and individuals recover from the devastation wrought by the blazes .
The head of the Federal Emergency Management Administration ( Fema ) , David Paulison , said the government had learnt lessons from the Hurricane Katrina disaster on the Gulf Coast two years ago .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Bush administration official under scrutiny for interfering with federal spending and offering to help Republican candidates has resigned , the General Services Administration said on Wednesday .
Lurita Doan had been under pressure to step down as head of the 12,000 - employee agency , which oversees U.S. government buildings , after an independent investigation last year found she offered to help Republicans get elected , a violation of federal law .
She was also accused of trying to improperly steer a contract to a friend , and renew another contract over the objections of agency officials .
The GSA , with an annual budget of $ 17 billion , oversees billions of dollars in contracts to manage government properties .
Doan denied wrongdoing last year at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Chairman Henry Waxman , a California Democrat , said she should resign .
Doan said in an e-mail to employees on Tuesday night that she had been asked to step down .
The GSA and the White House declined to say whether she had been forced out .
“ The president is grateful for her service and wishes her and her family the best , ” White House spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore said .
Doan , a former small - business owner , was the first woman to head the agency when she took office in 2006 .
It ’s that time of year when most ski resorts and destinations are wrapping up their winter ski season and avid urban vacationers are taking those last weekend runs .
Ski buffs sometimes brag about skiing at Whistler , Big Sky or other more exclusive resorts , but how many can say they ’ve skied in Bolivia or New Zealand ?
You ca n’t beat the price of skiing in South Africa and you can even catch a ( chilly ) lingerie fashion show on the slopes in Lebanon .
Lebanon :
Who would have thought that Lebanon not only has ski resorts but that one of those resorts have annual lingerie shows ?
That ’s right , the Faraya Ski Resort – an hour from Beirut and the largest ski resort in the Middle East – holds an annual show where shivering models show off the latest sexy styles .
Lebanon is also one of the few places in the world where you can go skiing in the morning then take a dip in the Mediterranean in the afternoon !
Of course , be sure to check the political climate before checking into a Lebanese resort .
Bolivia :
At over 5,000 meters Bolivia has the highest ski slope in the world .
However , the Chacaltaya glacier has been melting in recent years and much of the permanent snow cover has been depleted with time due to climate changes .
Nonetheless , during the snowy season there are still skiers to be found on its slopes though – for now at least .
South Africa : Africa sounds like the last place to have skiing at any time of year , but find the right spots and accept man-made snow and you are good to go – just do n’t trail - blaze too far !

Miscellaneous
Whether you ’re exploring your city or just like messing around on the Internet , here are a few more ways you can use Google Maps that you may not have thought of .
Review : Sound Health , Sound Wealth
For a while , I ’ve thought about including an occasional review on this blog .
Recently , someone approached me suggesting that I review Sound Health , Sound Wealth by Dr. Luanne Oakes .
So I checked out her reputation , and looked at recommendations from people like Deepak Chopra , John Gray , and Tony Robbins , and decided that reviewing this book was a good idea .
As I began to read the book and did some work , I listened to the CD that accompanies the book .
Dr. Oakes produces many products that use sound to relax and heal , but this is the first of those that I ’ve experienced .
This CD is beautiful and relaxing , about an hour long .
I listened to it twice , and enjoyed it even more the second time .
I came away refreshed and alert .
What is a Review ?
One of my beliefs is that there is no such thing as a completely objective review .
A good review expresses the personality , talents , and belief system of the reviewer as much as the work under review .
There are many types of reviews .
The most common reviews probably answer one or more of these questions :
Do I like it ?
What is the subject matter of this book ?
Is it well organized , and easy to understand ?
Does it entertain and / or inform me ?
If it makes promises , does it deliver on those promises ?
Is it worth my time to read this book ?
The more objective parts of a review tell me what the subject is , and if the material is clearly presented .
But there are no absolutes in a review .
What ’s clear to you may not be clear to me .
We have different experiences , and come to any book with different beliefs , likes , and dislikes .
I may like a certain author ’s style , and you may not .
I may like the way an author uses language , and you may not .
For example , Dr. Oakes likes to make up new phrases to describe the ideas that she writes about .
There are many authors who do this .
Sometimes familiar words and phrases are burdened with old , limited associations .
New phrases can be a wonderful way to explore an unfamiliar mindset .
The unfamiliar terms tell me that I ’m walking into the unknown .
I take a breath , and prepare to learn something new .
I ca n’t so easily slip into those very dangerous three words : “ I know that . ”
Some of my favorite of her terms are future memories , action - based faith , and first and second thoughts and feelings .
Future Memories
If you are familiar with the law of attraction , manifestation , or visualization techniques , then you ’ve heard of visualizing a desired future state in full emotional and sensory detail .
But she puts a slightly new spin on it , by also relating to that experience as a future memory .
I love that idea .
Action - based Faith
Action - based faith , asserts that belief in a desired future is expressed through every thought , word , and action .
The more that belief is expressed in our thoughts , words , and actions , the more power that belief has to shape our reality .
First and Second Thoughts and Feelings
Dr. Oakes writes that we cannot always find the presence of mind to respond to a situation with the thoughts and feelings that we would like to .
Our first thoughts and feelings may flow too quickly .
But , she writes , it is much easier to choose our second thoughts and feelings .
We can choose to replace our initial thoughts and feelings with ones that more powerfully represent who we want to be .
Hunting for Ideas
Some people may not like her new language .
I do n’t resonate with all of the terms myself .
But , I ’m a bit of an idea hunter .
I look for ideas that will shake up my thinking , and enable me to live in a bigger world , and understand more of it .
One powerful idea is often worth more to me than a well constructed , easy to understand discussion of ideas that I ’m already familiar with .
And I ’ve found many such ideas here .
Certainly the book is well organized , and covers a number of fascinating subjects such as manifestation , beliefs about what is possible , our relationship with time , saying no , welcoming resistance as a sign of change , health , and wealth .
This book may be a bit too ambitious at times , and some of the topics deserve a more lengthy treatment .
Conclusion
Above I discussed some questions that book reviews typically answer .
There are two more questions that I want to add to that list .
These are the questions that I personally want to see answered in a review , and they are the ones that I ’ve focused on in this review :
Is there something new in this book ?
Does it introduce ideas that enable me to think about my world and myself in new ways ?
The answer to these questions , for me , is a resounding yes .
( Dr Oakes ’ book is available in the usual places such as amazon.com , and her website is Sound Health , Sound Wealth . )
McCain delays releasing medical records again , raising suspicion John Byrne
Published : Friday April 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Declined to provide files three times to New York Times A little noticed remark in the press is generating heat for McCain 's presidential campaign .
On Wednesday , McCain 's campaign told CNN that the Arizona senator 's medical file would be produced May 15 .
Trouble is , they previously said they'd be released April 15 , and they 've refused to turn the records over to the New York Times on at least three occasions .
This has led some on the left to question , " What 's he hiding ? " -- as is the banner headline on the politics section of liberal blog , The Huffington Post .
" Mr. McCain has yet to make his full medical records or his physicians available to reporters , " the Times veteran medical correspondent Dr. Lawrence Altman penned in March .
" At least three times since March 2007 , campaign officials have told The New York Times that they would provide the detailed information about his current state of health , but they have not done so .
The campaign now says it expects to release the information in April . "
McCain 's previous encounter with skin cancer
The Times has taken issue with McCain 's health before .
In early March of this year , the paper ran a Sunday splash titled " On the Campaign Trail , Few Mentions of McCain 's Bout With Melanoma . "
" Along with his signature bright white hair , the most striking aspects of Senator John McCain 's physical appearance are his puffy left cheek and the scar that runs down the back of his neck , " Altman wrote .
" The marks are cosmetic reminders of the melanoma surgery he underwent in August 2000 .
Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , sometimes tells audiences that he has ' more scars than Frankenstein . ' "
The recent ducking of questions on his medical history stands in contrast to his release of detailed files in 1999 , " In 1999 , during Mr. McCain 's first race for president , he gave the public an extraordinary look at his medical history  1,500 pages of medical and psychiatric records that were amassed as part of a United States Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war , " Altman wrote in March .
" This reporter , who is a physician , interviewed the senator 's doctors in 1999 with his permission . "
The CNN report was featured in a blog post on their political ticker Wednesday .
It was not picked up by news agencies or even the subject of a CNN report .
The Carpetbagger blog , however , caught the CNN blog post and raised a storm .
McCain said he 'd release files on 60 Minutes The Times report " was the standard line in early March .
McCain sat down for an interview with Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes , and was asked about his health .
McCain said it's ' excellent ' ( three times ) , and said his campaign would be ' doing the medical records thing ' soon , " Carpetbagger 's Steve Bennen wrote .
" Pelley followed up , " There has been some criticism that you have not released your medical records .
You 're saying in this interview that you 're about to do that .
McCain replied , ' Oh , yeah , we 'll do it in the next month or so , yeah . ' "
" For a candidate who has nothing to hide , he 's acting like he has something to hide , " he continued later .
" And given that McCain is running to be the oldest president ever elected , and he has a history of medical problems including melanoma , this is a little unsettling .
" If McCain had a history of secrecy , " he added , " it 'd be easier to just chalk this up to a character flaw .
But his previous disclosures actually make the problem worse .
He was an open book during his first campaign , and now he can't even explain the delays in releasing his records .
" As I said , " he concluded .
" There 's probably nothing to this .
But the campaign 's conduct on the issue raises questions , does n't it ? "
In this chilling BBC clip , a newsteam ventures to one of LA 's new shantytowns made up of people who 've lost their homes in the subprime meltdown and now live in tents , improvised shacks or RVs on abandoned land .
It 's the contemporary Hooverville , and , as the Subliterate Cinephile notes , I wonder why I found out about this from the BBC and not US media .

Reports that a deal is in the works to allow Zimbabwe 's long - standing president to gradually relinquish power surfaced Tuesday , although officials dismissed the news as nothing more than rumour .
Jubilant supporters of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai show their party cards in the city of Bulawayo on Tuesday as unofficial results suggest the opposition won the election .
( ( Associated Press ) )
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told a news conference that there is no truth to reports that he and President Robert Mugabe are working on a transitional arrangement .
The arrangement allegedly is being struck because unofficial results now indicate that Tsvangirai won the country 's presidential and legislative elections .
" Any speculation about deals , about negotiations , about reaching out , it 's not there , " Tsvangirai said , insisting his party will not enter into any deals before official election results are released .
" We want to know who has won what before we can claim anything , " he said .
Mugabe 's government toed the same line , with Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga telling BBC
News that there will be " no negotiations whatsoever " until the results are through .
But other members of the government and opposition , as well as foreign observers , were privately saying Tuesday the leaders are in talks .
" I have to urge caution here , you hear one thing one moment and another thing the next but this talk of a deal is persistent , it will not go away , " the CBC 's Adrienne Arsenault reported Tuesday from Zimbabwe .
" Something is changing here .
The expectation is there will be some kind of compromise reached here in the next 24 hours . "
She said the suggestion is that the leaders are agreeing to recognize the official election results , once they emerge .
If no leader takes more than 51 per cent of the vote , the parties have agreed to hold a runoff , as is required in Zimbabwe .
Many observers say this would be humiliating for Mugabe .
" If this [ talk of a deal ] proves true , this will be the face - saving measure that people have been talking about for some time now that allows for Robert Mugabe to get out of this situation , allows people to move forward , " Arsenault said .
Tsvangirai has previously vowed not to entertain an alliance with Mugabe but has suggested in the past that he could negotiate an exit package for Mugabe , who has ruled for 28 years .
Opposition appears to take lead
Officials with Mugabe 's party , the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) , said earlier Tuesday that it expected the opposition had edged out Mugabe .
ZANU - PF projections showed Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , with 48.3 per cent of the vote , compared with Mugabe 's 43 per cent , according to senior sources quoted anonymously by Reuters .
The projections gave a third contender , Simba Makoni , eight per cent of the vote .
MDC plans to release its own tally of the votes Wednesday but Tsvangirai says he has no doubt that the party has won the presidential election .
In fact , at Tuesday 's news conference , he insisted outright that he won the election .

But the fact that no official results have been announced three days after the election has prolonged the frustration of many in the south African country .
The delay has prompted concerns that Mugabe is trying to rig the election .
CBC's Laura Lynch , who is in the capital of Harare , said it could be days before the Zimbabwe Election Commission provides full results .
Partial results from the commission show the opposition party has a slight lead over Mugabe 's in the parliamentary elections .
Results released Tuesday for 142 of the country 's 210 parliamentary seats showed the MDC had won 72 , including five for a breakaway faction , and ZANU - PF 70 .
An electoral official said on state television Tuesday that the commission was receiving presidential votes , but needed to collate and verify them before announcing results .
" We urge all Zimbabweans to remain patient as we go through this meticulous process , " Lovemore Sekeramayi said .
European leaders want Mugabe out
An opposition party tally released Monday gave Tsvangirai 60 per cent of the votes , compared with 30 per cent for Mugabe .
The unofficial figure was based on vote counts posted at polling stations for 128 of the 210 seats in the house of assembly , the lower chamber of parliament .
MDC 's claim to victory was bolstered by unofficial results from the Zimbabwe Election Support Network , a coalition of non-governmental organizations , which showed Tsvangirai received 49.4 per cent of the vote while Mugabe took 41.8 per cent .
" If those numbers hold true , then it would mean that there would have to be a runoff between those two men , a second round of voting , " Lynch said .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the election results must be immediately made official .
" Results should be published immediately and the elections must be seen to be fair , " Brown told reporters in London on Tuesday .
" It 's very important that the democratic rights of the Zimbabwe people be respected and upheld and recognized . "
The European Union , meanwhile , urged Mugabe to step down to spare his nation political turmoil .
" If Mr. Mugabe continues , there will be a coup d'état , " said Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitri Rupel , whose country holds the EU presidency .
His comments were backed by the Netherlands , which hailed the possibility of an opposition victory .
" Now , finally , the people of Zimbabwe have the prospect of a better life , " Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said .
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier on Monday also expressed concern with the election results delay and called on Zimbabwe 's electoral agency to release " accurate results without further delay and respect the will of Zimbabweans . "
Mugabe 's past
The election has presented Mugabe , 84 , the country 's leader since it gained independence from Britain in 1980 , with the toughest political challenge to his decades of rule .
Once praised for bringing health care and education to millions in Zimbabwe , Mugabe has been recently criticized for the economic collapse of his country that has spawned annual inflation above 100,000 per cent and unemployment of 80 per cent .
Food and fuel shortages are rampant , and the rising HIV - AIDS epidemic is said to be causing a steep decline in life expectancy .
In the past decade , Mugabe began seizing white - owned commercial farms , ostensibly to return them to the landless black majority .
But instead , Mugabe is accused of replacing a white elite population with a black one , giving the farms to relatives , friends and cronies who allowed cultivated fields to be taken over by weeds .

Sam is thought to be the youngest person in the UK to patent an idea A boy of five is thought to be the UK 's youngest person to patent an invention after coming up with a labour - saving broom to help his father sweep leaves .
Sam Houghton , of Buxton , Derbyshire , was just three when he came up with a double - headed broom to collect large debris and fine dust simultaneously .
After passing the rigorous patenting process , his invention is now protected from anyone who might copy it .
His father , Mark , said there were no plans to market the broom .
I do n't know if I want to be an inventor when I grow up but this was fun
Sam Houghton Sam , who was inspired by animated inventors Wallace and Gromit and Archie the Inventor from TV series Balamory , said : " I saw my Daddy brushing up and made it .
There are two brushes because one gets the big bits and one gets the little bits left behind .
" I do n't know if I want to be an inventor when I grow up but this was fun . "
Sam had been watching his father at work in the back yard , swapping between a large broom , for leaves and twigs , and a small one , for finer particles , when he came up with his idea .
Simple solution Mr Houghton , who by chance is a patents lawyer , was so impressed he decided to help Sam apply for a patent .
He said : " It was such a simple solution that only a child could have come up with it .
" I was swapping from one broom to the other and he asked why .
When I said it was to pick up the different leaves and twigs it must have got him thinking .
" He got a large elastic band from the shed and put it over the two brooms , holding them just the right way to use both together .
He then called me and announced that had had made up an invention . "
Insisting the broom itself was all Sam 's idea , he said : " Putting the application together was just a matter of extracting the underlying principle and carefully describing that and Sam 's specific way of using the invention . "
" I do have experience of patents so I knew what to do next but I am convinced there are other young children who come up with ideas but never have the chance to get a patent for them . "
The Improved Broom has a coarse head in front and a finer brush behind
The broom works with the coarser brush at the front to pick up larger objects and the finer brush at the back .
Mr Houghton , who spent about £ 200 getting the patent approved , said it was more about letting Sam have some fun than about marketing the broom .
He said : " Perhaps Sam will take it on when he is a bit older , after all a patent can last up to 20 years . "
Sam 's invention has been taken up by the UK - IPO , which is hoping to use it to encourage other youngsters to come up with inventions through an initiative called " Cracking Ideas " .
While the scheme is aimed at older children , project manager Sally Long said Sam 's invention had shown how the very young could often come up with the best ideas .
She said : " Sam has shown what a young mind can come up with .
" Patent applications do not always record ages but we have never come across anyone as young as Sam who has been successful in their application and believe he is the youngest yet . "

What are these ?
After many rumors as to when Windows Vista would get its much - anticipated first service pack looked improbable , Microsoft has finally dropped SP1 on the masses .
SP1 rolls together 23 security updates and 550 hotfixes into a 434.5 MB download ( 726.5 MB for the 64 - bit version ) .
Apart from improvements brought by individual updates that are now part of SP1 , changes that SP1 brings by itself to Microsoft 's flagship OS are numerous .
Significant changes include :
File copying should no longer have an ETA of hundreds of years
UAC has been altered slightly , including fewer prompts in specific scenarios
DirectX has been updated to support not only DirectX 9 and 10 hardware , but the backwards - compatible 10.1 as well
WGA has been tweaked to address two of the most popular exploits
Further support has been added for third party search solutions
Currently , the service pack is only available to users running English , French , German , Japanese and Spanish versions of Windows Vista , or Ultimate users that have only these language packs installed .
Both x86 and x64 flavors are available via Windows Update ( ~65 MB ) or from the Microsoft Download Center ( 434 MB ) .
If they have n't already , Vista users need to first install three prerequisite updates before installing SP1 , which makes Microsoft 's latest client OS more aligned with its server offering .
Those who have n't yet moved to Vista can skip the whole updating process with the purchase of a retail copy of Vista plus SP1 .
The many editions of Vista are already available with SP1 , and with a lower price tag to boot .
Although at press time they were n't yet showing signs of change , OEMs are ( hopefully ) not far behind with systems that have Vista SP1 installed .
The other 31 language versions ( both the actual service pack and the language packs for Ultimate users ) are on their way , with an early - April date being bandied about for the full SP1 language spectrum .
Furthermore , all language versions of SP1 will reportedly be pushed automatically through Windows Update on or after April 18 , for those that have set the built - in Windows Update client in Vista to automatically download and install updates .
Vista SP1 hit the Release to Manufacturing ( RTM ) milestone in early February , but the good news was quickly buried .
Microsoft disclosed an unexpected delay , saying that the company needed to work with certain hardware manufacturers to bring their problematic device drivers up to speed .
Microsoft has said that SP1 will not become available for PCs with hardware or peripherals that have these drivers until they are updated .
Many tech - savvy users were not happy with the news of having to wait for Vista SP1 RTM ( which is actually SP1 RC Refresh 2 in disguise ) .
Microsoft listened to their complaints , and changed its mind : the company gave SP1 to its beta testers , volume licensing customers , and MSDN and Technet Plus subscribers .
In addition to these users , SP1 x64 was released accidentally on Windows Update to lucky individuals on February 21 .
As with any update as major as SP1 , problems are to be expected .
Even before it was released , Microsoft had to pull a prerequisite update due to an infinite reboot loop a handful of users were seeing .
Unfortunately , this is only the beginning of problems that small groups of users will probably experience .
Cries of the issues that select few have with the service pack installation will most likely drown out talks of the many setup and deployment , application compatibility , performance , power consumption , security , reliability , and interoperability improvements of the service pack that the majority are enjoying .
As always , we recommend a clean install of the operating system , but regardless of which method you choose to install SP1 with , please do n't forget to make a backup .
There 's a lot riding on the release ; Microsoft is quite aware of the rule of thumb many businesses have for a new OS release : do n't deploy until the first service pack is available .
Sure , there are more than 100 million Vista users out there at the moment , but everyone knows that once businesses begin switching en masse , the predecessor ( in this case , XP ) truly begins to fall .
SP1 needs to have as little problems as possible if businesses previously on the fence about Vista are to give the new operating system a second look .
More virtual roundtables and tutorials for Vista deployment are most likely on their way in the coming weeks .
Even if the update wo n't be bringing any revolutionary features , the thousands of tweaks and bugfixes are exactly what businesses care most about .
If you or your company has n't moved to Vista yet , will SP1 make you take the plunge ?

ONE of the biggest paradoxes in human biology is that as societies grow richer , people have fewer children .
In most species , such an increase in available resources leads in the opposite reproductive direction .
What makes the demographic transition , as this phenomenon is known , even more paradoxical is that in less developed times and places , the rich do not have smaller families than the poor .
Most explanations of the demographic transition are social .
One school of thought emphasises reduced child mortality , suggesting this means that fewer “ spares ” need be generated to be sure that some children reach adulthood .
Another points out that elderly people in rich countries do not depend on their children to look after them .
A third suggests that as people are presented with more choices about how to spend their resources , they more often choose to consume things and experiences other than the joys and tribulations of parenthood .
A fourth , somewhat more biological , posits that lavishing time and money on a few children , rather than spreading it around amongst many , produces adults who do better in the next - generation reproductive stakes .
None of these ideas , though , is really satisfactory .
Now yet another explanation has been added to the pot .
This is that the mixing - up of people caused by the urbanisation which normally accompanies development is , itself , partly responsible .
That is because it breaks up optimal mating patterns .
The demographic transition is thus , in part , a pure accident .
Love thy neighbour ?
This suggestion is the corollary of a paper published in this week 's Science by Agnar Helgason and his colleagues at deCODE Genetics , a firm based in Reykjavik .
DeCODE 's business depends on a unique resource — the entire population of Iceland , living and dead .
The country 's records since its founding by a few , intrepid Vikings are so good that the antecedents of today 's inhabitants ( apart from a handful of recent immigrants ) are known with precision .
On top of this , its medical records are also good , and most Icelanders have willingly given genetic samples to an endeavour which is seen to be beneficial to the country 's economy as whole .
DeCODE hopes to translate this knowledge into money by understanding the genetic underpinning of diseases and hence developing diagnostic tools and drugs .
On the way , however , it is generating a lot of additional scientific knowledge — of which this study is one example .
The study 's principal finding is that the most fecund marriages are between distant cousins .
Using Iceland 's genealogical records , which allow the degree of relatedness between husband and wife to be calculated with great precision , Dr Helgason showed the optimum degree of outbreeding ( measured in terms of the number of children and grandchildren produced ) lay somewhere between cousins of the third and fourth degrees .
Probably , the reason is that marriages between close relatives risk inbreeding depression ( caused by individuals receiving two copies of broken genes from the same ancestor , but by different paths — one maternal and the other paternal ) .
Outbreeding means this is unlikely to happen , and at least one functional copy of each gene will be received .
But outbreed too far and other difficulties arise as genetic incompatibilities between the parents make reproduction harder .
( A well - known example is the case of rhesus blood groups , when the mother 's immune system may reject a fetus because of its father 's genes . )
The optimal degree of outbreeding remained the same in every 25 - year generation since 1800 , although the overall number of children from marriages of every degree of relatedness did drop gradually over time — an observation that accounts for part of Iceland 's demographic transition , and which probably has a social explanation .
However , the level of outbreeding in Iceland has also increased markedly over that period , and Dr Helgason 's findings suggest that this , too , drives down average family size measured over the whole population by reducing the number of third and fourth cousin marriages .
The strong relationship between kinship and fertility was so unexpected that the researchers have not yet calculated exactly how much it contributes to the demographic transition .
But even from the figures they present , it is clearly an important factor , and one that is likely to apply in other parts of the world where the records needed to prove it are not so good .
Even in poor countries , birth rates are now falling fast .
An important part of the explanation may simply be the additional choice of mates that development and urbanisation bring with them .
The geoduck or gooyduck is the largest species of clams on the face of the earth .
The clam grows to around 15 to 20 cm but it ’s long siphon can reach 1 metere in length .
It weighs between 0.5 and 1.5 kilograms but can grow much larger .
There have been stories about 7.5 kg heavy gooyducks .
The geoduck or gooyduck is the largest species of clams on the face of the earth .
The incredible aspect of the gooeyduck isnâ€™t only limited to its size , but also to its lifespan .
It has a life expectancy of 146 years , which makes it one of the longest - living organisms in the animal reign .
The organism , which can live well over 100 years , geoducks are a delicacy in China and Japa , where they are often eaten raw , sashimi style .

" The United States and Iran :
At a Dangerous Crossroads "

Senator Chuck Hagel ( R - NE )
Full Text
" Over the last few weeks , the world has witnessed a disturbing series of events .
Martial law declared in Pakistan ; state of emergency in Georgia ; Turkey threatens to invade Iraq ; six members of the Afghan parliament along with scores of others killed in one of Afghanistan 's largest ever suicide attacks ; an escalating drumbeat of U.S. - Iran tensions ; seventy six U.S. Senators supported a resolution urging the President to designate an entire branch of Iran 's military as a terrorist organization -- and the President announced unprecedented unilateral sanctions against Iran 's forces ; and , finally , President Bush warned of World War III unless Iran acts to stop its efforts to develop a nuclear weapons capability .
These events are one frame of a broad confluence of events occurring in the world today .
In the Middle East , Iraq is mired in a deep and dangerous civil war , with dim prospects for national political reconciliation .
The Israeli -Palestinian conflict festers and worsens , and intra-Palestinian divisions present a pivotal obstacle , creating uncertain prospects for a U.S. - hosted peace conference .
Syria is ostracized and insecure .
Lebanon is paralyzed by a devastating political deadlock ; Iran casts an unpredictable and ominous shadow over the region ; and Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia are trapped in this dangerous net .
Globally , our relations with Russia have sunk to a new post - Cold War low .
U.S. - Turkey relations are in tatters over our inability to translate Turkey 's 21st Century Government and objectives into a relationship of mutual interests that has been the case since World War II .
The U.S. - India civil nuclear assistance deal has been set back and is now in a state of uncertainty .
Afghanistan continues to lose ground -- including record - breaking opium production -- and Al Qaeda has re-emerged stronger than at any time since it was ousted from Afghanistan six years ago .
The border between Afghanistan and Pakistan represents the most dangerous zone in the world -- and we have little control and limited influence over it .
Nuclear armed India casts a wary eye on its nuclear armed neighbor to the west .
And , the price of oil edges close to $ 100 per barrel .
Record - breaking energy prices and surging demand are reshaping the global geopolitical economic power landscape -- from Russia , China and India -- to Angola , Nigeria , Venezuela , Norway -- and the United States .
The world is witnessing a diffusion of power never seen before that will increasingly be the norm for the 21st century .
Events are overtaking governments as they swirl in wild gyrations around us .
All too often , we mistakenly try to compartmentalize and isolate events and issues , and do not stop to consider how a series of events are interconnected and impact the world .
No nation can affect these events acting alone .
Unless nations work to shape , influence and guide the course of global events , events will shape themselves -- and the world , leading to an ever more dangerous planet .
The uncontrollable and combustible developments of the past few weeks present the reality of a world at an historic crossroads .
This reality has forced some hopeful and positive recent events that can guide us to a new consensus in world affairs .
Progress in North Korea as a result of the Group of Six working through a difficult and frustrating diplomatic - economic process appears to be bearing results -- Secretary Rice 's recent meetings in Turkey to address the future of Iraq with its neighbors -- her meetings in the Middle East to establish a bold , breakthrough framework for a Middle East peace conference in the United States -- strong and encouraging comments by Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas about the prospect for peace -- and the leaders of Turkey , France , and Germany here to confer with President Bush on the great challenges of our time .
The world is moving toward a consensus of common interests .
We must not squander this moment .
In order to capture this opportunity , our policies , actions and relationships must be grounded by these common interests .
In the Middle East , that means an integrated strategic U.S. foreign policy that encompasses all the nations of the region , oil , nonproliferation , political reform and more broadly Pakistan , Afghanistan , the Islamic world and international powers and institutions .
One dimensional optics , policies , and blunt , " black or white " rhetoric , like " you 're either with us or against us " wo n't work -- have n't worked -- and will fall far short of what is expected from American leadership .
As Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann , President of the American Academy of Diplomacy , wrote in his article , " Borderline Insanity : Thinking Big About Afghanistan , " in the current edition of The American Interest , " beyond the challenge of dealing with multiple actors -- is the challenge of integrating the multiple parts .
Precisely because every part is difficult for someone , all of the parts need to be brought together as a package , so that commitments can balance and sustain each other . "
Ambassador Neumann went on to say , " that 's the only way to de-fang the terrorist threat incubating in this critical part of the world . "
Ambassador Neumann has stated the essence of 21st century diplomacy .
The world we live in today is an incredibly complex and interconnected web of many interests -- political , security , economic , cultural , religious and societal .
A 21st Century frame of reference will be required to address the layers of global challenges that face the six and a half billion citizens of the world .
Loose talk of World War III , intimidation , threats , bellicose speeches only heighten the dangers we face in the world .
Without offering solutions and building international alliances we only strengthen the hand of those who prey upon and play to a confused , frightened and disorganized world .
Last week I received an e-mail from a friend who is an Australian Vietnam veteran regarding the U.S. and Iran .
He wrote , " Fear , I see it in your debates on immigration , trade , Iran and now even your economy .
Since when has your great nation and people been afraid ?
You , like Aussies , have always had a  fair crack ' at things , and a  fair go for everyone . '
Where is America 's clear voice of sanity ?
Why are you so afraid to talk to Iran ? "
America must not allow itself to become paralyzed by a fear that erodes our self confidence and trust in our Constitution and each other .
The world is living through one of those rare and defining times in history .
Our decisions today carry deep implications that will shape the world 's future -- similar to the time of Presidents Truman , Eisenhower and Kennedy during the Cold War .
The choices that our leaders make over the next few years will frame the structure and set the course for global security well into the new century .
Just as was the case after World War II , America must again lead from the strength of common purpose and common interest .
Working with allies and through alliances recognizing this is often frustrating and imperfect but there is no other option for world leadership .
The challenge of Iran will not be successfully met without Russia and China and the world community .
The answer to dealing with Iran will not be found in a military operation .
The U.S. is currently bogged down in two wars .
Our military is terribly over - burdened and we are doing great damage to our force structure and readiness capabilities .
In the Middle East of the 21st Century , Iran will be a key center of gravity ... and remain a significant regional power .
The United States cannot change that reality .
America 's strategic thinking and policies for the Middle East must acknowledge the role of Iran today and well into the future .
To acknowledge that reality in no way confuses Iran 's dangerous , destabilizing and threatening behavior in the region .
Our differences with Iran are real .
Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and continues to provide material support to Hezbollah and Hamas .
The President of Iran publicly threatens Israel 's existence and is attempting to develop the capacity to produce nuclear weapons .
Iran has not helped stabilize the current chaos in Iraq and is responsible for weapons and explosives being used against U.S. military forces in Iraq .
Yet , America 's military might alone cannot successfully address these challenges or achieve any level of sustainable stability with Iran .
The United States must employ a comprehensive strategy that uses all of its tools of influence within its foreign policy arsenal  political , diplomatic , economic , cultural , and military .
In the last two years , the United States has worked closely with the permanent members of the UN Security Council , Germany , Japan , and other key states as well as the UN Secretary General and the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to pursue a diplomatic strategy regarding Iran 's nuclear program .
The UN Security Council has adopted two binding resolutions calling on Iran to fully disclose its nuclear program and come into compliance with its international nuclear obligations .
Offers have been made to Iran by the informal coalition known as the " P - 5 + 1 " ( made up of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- China , France , Russia , the U.S. , the UK -- and Germany ) to address their nuclear concerns and find ways to build on common interests like trade .
Today , the IAEA will hold its latest round of technical talks with Iran in Vienna based on the agreement between the IAEA and Iran to fully address all nuclear questions by December .
The IAEA Board of Governors will be briefed on this process later this month .
I have supported these efforts .
Maintaining a cohesive , concentrated and united international front remains an effective and responsible element of a strategic policy toward Iran .
There are differences within our international partnership on Iran .
Prospects for further action in the UN Security Council are in question , and we appear increasingly reliant on a single - track effort to expand unilateral financial pressure on Iran outside of the UN Security Council with only a select few of our international partners .
Iran 's actions , both on its nuclear program and in Iraq , are unchanged .
Yesterday , the Iranian President said again that his country 's nuclear program is " irreversible . "
Iran 's leaders appear increasingly confident in their position vis-à - vis the United States .
And , concerns remain that the United States ' real objective in Iran is regime change , not a change in Iran 's behavior .
Last month , I wrote President Bush expressing my concerns about the path that we are now on regarding Iran .
I told him that unless there is a strategic shift in our policies , I believe the United States will find itself in a dangerous and increasingly isolated position in the coming months .
I do not see how the collective actions that we are now taking will produce the results that we seek  on Iran 's nuclear program , in Iraq , on the Israel - Palestine issue , or on any issue .
If this continues unchanged , countries will grow uncertain over our motives and more unwilling to risk tougher measures against Iran .
Our ability to sustain a united international front will weaken , leaving us with limited options .
Vice President Cheney said last month that , " The Iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course , the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences -- . We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . "
But , what confidence should we have in a strategy that , to date , has nothing to show for it ?... that has achieved no tangible changes to Iran 's nuclear program and actually has seen the Middle East become more dangerous and Iran more defiant ?
Is the U.S. pursuing a policy that could very well produce a self - fulfilling prophecy of the President 's warning of World War III ?
The United States must employ wise statecraft to redirect deepening tensions with Iran toward a higher ground of resolution .
We are at that crossroads .
We must be clear that the United States does not -- does not -- seek regime change in Iran .
There can be no ambiguity on this point .
We must be clear that our objections are to the actions and policies of the Iranian government ... not the Iranian people -- and that improved U.S. - Iran relations are a real possibility and clearly in the interests of the Iranian people , the Middle East and the United States .
In the last year , the President has authorized the U.S. Ambassador in Iraq , Ryan Crocker , to hold narrow and limited - agenda bilateral talks with Iranian officials regarding Iraq and I have supported this effort .
Three rounds of talks have been held , with another round scheduled soon .
However , now is the time for the United States to actively pursue an offer of direct , unconditional , and comprehensive talks with Iran .
We cannot afford to refuse to consider this strategic choice any longer .
We should make clear that everything is on the table  our issues and Iran 's -- .similar to the opportunity that we squandered in 2003 for comprehensive talks with Iran .
This should include offering Iran a credible way back in from the fringes of the international community , security guarantees if it is willing to give up nuclear weapons ambitions , as well as other incentives .
This will require the day - to - day efforts and presence of a very senior administration official , higher ranking than the American Ambassador to Iraq .
The offer should be made even as we continue other elements of our strategy -- working with our allies on multilateral sanctions applying financial pressure -- working in the UN Security Council on a third sanctions resolution -- and
working in the region to support those Middle East countries who share our concerns with Iran .
We should seek to work in concert with Russian President Putin , who traveled to Tehran last month to visit the Supreme Leader of Iran , Grand Ayatollah Khamenei and propose a new initiative to help resolve the standoff over Iran 's nuclear program .
We should seriously explore the proposal from the Arab Gulf States -- announced by Saudi Foreign Minister , Prince Saud -- to establish a nuclear consortium to provide any Middle East state with enriched nuclear fuel , including Iran .
Initial Iranian reactions could provide an opening for common interests .
Creative approaches like these , rather than war speeches and talk of World War III , would strengthen our ability across the board to deal with Iran .
Our friends and allies and international institutions would be more confident to stand with us -- not just because of our power -- but rather because they trusted our purpose , our words and our actions .
It could create a new dynamic in U.S. - Iran relations , in part by incentivizing the Iranians to react to the possibility of better relations with the West -- because it is in their interests .
We should be prepared that any dialogue with Iran will take time and diplomatic effort , focus and discipline .
Engagement should not be limited to government - to - government contact .
We must reach out at all levels .
As I called for earlier this year , part of that initiative could be offering to re-open a consulate in Tehran ... not formal diplomatic relations ... but a Consulate ... to help encourage and facilitate people - to - people exchanges .
U.S. - Iranian parliamentarian exchanges would be beneficial to both sides .
All nations of Europe and most of our allies in the Middle East and Asia presently have diplomatic relations with Iran .
Like with Cuba , the United States finds itself alone .
By refusing to engage Iran in direct , unconditional and comprehensive talks , we are perpetuating dangerous geo-political unpredictabilities .
Our refusal to recognize Iran 's influence does not decrease its influence , but rather increases it .
Diplomacy is an essential tool to ratchet down the pressure of conflict , increase the leverage of strength and create dialogue and opportunities to identify common interests .
To be sure , hard choices face the Iranian government as well .
Does Tehran want to perpetuate tensions with " the Great Satan " to distract the Iranian people from an increasingly dire and stagnant economic situation and social contradictions and stresses that ultimately point to economic collapse ?
Will the Iranian government decide that conflict is preferable to a beginning of reconciliation with America and opening to international acceptance ?
I do not know .
It may be that Iranian President Ahmadinejad wants to take his country into conflict with the United States .
He may believe that baiting the United States into striking Iran will allow him to consolidate clear control over the Iranian government , including by undermining the influence of Iran 's Supreme Leader .
We must not play the Iranian President 's game by allowing ourselves to recklessly ricochet into a conflict that could help unite Iran and the Muslim world behind the very extremists that we should be isolating .
Our strategy must be smarter -- wiser -- and get above the Iranian President .
We must demonstrate to the rest of Iran 's leaders , the Iranian people , the Middle East and the world that it is an irresponsible Iranian President who could take Iran into conflict -- not the United States .
Our strategy must be one focused on direct engagement and diplomacy -- backed by the leverage of international pressure , military options , isolation and containment -- not unlike the strategies that the United States pursued during the Cold War against the Soviet Union -- with Libya that has led to Libya 's reintegration into the global community -- and as we are doing today through the " Six - Party " process to address the North Korea nuclear issue .
The core tenets of George Kennan 's " The Long Telegram " and the strategy of containment remain relevant today .
This is how we should have handled Saddam Hussein .
Continued hostile relations between the United States and Iran will have the effect of isolating the United States as countries in the region move around us to address their own national interests .
Inside Iran , there are social strains and serious differences of opinion in a population of sixty - five million where two - thirds are under the age of thirty .
Iran 's economy is plagued by contradictions , inefficiencies and structural problems .
And , there are political divides in Tehran , most notably the fact that one of President Ahmadinejad 's key opponents , Ayatollah Rafsanjani , the former President of Iran , is now the Chairman of the Assembly of Experts -- the body charged with selecting the next Supreme Leader in Iran , a very powerful position .
Our strategy should exploit these differences .
America is the great power  not Iran .
Because of that awesome responsibility that comes with great power , we must be more mature in testing the proposition that the United States and Iran can overcome decades of mutual mistrust , suspicion and hostility .
The United States must be wise enough -- and patient enough -- not to follow the same destructive path on Iran that we did on Iraq .
We blundered into Iraq because of flawed intelligence , flawed assumptions , flawed judgments , and questionable intentions .
America and the Middle East face enormous challenges -- defining challenges that will shape this region for decades to come .
It is not simply Iran and Iraq that we must grapple with now .
The Israel - Palestine conflict , with its connections to Lebanon , Syria , Iran and beyond , is also approaching a defining crossroads .
The Arab world has renewed its Arab Peace Initiative .
Israeli President Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas are attempting to re-establish a basis of trust to launch new peace talks .
The U.S. proposed peace conference could be the beginning of a new round of peace process negotiations -- moving this deadly problem to a new high ground of hope and action .
But deep questions remain .
To succeed , President Bush must become actively invested in the negotiations .
In the Middle East , Hamas can not be simply ignored like before .
We must not pursue again a policy premised on an illusory hope that Hamas will collapse through isolation .
Nor can Syria be excluded .
Serious focus must be given to the " Israel - Syria " track , as part of any peace process .
These are all components of putting into perspective a Middle East 21st Century strategic context for our policies , actions and words .
These challenges that confront us now will not simply wait for the next American president .
Over the last few years the United States has lost considerable influence and trust in the Middle East and the world -- which has undermined the expectations of American leadership in the eyes of world .
In Michael Korda 's biography of Dwight Eisenhower , " Ike , " he writes that Eisenhower warned , " the United States has no business transforming itself into an occupying power in a seething Arab world ' -- and that if we should ever do so ,  I 'm sure we would regret it . ' "
I wonder what Ike would think of our current predicament in the Middle East .
Lasting solutions in the Middle East lie beyond January 2009 .
One of the most significant and potentially lasting contributions that this President could leave the United States and the world would be to begin to reverse the dangerous slide of America 's global standing and influence .
Twenty years ago , sustained , disciplined diplomacy under President George H. W. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker laid the groundwork for Israeli - Palestinian diplomatic breakthroughs under the Clinton Administration .
Today , the Administration must play for the " day after , "
help set up the next phase of peace efforts , and not seek hurried , but unsustainable achievements .
Over the next year , this Administration should " tee - up " the next phase of the Middle East peace puzzle .
Move as far as realistic , achievable and responsible  but play for the long term -- the lasting product -- the one with real adhesive to it .
This will require addressing Iran .
As a great power , America must understand not just its interests and strengths -- but its limitations .
With little time , credibility and international capital , the focus must be on what is possible and smart .
As David Ignatius wrote in the Washington Post this week in regard to Pakistan , " history suggests that the more we meddle , the more likely we are to get things wrong . "
None of us in public office today the Administration , Congress , our Presidential candidates  are fulfilling the requirements of leadership at a crossroads time in history -- nor are we absorbing the enormity of the time in which we are living .
Neither Republican nor Democratic candidates are speaking to the great challenges of our time -- in particular Iran -- with depth , strategic thinking and wise words .
We are captive to the lowest common denominator of " who can talk the toughest " and who is the " meanest cowboy on the block . "
That kind of rhetoric -- political as it may be -- will only drive the world further away from America and deepen a world crisis -- that we may not be able to recover from .
At times , the debate is astoundingly uninformed .
Before it is over , the American people will be subjected to nearly two years of a media circus surrounding our presidential election where the candidates are reduced to verbal ping pong volleys on the great issues of the day .
Rather than acting like a nation riddled with the insecurities of a schoolyard bully , we ought to carry ourselves with the confidence that should come from the dignity of our heritage -- from the experience of our history -- and from the strength of our humanity -- not from the power of our military .
Since World War II , American leadership has , for the most part , been a stabilizing force for the world , which has been beneficial for our country and the world .
It has been wise American leadership that has helped navigate through crises in Berlin , the Suez Canal , Cuba and elsewhere .
It is American leadership that created the array of international institutions , alliances , structures and treaties that brought peace and prosperity to most of the world that had been devastated by two world wars .
The world faces challenges and opportunities today that carry with it implications well beyond this moment in time .
American leadership is once again being called on at yet another transformational time in history to help set a new course for a rudderless world drifting in a sea of combustible dangers .
In engaging Iran , the Middle East and the world we must be wide in our scope , clear in our purpose , measured in our words , strong in our actions , generous in our spirit , humble in our attitude and wise in our course .
The U.S. and Iran find themselves at a historic crossroads .
What path we take will affect the future of mankind . "

It ’s no secret that the world is n’t a safe place .
Not every place is as safe as a strongbox , and you ca n’t feel secure in certain places as when you ’re staying at a fancy resort .
Even if there is danger , some people still love to explore and are rewarded , while some are easily frightened .
So , what kinds of countries do you definitely need to avoid if you want to be sure to come home with your belongings ( and yourself ) intact ?
iJet , an expert in this type of security , can give us a few ideas .
1. Iraq – A well - known unstable region that is definitely on this list .
No region here is truly secure , even the green zone , and the insurgency is still at large .
Despite security attempts by the US Forces , bombs and civilian deaths are still common , although this is lessening .
Journalists are escorted by soldiers at all times .
Do n’t expect that much protection if you ’re here just for kicks .
2. Haiti – Lack of a police force and corruption plagues this country .
It has severe environmental and economical problems .
Peacekeeping troops have been stationed here , but they ca n’t do that much .
Firearms are rampant , with people walking down the streets with weapons not an uncommon sight .
The culture is , however , rich , and you may want to take the risk if you know how to watch yourself .
Do n’t think there are any five - star hotels .
3. Somalia – This African country is not well - supported by the US , which is trouble for American travelers .
Violence flares often here , with fighting still ongoing .
Even with the Islamic Courts Union largely gone , they are still active along with Ethiopian troops .
The nation is still broken .
Parts of the nation are recovering , though , with technological aspects developing nicely .
Food in Somalia is great , too .
Fly in and sample the local dishes , and remember to stay on the beaten path .
4. Democratic Republic of the Congo –
The worst place for women to be , so if you ’re one , avoid going here at all costs .
Violence against women is considered common by a majority , and rape happens often .
A movement is out to right this wrong , but their influence is minor at best .
Crime levels are high , and you ’re likely to get kidnapped or killed for your belongings here .
Their art and music , however , are great .
I recommend viewing them from very far away .
5. Afghanistan – The Taliban has a powerful presence in this war - torn country .
Outside of the capital , the risk of being kidnapped or killed is high .
Beware when walking along the road ; land mines still litter the landscape .
Homemade bombs are also common .
But there is something good here .
Residents are proud of their culture , and if you play your cards right , you ’ll enjoy your time here immensely .
I was about to place the US as an honorable mention , but only a few areas are risky in the traditional sense .
What other places do you think are risky or places you should n’t go ?
Any comments ?

Click to viewZetix is a fabric so strong it will resist multiple car bomb blasts without breaking .
It absorbs and disperses the energy from explosions thanks to an inner structure so adamantiumtastic it can be used in body armor , window covering , military tents and hurricane defenses — it might even be able to fend off my ex-wife .
When not shielding from explosions , it can be used as medical sutures that wo n't damage body tissue .
All of this is thanks to a property that apparently defies the laws of physics :
Zetix is built around the principle of auxetics : objects that actually get fatter the more you stretch them .
Though it hurts to think about , as you will discover , it actually makes sense .
Advertisement
To demonstrate how Zetix works , the best thing is to look how a thread behaves .
When you jump from a bridge using a bungee cord , the force of gravity acting over your body weight will stretch it as you go down in free fall .
While this happens , the cord threads will stretch getting closer together and making the cord get thinner as it expands through a larger distance .
Advertisement
However , if you coil a line around the bungee cord , something that defies logic will happen : the whole structure will get wider as it stretches .
As you can see in the image , the line around the bungee cord becomes taut , making the bungee itself flex outward .
This principle is called helical - auxetics .
When you put two of these threads together , you have what Reed Richards would call an auxetic structure .
When you take this to the micro level , you can create a fabric formed from thousands of these helically wound threads .
The resulting global structure is so strong that it can dissipate the energies of multiple blasts without breaking , unlike other materials of this class .
In fact , the expanding properties of Zetix give it almost miraculous properties .

According to Dr. Patrick
Hook — the creator of the fabric and managing director of Auxetix Ltd. — this fabric is " a design that can save lives " and , more importantly , it can do so repeatedly .
" Most blast defenses are only capable of coping with a single explosion event and , once deployed and used , all significant protection is lost , " he told Gizmodo .
You can see the difference in the first photo , comparing an helical - auxetic fabric with your usual high - strenght blast protective fabric .
Advertisement
This material has other uses beyond terrorist attacks or battle scenarios , said Dr. Hook .
The fabrics can " provide sustained protection and gives emergency services extra time to rescue trapped or injured people , " and can offer effective protection against natural forces like hurricanes , as well as be deployed in containment systems , military tents , ballistic mosquito nets and body armor , a $ 2 billionpret - a - porter market .

Another advantage of Zetix is its low cost : other blast - protective textiles are made entirely of very expensive high - performance materials ; Zetix uses them too , but in much smaller proportions .
Zetix combines the good stuff with " cheaper bulk components " in a 1 - to - 100 ratio while maintaining it 's blast - resistant properties .
The cost difference only gets crazier when you remember that this can be used multiple times .
Though the company is in talks with multiple manufacturers to go into mass production , we do n't yet know when you 'll be able to buy this stuff at Home Depot to protect against the next hurricane or tornado , let alone when Chen will be able to buy underwear made completely from it for his next pantsing session .

Bay Area tops in broadband use Region is tops in U.S. high - speed Internet access , but experts worry it still lags the rest of the world
Chronicle photo illustration by Tracy Cox Chronicle photo illustration by Tracy Cox Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Bay Area tops in broadband use 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Anne Barry presides over a power broadband household .
The kids download videos and do school research , while she e-mails and shops and her husband connects to work remotely .
" My husband works in tech , we live in Palo Alto , we have three children and we 're completely wired , " Barry said .
It 's families like the Barrys that have helped the Bay Area boast the highest penetration of broadband Internet access in the country .
The region topped the charts in 2007 , with 62 percent of households connected to high - speed Internet access , according to a report released Tuesday by Scarborough Research .
The Bay Area bested San Diego and Boston , which held the top spots in 2005 and 2006 , respectively .
The Bay Area has been at or near the top of Scarborough 's broadband surveys for the last five years .
Gary Meo , senior vice president of digital and print media services at Scarborough , said the Bay Area scores high because of its wealth and education resources , which correspond to broadband usage .
" The Bay Area , being the center of Internet activity in the U.S. with Silicon Valley , ranks high in all the demographic indicators , particularly education and affluence , " Meo said .
The results echo similar findings from the Bay Area Council , which said Monday that the region is tops in broadband adoption .
Both studies also reflect a growing use nationwide of broadband .
Now , 49 percent of households in America are connected through broadband , an increase of more than 300 percent over 2002 , when 12 percent of adults reported subscribing to high speed access , said Meo .
" Clearly people are using the Internet more and more and are interested in more speed to access the sophisticated interactive aspects of the Web , " Meo said .
" This is a trend that is marching forward in a big way . "
Local observers said it 's premature for the Bay Area to trumpet its accomplishments , saying the United States is still behind other countries in terms of broadband adoption .
In the latest survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris , the United States fell two spots to 15th in broadband use , behind Denmark , the Netherlands , Iceland and South Korea .
" We do n't need to be worried about other American cities , we need to be worried about other parts of the world , " said Russell Hancock , president and CEO of Joint Venture Silicon Valley Networks , a nonprofit group that brings business and governments together .
" We 're no longer a regional economy .
It 's global now . "
Chris Libertelli , director of government and regulatory affairs for Skype , an Internet phone service , said the country needs to boost broadband access and speeds to make sure that the United States does n't get left behind in the digital age .
" The faster the broadband , the more available it is , the faster it is to create the next platform for innovation , " Libertelli said .
" The engine of the Silicon Valley economy is the creation of new software that rides on faster and faster broadband . "
Sally Cohen , an analyst with Forrester Research , said a slowdown in broadband proliferation has longer - term consequences for students and employees who do n't have access to faster networks .
" In terms of companies or even small businesses , it 's about access to information , efficiency and productivity , " Cohen said .
" The faster the speeds , it makes employees more productive . "
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A California mother sued Nalge Nunc International Corp , claiming the company knew , but downplayed risks , that a toxic substance in its popular Nalgene plastic sports bottles could leach into the bottles ’ contents and sicken consumers .
The case , filed on Tuesday , is believed to be the first consumer class action over the use of Bisphenol A , or BPA , in plastic sports bottles since Canada moved to ban baby bottles containing the substance and the U.S. government expressed concern over its safety last week .
Nalge Nunc , a unit of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc , said on Friday it will phase out production of its Outdoor line of polycarbonate containers that include BPA over the next several months .
Wal - Mart Stores
Inc also said on Friday it will pull baby bottles and other products made with BPA from its Canada stores immediately and phase the items out of its U.S. stores next year .
The suit , filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento , accuses Nalge Nunc of continuing to assert that BPA is safe long after dozens of studies linked the substance to hormone disruptions , infertility , early puberty , and cancer .
The lawsuit was brought by Lani Felix - Lozano , who said she bought the company ’s reusable beverage containers for herself and her two daughters , now ages 11 and 13 , for several years .
“ They address the issue of BPA in their bottles ( on their Web site ) ; they cite the ( Food and Drug Administration ) stating that they see no problem with it .
The problem is they did n’t cite the many other studies that show there is a risk and there is a great concern about the issue , ” attorney Harold Hewell , who represents Felix - Lozano , said .
The lawsuit does not describe any physical ailment suffered by the plaintiffs and seeks unspecified damages .
A spokeswoman for Nalge Nunc could not be reached for comment late on Wednesday .
Industry groups and some scientists defended BPA ’s safety , saying there has been no clear corroboration between studies on animals showing BPA to be harmful even at low levels , and risks to human health .

It ’s not very comforting that $ 200 per barrel is even being discussed but unfortunately , the OPEC president is n’t the only person kicking this idea around .
He added : “ The prices are high due to the fact of the recession in the United States and the economic crisis which has touched several countries , a situation which has an effect on the devaluation of the dollar , and therefore each time the dollar falls one percent , the price of the barrel rises by $ 4 , and of course vice versa , ” he was quoted as saying in brief remarks to journalists on Sunday .
He added that : “ If this ( the dollar ) strengthens by 10 percent , it is probable that ( oil ) prices will fall by 40 percent . ”
If the U.S. economic situation improved from now to the end of the year “ that would help the market to stabilize . ”

The Monday after a long working weekend , Jamie Dimon looked a little tired .
His collar was unbuttoned , his tie loosened , and he was slouching slightly in his office chair .
The week before , he had turned 52 years old — a bunch of balloons was still tethered in the corner of his office — and his hair was whiter than most recent photos show .
But he was far from worn out .
Dimon , the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase , had just won the biggest game of his life .
Sunday , March 16 , 2008 , will go down in history one way or another .
Depending on how things develop from here , it might be considered the day Dimon helped save Wall Street .
While he certainly would n’t put it that way , his shocking triumph that evening — an agreement , brokered by Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , to take over Bear Stearns , a Wall Street institution , for the pretty - much - laughable price of $ 2 a share — may have in the process helped avert a financial panic the likes of which has n’t been seen since 1929 .
Or maybe Dimon will have to settle for the trophy for best deal ever , spending just $ 260.5 million for a company whose last reported net worth was $ 11.7 billion and whose lavish Madison Avenue headquarters alone is estimated to be worth more than $ 1 billion .
“ We had one and a half days to do this deal , which includes uncertainties we do n’t even know about , ” said Dimon , in a voice that still contains traces of his Queens upbringing .
“ So it was n’t a typical valuation .
Two dollars a share is a reflection of the extra risk JPMorgan Chase was taking on in the middle of the night to do something that otherwise might not have gotten done .
We had to build in a margin for error , where if we were wrong , we were n’t risking the whole company . ”
I asked if there were moments during the weekend when the deal was nearly derailed .
“ Absolutely , ” he replied .
“ It had its ups and downs , but there was a general feeling that this would be better for everybody . ”
It may well be .
It was certainly better for Dimon , from whom much had been expected .
In many respects , this deal feels like the fulfillment of a prophecy .
Dimon ’s creation myth is familiar to everyone on Wall Street .
He was 26 years old , just out of Harvard Business School , when he signed on with the banking titan Sandy Weill at American Express .
The Amex experience was Weill ’s one big blunder ; he clashed with the blue - blood culture and was ousted .
Virtually by themselves , he and Dimon started over from the bottom , commandeering a third - tier Baltimore lending outfit called Commercial Credit .
From there , like banking marauders , they pulled off an audacious string of acquisitions that culminated in the takeover of Citicorp .
For a decade and a half , side by side , they built an empire , the world ’s first financial supermarket .
But all was not right in the kingdom .
Twenty - three years younger than Weill , Dimon was the natural heir to the throne , but as the final pieces of Citigroup came together , the partnership disintegrated .
Dimon was cast out , left to wander in the wilderness .
Eventually , he would return to slay the father figure ( metaphorically speaking ) and reclaim the role once ordained to him , as the undisputed king of the land .
Contrast :
As you ride up the escalator to the second floor of JPMorgan Chase ’s headquarters at 270 Park Avenue , you can actually see the backside of the Bear Stearns building , on Vanderbilt Avenue , which as of last Monday afternoon was full of a bunch of shell - shocked bankers still trying to process what had happened to them .
Many were staring out their windows , almost , it seemed , toward JPMorgan itself , as if searching for signs of their fate .
Dimon is no stranger to takeovers , hostile and otherwise , or the jagged ups and downs of life on Wall Street .
His father , a second - generation Greek - American , was a broker who worked for Weill and did well enough to move the family from Queens to Park Avenue when Dimon was in junior high .
There were three Dimon boys : Jamie ; his fraternal twin , Ted ; and Peter .
Jamie studied economics and biology at Tufts , and after Harvard Business School his father arranged for an interview with Weill .
Weill and Dimon became like father and son , a complementary team , emotional and combative at times but deeply loyal to one another .
Weill was the deal - maker ; Dimon was the numbers guy who could make the firms fit .
The process was simple : Weill borrowed huge amounts of money to acquire companies , then they went into the shop and started cutting costs like mad to pay down the debt .
Inevitably , that meant job losses and acrimony .
The work required resolve and discipline but also brains , because you could n’t hurt the business in the process of all that cutting .
You needed every last penny of the revenues .

Dimon was extremely well suited to his role , and he and Weill went about assembling a financial conglomerate that investors found irresistible .
There would be cross-selling — your retail bank offering you a credit card , an investment banker facilitating a commercial loan , a stockbroker hooking you up with a mortgage — and customers who once did just one type of transaction with the firm would suddenly be providing multiple streams of revenue .
Building this giant brought Weill and Dimon together , but as they neared their goal , Dimon ’s pent - up resentments from playing second fiddle to Weill for all those years were unleashed , and his temper started to get the better of him .
The tail end of Dimon ’s tenure at Citigroup was marked by what many people saw as a level of hostility between Dimon and Weill that would not have been tolerated by any other CEO .
“ Jamie would say things to Sandy that would leave your mouth open , ” says one executive who worked closely with the two men .
Along the way , Dimon lost more allies than just Weill .
Former Citigroup chairman and CEO John Reed ( who was himself ousted by Weill ) went from being a Dimon fan to a Dimon foe in mere weeks .
“ Reed originally thought the light shone out of Jamie ’s rear end , ” says the executive .
“ He was going to be the guy to take over from Sandy and John when the two of them walked into the sunset eighteen months later .
And then before you knew it , he was saying Dimon had to go . ”
In his early years , Dimon was praised for his intellect , his ability to focus on the details of the deals his boss , Weill , conceived of in broad strokes .
With success , however , Dimon became harder to manage , certainly harder to control .
“ Jamie was testosterone — he was loud , ” says someone who worked closely with him .
“ You do n’t have to be like that .
Ideas can carry the day . ”
Others saw Dimon as a victim of Weill ’s egomania .
“ I can still hear Jamie saying , ‘ But Sandy ! ’ with his arm up in a meeting .
Without any fear .
For the right reasons , ” says Marge Magner , the former head of Citigroup ’s global consumer group .
Whether one ’s interpretation favored Dimon or Weill , there was no doubt that the two were behaving like a dysfunctional family .
It was awful to watch .
The final blow came during the last merger , the one that joined Travelers and Citicorp .
Dimon reportedly wanted to be both president of the combined company and the chief of the corporate investment bank .
Weill and Reed thought he needed to share the investment - banking job with two others , Deryck Maughan and Victor Menezes .
“ Sandy had asked the three of them to come up with a plan to run the bank together , ” says one executive who was in on the discussions .
“ So there ’s the meeting at 388 Greenwich when Sandy asks for their plan .
Jamie said they could n’t do it unless only one of them was put in charge .
And then he pretty much refused to speak .
It was mutiny .
Disobedience .
If someone had done that to Jack Welch , he would have ripped their heart right out of their chest . ”
Dimon was fired in November 1998 .
Whatever his emotional state , his reputation emerged more or less unscathed .
In fact , he was regarded as something of a martyr .
There would be a CEO job for him ; it was just a question of when the right one would open up .
Dimon did not leap at opportunities .
He turned down a job at Amazon .
Sixteen months went by until Bank One , in Chicago , named him CEO .
He moved his family ( he and his wife , Judith , whom he met at Harvard , and their three daughters ) into a 26 - room mansion and took up his customary role as a cost - cutting zealot .
A 2002 story in Money magazine reported that he was incensed by the number of newspaper subscriptions paid for by the company , telling one executive , “ You ’re a businessman .
Pay for your own Wall Street Journal . ”
Dimon did well at Bank One .
One of his virtues as an executive is that he ’s blunt and truthful — to bosses , peers , and subordinates alike .
He does n’t tend to mince words or spare people ’s feelings .
As a younger man , when he was forced to share power , this could turn easily into anger and nastiness .
But as his own boss , he used it more effectively .
In four years at Bank One , he doubled the value of the company and made it a very attractive acquisition target .
In 2004 , he persuaded William Harrison , then CEO of JPMorgan Chase , to purchase Bank One for $ 58 billion , a stupendous deal for Dimon ’s shareholders .
Dimon , it is said , offered to accept $ 7 billion less in the deal if he were named CEO immediately , but Harrison reportedly paid the extra to extend his own tenure .
Dimon ascended to the CEO job in 2006 , when Harrison moved into the chairman role .
A year later , Dimon took that title , too .
He was back .

And that ’s where the Jamie Dimon story gets quite boring , at least for a while .
He returned to New York at a time when risk aversion had fallen out of favor on Wall Street .
Major financial institutions , in hot pursuit of higher returns , were riding a wave of financial engineering .
Dimon took a more cautious approach , focusing on the regular spadework of banking , which included renovating old branches and opening a slew of new ones .
Citibank , which once dominated the Manhattan streetscape , now has just half as many branches as Chase .
Dimon kept up the pressure on cost - cutting by doing things like slashing the number of software applications used by the bank .
Meanwhile , Dimon avoided easy - money gimmicks like so - called structured investment vehicles , or SIVs , one of the black holes of the current credit crisis .
SIVs are deceptively simple in concept : A fund is set up that borrows using short - term securities at low interest rates , and then uses that money to buy longer - term securities with higher interest rates .
For a while , Wall Street was in love with SIVs , because profits could be manufactured without putting any of the company ’s capital at risk .
All you needed was easy access to short - term credit .
Then , last summer , the credit markets seized up , and the banks had no way to fund their obligations without dipping into their own capital .
Citi had to take $ 58 billion of SIVs onto its balance sheet , crippling the company .
JPMorgan lost nothing in the SIV debacle .
After conferring with Bill Winters and Steve Black , JPMorgan Chase ’s co-heads of investment banking , in 2005 , Dimon agreed to sell the single SIV the bank had on its books .
Why ?
“ Because no matter what kind of equity we might have had to commit toward it , we still considered it an unacceptable return , ” Winters told me in late February .
Here another of Dimon ’s most referenced character traits — his tendency toward micromanagement — came into play .
Did deposed Citigroup chairman Chuck Prince ( who got the job that would have been Dimon ’s ) have conversations with his bankers about whether Citigroup was overexposed to SIVs ?
If he did , he obviously made the wrong call .
Dimon also steered the bank mostly clear of CDOs , or collateralized debt obligations , another fancy bit of financial gimcrackery that purported to turn risky investments into safe ones , as if by magic .
CDOs were one of Merrill Lynch ’s great profit centers — in 2007 , the firm underwrote $ 31 billion worth of them , compared with just $ 4 billion for JPMorgan , and then made the fateful decision to hold on to some of the highest - yielding ( and riskiest ) portions thereof .
You can think of these Wall Street firms as drug dealers who forgot the cardinal rule of the trade :
Do n’t start taking the junk yourself .
While these faddish schemes came and went , Dimon ’s obsession with what he refers to as a “ fortress balance sheet ” did not let him follow his reckless competitors .
This took conviction .
“ One of the toughest jobs as CEO is to look at all the stupid things other people are doing and to not do them — because maybe you ’re the stupid one , ” says Bob Willumstad , the former president and COO of Citigroup .
Under Dimon , JPMorgan was a plodder , methodically increasing its profits , adding to credit reserves , and expanding market share in a number of different businesses .
But as recently as the middle of last year , Dimon had sort of been forgotten .
Many analysts lost interest in JPMorgan .
Word got around that although he was a skilled cost - cutter , Dimon lacked the imagination to grow the business from within , and that he would soon have no choice but to start hungrily acquiring companies like he had done with Weill .
Wall Street always needs a story , and Dimon did n’t have one that people wanted to hear .
Then came the credit crunch , a consequence , most economists agree , of dangerously lax lending standards across the board .
JPMorgan took its blows — given the climate , no bank was immune .
The company ’s mortgage - related , structured - credit , and leveraged - lending write - downs totaled $ 2.9 billion from the summer through late February , which sounds like a lot until you look at the competition : $ 22 billion for Merrill Lynch , $ 20.4 billion for Citigroup , $ 18.7 billion at UBS , and $ 10.1 billion at Morgan Stanley .
And along with everyone else , JPMorgan is not in the clear yet .
At a shareholder meeting I attended in February , chief financial officer Mike Cavanagh warned that the company already foresaw an additional $ 450 million in home - equity losses in 2008 , a number that will surely grow by the time JPMorgan reports its first - quarter results .
Much deeper losses are likely , and there is concern about its portfolio of “ leveraged loans ” — those made to finance private - equity deals over the past five years .
As of the end of January , JPMorgan was sitting on $ 26.4 billion in loans that it would ’ve liked to pass into the secondary market , if only that market still existed .
But here ’s the most important thing .
Despite its problems , the bank remains on solid financial footing .
While many of his peers have gone hat in hand to so - called sovereign funds in places like Dubai and China , Dimon has n’t needed to raise a dime .
“ Not having to raise capital from foreign investors says a lot about them at this particular juncture , ” says Richard Bove , an analyst at Punk , Ziegel & Company .
More to the point :
In contrast to the chatter about Citigroup , no one is talking about breaking up JPMorgan Chase .
While the cross-selling synergies have proved more elusive than originally anticipated , one clear benefit of a financial conglomerate is the sheer size of its balance sheet —
JP Morgan has $ 1.56 trillion in assets , the kind of heft that allows it to absorb , say , an imploding investment bank with only a couple of days ’ notice .
When Bernanke was looking for a financial company with the wherewithal to take over Bear Stearns , there really was n’t much of a choice .
“ If not us , I do n’t know who else , ” Dimon stated matter - of - factly .
While Bear Stearns was , until recently , the fifth - largest pure investment bank , it was relatively small fry among the giants of the financial sector , as well as something of a self - styled outsider outfit .
Bear did n’t aspire to the august reputations of Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs .
They were , by and large , traders , and they suffered from the same credit - market problems that everybody else did .
The difference was the fear that began to spread on the Street that the firm was undercapitalized , a situation in which perceptions quickly solidify into reality .
Major clients began to pull their accounts , threatening a collapse of the firm .
The rescue mission began on Friday , March 14 , when the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan agreed to provide emergency funding to Bear .
Dimon had one very good reason to get involved — JPMorgan stood to lose millions itself if Bear went belly - up .
But the Fed ’s announcement failed to stop Bear ’s stock from plummeting as more business partners ran for the exits .
Bankruptcy loomed as a frighteningly real possibility .
A more intensive bailout appeared necessary , and JPMorgan started quizzing Bear executives and studying their books to assess what they had .
Given the state of the credit market , it was hard to place a value on many of the securities .
On such a tight time frame , JPMorgan could only guess .
The numbers batted around Saturday night were reportedly considerably greater than the $ 2 - a - share figure , but no agreement was at hand , and when JPMorgan executives woke up Sunday , they were determined to go lower .
The Fed , too , reportedly pushed for a lower price , to ensure that Bear shareholders , not the government nor JPMorgan ’s shareholders , bore the brunt of the losses .
That was the Fed ’s way of averting the moral hazard of bailing out reckless bankers .
Dimon ’s inner circle — CFO Mike Cavanagh , investment - banking co-heads Bill Winters and Steve Black , and general counsel Stephen Cutler — put the screws to Bear Stearns ’ negotiating team , which reportedly included chairman James Cayne .
“ It was clearly not the easiest transaction , ” says Dimon .
“ And until the boards voted , there was no deal at all . ”
In the end , $ 2 a share amounted to a token payment .
So if that ’s the level they were operating at , I asked Dimon , why not $ 1 a share ?
“ There were a lot of factors involved , ” he said cryptically .
The attractions for Dimon were obvious .
The Fed has guaranteed some $ 30 billion of Bear ’s less - liquid assets , leaving JPMorgan free to feast on the attractive ones , such as the firm ’s prime - brokerage desk ( which provides trading and other services to hedge funds ) , a business that JPMorgan barely competes in .
Bank of America is reportedly shopping its own prime - brokerage business for $ 1 billion .
Dimon got Bear Stearns ’— the third largest in the industry — for less than a quarter of that , and that ’s if you ignore the rest of the business entirely .
I ask him what else he likes about the acquisition .
“ Their securities - clearing operations are excellent , ” he said , and went on to mention Bear ’s equities and commodities businesses .
As if that ’s not enough of a haul , Dimon added , “ They also have a great building . ”
The deal is not yet settled .
Bear Stearns employees and shareholders have mutinied against it .
Last Wednesday , Dimon and his team tried to present a compassionate face at a meeting with more than 400 outraged Bear Stearns executives .
“ I do n’t think Bear did anything to deserve this , ” he said .
“ Our hearts go out to you . ”
The crowd refused to be mollified by his remarks .
Many in the room had surely lost the bulk of their life savings , but the irony is hard to ignore : Investment bankers , whose actions regularly force drastic cost - cutting and job loss on companies across the world , were reeling from a taste of their own medicine .
“ You ’re acting like it ’s our fault , and it ’s not , ” Dimon argued when one forlorn banker suggested , ridiculously , that JPMorgan should compensate Bear Stearns employees for their losses .
The stock market , for now , is betting that JPMorgan is a winner , and the stock has been rewarded with a 25 percent run-up , boosting Dimon ’s own stake to over $ 200 million .
But the benefits go far beyond personal wealth .
This might mean that Dimon no longer has to live in Sandy Weill ’s shadow .
“ Has he eclipsed Sandy ? ” asked someone who knows both well .
“ Yes , he has .
The only positive thing being written about Sandy these days is that Jamie learned from him . ”
Adds a hedge - fund manager , “ Sandy Weill did wonderful things for Citigroup , but forcing Jamie Dimon out will forever taint his legacy . ”
When I bring up the inevitable topic of Citigroup with Dimon , he seems exasperated .
He is clearly sick of being a character in someone else ’s legend .
“ I left ten years ago , ” he said , then corrected himself .
“ No , I did n’t leave , I was fired .
I was kicked out of the nest . ”
If he were inclined to , Dimon could easily gloat over the fact that JPMorgan has all but supplanted Citigroup as the preeminent financial conglomerate .
The numbers say it all : JPMorgan is valued by investors at $ 158 billion , Citigroup just three quarters as much .
JPMorgan is even mentioned now in the same breath as Goldman Sachs .
So ascendant is Dimon ’s reputation that he was recently able to lure an ex-Goldman partner out of retirement — a feat which usually takes a governorship or cabinet post — to become the company ’s chief risk officer .
“ There ’s no place I ’d rather be right now than working with Jamie and his team , ” says that new hire , Barry Zubrow .
Dimon seems ready for his new role as Wall Street ’s top dog .
After explaining how the Bear Stearns deal will likely prove a good one for JPMorgan shareholders , he segued into a rationale for why it might also prove so for the entire economy .
“ You have to keep in mind the financial conditions of the entire system , ” he said , when I asked him whether an appropriate example could have been set if Bear Stearns had been allowed to go under .
“ Who are you really helping if everyone gets hurt ?
No , I do n’t think highly paid executives at any investment bank deserve to get bailed out .
But at some point , you ’re just talking about various degrees of suffering . ”
Of course , JPMorgan did n’t “ save ” the system on its own .
The loans the company originally provided to Bear Stearns to keep it afloat had been guaranteed by the Fed , effectively making them risk - free .
Would Dimon have done the deal without the backstop from the Fed ?
He pauses .
“ It would have been very hard to do .
Without the Fed to help mitigate the risk , to protect us from an overconcentration in some risky assets , I ’m not sure it was doable at all . ”
So how worried is Dimon about the risky assets that might be lurking in his firm ’s own portfolio , stuff for which he does n’t have the luxury of a guarantee from the Fed , like , say , the company ’s derivatives exposure ?
JPMorgan had $ 77 trillion in so - called notional derivatives exposure at the end of 2007 , a number that gives some derivatives doubters pause .
After pointing out that JPMorgan ’s net exposure is only $ 67 billion — only $ 67 billion ?
No worries , then !
—Dimon and his team scoff at the analysts ’ suggestion that they do n’t understand the risks of such exposure .
They say they understand them all too well .
“ Look , if you do n’t worry in this business , you ’re crazy , ” Dimon said .
“ It ’s not lurking in the back of my mind . ”
He pointed to the center of his forehead .
“ It ’s right here . ”

BA is passing on higher fuel costs to customers
British Airways says it is increasing fuel surcharges on long and short - haul flights from 2 May .
The airline said the charges reflected high oil prices , which hit a record on Monday just below $ 120 a barrel .
The surcharge for short - haul flights will increase to £ 13 per flight from £ 10 , or to £ 26 for a return flight .
For one - way flights of less than nine hours the charge will increase by £ 10 to £ 63 , and by £ 15 to £ 79 for flights of more than nine hours .
Problems
British Airways has been beset by problems this year .
In addition to high fuel prices , its pilots have threatened to strike over the launch of a new subsidiary and the opening of its Terminal 5 at Heathrow was regarded as a disaster .
Staff at the new terminal were not able to get into work , thousands of bags were mislaid and flights were cancelled .
BA has warned that high fuel bills , an economic slowdown and the cost of Terminal 5 will hit its earnings in 2008 .
It has said that jet fuel costs have doubled over the past two years and fuel now accounts for a quarter of the airline 's costs .
Last year , BA was fined £ 121.5 m by the Office of Fair Trading and $ 300 m by the US Department of Justice for colluding with Virgin on the level of fuel surcharges that would be added to their ticket prices .
Virgin escaped the fines because it had informed the authorities that the breaches had happened .
In 1990 , Bobby Kotick bought 25 percent of failing videogame maker Activision for $ 440,000 , with financing from his mentor , casino king Steve Wynn .
Since then , the company has been in nonstop - growth mode , through both internal expansion and acquisitions , and late last year , Kotick engineered his biggest deal yet — a nearly $ 19 billion merger with Vivendi ’s game division .
The prize for Activision : Blizzard Entertainment , maker of the online game World of Warcraft , which has about 10 million paying subscribers .
Vivendi will own a majority stake in the merged company , to be renamed Activision Blizzard , and Kotick will run it .
With megahits like Guitar Hero , Call of Duty , and Tony Hawk ’s skateboarding games , Kotick , 45 , has become one of the most powerful figures in the $ 10 billion videogame industry ( a number that counts sales of games only , not consoles ) .
Longtime game - industry leader Electronic Arts currently has about $ 3.7 billion in annual sales .
Once Activision closes the merger with Vivendi , the combined entity will have yearly revenue of nearly $ 4 billion as well .
But E.A. recently made a hostile offer for Take - Two Interactive , creator of the Grand Theft Auto series , a move seen by industry observers as an attempt to stay ahead of Kotick .
Moreover , some analysts question whether Activision can continue growing at such a rapid rate .
Condé Nast Portfolio ’s Kevin Maney met with Kotick at his Beverly Hills home , an airy , angular , modern structure with contemporary art — including a de Kooning — on every wall .
( Kotick is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. )
Wearing a sweatshirt from an Allen & Co. media conference , blue workout pants , and white socks with no shoes , he talked about his management style , Wynn , and the future of the videogame business .
Portfolio : I take it that in the Vivendi merger , you were most interested in Blizzard ’s World of Warcraft .
Bobby Kotick :
We started hearing the rumors of how profitable that was .
My guys kept telling me about the business , and I did n’t believe it .
But we realized that this is not just a game .
It ’s a social network with a lot of elements , and people rely on the game for a lot more than just entertainment .
It was n’t the kind of thing that something else would come along and displace .
Portfolio :
How did the deal happen ?
Kotick :
We made an offer .
It was more than we 'd ever offered for anything — billions , almost equal to our own market value .
And Vivendi said , " We ’d really like not just to sell you the business but actually to become your partner . "
Portfolio :
Were there any tensions during the negotiations ?
The price ?
The amount of influence Vivendi will have in management ?
Kotick :
There was n’t any real tension .
I had an extremely long history with Blizzard .
The fact that we ’re so philosophically well aligned made the deal easier to accomplish .
Portfolio : Guitar
Hero is huge — with more than $ 1 billion in sales since it was introduced in 2005 .
Essentially , it lets people play along on a fake guitar to real songs .
Given that the Universal Music Group is part of Vivendi , will any special emphasis be given to its songs and artists ?
Kotick :
One of the big benefits will be access to the Universal library .
Guitar
Hero takes an artist to a whole different place in the popular culture right now .
Downloads on iTunes take off .
The artist ’s relevance and importance to 17 - year olds change in a way that you could never get in any other medium .
Forty percent of its users are women .
The age appeal is something we 've never seen before — 7 - year olds who have no idea who Aerosmith is are playing the band 's music on Guitar Hero .
So are 45 - year olds who spent a good portion of their lives following the band around .
Portfolio :
Where do you take the idea next ?
Kotick :
It ’s not just about guitars .
We ’ll include a lot of other instruments , vocals .
It will help us expand internationally .
It ’s the first game we ’ve had in which we can use local content and local bands .
Portfolio :
What else is in the works with other games ?
Kotick : Let ’s take Wii .
There are opportunities to add to the physical experience , whether it 's guitars or the Star Wars game — in which you have a lightsaber — or fishing .
Having that physical connection with what you see on the screen is bringing in audiences that never would have tried games .
But we ’re in the very , very earliest stage of physical interface .
Portfolio : OK , what ’s coming that we have n’t seen yet ?
Kotick : Games have not been a good storytelling medium .
It ’s because the characters on the screen do n’t have good facial animation .
Mouth movement is unrealistic , so it ’s hard to deliver dialogue .
Facial animation and mouth movement will become part of games .
Portfolio :
Let ’s talk about you .
Even as a kid , you were fascinated by business .
Kotick : I was pretty entrepreneurial .
I ran a hot - dog - and - soda stand at Little League , and I started a business planning parties in high school .
Portfolio :
In the early days of computing , you tried to create a graphic user interface for the Apple II ?
Kotick :
My dad had introduced me and a business partner to some venture capitalists in New York .
They were going to put up the money for us to go into this business .
It was a good amount — $ 2 million .
Portfolio :
But you did n’t end up taking it .
Why not ?
Kotick :
At the time , I had been invited to a cancer fundraiser in Texas .
I met this guy at the party who was 40 - years old , a real dynamic person .
I ran into him the next day at the hotel , and he said , " Are you going back to Michigan ? "
And I said , " No , I ’m actually going to New York .
I ’m working on this company . "
He said he was going to New York , and would I want to go with him ?
I said sure .
He had a DC - 9 , and I figured , it ca n’t be that unappealing .
It was Steve Wynn .
On the plane , he told me that when he was getting started , a mentor type had helped him out .
So he wanted to do that for someone else .
Portfolio :
This was the start of a significant relationship .
Kotick : I ended up blowing the original deal I had and later flew down to Atlantic City to meet Steve .
He said , " OK , how much do you need for a prototype ? "
We said , " About $ 300,000 . "
He wrote out the check .
Portfolio :
And he ’s been part of your life ever since then ?
Kotick :
Of all the things that could have happened to me in my life , meeting the Wynns was probably about the most fortunate .
Not just in the way you get a second set of parents — my parents were divorced , so the Wynns came with none of the guilt — but watching what he accomplished .
It set the bar so high .
That drove me to be even more successful .
Portfolio :
What ended up happening with that software company ?
Kotick : I met with Steve Jobs and spent time with then - C.E.O. John Sculley and a lot of the marketing folks .
Steve , even then , had very definitive ideas about the interface .
There were conventions that we used differently than Apple did .
Steve , being the dogmatic guy that he is , said that we had to change .
He took the mouse we had made and threw it on the floor .
He said , " This is garbage . "
It was great advice — demoralizing , but great advice .
The company was an abysmal failure .
Portfolio :
Then what ?
Kotick : I tried to buy Commodore , the computer maker , with the idea of actually turning it into a videogame company .
That did n’t work out either , but I learned a lot .
After that came Activision .
Portfolio :
What got your mind on videogames at all ?
Kotick : In 1984 , Steve Wynn took me out to dinner with then - Warner Bros. chief Steve Ross , who was having all sorts of problems with Atari , which Warner owned at the time .
Ross took me up and invited me to Atari .
When it collapsed , I realized there was nobody filling that void .
PCs did to some extent , but as multipurpose devices , not as something specialized .
Portfolio :
Is there a key to Activision 's growth ?
Kotick :
It 's about really being considerate of the culture in the game studios that Activision buys .
That 's the biggest difference between us and any of our competitors .
We built a model that celebrates entrepreneurial , opportunistic , independent values .
It 's almost the opposite of Electronic Arts , which has commoditized development .
It did a very good job of taking the soul out of a lot of the studios it acquired .
Portfolio :
Do you get involved in game concepts ?
Kotick : I play the role of cheerleader and adviser .
I do n’t personally pick the game ideas or get too involved in that .
Portfolio :
What do you worry about ?
Kotick : I 'm a worrier , so that 's another hour - long discussion .
But we have big and really well funded competitors — Nintendo , Sony , Microsoft .
Our competitors have a natural advantage on their own platforms .
Portfolio : How about E.A.'s $ 2 billion offer to buy Take - Two , which makes the hugely successful Grand Theft Auto games ?
Kotick : I ca n't comment on competitors ' deals .
Portfolio : Activision ’s growth has been phenomenal — over 80 percent in the past quarter .
Is that sustainable ?
Analysts are expecting it to slow down .
Kotick : Historically , during the past 15 years , Activision has grown at rates greater than the market .
I ’m hopeful that our growth will continue to outpace market growth and that of our competitors .
Portfolio : Anything else in Activision 's way ?
Kotick : Figuring out how to make the game experience more fun than any one of a hundred Facebook applications is going to be a challenge .
There 's your Unity '08 candidates , folks .
Enough to make me vomit in my mouth a little .

Sen .
Joe Lieberman has been named a chairman of Republican presidential hopeful John McCain 's state leadership team .
Lieberman , an Independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats , has endorsed the Arizona senator and campaigned for him in Florida , Michigan , New Hampshire and South Carolina .
He is heading McCain 's Connecticut campaign with Republican Rep. Christopher Shays .
George Jepsen , former state Democratic Party chairman who supported Ned Lamont 's successful challenge of Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary , said Lieberman 's endorsement of McCain is an affront to Democrats who believed Lieberman when he said two years ago that he was committed to helping put a Democrat in the White House in 2008 .
Maybe I should n't help McCain out this way , but it seems worth reminding that Lieberman as VP ( which you KNOW is the next step ) did n't work out so well the last time .
There 's also some choice quotes from an interview of Lieberman in Newsweek .
I 've been thinking about AJAX a lot recently .
Between reviewing a book on the subject , reading some of the comments coming out of the Adobe Engage event and chatting with some coworkers at dinner about WPF / E I 've had a lot of food for thought .
I 'll start with an excerpt from Ted Leung 's post entitled Adobe wants to be the Microsoft of the Web
The problem as I see it
I think that a lot ( but not all ) apps will become RIA ’s , and the base platform technology for RIA ’s is very important .
Too important to be controlled , or designed by any single party .
The current vogue toolchain , AJAX , has this property .
It also has the property of being a cross platform development nightmare .
On the desktop , you commit yourself to a single cross platform library / technology , and then you spend the rest of your time wrestling with it .
In AJAX , you have multiple browsers on each platform that you want to support .
Not only that , you have multiple versions of each browser .
...
Flash / Flex
Enter Flash / Flex .
Flash has a great cross platform story .
One runtime , any platform .
Penetration of the Flash Player is basically the same as penetration of browsers capable of supporting big AJAX apps .
There are nice development tools .
This is highly appealing .
What is not appealing is going back to a technology which is single sourced and controlled by a single vendor .
If web applications liberated us from the domination of a single company on the desktop , why would we be eager to be dominated by a different company on the web ?
Most people who 've done significant AJAX development will admit that the development story is a mess .
I personally do n't mind the the Javascript language but I 'm appalled that the most state of the art development process I 've found is to use Emacs to edit my code , Firebug to debug in Firefox and attaching Visual Studio to the Internet Explorer processes to debug in IE .
This seems like a joke when compared to developing Java apps in Eclipse or .NET applications in Visual Studio .
Given how hypercompetitive the " Web 2.0 " world is , I doubt that this state of affairs will last much longer .
There is too much pressure on Web companies to improve their productivity and stand out in a world full of derivative YouTube / MySpace / Flickr knock offs .
If one company finds a way to be more productive and / or build richer Web applications the rest of the industry will follow .
This is pretty much what happened with Google and AJAX as well as with YouTube and Flash Video .
Once those companies showed how much value they were getting from technologies which were once passe , everyone jumped on the bandwagon .
This means that it is inevitable that Rich Internet Applications will eventually be built on a platform that provides a better development experience than AJAX does today .
The only questions are how quickly will this happen and which technology will replace AJAX ?
Ted Leung mentions two contenders for the throne ; Flash / Flex and OpenLaszlo .
I 'll add a third entry to that list , Windows Presention Foundation / Everywhere ( WPF/E ) .
Before discussing what it will take for one of these contenders to displace AJAX , I should point out that being " open " has nothing to do with it .
Openness is not a recipe for success when it comes to development platforms .
According to TIOBE Java is the most popular programming language today and it was a proprietary language tightly controlled by Sun Microsystems .
Before that , it was commonly stated that Visual Basic was the most popular programming language and it was a proprietary language controlled by Microsoft .
I believe these count as existence proofs that a popular development platform can rise to the top while being controlled by a single vendor .
So what will it take for an RIA platform to displace the popularity of AJAX besides being able to build richer user interfaces ?
Ubiquity : Over 95 % of the Web users are using an AJAX capable browser .
Any replacement for AJAX must have similar penetration or it's dead in the water .
No one wants to turn away customers especialy when it 's competitors are n't doing anything that stupid .
Debug Once , Run Anywhere :
The biggest problem with AJAX is that it is n't a single development platform .
Being able to write an application and debug it once instead of having a different debugging and runtime experience for Internet Explorer , Firefox and Safari is the killer productivity enhancer .
Of course , there will always be differences between environments but if we can move to a world where RIA development is more like cross-platform Java development as opposed to cross- platform C++ development ( yes , I know that 's an oxymoron ) then we all win .
Continuoum of Development Tools : I do n't need expensive development tools to become an AJAX developer , however if I feel that I need heavy duty tooling I can buy Visual Studio 2005 then download ASP .
NET AJAX to get a fancy integrated development environment .
Any platform that expects to replace AJAX needs to have a continuoum with high quality , free & Open Source tools on one end and expensive , proprietary and " rich " tools at the other .
The Java world with it 's culture of Open Source tools like Eclipse , JBoss and Hibernate coexisting with overpriced tools from big vendors like IBM WebSphere and BEA WebLogic is the best example of this to date .
That way the hackers are happy and the suits are happy as well .
So far Adobe seems closer than anyone in getting the trifecta .
In a year or two , things might look different .
The General is very happy to announce that it 'll be exporting some of its two - mode Tahoes and Malibu to the Middle East ; the Middle East is happy to announce that it does n't want them and is sending them back ( j / k ) .
The Dubai Roads & Transit Authority will be taking possession of the vehicles to use as fleet cars and cabs as part of a test program .
The great thing about hybrids is they only slow our dependence on oil in the Middle East , making sure we 'll care about them forever .
We 're actually not being fair to Dubai , which only receives less than 3 % of its annual revenues from natural gas and petroleum .
The hilarious press release below the jump :

General Motors and Government of Dubai to Bring Hybrids to the Middle East
Dubai , UAE - General Motors and Dubai Roads and Transport Authority ( RTA ) announced today an agreement for an evaluation program that will bring hybrid vehicles to the Middle East .
The agreement , which includes a comprehensive local market evaluation of GM's all - new Chevrolet Tahoe Two - Mode Hybrid and the all - new Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid , could eventually lead to one of the largest fleets of hybrid vehicles in the world .

The accord is groundbreaking because it demonstrates the common goal of General Motors , Dubai RTA and the Government of Dubai to reduce their impact on the environment - even in a region that is rich in oil - resources .
The agreement was signed by His Excellency Matar Al Tayer , Chairman of the Board & Executive Director of the RTA and Terry Johnsson , President of General Motors Middle East Operations , in the presence of Engineer Essa Al - Dosary , CEO Public Transportation Agency , Engineer Abdul Aziz Malik , CEO Dubai Taxi , and a number of department directors and officials from RTA and General Motors .
Maureen Kempston Darkes , GM Group Vice President and President of GM Latin America , Africa and the Middle East said , " We are honored that Dubai RTA selected the all - new Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid and Malibu Hybrid for this program .
This is further evidence that our environmental strategy goes to markets all around the world - and is truly a global effort to reduce emissions and develop sustainable transportation .
These advanced technology vehicles are leaders in their automotive segments and selecting them is testimony to the visionary leadership of the Government of Dubai .
His Excellency Matar Al
Tayer said that this initiative comes in implementation of the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai to seek a safe , clean and attractive and sustainable environment that lives up to the reputation and prestige of the Emirate .
It also comes in the framework of RTA 's commitment to protect life and property , preserve the environment and natural resources , improve standards of occupational health and public safety , and implement all the necessary technologies to reduce noise levels caused by means of transportation .
The GM - RTA agreement calls for the provision of a small fleet of Chevrolet Tahoe and Malibu hybrids that will be used as limousines and taxis by RTA on the roads in Dubai .
The program will last one year , beginning in January 2008 .
General Motors will provide technical training on safety and other aspects for 15 RTA technicians , along with training for 40 drivers of Dubai Taxi .
During the program , GM and the RTA will work together to validate the vehicles for use and serviceability .
The intent is for the Dubai RTA to consider the Chevrolet hybrids for its fleet plans scheduled for early 2009 .

When traveling I just love to read news from my favorite social news site reddit.com .
A few weeks ago I saw this ' Ask Reddit ' post which asked if we could get a reddit version for mobile phones .
Well , I thought , it 's a cool project and I can do it quickly .
While scanning through the comments of ' Ask Reddit ' post , I noticed davidlvann 's comment where he said that Digg.com already had almost a plain text version of Digg , called DiggRiver.com .
It did n't take me long to do a
$ whois redditriver.com
No match for " REDDITRIVER.COM " .
to find that the domain RedditRiver.com was not registered !
What a great name for a project !
I quickly mailed my friend Alexis [ kn0thing ]
Ohanian at Reddit ( check his alien blog ) to ask a permission to do a Reddit River project .
Sure enough , he registered the domain for me and I was free to make it happen !
I 'll describe how I made the site , and I will release full source code .
Update :
The project is now live !
Update : Full source code is now available !
It includes all the scripts mentioned here !
My language of choice for this project is Python , the same language reddit.com is written in .
This is actually the first real project I am doing in Python ( I'm a big Perl fan ) .
I have a good overall understanding of Python but I have never done a project from the ground up !
Before doing the project I watched a few Python video lectures and read a bunch of articles to get into a mindset of a Pythonista .
Designing Stages of RedditRiver.com
The main goal of the project was to create a very lightweight version of reddit , which would monitor for story changes ( as they get up / down voted ) on several pages across the most popular popular subreddits , and which would find mobile versions of stories posted ( what I mean is rewrite URLs , say , a post to The Washington Post gets rewritten to the print version of the same article , or a link to youtube.com gets rewritten to the mobile version of yotube.com -- m.youtube.com , etc. ) .
The project was done in several separate steps .
First , I set up the web server to handle Python applications ,
Then I created a few Python modules to extract contents of Reddit website ,
Next I created an SQLite database and wrote a few scripts to save the extracted data ,
Then I wrote a Python module to discover mobile versions of given web pages ,
Finally , I created the web.py application to handle requests to RedditRiver.com !
Setting up the Web Server
This blog and picurls.com run on a dedicated linux server .
I use lighttpd web server and PHP programming language for this project .
To get RedditRiver running , I had to add Python support to the web server .
I decided to run web.py web framework to serve the HTML contents because of its simplicity and because Reddit guys used it themselves after rewriting Reddit from Lisp to Python .
Following the install instructions , getting web.py running on the server was as simple as installing the web.py package !
It was also just as easy to get lighttpd web server to communicate with web.py and my application .
This required flup package to be installed to allow lighttpd to interface with web.py .
Update : after setting it all up , and experimenting a bit with web.py ( version 0.23 ) and Cheetah 's templates , I found that for some mysterious reason web.py did not handle " #include " statements of the templates .
The problem was with web. py's ' cheetah.py ' file , line 23 , where it compiled the regular expression for handling " #include " statements :
r_include = re_compile (r '( ?!\\) #include \ " (.*? ) \ " ( $ | # ) ' , re . M )
When I tested it out in interpreter ,
>>> r_include = re.compile(r'( ?!\\) #include \ " (.*? ) \ " ( $ |# ) ' , re . M ) >>> r_include.search ( '# include " foo " ' ) .groups ( ) ( ' foo ' , '' ) >>> r_include.search (' foo
#include " bar.html "
baz ' ).groups ( ) ( ' bar.html ' , '')
it found #include 's accross multiline text lines just fine , but it did not work with my template files .
I tested it like 5 times and just could n't get it why it was not working .
As RedditRiver is the only web.py application running on my server , I easily patched that regex on line 23 to something trivial and it all started working !
I dropped all the negative lookahead magic and checking for end of the line :
r_include = re_compile ( r ' #include " (.*? ) " ' , re . M )
As I said , I am not sure why the original regex did not work in the web.py application , but did work in the interpreter .
If anyone knows what happened , I will be glad to hear from you !
Accessing Reddit Website via Python
I wrote several Python modules ( which also work as executables ) to access information on Reddit - stories across multiple pages of various subreddits ( and front page ) and user created subreddits .
As Reddit still does not provide an API to access the information on their site , I had to extract the relevant information from the HTML content of the pages .
The first module I wrote is called ' subreddits.py ' which accesses http://reddit.com/reddits and returns ( or prints out , if used as an executable ) the list of the most popular subreddits ( a subreddit is a reddit for a specific topic , for example , programming or politics )
Get this program here : catonmat.net/ftp/subreddits.py
This module provides three useful functions :
get_subreddits ( pages=1 , new=False ) , which gets ' pages ' pages of subreddits and returns a list of dictionaries of them .
If new is True , gets ' pages ' pages of new subreddits ( http://reddit.com/reddits/new),
, which gets ' pages ' pages of subreddits and returns a list of dictionaries of them .
If new is True , gets ' pages ' pages of new subreddits ( http://reddit.com/reddits/new), print_subreddits_paragraph ( ) , which prints subreddits information in human readable format , and
, which prints subreddits information in human readable format , and print_subreddits_json ( ) , which prints it in JSON format .
The output is in utf - 8 encoding .
The way this module works can be seen from the Python interpreter right away :
>>> import subreddits >>> srs = subreddits.get_subreddits(pages=2 ) >>> len( srs ) 50 >>> srs [ : 5 ] [ {' position ' : 1 , ' description ' : '' , ' name ' : ' reddit.com ' , ' subscribers ' : 11031 , ' reddit_name ' : ' reddit.com'} , {'position ' : 2 , ' description ' : '' , ' name ' : ' politics ' , ' subscribers ' : 5667 , ' reddit_name ' : ' politics'} , {'position ' : 3 , ' description ' : '' , ' name ' : ' programming ' , ' subscribers ' : 9386 , ' reddit_name ' : ' programming '} , {'position ' : 4 , ' description ' : ' Yeah reddit , you finally got it .
Context appreciated .' , ' name ' : ' Pictures and Images ' , ' subscribers ' : 4198 , ' reddit_name ' : ' pics'} , {'position ' : 5 , ' description ' : '' , ' name ' : ' obama ' , ' subscribers ' : 651 , ' reddit_name ' : ' obama'} ] >>> >>> from pprint import pprint >>> pprint ( srs [ 3:5 ] ) [ {' description ' : ' Yeah reddit , you finally got it .
Context appreciated .' , ' name ' : ' Pictures and Images ' , ' reddit_name ' : ' pics ' , ' subscribers ' : 4198} , {'description ' : '' , ' name ' : ' obama ' , ' reddit_name ' : ' obama ' , ' subscribers ' : 651} ] >>> >>>
subreddits.print_subreddits_paragraph( srs [ 3:5 ] ) position : 4 name : Pictures and Images reddit_name : pics description : Yeah reddit , you finally got it .
Context appreciated .
subscribers : 4198 position : 5 name : obama reddit_name : obama description : subscribers : 651 >>> >>> subreddits.print_subreddits_json(srs [ 3:5 ] ) [ { " position " : 4 , " description " : " Yeah reddit , you finally got it .
Context appreciated . " , " name " : " Pictures and Images " , " subscribers " : 4198 , " reddit_name " : " pics " } , { " position " : 4 , " description " : " " , " name " : " obama " , " subscribers " : 651 , " reddit_name " : " obama " } ]
Or it can be called from the command line :
$ ./subreddits .py -- help usage : subreddits .py [ options ] options : -h , -- help show this help message and exit - oOUTPUT Output format : paragraph or json .
Default : paragraph .
- pPAGES
How many pages of subreddits to output .
Default : 1 . -n Retrieve new subreddits .
Default : nope .
This module reused the awesome BeautifulSoup HTML parser module , and simplejson JSON encoding module .
The second program I wrote is called ' redditstories.py ' which accesses the specified subreddit and gets the latest stories from it .
It was written pretty much the same way I did it for redditmedia project in Perl .
Get this program here : catonmat.net/ftp/redditstories.py
This module also provides three similar functions :
get_stories ( subreddit= ' front_page ' , pages=1 , new =False ) , which gets ' pages ' pages of stories from subreddit and returns a list of dictionaries of them .
If new is True , gets new stories only .
, which gets ' pages ' pages of stories from subreddit and returns a list of dictionaries of them .
If new is True , gets new stories only .
print_stories_paragraph( ) , which prints subreddits information in human readable format .
, which prints subreddits information in human readable format . print_stories_json( ) , which prints it in JSON format .
The output is in utf - 8 encoding .
It can also be used as a Python module or executable .
Here is an example of using it as a module :
>>> import redditstories >>> s = redditstories.get_stories(subreddit='programming ') >>> len(s ) 25 >>> s [ 2:4 ] [ {' title ' : " when customers do n't pay attention and reply to a " donotreply.com " email address , it goes to Chet Faliszek , a programmer in Seattle " , 'url ' : ' http://consumerist.com/371600/the-man-who-owns-donotreplycom-knows-all-the-secrets-of-the-world', ' unix_time ' : 1206408743 , ' comments ' : 54 , ' subreddit ' : ' programming ' , ' score ' : 210 , 'user ' : ' srmjjg ' , ' position ' : 3 , ' human_time ' : ' Tue Mar 25 03:32:23 2008 ' , ' id ' : ' 6d8xl'} , {' title ' : ' mysql --i-am-a- dummy ' , 'url ' : ' http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/mysql-tips.html#safe-updates', ' unix_time ' : 1206419543 , ' comments ' : 59 , ' subreddit ' : ' programming ' , ' score ' : 135 , 'user ' : ' enobrev ' , ' position ' : 4 , ' human_time ' : ' Tue Mar 25 06:32:23 2008 ' , ' id ' : ' 6d9d3'} ] >>> from pprint import pprint >>> pprint ( s [ 2:4 ] ) [ {' comments ' : 54 , ' human_time ' : ' Tue Mar 25 03:32:23 2008 ' , ' id ' : ' 6d8xl ' , ' position ' : 3 , ' score ' : 210 , ' subreddit ' : ' programming ' , ' title ' : " when customers do n't pay attention and reply to a " donotreply.com " email address , it goes to Chet Faliszek , a programmer in Seattle " , ' unix_time ' : 1206408743 , 'url ' : ' http://consumerist.com/371600/the-man-who-owns-donotreplycom-knows-all-the-secrets-of-the-world', ' user ' : ' srmjjg'} , {' comments ' : 59 , ' human_time ' : ' Tue Mar 25 06:32:23 2008 ' , ' id ' : ' 6d9d3 ' , ' position ' : 4 , ' score ' : 135 , ' subreddit ' : ' programming ' , ' title ' : ' mysql --i-am-a-dummy ' , ' unix_time ' : 1206419543 , 'url ' : ' http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/mysql-tips.html#safe-updates', ' user ' : ' enobrev'} ] >>> redditstories.print_stories_paragraph(s[ :1 ] ) position : 1 subreddit : programming id : 6 daps title : Sign Up Forms Must Die url : http://www.alistapart.com/articles/signupforms score : 70 comments : 43 user : markokocic unix_time : 1206451943 human_time : Tue Mar 25 15:32:23 2008 >>> redditstories.print_stories_json(s [ :1 ] ) [ { " title " : " Sign Up Forms Must Die " , " url " : " http:\/\/www.alistapart.com\/articles\/signupforms " , " unix_time " : 1206451943 , " comments " : 43 , " subreddit " : " programming " , " score " : 70 , " user " : " markokocic " , " position " : 1 , " human_time " : " Tue Mar 25 15:32:23 2008 " , " id " : " 6daps " } ]
Using it from a command line :
$ ./redditstories .py -- help usage : redditstories .py [ options ] options : -h , -- help show this help message and exit - oOUTPUT Output format : paragraph or json .
Default : paragraph .
- pPAGES
How many pages of stories to output .
Default : 1 . -sSUBREDDIT
Subreddit to retrieve stories from .

-n Retrieve new stories .
Default : nope .
These two programs just beg to be converted into a single Python module .
They have the same logic with just a few changes in the parser .
But for the moment I am generally happy , and they serve the job well .
They can also be understood individually without having a need to inspect several source files .
I think that one of the future posts could be a reddit information accessing library in Python .
I can already think of one hundred ideas what someone can do with such a library .
For example , one could print out top programming stories his or her shell :
$ echo " Top five programming stories : " && echo && ./redditstories .py -s programming | grep ' title ' | head - 5 && echo && echo " Visit http://reddit.com/r/programming to view them ! "
Top five programming stories : title : Sign Up Forms Must
Die title :
You can pry XP from my cold dead hands !
title : mysql -- i- am - a- dummy title : when customers do n't pay attention and reply to a " donotreply.com " email address , it goes to Chet Faliszek , a programmer in Seattle title : Another canvas 3D Renderer written in Javascript Visit http://reddit.com/r/programming to view them !
Creating and Populating the SQLite Database
The database choice for this project is SQLite , as it is fast , light and this project is so simple , that I can't think of any reason to use a more complicated database system .
The database has a trivial structure with just two tables ' subreddits ' and ' stories ' .
CREATE TABLE subreddits ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT , reddit_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE , name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE , description TEXT , subscribers INTEGER NOT NULL , position INTEGER NOT NULL , active BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 ) ; INSERT INTO subreddits ( id , reddit_name , name , description , subscribers , position ) VALUES ( 0 , ' front_page ' , ' reddit.com front page ' , ' since subreddit named reddit.com has different content than the reddit.com frontpage , we need this ' , 0 , 0 ) ; CREATE TABLE stories ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT , title TEXT NOT NULL , url TEXT NOT NULL , url_mobile TEXT , reddit_id TEXT NOT NULL , subreddit_id INTEGER NOT NULL , score INTEGER NOT NULL , comments INTEGER NOT NULL , user TEXT NOT NULL , position INTEGER NOT NULL , date_reddit UNIX_DATE NOT NULL , date_added UNIX_DATE NOT NULL ) ; CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_stories ON stories ( title , url , subreddit_id ) ;
The ' subreddits ' table contains information extracted by ' subreddits.py ' module ( described earlier ) .
It keeps the information and positions of all the subreddits which appeared on the most popular subreddit page ( http://reddit.com/reddits).
Reddit lists ' reddit.com ' as a separate subreddit on the most popular subreddit page , but it turned out that it was not the same as the front page of reddit !
That 's why I insert a fake subreddit called ' front_page ' in the table right after creating it , to keep track of both ' reddit.com ' subreddit and reddit 's front page .
The information in the table is updated by a new program - update_subreddits.py .
View : catonmat.net/ftp/update_subreddits.py
The other table , ' stories ' contains information extracted by ' redditstories.py ' module ( also described earlier ) .
The information in this table is updated by another new program - update_stories .py .
As it is impossible to keep track of all the scores and comments , and position changes across all the subreddits , the program monitors just a few pages on each of the most popular subreddits .
View : catonmat.net/ftp/update_stories.py
These two programs are run periodically by crontab ( task scheduler in unix ) .
The program update_subreddits .py gets run every 30 minutes and update_stories .
py every 5 minutes .
Finding the Mobile Versions of Given Websites
This is probably the most interesting piece of software that I wrote for this project .
The idea is to find versions of a website suitable for viewing on a mobile device .
For example , most of the stories on politics subreddit link to the largest online newspapers and news agencies , such as The Washington Post or MSNBC .
These websites provide a ' print ' version of the page which is ideally suitable for mobile devices .
Another example is websites who have designed a real mobile version of their page and let the user agent know about it by placing < link rel= " alternate " media= " handheld " href= " ... " > tag in the head section of an html document .
I wrote an ' autodiscovery '
Python module called ' autodiscover.py ' .
This module is used by the update_stories .
py program described in the previous section .
After getting the list of new reddit stories , the update_stories .
py tries to autodiscover a mobile version of the story and if it is successful , it places it in ' url_mobile ' column of the ' stories ' table .
Here is an example run from Python interpreter of the module :
>>> from autodiscovery import AutoDiscovery >>> ad = AutoDiscovery ( ) >>> ad.autodiscover ( ' http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402969.html')
' http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402969_pf.html' >>> ad.autodiscover ( ' http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11880954/')
' http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11880954/print/1/displaymode/1098/'
And it can also be used from command line :
$ ./autodiscovery.py
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402969.html
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402969_pf.html
Source : catonmat.net/ftp/autodiscovery.py
This module actually uses a configuration file ' autodisc.conf ' which defines patterns to look for in the web page 's HTML code .
At the moment the config file is pretty primitive and defines just three configuration options :
REWRITE_URL defines a rule how to rewrite URL of a website which makes it difficult to autodiscover the mobile link easily .
For example , a page could use JavaScript to pop -up the print version of the page .
In such a case REWRITE_URL rule can be used to match the host which uses this technique and rewrite part of the url to another .

This directive defines such phrases to look for .

This directive defines such phrases to look for .
IGNORE_URL defines urls to ignore .
For example , a link to a flash animation should definitely be ignored , as it does not define a mobile version at all .
You can place the . swf extension in this ignore list to avoid it being downloaded by autodiscovery.py .
Configuration used by autodiscovery.py : catonmat.net/ftp/autodisc.conf
Creating the web.py Application
The final part to the project was creating the web.py application .
It was pretty straight forward to create it as it only required writing the correct SQL expressions for selecting the right data out of the database .
Here is how the controller for the web.py application looks like :
urls = ( '/' , ' RedditRiver ' , '/ page /(\d+ ) /?' , ' RedditRiverPage ' , '/r/( [a-zA - Z0 - 9 _ . -]+)/?' , ' SubRedditRiver ' , '/r/( [a- zA - Z0 - 9 _ . -]+) / page/(\d+ )/?' , ' SubRedditRiverPage ' , '/ reddits / ?' , ' SubReddits ' , '/ stats / ? ' , ' Stats ' , '/ stats /( [a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ . - ]+ )/?' , ' SubStats ' , '/ about / ? ' , ' AboutRiver ' )
The first version of reddit river implements browsable front stories ( RedditRiver and RedditRiverPage classes ) , browsable subreddit stories ( SubRedditRiver and SubRedditRiverPage classes ) , list of the most popular subreddits ( SubReddits class ) , front page and subreddit statistics ( most popular stories and most active users , Stats and SubStats classes ) and an about page ( AboutRiver class ) .

Radar astronomy is a crucial tool in measuring the trajectories of Earth - crossing asteroids .
If we ’re going to be hit , radar is how we ’ll work out when .
The technique has also been used to image various bodies such as the asteroid 216 Kleopatra , to measure distances with extreme accuracy and to test relativity by monitoring the orbit of Mercury .
The technique was first used in the 1960s and since then astronomers have broadcast some 1400 radar transmissions towards the heavens , says Alexander Zaitsev at the Institute of Radioengineering and Electronics , Russian Academy of Sciences , in Fryazino near Moscow .
These transmissions have lit up about 2 ×10 ^ - 3 part of the sky .
By contrast , humanity has broadcast only 16 messages intended for extraterretrial consumption .
And these have illuminated an area of sky some 2000 times less than the radar astronomy signals .
Since the radar signals were 500 times longer than the ET messages , Zaitsev says that ET is about 1 million times more likely to pick these up first .
So first contact is likely to be a little more prosaic than most of us had anticipated .
The purpose of Zaitsev ’s calculation is to take on the chicken little ’s who say that we should keep our interstellar gobs shut lest some hostile super - civilisation decide to turn us all to astroslavery .
He says these people should be more worried about radio astronomy than ET messages and since we ca n’t stop monitoring Earth - crossing asteroids , the party poopers might as well give up and go home .
It ’s all irrelevant anyway .
If ET was going to make herself known , she ’d have done it by now .

Very excited that the SDK has come out , but have any of you been to TUAW ?
They 've come out of the Reality Distortion Field a little faster then the folks at Gizmodo .
1 . It does n't only cost $ 99 to publish a 3rd party app , you need to pay the $ 99 dollar charge if you even want to load apps your developing onto your own phone , for hardware debugging .
Not a deal breaker , but this surely was n't mentioned in the press conference .
2. 3rd party apps cannot run in the background !
That 's right , no multitasking for 3rd party apps on the iPhone .
Now , this is getting more serious .
Like how long has multitasking been around ?
Windows 3.11 ?
Ok , so too many open apps will take too much from system resources .
But at least give us the option to muck our own phones up , do n't treat us at kids / grandmothers .
Now , I 'm still very excited about the SDK 's possibilities .
70 % of profits minus $ 99 is a VERY nice incentive to code up some apps , with iTunes as a distribution system .
No development infrastructure that I 've ever seen produced a return like that , once all other expenses were accounted for .
... and I have to say , I 've been hearing empty speculation about Apple releasing A2DP / other bluetooth profiles since release .
" I think it 's coming out at Mac world , with Leopard release , with the SDK , ... "
The next likely opportunity for A2 DP to be released is this June , with the 2.0 firmware .
If I do n't see an augmented Bluetooth stack by then , I 'm going to start looking for a new phone ( Sony Xperia / N95 8GB ) .

The Central Intelligence Agency , also known as the " Cocaine Import Agency , " is suspected by aviation experts of running cocaine and other drugs on its fleet of small passenger jets used to ferry prisoners to and from American gulags like Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
A Beechcraft Super King Air 350 ( N675BC ) , registered to a suspected CIA front , Aviation Enterprises , Inc. of Wilmington , Delaware , was recently spotted alongside a Russian - made AN - 124 , suspected of being a major drug transport cargo plane , in Colombia .
The " specially configured " King Air flew from Tampa to Guantanamo Bay on October 22 , 2007 .
From 2002 to 2006 , the King Air was registered to Prewitt Leasing Inc. of Bedford , Texas .
On September 19 , 2007 , the King Air was spotted at Medellin 's Enrique Olaya Herrera airport in Colombia .
On August 20 , 2007 , the plane was sighted at Juan Santamaria International Airport in San Jose , Costa Rica .
The aircraft was last seen in Houston .
The King Air 's trips to Guantanamo include :
N675 BC 12.06.2004 MUGM
( Gtmo ) KFLL
N675 BC 07.01.2005 KPDK ( DeKalb - Peachtree ) MUGM
N675 BC 18.07.2006 MUGM KFLL ( Ft.Lauderdale-Hollywood )
N675 BC 24.05.2006 MUGM KFLL
N675 BC 28.03.2006 MUGM KFLL
N675 BC 22.10.2007 MUGM KTPA ( Tampa )
The plane has also been a frequent visitor to Grand Cayman and was seen in Mexico in 2003 .
Another CIA rendition aircraft , Learjet ( N500ND ) , registered to World Jet of Delaware , a frequent visitor to Guantanamo , experienced an accident at Dominica 's Melville Hall Airport on August 11 , 2007 , while landing from St. John in the US Virgin Islands .
The accident is common for aircraft carrying heavy " loads . "
The National Transportation Safety Board concluded : " The pilot in command pumped the brakes with no response .
The drag chute was deployed but was not effective .
The pilot in command stated he took over the flight controls and applied maximum braking .
The airplane continued to roll off the end of the runway , down an embankment , through a fence , and came to a stop on a road . "
The successor to Science
Those of you who 've read my novel Ventus may recognize " The Successor to Science " as the title of a fictional paper referred to in that book .
The paper introduces the reader to the concept of thalience .
As originally intended , thalience was an attempt to look past science to see what discipline would come after it -- hence the title " A Successor to Science . "
You 're forgiven if you 're bewildered -- after science ?
How does that make sense ?
Am I saying that science is just a cultural phenomenon , a fashion ?
No .
But it is something that exists in a particular historical context , and the question I was asking with thalience was whether science might produce some new kind of activity that , while not replacing it , could be viewed as an offspring of equal value to us .
Let 's back up a bit .
In Ventus I invented a new word , and gave several definitions for it -- quite deliberately , because I believe that ambiguity is the life - force of words .
The word is acutally defined now on Wikipedia , but the two definitions given there are only half - right .
Vinge asked me whether the word has to do with distributed sensor nets -- because the Winds of Ventus are a system of massively parallel nanotech AIs -- and I said yes at the time , but did n't expand on what that implied .
If your eyes have n't glazed over yet , bear with me ; you may find what follows interesting .
What if you could separate the activity of science from the human researchers who conduct it ?
Automate it , in fact ?
Imagine creating a bot that does physics experiments and builds an internal model of the world based on those experiments .
It could start out as something simple that stacked blocks and knocked them over again .
Later models could get quite sophisticated ; and let 's say we combine this ability with the technology of self - reproducing machines ( von Neumann machines ) .
Seed the moon with our pocket - protector - brandishing AIs and let them go nuts .
Let them share their findings and refine their models .
So far so good .
Here 's the question that leads to the notion of thalience : if they were allowed to freely invent their own semantics , would their physical model of the universe end up resembling ours ?
-- I do n't mean would it produce the same results given the same inputs , because it would .
But would it be a humanly - accessible theory ?
This is a better question than it might at first appear , because even we can produce mutually irreconcilable theories that successfully describe the same things : quantum mechanics and relativity , for instance .
Their worldviews are incompatible , despite the fact that together they appear to accurately describe the real world .
So it 's at least possible that non-human intelligences would come to different conclusions about what the universe was like , even if their theory produced results compatible with our models .
This little thought - experiment asks whether we can turn metaphysics into a hard science ; and this becomes the first interesting meaning of the world thalience : it is an attempt to give the physical world itself a voice so that rather than us asking what reality is , reality itself can tell us .
It is possible that thalient systems will always converge on a model of the universe that is comprehensible to humans ; if so , then we will actually have a means of solving what were once considered philosophically imponderable questions -- such as , what is the world really made of ?
How much of our understanding of the universe is subjective , and is truely objective knowledge even possible ?
A thalient system could tell us .
In Ventus , of course , the thalient system has lost the ability to communicate with humans ; but the end of the novel holds out the hope that some sort of bridge can be constructed .
Strangely , this bridge appears in the form of politics , rather than as a meeting of minds through Reason or Mathematics .
But there 's a further meaning to the term .
If you were to automate science , and reap the rewards , what would you be left doing ?
Twiddling your thumbs while the AIs solve all the big problems ?
Well , not necessarily .
The last definition of thalience involves the exciting possibility that , yes , multiple equally valid physical models of the universe are possible .
Not one true " theory of everything " but many , perhaps an endless number of them .
In this case , the conclusions we reach about our place in the universe when we understand quantum mechanics and relativity -- or , for that matter , Newtonian physics -- are accidental , by - products of the subjective side of objective research .
So here is the grandest definition of thalience : it is the discipline that chooses among multiple successful scientific models based on which ones best satisfy our human , aesthetic / moral / personal needs .
In other words , given two or more equally valid models of the universe , thalience is the art of choosing the one with the most human face .
It is the recovery of the natural in our understanding of the Natural .
The ability to create non-human intelligences that can ask the same questions we ask leads to the possibility not just of answering ancient questions , but of turning science into the precursor of a new human activity .
If thalient entities can create accurate models of the world that are different from our own , you may no longer be faced with the dilemma of taking either a religious , comforting view of the universe , or an objective and scientific -- but not humanly satisfying -- view .
Thalience would consist in taking science 's results as raw material for building new mythologies -- and possibly religions -- which would differ from all previous ones in that they would all be scientifically , objectively true .
Now maybe you can see how science could have a successor : thalience would use objective truth as an artistic medium and merge subjectivity and objectivity in a creative activity whose purpose is the re-sanctification of the natural world .
To believe in an uplifting and satisfying vision of your place in the universe , and to know that this vision is true ( or as true as anything can be ) would be sublime .
Thalience would be an activity worthy of post - scientific humanity , or our own biological or post - biological successors .

With France preparing to oversee the appointment process , Blair set out his vision of modern European democracy at a meeting of the French governing conservative party by also claiming that EU countries could achieve far more by working together than acting in isolation .
' Europe is not a question of left or right , but a question of the future or the past , of strength or weakness , ' said the former British Prime Minister , speaking in French .
In his most important speech since leaving Downing Street last June , addressing 2,000 supporters of French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Blair said globalisation was eradicating traditional party lines and class distinctions and rendering old political remedies obsolete .
' It 's about today versus yesterday .
Less about politics and more about a state of mind ; open as opposed to closed , ' he said .
' Terrorism , security , immigration , organised crime , energy , the environment , science , biotechnology and higher education .
In all these areas , and others , we are much stronger and able to deliver what our citizens expect from us as individual nations if we are part of a strong and united Europe , ' he added before supporters of Sarkozy 's Union Pour Un Mouvement Populaire ( UMP ) party .
Blair , a close ally of Sarkozy who advised the French politician during his rise to power , is strongly backed by the French President to become President of the EU Council of Ministers in January next year , a position he has previously said he was not interested in .
Sarkozy , 52 , who appeared at the Palais des Sports rally without his 40 - year - old girlfriend , Carla Bruni , offered unequivocal backing for Blair yesterday , describing him as an ideal candidate to run Europe .
' He is intelligent , he is brave and he is a friend .
We need him in Europe .
How can we govern a continent of 450 million people if the President changes every six months and has to run his own country at the same time ?
I want a President chosen from the top - not a compromise candidate - who will serve for two - and - a - half years , ' added Sarkozy .
A UMP party grandee , Jean - Pierre Rafarin , wrote in yesterday 's Le Monde newspaper that Blair 's experience in Europe positioned him well for the post .
The position of President of the European Council - which meets at head - of - state and government level , usually four times a year - is due to be created by the 27 - nation grouping in the second half of 2008 , when France will chair EU ministerial meetings .
At the end of this month , Blair will continue his campaign to win the leadership of Europe when he addresses a conference at the Sorbonne of Les Progressistes , a breakaway socialist party group which has joined Sarkozy 's government .
Blair is also due to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , this month .
After Blair 's speech , Sarkozy took the former Prime Minister for lunch at the Hotel Bristol near the Elysee Palace .
Despite support from Sarkozy - who is the architect of the mini-treaty for a European constitution - Blair is an outsider for the EU job .
His support for the war in Iraq and Britain 's reluctance to join the euro and other core projects is likely to count against him when EU leaders vote for their president later this year .

The Carlyle Group , one of the world 's largest private equity funds , may soon acquire the $ 2 billion government contracting business of consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton , one of the biggest suppliers of technology and personnel to the U.S. government 's spy agencies .
Carlyle manages more than $ 75 billion in assets and has bought and sold a long string of military contractors since the early 1990s .
But in recent years it has significantly reduced its investments in that industry .
If it goes ahead with the widely reported plan to buy Booz Allen , it will re-emerge as the owner of one of America 's largest private intelligence armies .
Reports of a potential Carlyle acquisition of Booz Allen 's government unit began circulating among U.S. military contractors in December 2007 , after Booz Allen 's senior partners and board members - a group of 300 vice presidents who own the privately - held firm - gathered at company headquarters in McLean , Virginia , for an extraordinary two - day meeting .
According to a December 15 letter to Booz Allen employees from CEO Ralph W. Shrader that was released by the firm , the vice presidents signed off on a " new strategic direction " that would involve separating the company 's commercial and government units and operating them as separate companies .
That was widely seen , both inside and outside the company , as a sign that a sale of one or both of the units was imminent .
Shrader said the company hoped to come to a resolution of the issues involved by March 31 , 2008 .
In January 2008 , major newspapers - each quoting unnamed people close to the situation - reported that discussions between Booz Allen and Carlyle about the sale of the government unit were underway .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the deal will be " centered on Booz Allen 's influence in defense and intelligence contracting .
If an agreement is reached the sale price will likely be around $ 2 billion . "
Christopher Ullman , Carlyle 's chief spokesman , could neither confirm nor deny that a deal was in the works , and declined to comment to CorpWatch about the reports .
Because of Carlyle 's long experience in the defense sector , he added , such companies " would be a priority for us when the price is right and it's the right fit for us . "
George Farrar , a Booz Allen spokesman , said his company " has refused to discuss particulars of any ongoing discussions " and would not comment beyond what Shrader wrote in his December 15 missive to Booz Allen 's workforce .
Who Is Booz Allen Hamilton ?
In 2006 , Booz Allen Hamilton , a privately held company based in McLean , Virginia , had a global staff of 18,000 and annual revenues of $ 3.7 billion .
Its work for U.S. government agencies accounts for more than 50 percent of its business .
Notably Booz Allen is a key adviser and prime contractor to all of the major U.S. intelligence agencies - the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) , the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , and - as well as the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , the National Counterterrorism Center , the Department of Defense and most of the Pentagon 's combatant commands .
Shadow Intelligence Agency
Booz Allen prides itself on the long - term personal relationships it has forged between its personnel and their government clients .
" We stay for a lifetime , " Mark J. Gerencser , the senior vice president in charge of Booz Allen 's government contracting division , remarked in 2006 .
A quick study of their biographies posted on Booz Allen 's Website suggests that this is indeed true - the senior management have shuttled back and forth between the company and the government for their entire lives .
As the director of Booz Allen 's U.S. government business , for example , Gerencser serves in " several broad - based roles , " including " representing industry " to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff , which manage the Pentagon 's vast intelligence operations .
He is also a member of Booz Allen 's leadership team that sets the strategic direction of the company , and has run many of the war games staged by Booz Allen for its government clients .
Just below him in the company 's intelligence hierarchy is Ken Wiegand , another senior vice president .
Weigand came to Booz Allen in 1983 after working for a decade in Air Force intelligence , and now leads the firm 's work for national intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Department of Homeland Security .
His specialty , the Website says , includes imagery intelligence operations , which are managed by the NGA , one of Booz Allen 's most important clients .
Senior vice president Joseph W. Mahaffee , a veteran of naval intelligence , is the leader of Booz Allen 's Maryland procurement office business , which puts him in charge of the company 's contracts with the NSA in Fort Meade .
He focuses on " meeting the Information Assurance mission objectives " of the NSA with various technology services , including systems engineering , software development and " advanced telecommunications analysis . "
Another key Booz Allen figure at the NSA is Marty Hill , who came to the company after a 35 - year career in signals intelligence and electronic warfare and previously served as an expert on " information operations capabilities and policy " for Donald Rumsfeld 's Pentagon .
He leads of team of 1,200 professionals engaged in all aspects of " signals intelligence " including technical analysis , systems development and operations .
Vice President Pamela Lentz is a former cryptology officer with the Navy and once worked as a program manager for TRW , one of the nation 's oldest intelligence contractors ( it is now owned by Northrop Grumman ) .
She is Booz Allen 's " client service officer " for the DIA and other military intelligence markets , which includes intelligence units within the Navy , Air Force , Army , the unified combatant commands and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence .
Among other tasks , Lentz manages a 120 - person Booz Allen team that supports the NRO , the Pentagon agency that manages the nation 's military spy satellites .
She also runs a task force that supports human intelligence collection efforts at the DIA .
Vice President Laurene Gallo , a former intelligence analyst at the NSA , leads a Booz Allen " intelligence research and analysis " team that support several agencies , including the CIA , the DNI and the National Counterterrrorism Center .
Vice President Richard Wilhelm , whose job at Booz Allen is to work with the CIA and the ODNI , came to the company after a long career in U.S. intelligence that included stints directing the Joint Intelligence Center for Iraq during Operation Desert Storm and the NSA 's first director of information warfare .
Vice President William Wansley , a former Army intelligence officer , leads a team of experts in " strategic and business planning " who support the CIA 's National Clandestine Service , the part of the CIA that conducts covert operations and recruits foreign spies , as well as the DNI .
Another vice president Robert W. Noonan , a retired Army lieutenant general who once served as the Army 's deputy chief of staff for intelligence and the commanding general of the U.S. Army 's Intelligence and Security Command , is in charge of expanding Booz Allen 's military intelligence business within all the armed services , the combatant commands , the DIA and the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
It is each of these vice presidents who are poised to personally profit from a corporate takeover by the Carlyle Group .
On its website , Booz Allen describes its intelligence work as part of
its broader expertise in information technology .
" Whether dealing with
homeland security , peacekeeping operations , or the battlefield , success
depend on the ability to collect , safeguard , store , distribute , fuse ,
and share information - on getting the right information to the right
place at the right time , " it says .
" Our security professionals work in
partnership with clients to develop capabilities ... for protecting
information and networks against cyber and physical threats . "
That has not always been the case : Booz Allen Hamilton was founded as a management consultancy in 1914 in Chicago by three businessmen whose surnames gave the firm its name .
In 1940 , after more than three decades of giving advice to top ranking companies in America 's manufacturing and service economy , such as Montgomery Ward , Goodyear Tire and the Illinois State Railroad , Booz Allen started working for the U.S. military , where its clients included the Army , the Navy , and , after the war , the Air Force and the Pentagon .
Its initial contracts with the Navy in 1940 set the pace for its military work : as a management consultant , Booz Allen helped the Navy restructure for World War II and permeated its ranks with contractors ( " Each Navy bureau had a Booz rep , " Investors Daily reported in a 2005 profile of the firm ) .
That relationship served as a template for Booz Allen 's later work in intelligence and national security where its personnel worked inside government agencies alongside public employees .
Since the late - 1990s , Booz Allen has forged a particularly close relationship with the NSA , the spy agency that monitors global telephone , e-mail and Internet traffic for the U.S. military and political leaders , which hired Booz Allen as its chief outside consultant on Project Groundbreaker .
This $ 4 billion project outsourced the NSA 's internal communications and networking systems to a consortium led by Computer Sciences Corporation ( CSC ) and the IT subsidiary of Northrop Grumman .
Today , among the many services Booz Allen provides to intelligence agencies , according to its Website , are war - gaming - simulated drills in which military and intelligence officials test their response to potential threats like terrorist attacks - as well as data - mining and analysis of imagery and intelligence picked up by U.S. spy satellites , the design of cryptographic , or code - breaking , systems ( an NSA specialty ) and " outsourcing / privatization strategy and planning . "
The company 's 2007 annual report spells out several other areas of expertise , including " all source analysis , " an intelligence specialty managed by the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) that draws on public sources of information , such as foreign newspapers and textbooks , to add texture to data gathered by spies and electronic surveillance .
According to the company 's annual report , Booz Allen is also working on one of the most important spy initiatives launched in recent years : the Cryptographic Modernization Program .
Air Force General John C. Koziol , the commander of the Air Force Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency , described this program as an attempt to combine a variety of intelligence technologies to pick up tell - tale signs of chemicals and other substances - into a single electronic package that can be used by combat and special operations commanders to track the enemy .
Booz Allen is a full partner in the project , according to General Koziol , an idea that has been " fully endorsed " by the Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell , the nation 's spy chief - himself a Booz Allen alumnus ( see box ) .
Revolving Door
To carry out its tasks at the intelligence agencies , Booz Allen has hired a dazzling array of former national security officials and foot - soldiers .
In 2002 , Information Week reported that Booz Allen had more than 1,000 former intelligence officers on its payroll .
In 2007 , as this reporter was researching a chapter about Booz Allen for his forthcoming book , he asked the company if it could confirm that number or provide a more accurate one , and received an e-mail reply from spokesman George Farrar :
" It is certainly possible , but as a privately held corporation we consider that information to be proprietary and do not disclose . "
Buried deep on the company 's Web site , however , a much larger number is
confirmed in an explanation of a Booz Allen information technology
contract with the DIA , which carries out intelligence for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
It stated
that the Booz Allen team " employs more than 10,000 TS / SCI cleared
personnel . "
TS / SCI stands for top secret - sensitive compartmented
intelligence , one of the highest possible security ratings , which would
make Booz Allen one of the largest employers of cleared personnel in
the United States .
Many of these former intelligence officers at Booz Allen , do the same
jobs as they did for the government .
For example , Keith Hall , a Booz
Allen vice president initially worked in Army intelligence and on one
of the congressional intelligence committees .
In the early 1990s , he
was hired by the CIA to manage budgets and policy development for
then - Director of Central Intelligence Robert Gates .
During that time ,
he played an instrumental role in creating the National Imagery and
Mapping Agency , which was later renamed the National
Geospatial - Intelligence Agency .
During the Clinton administration , Hall
was named Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for space programs and ,
simultaneously , director of the NRO , the agency that manages the
nation 's military satellite program .
Now , as a Booz Allen executive , Hall leads a " strategic intelligence
initiative " that integrates the company 's extensive contracting
activities for the NRO and the NGA .
Recently , one of his most important
tasks involved chairing a 2005 homeland security study group that
recommended a major expansion of information and data - sharing between
U.S. spy agencies that work outside the country and domestic law
enforcement , like the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
" The
study 's findings have become a road map for the government in making
decisions related to critical information sharing in support of
homeland security , " Booz Allen boasts in its 2007 annual report .

Who is the Carlyle Group ?
The
Carlyle Group is a private equity fund - a group of financial advisers
that invests large sums of money from pension funds , large
corporations , wealthy individuals and foreign banks into privately held
companies in many different industries , and then run those companies
until the market is right to sell them at a substantial profit .
During
the early years of the George W. Bush administration , it gained
attention - and some notoriety - because of the large number of former
high - ranking political figures it had attracted as advisers and
managers .
They included former President George H.W. Bush , former
Secretary of State James Baker and former British Prime Minister John
Major .
Shortly after the September 11 , 2001 ,
attacks on New York and Washington , Carlyle was in the news again when
newspapers revealed that Osama Bin Laden 's family in Saudi Arabia -
which owns one of the world 's largest construction companies - held a
stake in the fund .
The stake was quickly liquidated after the news
broke .
Until the recent slowdown in the
financial markets , the private equity industry , with over $ 160 billion
under its control , was widely seen as one of the most important drivers
of the global economy , pumping venture capital into high - tech startups
and buy - out capital into corporate reorganizations worldwide .
They are
extremely active in Britain , where more than 20 percent of the private
sector workforce is employed by companies that are , or have been , the
targets of private equity investments .
Business magazines credit them
with breaking up some of America 's worst - run conglomerates and bringing
competition to Japan 's highly regulated and incestuous banking
industry .
" Private equity funds now wield much of
the transformational power at the heart of the capitalist system , " The
Economist magazine recently observed .
In addition to Carlyle , which has
more than $ 75 billion under management , industry leaders include the
Blackstone Group ( $ 30 billion ) , Bain Capital ( $ 27 billion ) , Kohlberg ,
Kravis , Roberts & Co. ( $ 26 billion ) and Texas Pacific Group ( $ 20
billion ) .
Carlyle , the largest of the funds , is
best - known for owning large military contractors and aerospace
contractors , such as United Defense Industries , the maker of the
Bradley Fighting Vehicle and other weapons systems , which it sold to
BAE Systems in 2004 , and Vought Aircraft Industries , a major producer
of structural assemblies for commercial , military and business
aircraft , which it still holds .
Other military contractors that have
gone through Carlyle 's hands include EG&G , LTV Aerospace and
Magnavox Electronic Systems .
During the 1990s , when it made most of
these acquisitions , the fund was led by former Secretary of Defense
Frank Carlucci , who served during the Carter administration as deputy
director of the CIA .
During his tenure , Carlyle bought and sold nearly
a dozen companies active in the intelligence industry .
They include BDM
International , an influential company that , during the 1990s , provided
some of the U.S. Army 's first contract interpreters and , through a
subsidiary known as Vinnell Corporation , once trained the Saudi
National Guard .
It was eventually sold to Northrop Grumman and is now
part of that company 's huge intelligence division .
U.S. Investigative Service , which
Carlyle bought in 1996 and sold in 2007 , is the largest provider of
security investigations for employees and contractors hired by the
Pentagon , the National Security Agency and other agencies , and in
recent months has been training Iraqi police commandoes under contract
to the Pentagon .
( See CorpWatch coverage of USIS . )
Another spectacular acquisition was
QinetiQ , the privatized arm of Britain 's military research corporation .
It was acquired by Carlyle in 2003 , sold in 2007 , and recently emerged
as one of the premiere U.S. intelligence contractors - after netting a
$ 470 million profit for Carlyle .
( See our article " QinetiQ goes Kinetic " . )
Carlyle , however , has divested itself of
most of its military holdings .
" In our current U.S. portfolio , there 's
none , " Carlyle 's Ullman told CorpWatch .
Today , most of its investments
are concentrated in commercial industries , such as real estate and
banking .
During a few months ' span in 2006 , for instance , Carlyle did a
" manufacturing deal , an education deal , a consumer products deal , and
buildings deal , and a financial services deal , " according to an account
in the Washingtonian magazine .
Its holdings are extensive and
pervasive : every time you rent a car from Hertz , catch a quick
breakfast at Dunkin ' Donuts or get ice - cream at Baskin - Robbins , you 're
sending money to Carlyle .
A $ 2 billion acquisition of Booz Allen's
contracting business would therefore put Carlyle back in the big
leagues of military contractors .
Other key executives who came to Booz Allen from the spy agencies include R. James Woolsey , the former director of the CIA , who was hired in 2003 to run Booz Allen 's " global resilience " division , which advises corporations on security issues , and Joan A. Dempsey , a career U.S. intelligence official and a former top aide to former CIA Director George Tenet , who was hired in 2005 as a Booz Allen vice president with responsibility to advise the DNI and other key intelligence agencies .
( See box for list of other key corporate figures that previously worked in government intelligence agencies . )
It is these senior managers who would most likely benefit from a sale to Carlyle .
Unlike many of its competitors in the intelligence industry , Booz Allen is a privately held company whose shares are owned by its 300 vice presidents of whom " approximately 80 are in government support , " Booz Allen 's Farrar told CorpWatch .
For these vice presidents , Carlyle 's infusion of capital , and its $ 2 billion buyout of their shares , will make them very rich men and women indeed .
After all , $ 2 billion divided by 80 is $ 25 million ; even if Booz Allen 's shares were divided equally , which is unlikely , that 's an astounding windfall for any executive .
Booz Allen CEO Ralph Shrader
The man most responsible for Booz Allen 's growth as an intelligence contractor is Ralph Shrader , who has been running the company as chairman and CEO since 1998 .
Shrader , an electrical engineer by training , came to Booz Allen in 1974 after serving at senior management levels of two prominent telecommunications companies - Western Union , where he was national director of advanced systems planning , and RCA , where he served in the company 's government communications system division .
These positions prepared him well for his later work at Booz Allen as a consultant to the telecommunications industry .
According to his official biography , he " led major assignments " for the industry as a Booz Allen consultant and was deeply involved in the company 's " landmark work for AT&T " when that company was broken up by the government .
In those assignments , Shrader may have been exposed to the telecommunications industry 's close ties to U.S. intelligence .
During the years he worked for Western Union and RCA , those companies , along with ITT World Communications , were part of a secret surveillance program known as Minaret in which telecommunication companies , with the concurrence of a handful of high - ranking executives , handed over to the NSA information on all incoming and outgoing U.S. telephone calls and telegrams - an early version of the NSA 's warrantless surveillance program launched by the Bush administration after the September 11th attacks .
Minaret , and the involvement of the private companies in NSA spying , was exposed by the congressional committees investigating intelligence abuse in the mid-1970s , and was the inspiration behind the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which set the rules - including the important requirement for warrants - for domestic surveillance of telephone traffic .
None of this is alluded to in Booz Allen 's official literature , of course ; but Shrader , upon his appointment as CEO in 1998 , mentioned in a rare press interview ( with the Financial Times ) that the most relevant background for his new position of chief executive was his experience working for telecommunications clients and doing classified military work for the U.S. government - " something of a Booz specialty , " the FT pointed out .
Booz Allen adds on its website that Shrader , as CEO , has also " led important programs for the U.S. National Communications System and the Defense Information Systems Agency , " two of the most important classified intelligence networks in use by the federal government .
Under Shrader , Booz Allen also became the NSA 's most important outside consultant , culminating in its advisory role in Project Groundbreaker .
That project , which awarded its first contracts in the summer of 2001 , put Booz Allen in a prime position to capture NSA and other intelligence work in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks , when intelligence budgets , and NSA surveillance , increased substantially .
" War on Terror " Contracts
After September 11th , 2001 , by Booz Allen 's own account , the firm helped the government reshape its spying capabilities to match the new era of counterinsurgencies and terrorist threats .
" The nature of intelligence changed dramatically in the wake of 9/11 , " Christopher Ling , a Booz Allen vice president , explains in the company 's most recent annual report .
" An entire analytic production system geared to detect large - scale cold war adversarial capabilities was suddenly required to transform . "
At Booz Allen , he added , " We are finding innovative ways to integrate intelligence and operations , enabled by advanced visualization and data management capabilities , which has allowed us to pioneer tactics , techniques , and procedures . "
In addition to serving as a prime contractor on Admiral John Poindexter 's controversial Total Information Awareness project ( see box ) , Booz Allen was active on both the military and economic fronts on the " war on terror . "
For the Pentagon , it helped develop the " blue force " tracking system that allows soldiers and commanders in Iraq and other battlegrounds the ability to electronically identify friendly troops .
And in the weeks leading up to the invasion of Iraq , Booz Allen sponsored and organized several conferences aimed at helping U.S. corporations secure contracts in occupied Baghdad , with former CIA director Woolsey , one of the most ardent backers of the war , as a keynote speaker .
Michael McConnell
Booz Allen Hamilton 's most illustrious alumnus is Michael McConnell , the current Director of National Intelligence , the top spy job in the country , who epitomizes the term revolving door , spinning from government job to industry and back again .
McConnell was a senior Pentagon official during George Bush Senior 's administration and the first Gulf War , where he worked for Dick Cheney , then the Secretary of Defense , as the chief intelligence adviser to General Colin Powell , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Cheney was so impressed with McConnell 's work during the war that he appointed him to head the NSA in 1993 ( he later intervened personally to convince McConnell to take the DNI job in 2007 ) .
McConnell subsequently spent more than 10 years as a Booz Allen senior vice president in charge of the company 's extensive contracts in military intelligence and information operations for the Pentagon .
In that job , his official biography states , McConnell provided intelligence support to " the U.S. Unified Combatant Commanders , the Director of National Intelligence Agencies , and the Military Service Intelligence Directors . "
That made him a close colleague of not only Donald Rumsfeld , who ran the Pentagon from 2001 to 2007 , but of Vice President Cheney , who has served President Bush as a kind of intelligence godfather since the earliest days of the administration .
As Booz Allen 's chief intelligence liaison to the Pentagon , McConnell was at the center of action , both before and after the September 11 attacks .
During the first six years of the Bush administration , Booz Allen 's contracts with the U.S. government rose dramatically , from $ 626,000 in 2000 to $ 1.6 billion in 2006 .
McConnell and his staff at Booz Allen were deeply involved in some of the Bush administration 's most controversial counterterrorism programs .
They included the Pentagon 's infamous Total Information Awareness data - mining scheme run by former Navy Admiral John Poindexter , which was an attempt to collect information on potential terrorists in America from phone records , credit card receipts and other databases .
( Congress cancelled the program over civil liberties concerns , but much of the work was transferred to the NSA , where Booz Allen continued to receive the contracts . )
In 2002 , when the CIA launched a financial intelligence project to track terrorist financing with the secret cooperation of SWIFT , the Brussels - based international banking consortium , Booz Allen won a contract to serve as an " outside " auditor of the project .
In January 2007 , McConnell resigned from Booz Allen after he was appointed by President George W. Bush to his current job .
He now oversees all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies , and thus much of Booz Allen 's government business .
( See this reporter 's 2007 Salon article . )
Under Shrader 's leadership , Booz Allen played an instrumental role after September 11th in proselytizing for a greater corporate role in national and homeland security .
This was important , the Booz Allen CEO said at a CEO summit he organized in 2002 , because " business leaders cannot opt out of geopolitics and leave the job of security solely to government and the military . "
Deepening the corporate alliance with the Bush administration and its war on terror also had significant advantages for Booz Allen and its fellow corporations : on one hand , it drastically increased their contracts with military and intelligence agencies ; and on the other , homeland security provided a convenient excuse for reducing government oversight and regulation .
These dual interests were spelled out in unusual detail in 2004 by Richard Wilhelm , a former CIA and NSA officer who once served as national security adviser to former Vice President Al Gore and now leads Booz Allen 's business with the CIA and the Office of the DNI .
Speaking to a conference on information - sharing and counterterrorism , Wilhelm explained that the " right mix of policies " for business should include a wide range of " incentives " and " cooperative arrangements , " including " appropriate protections from Freedom of Information
Act requirements and other unintended consequences of more open information sharing . "
Government , he argued , should " help make the business case , and then sweeten it - because industry will share information when there is a business case to do so . "
In other words , corporations were happy to participate in the exchange of information about terrorism and other security threats , but only if there were enough rewards .
And for Booz Allen , those rewards have been sweet indeed , as a short list of their recent unclassified contracts attests .
They include :
â¢ A $ 6.3 million contract to provide research on 3 - D facial recognition biometric software for the Information Assurance Technical Analysis Center at Offut Air Force Base in Nebraska , awarded in 2008 .
â¢ A $ 48 million contract with the U.S. Air Force to conduct research on " survivability and lethality implications " of an Air Force vehicle program , awarded in 2008 .
â ¢
In a partnership with CACI International , EDS , Lockheed Martin , SAIC and SRA , the right to bid on $ 12.2 billion worth of contracts for telecom and IT services for the Defense Information Systems Agency ( DISA ) , awarded in 2007 .
â¢ Participation in a consortium of seven companies that will bid on up to $ 20 billion worth of work in Command , Control , Communications , Computers , Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance - a mouthful of a term usually referred to as C4ISR - for the Army 's Communications Electronics Command , which is based in Fort Monmouth , New Jersey , awarded in 2006 .
â ¢ A five - year , $ 25o million contract to provide " systems engineering technical assistance " to the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security , signed in 2005 .
Little Congressional Scrutiny ?
In spite of its tremendous power as a contractor , Booz Allen has received very little criticism or even scrutiny from the U.S. Congress .
In January 2007 , the Senate had a rare opportunity to inquire about the company when it held hearings on Michael McConnell 's nomination as Director of National Intelligence ( see box ) .
Prior to the hearing , several senators said they would question McConnell about Booz Allen 's role as a contractor ; but the hearing was a desultory affair , and few questions were asked of the new DNI about the high level of contracting among the spy agencies or the specific role of Booz Allen .
A month later , a Booz Allen contract with the Department of Homeland Security came under close scrutiny in the House .
In February 2007 , Henry Waxman , a Democratic Congressman from California , the chairman of the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform , charged that Booz Allen had a significant conflict of interest over its contract to oversee an $ 8 billion contract with the DHS Secure Border Initiative known as SBI - Net .
Under the contract , Boeing and other companies will build a " virtual fence " of cameras , radar and sensors that will transmit imagery and data to border patrol agents working along the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico .
( See CorpWatch 's " Fencing the Border " . )
The conflict arose , said Waxman , because Booz Allen had long - standing business partnerships with Boeing , the prime contractor for SBI - Net , and could therefore not provide objective oversight of the program .
At the hearing , Waxman pointed out to DHS officials that they had hired 98 people to oversee the SBI - Net contract .
" But the problem is that 65 of these people do n't work for the government .
They work for the contractor , " he said .
" You 're relying on them to do the function that a government ordinarily would do . "
DHS officials responded that Booz Allen had been hired for advice , not for oversight .
Waxman 's criticism could be made of a myriad of contracts Booz Allen holds with intelligence agencies .
At the NSA , for example , it has advised the agency about several contracts that involve companies that Booz Allen has close business ties with .
That is also true at the NRO , the NGA and the CIA .
So far , however , no reports of conflicts of interest have emerged from Congress , which in any case exercises little oversight over intelligence contracts .
In another damaging report issued in 2007 , the General Accounting
Office , the audit arm of the U.S. Congress , found that the Department
of Homeland Security was spending nearly $ 16 billion a year on goods
and services from the private sector , making it the third - largest
employer of contractors in the federal government .
Among the
beneficiaries of DHS ' spending was Booz Allen Hamilton , which in 2006
was awarded a $ 43 million no -bid contract to provide services to the
DHS intelligence unit .
Upon reading the $ 16 billion DHS figures in the
GAO report , Joseph Lieberman , an independent U.S. senator from
Connecticut , angrily commented : " plainly put , we need to know who is in
charge at DHS - its managers and workers , or the contractors . "
The Washington Post later found that Booz Allen's
no - bid intelligence contract with DHS had ballooned in value from $ 2
million in 2003 to over $ 30 million in 2006 - 15 times its original
value .
When DHS lawyers first examined the Booz Allen deal , the Post
said , they found it was " grossly beyond the scope " of the original
contract and had violated government procurement rules .
An open
competition was ordered by DHS lawyers , but delayed for a year .
During
that time , the Post said , " the payments to Booz Allen more than doubled
again under a second no - bid arrangement , to $ 73 million . "
Union Protests
So far , the only public criticism of
the potential Carlyle - Booz Allen deal has come from the Service
Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , one of the country 's largest
labor unions .
Last year , the union launched a blistering attack on
Carlyle and the private equity industry in a widely distributed report
called " Behind the Buyouts : Inside the World of Private Equity . "
The
gist of the report was that Carlyle , Kohlberg , Kravis , Roberts ( KKR )
and other large private equity funds were undermining the U.S. economy
by avoiding taxes and creating " harsh consequences , " such as layoffs ,
for workers and communities .
In late 2007 , when Carlyle acquired the
assets of Manor Care , a chain of nursing homes where the SEIU is trying
to organize workers , the union stepped up its campaign .
Of Unions , Pension Funds and the Carlyle Group
The SEIU 's campaign material on the Carlyle Group , including a 40 - page white paper on private equity issued last year , fails to mention a salient fact : that many SEIU members are affiliated with a pension fund that holds a significant stake in the Carlyle Group .
That fund is the California Public Employees Retirement System , the world 's largest public pension fund , often known as CalPERS .
It has held a five percent stake in Carlyle 's core management group since 2000 , and therefore profits every time Carlyle makes money from one of its investments .
Many of the California state officials who sit on CalPERS boards are also members of the SEIU , although they officially only represent their employer , not the union .
In 2001 , this reporter attended a meeting of the CalPERS investment board where Carlyle 's three founding managers appeared as witnesses .
The public meeting took place at a time when Carlyle was a hot media topic because of its close ties to the Bush administration and its prominence as the nation 's 11th largest military contractor .
Several SEIU officials attended the meeting , and the questioning of Carlyle was led by a CalPERS official who belonged to the SEIU .
However , the investment board did n't ask about Carlyle 's military industry investments , and instead posed a single , softball question about Carlyle 's views on the U.S. investment climate .
Asked why the SEIU has n't mentioned CalPERS ' stake in Carlyle in any of its literature , Stephen Lerner , the director of SEIU 's Private Equity Project , replied that the union did n't start investigating the pension fund 's role in Carlyle until 2007 .
Until then , " we never really thought about CalPERS ' investment in Carlyle , " he said .
" Now that we 're digging in deeper , we 're raising lots of questions . "
Under SEIU 's initiative , a California lawmaker has introduced legislation that would prohibit CalPERS from investing in private equity funds owned in part by overseas funds from countries that do n't " generally respect human rights . "
According to an SEIU handout , the legislation " is only applicable to private equity firms in which sovereign wealth funds have an ownership stake , " such as Carlyle .
Carlyle 's Ullman responded that the legislation could hurt the people it is supposed to protect .
California lawmakers " should consider the detrimental impact on California pensioners who have benefited greatly from CalPERS ' investment in , and ownership of , the Carlyle Group , " he told CorpWatch .
In January 2008 , after rumors of a Carlyle takeover of Booz Allen surfaced in the press , SEIU issued a blistering press release denouncing the potential deal .
The union 's criticism of the proposed acquisition did n't focus on Booz Allen 's role in intelligence outsourcing but on Carlyle 's ties with the Mubadala Development fund of the Government of Abu Dhabi .
In 2007 , that fund paid $ 1.35 billion to buy a 7.5 percent ownership stake in Carlyle 's general partnership .
As a result of that investment , the SEIU charged , Carlyle was risking national security .
" The potential for a Carlyle Group - Booz Allen buyout demands urgency on the part of lawmakers and regulators to examine the risks faced by the U.S. when foreign governments potentially have access to classified and other sensitive national security information through their stake in U.S. companies , " the union declared in a press release .
In an interview with CorpWatch , Stephen Lerner , the director of SEIU 's Private Equity Project , said the union launched this nationalist campaign out of concern that classified information from Booz Allen could leak into the hands of the Abu Dhabi fund , thus compromising U.S. security interests .
" When you combine buyout firms , which have much less reporting requirements because they are private , with opaque sovereign wealth funds , you get a toxic stew of secrecy , " he said .
Asked how or why Booz Allen executives might leak classified information to a foreign government , he replied : " The point is , you have no way of knowing if they would or would n't . "
He added that , while the SEIU has not taken a position on Booz Allen 's extensive role in intelligence outsourcing , the issue of " government jobs being done by private contractors " might emerge in the future for the union .
( The SEIU does not mention in its material that the California Public Employees Retirement System , the pension fund for California state retirees where the SEIU has significant influence , owns five percent of the Carlyle Group - see box . )
Carlyle 's Ullman , who recently discussed the union campaign with SEIU president Andrew Stern during a conference on private equity , rejected the SEIU 's claims .
The charges that the Abu Dhabi investment could jeopardize national security " is really an obscene allegation , " he said .
Ullman added that the Abu Dhabi fund was a " passive investor " in Carlyle and would have no role in the management of Carlyle companies .
" Carlyle 's portfolio companies have a pristine track record in handling sensitive government data , " he said .
" Giving top secret and classified data to foreign governments is known as treason , and is punishable by jail and worse .
That would be a fairly strong impediment " to leaks .
In any case , there is virtually no evidence to suggest that any US intelligence contractor has leaked classified information , and it 's unlikely the union 's allegations will be a factor if the Carlyle Group does decide to acquire Booz Allen Hamilton .
Tim Shorrock 's book on the outsourcing of U.S. intelligence , Spies for Hire , will be published in May by Simon & Schuster .

With that , President Bush has already eliminated one member of the axis of evil ( Iraq ) , is bending over backwards to appease another ( North Korea ) , and is dangling a carrot in front of the third to bring them to a negotiating table over their very real nuclear program ( Iran ) .
Well , move over axis of evil , there is a new axis in town , the ‘ axis of the abhorred . ’
Consisting of the two remaining axis of evil members plus , you guessed it , the United States .
Bush ’s words have now come full circle , and the price of Bush ’s indifference was the world ’s opinion of the US .
In a recent poll conducted by GlobalScan , BBC World Service surveyed 28,389 people in 27 different countries .
The poll asked the interviewees to rate other countries as either a mostly positive influence in the world , or as a mostly negative influence .
Three of the four most negatively rated countries are – in order – North Korea ( 48 % negative ) , United States ( 51 % negative ) and Iran ( 54 % negative ) .
For the curious minded , the most negatively viewed country was Israel , at 56 % .
The negative view of the United States does not originate primarily from countries that many might consider to be the enemies of the Unites States or freedom or democracy , but rather nations who are America ’s traditional allies , the likes of which are Great Britain ; its citizens viewed the US as being 57 % negative , Canada ( 56 % ) , Mexico ( 53 % ) , Australia ( 60 % ) , Germany ( 74 % ) … and many others .
Here at home , 51 % of Americans view the nation as being a primarily negative influence throughout the world .
For a country that had the overwhelming support of the world in the wake of September 11th , 2001 , what went wrong ?
For most of the world , it all began on January 29th , 2002 when Bush first delivered the “ axis of evil ” comment at the annual State of the Union address .
Bush ’s administration quickly adopted a policy that can be called “ either you ’re with us or yer against us . ”
This type of foreign policy was looked poorly upon by both US allies , and by those fearful of being named as an enemy to the United States .
As for US allies , the cost of France deciding not to support Bush ’s war in Iraq led to months of slander against a country that is responsible for America winning its independence from the British .
Even members of the US Congress got in on the pettiness by renaming ‘ french fries ’ to ‘ freedom fries . ’
Moreover , as a punishment , Bush ’s administration hired no contractors from countries that detracted from the war .
For the allies who did support the US , the cost was far greater .
After suffering terrorism on their own soil , in 2004 the Socialist Workers Party , led by Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , ousted the Conservative party in Spain which had supported Bush and sent 1300 Spanish troops into Iraq .
The situation has also gotten out of hand for America .
After more than four years of occupation in Iraq , the violence only continues to worsen as the body counts rise on both sides .
Iraq has become a recruitment tool for terrorism , as cooler heads has foreseen years earlier .
“ Look , look and see what America has done in Iraq .
Go to Iraq , it ’s your chance to kill Americans , kill the infidels ! ” young Muslim men are told before buying into the idea of traveling to Iraq to murder and torture westerners .
And not just in Iraq , US allies Australia , the United Kingdom , Spain and Turkey have also become targets .
The cost of business has also become unbearable for Bush ’s allies at home .
In a massive upset , the Democratic Party not only easily retook the House of Representative away from Republican control , but managed to squeak out a victory in the Senate , which even had to surprise now Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nevada ) .
Many of the casualties of the 2006 midterm election , such as Jim Talent ( R - Missouri ) , had done nothing more to deserve being fired other than to support the President .
With Democrats in control of both houses of the legislative branch of government , and with public opinion on their side , Bush is partially castrated when it comes to initiating any new foreign policy .
Though much of his power has been revoked by the people , President Bush remains a globally polarizing figure used as a prop to turn millions against the once revered USA .
“ Mr. President , you have not only put us in harm ’s way , but you have harmed us , ” said Senator Joe Biden ( D - Delaware ) , the Senate Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and Democratic Presidential Candidate of Bush ’s Iraq policy on the Senate floor .
Of course he is right , he has cost the lives of thousands of American troops , hundreds of American citizens , soldiers and citizens of our allies , and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians .
He has destroyed America ’s image in the world , and as a result Bush has nurtured and cultivated a mindset that the true enemies of the United States use to inflict damage upon the world .
Biden is not alone in his opposition of Bush , nearly every Democrat , and at least one third of Republicans , agrees that the President ’s administration has been wrong , is wrong , and continues to be wrong on foreign policy .
With the 2008 election fast approaching , the winner of the contest will have the formidable task at hand .
Not since Truman succeeded Roosevelt has a new President entered into office facing such a critical task that could affect Americans and the world for generations ; not winning the unwinnable war in Iraq , but picking up the pieces of America ’s image and putting it back together .
If the next guy ( or woman , as the case maybe ) cannot accomplish that mission , then the future of a US role on the world stage may be forever darker .

Since Asus announced plans to launch a version of its low - cost micro laptop with a wider screen and more built - in storage last week , many in the United States have been eagerly awaiting the news on when the Eee PC 900 series will debut in this country .
( view large image )
The wait is over ; Asus CEO Jerry Shen has told Laptop Magazine that this model will debut in the U.S. in April , and that prices will start at $ 500 .
The price is good news for those who are interested in this product .
In Europe it is going to cost 400 Euros , which is equal to over $ 600 in the U.S. , and many were concerned that the Eee PC 900 series would be too expensive .
More New Details
According to Shen , a version with an 8 GB SSD hard drive running Windows XP will be available , while a version running Xandros Linux will have either an 8 GB or 12 GB SSD drive .
This will run on a new Intel Atom processor , not one from VIA like the current mode .
An Overview of the Eee PC 900
Like the current models , the Eee PC 900 will have a clamshell design .
The most obvious change in the upcoming version will be the 8.9 - inch display , up from 7 inches .
The upcoming model will also have a higher - resolution screen : 1024 by 600 pixels .
In addition , versions of the Eee PC 900 will have up to 1 GB of RAM and storage capacity of up to 12 GB , much more than in the current versions .
To make room for the new features , the newest model will be a bit larger : from about 2 lbs. to about 2.2 lbs , and the device will be slightly thicker .
However , many things will not change in the upcoming version .
It will still have Wi -Fi ( 802.11b/g ) , three USB ports , and an SD card slot , for example .

The crime itself is horrific -- beyond comprehension in its cruelty -- so there 's some hesitancy to complain about semantics .
But this is a technology blog and the underlying issue -- society 's tendency to blame modern - day bad deeds on technology instead of the bad - deed doers -- is an important one .
From this morning 's New York Times :
The phone call begins with the cries of an anguished child calling for a parent : " Mama ! Papa ! "
The youngster 's sobs are quickly replaced by a husky male voice that means business .
" We 've got your child , " he says in rapid - fire Spanish , usually adding an expletive for effect and then rattling off a list of demands that might include cash or jewels dropped off at a certain street corner or a sizable deposit made to a local bank .
This is " virtual kidnapping , " the name being given to Mexico 's latest crime craze , one that has capitalized on the raw nerves of a country that has been terrorized by the real thing for years .
The word virtual , of course , has come to take on several meanings in the technology world , but perhaps the one most commonly understood by your average newspaper reader is " on the Internet . "
Second Life is a virtual world ( maybe there are virtual kidnappings there ) .
Those you know only on MySpace are your virtual friends .
The ongoing Interop conference in Las Vegas this week is being dominated by talk of virtualization .
None of which has anything whatsoever to do with what 's been happening to those terrified parents in Mexico .
So back to the question in the headline :
Why is this called " virtual kidnapping . "
I 'll tell you why : Someone somewhere along the line -- probably a fellow journalist -- decided that " fake kidnapping " or " phone kidnapping , " both of which are not only more precise but better convey what actually happens , suffer from not being very " sexy " ... especially when compared to something as hip , here and now as " virtual kidnapping . "
You 'll notice that The Times could n't resist the phrase in its headline : ' Virtual Kidnappings ' Exploit Very Real Fears .
And while we 're parsing , the use of " virtual " that way is simply wrong .
The non-kidnappings did n't " virtually " happen -- as in " virtually everyone likes ice cream , " or " the planes virtually collided " -- they did n't come close to happening in any way , shape or form .
How many readers to you suppose presumed they were about to read a story involving kidnapping and the Internet ? ...
Just about all of them , I 'd say .
Labels matter .
Rest Well Albert Hoffman
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ obituaries/1912485/Albert-Hofmann ,-LSD-inventor ,-dies.html
Quote :
The day , April 19 1943 , became known among aficionados as “ Bicycle Day ” as it was while cycling home from his laboratory that he experienced the most intense symptoms .
Hofmann was working as a research chemist in the laboratory of the Sandoz Company ( now Novartis ) in Basel , Switzerland , where he was involved in studying the medicinal properties of plants .
This eventually led to the study of the alkaloid compounds of ergot , a fungus which forms on rye .
In the Middle Ages , ergot was implicated in period outbreaks of mass poisonings , producing symptoms in two characteristic forms , one gangrenous ( ergotismus gangraenosus ) and the other convulsive ( ergotismus convulsivus ) .
Popular names such as “ mal des ardents , ” “ ignis sacer , ” “ heiliges Feuer , ” or “ St Anthony ’s fire ” — refer to the gangrenous form of the disease .
Hofmann ’s studies led to many new discoveries such as Hydergine , a medicament for improvement of circulation and cerebral function and Dihydergot , a circulation and blood pressure stabilising medicine .
His interest in synthesising LSD was stimulated at first by the hope that it might also be useful as a circulatory and respiratory stimulant .
But when his molecule , known as LSD - 25 , was tested on animals , no interesting effects were observed , though the research notes recorded that the beasts became “ restless ” during narcosis .
The substance was dismissed as of no interest and dropped from Sandoz ’s research programme .
But five years later , acting on some intuition , Hofmann decided to resynthesise LSD .
In his autobiography , LSD , My Problem Child ( 1979 ) , he recalled that in the final stage of the synthesis , he was interrupted by some unusual sensations .
In a note to the laboratory ’s director , he reported “ a remarkable restlessness , combined with a slight dizziness .
At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated - like condition , characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination .
" In a dreamlike state , with eyes closed , I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures , extraordinary shapes with intense , kaleidoscopic play of colours .
After some two hours this condition faded away . ”
Hofmann concluded that he must have accidentally breathed in or ingested some laboratory material and assumed LSD was the cause .
To test the theory he waited until the next working day , Monday April 19 1943 , and tried again , swallowing 0.25 of a milligram .
Forty minutes later , his laboratory journal recorded “ dizziness , feeling of anxiety , visual distortions , symptoms of paralysis , desire to laugh ” .
Unable to write any more , he asked his assistant to take him home by bicycle .
“ On the way home , my condition began to assume threatening forms .
" Everything in my field of vision wavered and was distorted as if seen in a curved mirror .
I also had the sensation of being unable to move from the spot .
Nevertheless , my assistant later told me that we had travelled very rapidly . ”
Back home , when a friendly neighbour brought round some milk , he perceived her as a “ malevolent , insidious witch ” wearing “ a lurid mask ” .
After six hours of highs and lows , the effects subsided .
Sandoz , keen to make a profit from Hofman ’s discovery , gave the new substance the trade name Delysid and began sending samples out to psychiatric researchers .
By 1965 more than 2,000 papers had been published offering hope for a range of conditions from drug and alcohol addiction to mental illnesses of various sorts .
But the fact that it was cheap and easy to make left it open to abuse and from the late 1950s onwards , promoted by Dr Timothy Leary and others , LSD became the recreational drug of choice for alienated western youth .
An outbreak of moral panic , combined with a number of accidents involving people jumping to their deaths off high buildings thinking they could fly , led governments around the world to ban LSD .
Research also showed that the drug taken in high doses and in inappropriate settings , often caused panic reactions .
For certain individuals , a bad trip seemed to be the trigger for full - blown psychosis .
Hofmann was disappointed when his discovery was removed from commercial distribution .
He remained convinced that the drug had the potential to counter the psychological problems induced by “ materialism , alienation from nature through industrialisation and increasing urbanisation , lack of satisfaction in professional employment in a mechanised , lifeless working world , ennui and purposelessness in wealthy , saturated society , and lack of a religious , nurturing , and meaningful philosophical foundation of life ” .
Albert Hofmann was born at Baden , Switzerland , on January 11 1906 , the elder of two children .
Having graduated from Zürich University with a degree in chemistry in 1929 he took a doctorate on the gastro - intestinal juice of the vineyard snail .
After leaving university , he went to work for Sandoz Pharmaceuticals where he researched the medicinal properties of the Mediterranean squill ( Scilla maritima ) , before moving on to the study of Claviceps purpurea ( ergot ) .
As a result of the use of LSD as a recreational drug Sandoz found itself bombarded with demands for information from regulatory bodies along with demands for statements after accidents , poisonings , criminal acts and so forth from the press .
For scientists unaccustomed to the glare of publicity , it became a headache .
“ I would rather you had n’t discovered LSD , ” Hofmann ’s managing director told him .
In the end the decision was taken to stop all further production .
Hofmann laid some of the blame at the door of Dr Timothy Leary .
In his autobiography , he described meeting Leary in 1971 in the railway station snack bar in Lausanne .
Hofmann began by voicing his regret that Leary ’s experiments had effectively killed off academic research into LSD and took Leary to task for encouraging its recreational use among young people .
Leary was unabashed .
“ He maintained that I was unjustified in reproaching him for the seduction of immature persons to drug consumption , ” Hofmann recalled , on the ground that American teenagers “ with regard to information and life experience , were comparable to adult Europeans ” and able to make up their own minds .
Hofmann continued to work at Sandoz until 1971 when he retired as Director of Research for the Department of Natural Products .
In addition to his discovery of LSD , he was also the first to synthesize psilocybin ( the active constituent of “ magic mushrooms ” ) in 1958 .
He also discovered the hallucinogenic principles of Ololiuqui ( Morning Glory ) , lysergic acid amide and lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide .
In retirement , Hofmann served as a member of the Nobel Prize Committee .
He was a Fellow of the World Academy of Sciences , and a Member of the International Society of Plant Research and of the American Society of Pharmacognosy .
In 1988 the Albert Hofmann Foundation was established “ to assemble and maintain an international library and archive devoted to the study of human consciousness and related fields . ”
He disapproved of the appropriation of LSD by the youth movements of the 1960s , but regretted that its potential uses had not been explored .
He had been due to speak at the World Psychedelic Forum in March , but ill health prevented him from attending .
Albert Hofmann was married and had three children .
I alerted everybody in irc earlier , seems ados made a thread in the pub , this one is his obituary and as such belongs in the news forum .

You were truly a genius .
You will never , ever , EVER be forgotten by the human race , and I will be remembering you in a very special way on Saturday night .
My next trip 's for you , Doc .

" Albert Hofmann , the father of LSD , passed away at 9 AM CEST on Tuesday April 29 , 2008 at his home in Basel , Switzerland .
Cause of death was a heart attack ; two caretakers were there with him at the time .
MAPS President Rick Doblin said , " [ Albert and I ] spoke on the phone the day after the Basel conference and he was happy and fulfilled .
He 'd seen the renewal of LSD psychotherapy research with his own eyes , as had [ his wife ] Anita .
I said that I looked forward to discussing the results of the study with him in about a year and a half and he laughed and said he'd try to help the research however he could , either from this side or " the other side " . "

Wichita , Kansas , even in the depths of an ice storm , has been a reasonably pleasant place to hang out .
The folks at the airport Hilton are much friendlier than any of my friends in Boston .
The price of a room ( $ 94 / night ) is probably less than what I spend keeping my apartment heated , cooled , Internetted , lighted , insured , taxed , and maintained .
The restaurants have been good .
There are no traffic jams .
We went to the local health club , Genesis , with a fantastic array of machines , an indoor running track , a spacious free weight area , racquetball courts , a 25 yard pool , a huge hot tub , a sauna , a steam room , a pool for water aerobics , and a Swim - Ex treadmill pool .
Unlike the $ 50 million , $ 900 / year MIT gym , the Genesis club provides soap in the showers .
In fact , the club provides shampoo , shaving cream , deodorant , and a bunch of other items from dispensers .
The cost to enjoy this luxurious retreat ?
$ 40 per month .
All is not rosy in Wichita , however .
One guy in the Cessna sales department told us that the nicest part of the city was just north of downtown .
“ I ’d like to live there , but no way would I be willing to pay the outrageous price of a house there . ”
What does it cost to buy into Wichita ’s most happening neighborhood ?
“ You could be looking at as much as $ 160,000 for a house there . ”
The company is hoping that production will begin by June 2009 in a new € 12.4 million factory in Heinsberg , Germany , which aims to produce 10,000 2 kW units per year .
The cells are expected to emit 60 % less carbon dioxide than traditional combustion generators .
The company is also partnering with Britain 's Powergen , Germany 's EWE and Gaz de France .
An Australian company working in this area called Ceramic Fuel Cells was in the news recently after landing a $ 240 million deal with Dutch energy company Nuon to supply 50,000 CHP units by 2014 .
The company still needs to meet a number of commercial requirements set by Nuon - in particular improving the durability of the cells from two years to four .
The Engineer - Poet recently had a post on The Cogeneration Stopgap at the Oil Drum , which looked at how the combination of cogeneration ( generating combined heat and power - CHP - using natural gas ) and heat pumps could be used to heat North American homes much more efficiently and extend the life of North America 's dwindling natural gas reserves for a period of time while houses are retrofitted to make them more energy efficient and natural gas use is replaced with electricity .
The only example of cogeneration technology touched on in the article was from Climate Energy , whose CHP unit is made by Honda .
Ceramic 's fuel cells have been under development for several years , listing on the ASX in 2004 and the AIM shortly after .
The company specialises in solid oxide fuel cells , which convert natural gas ( and presumably biogas ) into power and heat without burning the fuel .
The cells convert about 50 per cent of the energy in the fuel to electricity - traditional gas - fired power stations manage around 30 per cent - with another 35 per cent of the potential energy captured as heat from the catalytic process .
The company does n't have any plans to market units in Australia in the foreseeable future , preferring to concentrate on the European market due to higher energy prices , specific CHP rebates in Germany , feed - in tariffs and possible carbon credits for trading on the EU emissions trading scheme ( set up under the Kyoto protocol ) .
CHP in Britain
Reuters reported that boilers containing Ceramic 's units could be sold in Britain in 2010 if utility company Powergen orders units this year .
The article estimates that fuel cell units for home units will be priced between 1,500 and 2,000 pounds and that larger units priced at over 3,000 pounds will be operated by utility companies .
The same report goes on to speculate that because utilities will save so much money by producing electricity using CHP ( which they believe is twice as efficient as centralised generation and sending power through the grid ) , that they expect utilities will eventually start giving next - generation boilers to customers for free , with the units having a 4 - 5 year payback period .
Powergen has also previously looked at a different micro-CHP approach using Stirling Engines attached to water boilers .
I can't tell what happened to this plan , though the company is assume was the prospective supplier - Disenco - is still marketing a CHP product ( although full production is n't due to begin until this year , which may explain the absence of progress ) .
Another British CHP company called Ceres Power received an order for 37,500 units from British Gas owner Centrica in January , for delivery from 2011 .
These units are smaller but cheaper than Ceramic 's units .
Carbon Commentary have looked at this unit and claimed the main challenge facing CHP vendors in the UK is a the lack of feed - in tariffs - which would presumably affect Ceramic as much as Ceres .
Bloom Energy
Another company that has received a lot of attention in the fuel cell market is US company Bloom Energy , who are also developing solid oxide fuel cells ( though there is some legal argument underway about who actually developed the technology in this case ) .
Bloom Energy
The company is investigating using natural gas and ethanol as fuel for the cells , and most reports speculate the cells will be able to generate 100 kw of power ( the company 's web site says absolutely nothing ) .
One report from Business 2.0 claims the company is aiming to sell units for around US $ 10,000 .
Bloom is backed by a number of high profile investors , including the omnipresent Kleiner Perkins Caulfield Byers , and has raised US $ 100 million in funding .
According to Vinod Khosla , the company is currently building a " massive " facility in Mumbai , India .
One possible application for Bloom 's fuel cells is in data centres , with the cells used to eliminate the need for uninterruptible power supplies ( UPS's ) and thus ( in some cases ) the need for additional disaster recovery ( DR ) facilities .
Japan
Japan has also seen trials of hydrogen fuel cells for CHP , with the hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas .
The cells are leased for 1 million yen ( US$ 9,500 ) for a 10 - year period from Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Toyota , Honda and Toshiba are all also working on fuel cells , usually as part of efforts to develop fuel cell vehicles .
The Japanese Government is spending 2.4 billion yen ( US$ 310 million ) per year on fuel cell development and plans for 10 million homes ( 25 % of Japanese households ) to be powered by fuel cells by 2020 .
The Air Car
One last note - a commenter on the " Air Car " articles noted that MDI 's main business seems to be a variable - fuel stationary power supply , so presumably they could be a vendor in this market at some point as well .

By now , I assume , the entire blogosphere has heard about the public - relations fiasco which the producers of the creationist film Expelled have brought upon themselves .
If you have n’t , here ’s a brief rundown : last week , everyone ’s favorite fire - breathing atheist blogger and biology professor , P.Z. Myers , went to see an advance screening of the film .
It seems only fair that he ’d get to see it – he was deceived into appearing in it by the producers , who told him it was going to be called Crossroads and would be an exploration of the relationship between science and religion , not the hardcore anti-science polemic it turned out to be .
But while he was standing in line at the theater , he was met by security , who demanded he leave the premises immediately .
It turned out the film ’s producers did n’t want him to see it .
But in the grandest stroke of irony ever , Myers ’ guest – who is also interviewed in the film , and whom the producers apparently did not recognize – was allowed in to see it .
That guest ?
Richard Dawkins .
Mark Mathis , the producer of Expelled , has rapidly cycled through excuses in the past several days trying to explain this .
First it was alleged that P.Z. Myers was being disruptive ( a lie ) , then it was alleged that he was gate - crashing a private screening ( also a lie ; there was an open registration on the internet for anyone who wanted to attend ) .
Finally , he seems to have settled on the ad hoc excuse that he simply wanted Myers to pay to see it .
Apparently , Mathis is oblivious to the hypocrisy of making a film which asserts that dissenters are being unfairly shut out of scientific discourse , then banning people whom he disagrees with from seeing it and threatening them with arrest if they do n’t comply .
( A post filed on another screening of Expelled reports that Mathis is still threatening people with expulsion for asking too many non-supportive questions .
The producers have also tried to make critics sign non-disclosure agreements in an apparent bid to prevent them from writing negative reviews . )
By most accounts , Expelled is a remarkably shoddy piece of filmmaking .
Its entire premise is that evolution led directly to the Holocaust , making its case by showing footage of scientists followed by footage of Nazi death camps .
Of interest , it also drops the flimsy pretense of intelligent design being “ science ” , instead claiming repeatedly and straightforwardly that ID is religious .
The film ’s strategy of marketing directly to churches and homeschoolers ties in with that .
( I really , really hope some Christian group congratulates the film ’s narrator , Ben Stein , on how many souls his wonderful movie is bringing to Christ .
Stein is Jewish , incidentally . )
All in all , this affair has proved to be a wonderful piece of good news for friends of science .
This whole affair has made the creationists look like hypocrites , and not only that , it ’s shone a light on the shoddy and deceptive tactics of their film and the ID movement as a whole , the very outcome they were hoping to avoid .
How could this have turned out any better ?
However , at least one non-creationist thinks this is somehow a disaster for us .
Anyone care to guess who ?
As long as Dawkins and PZ continue to be the representative voices from the pro-science side in this debate , it is really bad for those of us who care about promoting public trust in science and science education .
Dawkins and PZ need to lay low as Expelled hits theaters .
Let others play the role of communicator , most importantly the National Center for Science Education , AAAS , the National Academies or scientists such as Francis Ayala or Ken Miller .
When called up by reporters or asked to comment , Dawkins and PZ should refer journalists to these organizations and individuals .
If Dawkins and PZ really care about countering the message of The Expelled camp , they need to play the role of Samantha Power , Geraldine Ferraro and so many other political operatives who through misstatements and polarizing rhetoric have ended up being liabilities to the causes and campaigns that they support .
Lay low and let others do the talking .
The above piece of condescending concern trolling is courtesy of Matt Nisbet , the “ framing ” proponent who ’s only ever offered one piece of advice : namely , telling atheists to shut up and not voice their views or criticize religion .
He ’s done this before , but this latest statement is by far the most arrogant and obnoxious one he ’s offered .
Nisbet ’s attitude seems to be that religious believers are overwhelmingly powerful , their opinions cannot be changed , and thus we must genuflect to them or else .
His above post is of a piece with a long line of writings he ’s produced urging atheists to go back into the closet and hide – a ridiculous piece of advice which , I ’m happy to say , has been treated with the contempt it deserves .
Nisbet ’s piece says bluntly , “ It ’s Time To Let Others Be the Spokespeople for Science ” , with a prominent photo of P.Z Myers and Richard Dawkins .
This claim displays a serious misunderstanding of what is going on here .
Nisbet seems to assume that this position is some kind of mantle that can be passed from person to person .
What he has n’t grasped is that , to whatever extent Myers and Dawkins are viewed as influential scientists whose opinions are worth listening to , they earned that authority by their own effort .
They are doing just what they ’ve always done – writing , speaking , publishing their opinions .
Their following was not bestowed upon them from on high ; they created it for themselves by presenting persuasive arguments that won people over .
In other words , they ’re winning the battle of ideas , and Nisbet is not .
His ridiculous call for them to shut up and hand that authority over to him is really just a plea for him to be handed the acclaim that he ’s failed to achieve by his own effort .
The similarities with creationists are instructive .
Nisbet ’s post also displays what I call “ the myth of the silenced middle ” : the notion that there ’s some reasonable , moderate center that ’s being drowned out by those on both extremes .
The truth of the matter is that no one is being prevented from speaking their minds exactly as they wish .
If Nisbet ca n’t hear this mythical centrist majority , perhaps it ’s because they ’re not speaking out – and I agree that they ’re not , which is precisely why we radical , uncompromising atheists have arisen in the first place .
We ’re tired of the fundamentalists shoving government and the media around without anyone standing up to them forcefully or effectively .
We believe people ’s minds can be changed , and we intend to do just that .
The vested interests of religion have not silenced us .
I can assure Matt Nisbet that his comparatively feeble efforts are not going to succeed either .
UPDATE : Further thoughts .
“ I told the government that the probability of this is as high as the birth of a dog with five legs , ” said Geert Ahrens , head of the organization ’s Election Observation Mission here .
There were moments of drama straight out of Gogol .
In one recount witnessed by a Western observer , some members of a counting committee , apparently in an attempt at filibustering , wandered off and were missing for hours .
The committee chairman was declared sick .
Then came a rumor he had had a heart attack .
Finally , in sheer frustration after hours of waiting , an official ripped open an envelope marked as containing ballots for Mr. Sargsyan .
The ballot on top of the pile was for his opponent , Mr. Ter -Petrossian , and other officials immediately rushed to close the envelope .
“ I can only assume it was a bad count that someone did not want reopened , ” the observer said .
Even so , when seen in the context of the broader region , Mr. Ahrens said , “ I ’ve seen worse . ”
“ We won the election , ” Mr. Ter - Petrossian said Thursday , sitting in a cafe , the Swan Lake .
He added that he had received 65 percent of the vote , a figure that Mr. Ahrens said was “ not grounded in any factual evidence . ”
Mr. Ter -Petrossian ’s aides , who refer to him as “ the president , ” seemed to have fully internalized the figure nonetheless .
The crowds have only seemed to grow since the first post- election rallies , particularly since the day last week when a government - organized rally broke ranks to join them .
Mr. Ter -Petrossian , who is fond of dramatic entrances , rushed onto the stage , as Beethoven ’s “ Ode to Joy ” blared from loudspeakers .
He spoke for hours , revving up the crowd of angry grandmothers , bored young men eating sunflower seeds and a variety of Armenian professionals .
Mr. Ter -Petrossian , who was president from 1991 to 1998 , presents himself as the one to rescue the country .
For nine days he has slept in his Lincoln Town Car , parked near the protesters ’ camp , and he calls the protests “ a clear , classic bourgeois , democratic revolution . ”
3/25/2008 - Video of beatings outside UN building Video footage of New York cops clubbing and arresting peaceful Tibetan protesters who were merely walking down the street has gone relatively ignored beyond Youtube .
While stories emerge out of China every day of police beating and killing Tibetan protestors in the streets , the same sort of behavior by cops in America tells its own story .
The footage was shot at a free Tibet peaceful assembly in New York on the 14th of March .
It shows the protestors holding flags and signs and peacefully walking down the street towards the UN building in the Turtle Bay neighborhood only to be accosted by police officers with batons .
One officer identified as " Delgado " is seen in the video pushing people as the group crosses the street .
Another officer , identified as " Serano " is caught threatening to kill two protesters as the cameraman passes .
He later admits to the threat and apologizes for it .
As the group nears the UN building , cop cars and vans screech onto the sidewalks , cops pour out and begin to beat the protesters with clubs as UN security guards observe without becoming involved .
A non uniformed officer , who seems to be directing the entire operation , then orders the cameraman to step back and move away .
" Look at these cops , clubbing people in front of the UN , unbelievable , protesting to free Tibet , cops clubbing people in their legs on the sidewalk , in front of the UN in America , unbelievable , this is not China . " the American cameraman announces in disbelief .
The officer identified as Serano then forces the cameraman away from the melee , telling him to shut the camera off and that he will not talk to him because he may be a reporter .
Several officers then follow the cameraman asking him about his recording of the incident .

A better ext4
Benefits for LWN subscribers
The primary benefit from subscribing to LWN is helping to keep us publishing , but , beyond that , subscribers get immediate access to all site content and access to a number of extra site features .
Please sign up today !
Last week 's Kernel Page may have been filesystem - heavy , but there was still a big omission , in the form of ext4 .
But ext4 , being the successor to ext3 , may well be the filesystem many of us are using a few years from now .
Things have been relatively quiet on that front - at least , outside of the relevant mailing lists - but the ext4 developers have not been idle .
Some of their work has now come to the surface with Ted Ts'o 's posting of the ext4 merge plans for 2.6.25 .
One of the changes going into ext4 is a lifting of the longstanding 4KB block size limit .
That does not mean that just any block size works , though , and this feature will benefit fewer people than one might think , for one specific reason : the block size must still be no larger than the page size on the host system .
So those of us running x86 systems with 4KB pages will be stuck with 4KB blocks still .
And , on any system , the maximum block size is now 64KB .
One amusing effect of this change is that the size of a directory entry can now be as large as 64KB as well .
But the field which holds the size of directory entries is only 16 bits wide .
So a special hack has been employed to recognize 64KB directory entries and keep everything consistent .
Some internal variables have overflow problems as well .
Block numbers are stored as a signed , 32 - bit quantity , and so are block group numbers .
That limits the maximum size of a filesystem to a mere 256PB .
In 2.6.25 , these values will become unsigned long variables , eliminating that intolerably low limit .
Through some trickery , the inode field which stores the number of blocks associated with a file will be expanded to 48 bits , raising the maximum size of an individual file to just under 248 512 - byte blocks .
The work does not stop there , though : another patch redefines that field to mean the number of filesystem blocks ( instead of 512 - byte sectors ) used by the file .
This is a change which has to be handled carefully , since it is an on - disk format change which could create trouble for people with existing ext4 filesystems .
Everybody who is using ext4 should certainly be doing so with the knowledge that it's a development filesystem and is only suitable for storing files which are not valuable for more than about 30 minutes - Rawhide OpenOffice.org updates , say .
But it still would be nice to not trash every existing ext4 filesystem out there .
So the i_blocks field will continue , by default , to hold the number of 512 - byte blocks .
But , if that field exceeds 32 bits and forces the use of 48 - bit numbers , it is thereafter interpreted as filesystem blocks .
Since no existing filesystems are yet using 48 - bit numbers , this approach successfully avoids breaking them .
Journal checksums are another feature arriving for 2.6.25 .
If the system crashes , the journal is used to recover any transactions which were committed , but which did not actually make it to disk .
It sure would be nice to know that the journal , as stored in the filesystem , is intact before using it to make changes elsewhere .
The checksum enables the filesystem to ensure that the journal is good and avoid ( further ) corrupting the filesystem if it is not .
An interesting side benefit is that the checksum loosens the constraints on how the journal is written to disk , since an incompletely - written journal will now be detected ; that should help to improve filesystem performance slightly .
Note that full data checksumming is still not on the agenda for ext4 .
But checksumming the journal is a good ( if small ) step in the right direction .
Another change is a VFS API change , in that it turns the i_version field of the inode structure into an unsigned , 64 - bit value on all architectures .
This version number is incremented when the file is changed , and it 's stored ( split into two fields ) in the on - disk inode .
64 - bit version numbers are required by NFSv4 , which uses them to provide the dreaded " stale file handle " error when things change .
There is a new ioctl ( ) ( EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ) which can be used to explicitly request that the on - disk inode for a file be converted to the ext4 format .
The ext4 filesystem is extent - based , and has been for some time .
" Extent - based " means that it tracks block allocations by extents ( first block , number of blocks ) rather than storing pointers to each individual block , as is done in ext3 .
There are a number of performance benefits to doing things this way , especially for larger files .
Those benefits disappear , though , if a file 's blocks cannot be grouped into the smallest number of extents possible .
One technique which greatly helps in optimizing block allocations for files is to allocate them in relatively large groups , rather than individually .
In 2.6.25 , ext4 will contain the multi- block allocator , which does exactly that .
One might think that allocating a few blocks at a time would not be that big of a change , but the multi- block allocator is by far the most complex patch in the set .
A lot of effort and heuristics go into deciding how many blocks to allocate , finding the optimal set of blocks , tracking the allocation , recovering blocks which end up never being used , ensuring that an application cannot read pre-allocated ( but unwritten ) blocks in search of leaked secrets , etc .
It is quite a bit of code , but it is worth the trouble ; multi- block allocation will be enabled by default in 2.6.25 .
As noted above , a number of these patches force changes to the on - disk data structure .
According to Ted , though , these should be the last on - disk changes for ext4 .
There are some features which still will not have been merged when 2.6.25 comes around - delayed allocation and online defragmentation among them - but they should not require format changes .
So ext4 is getting closer to the point where it is considered ready for production use .
It is not at that point yet , though , and people who use it are still doing so at their own risk .
To help drive that point home , Ted has proposed a new mount flag ( called test_fs ) which communicates to the kernel the user 's understanding that they are about to mount a developmental filesystem and will not go filing lawsuits if things go wrong .
In the absence of this mount option , an ext4 filesystem will refuse to mount .
One might think that child - proofing the filesystem in this way would not be necessary , but some extra care in this area can only be a good thing .
Filesystem - related surprises are rarely welcome .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked legislation to reverse a Supreme Court ruling that makes it tougher for workers to sue for pay discrimination .
Democratic presidential rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton interrupted their campaigns to return to the Senate to vote for the bill .
The measure would lift tight time restraints to file claims that could expire before workers realize they were treated unfairly .
On a 56 - 42 vote , mostly Democratic supporters of the bill fell short of the needed 60 in the 100 - member Senate to clear a Republican procedural hurdle and move toward passage of the bill approved earlier by the House of Representatives .
The Senate action likely kills the bill for the year .
Yet it is certain to be an issue in this November ’s congressional and presidential elections , particularly among female voters sensitive to pay inequity between the sexes .
The blocked Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , named for an Alabama woman who lost her case in the Supreme Court last year , is backed by women ’s and civil rights groups that argue it would give workers a fair chance for justice .
It is opposed by the White House and business groups , which warn it would trigger an explosion of lawsuits and allow suits to be filed years and even decades after alleged offenses .
On average in the United States , women are paid about 23 percent less than men , while minorities receive even less -- despite laws that mandate equal pay for equal work .
In a failed plea for the bill before the vote , Clinton , who would be the first female U.S. president , told colleagues : “ I ’m hoping you will stand up and vote to make it clear that women who get up every single day and go to work deserve to be paid equally to their male counterparts .
That ’s all Lilly Ledbetter wanted . ”
The White House said it opposed discrimination in the workplace .
But it threatened to veto the bill if Congress passed it , saying in a statement the measure would “ impede justice and undermine the important goal of having allegations of discrimination expeditiously resolved . ”
Obama , who would become the first black U.S. president , said in a statement : “ This pay gap is an ugly reflection of the discrimination that still exists in the workplace .
And as the son of a single mother and the father of two young daughters , I believe we have a responsibility to close it . ”
Backers of the bill complained that the Supreme Court , in its 5 - 4 ruling last May , reversed decades of legal precedent by declaring discrimination claims must be filed within 180 days of the first alleged offense .
The court rejected the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ’s contention that each new discriminatory paycheck triggers a new 180 - day statute of limitations .
The failed legislation would have amended the 1964 Civil Rights
Act by putting the old EEOC standard into law , and cover pay discrimination based on gender , race , national origin , religion , age and disabilities .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell denounced the bill , saying , “ The fundamental problem is that it creates massive new opportunities to sue . ”
Sen . John McCain of Arizona , the Republican presidential candidate , did not return to Washington to vote on the bill .
Instead , he continued his tour of depressed areas of the United States .
Poverty has been partly linked to the wage gap , particularly among households headed by single mothers .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) won another battle against the government Friday over the release of information about a campaign to change federal surveillance law .
A federal judge ordered the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) to provide to EFF by April 21 , 2008 , records about telecom industry lobbying of their offices .
Congress is currently considering granting immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in unlawful electronic surveillance on millions of ordinary Americans as part of changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
Officials at the DOJ and ODNI have been vocal supporters of the immunity proposal .
Using the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , EFF asked the DOJ and ODNI for any documents reflecting telecom carriers ' efforts to avoid legal responsibility for their role in the government 's surveillance operations , but the agencies failed to comply with EFF 's requests .
" We went to court over the release of these documents because they could play a critical role in the national debate over telecom immunity .
Denying Americans access to this information is not only unconscionable , but also illegal , " said EFF Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" We 're pleased the judge recognized that time is of the essence here and ordered these agencies to follow the law . "
In November , another federal judge ordered ODNI to comply with a similar EFF request .
Documents released as a result of that case detailed high - level battles over changes to FISA , featuring key members of Congress and Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell .
EFF also represents the plaintiffs in Hepting v. AT&T , a class - action lawsuit brought by AT&T customers accusing the telecommunications company of violating their rights by illegally assisting the National Security Agency in widespread domestic surveillance .
There are nearly 40 legal cases that have arisen from the warrantless surveillance currently pending in the Northern District of California courts .

The conservative movement is dead .
At least , anything resembling the traditional conservative movement .
As represented by the Bush administration , Republican congressional majority , and right - leaning punditocracy , conservatism means more federal spending , an expanded welfare state , federalization of local and state issues , warrantless surveillance , executive branch dominance , Wilsonian global intervention , and endless war .
Indeed , it is hard to find a conservative initiative today that seeks to limit government power and enhance individual liberty .
Ending earmarks and promoting school choice , perhaps .
But not much else .
For the most part conservative activists view their mission as defending the Bush administration .
The particular issues matter little .
Whatever today ’s Republican leadership desires , conservatives must provide .
However , not all conservatives espouse the new imperial conservatism , which treats the Republican president as a monarch who must be obeyed , perhaps even worshipped .
Vic Gold , a speech writer for former Senator and GOP presidential nominee Barry Goldwater , last year penned a devastating critique of the Bush administration and its conservative acolytes .
A number of traditionalists , including direct mail pioneer Richard Viguerie and the late William F. Buckley , founder of National Review magazine , also have criticized administration policies .
Mickey Edwards , former conservative Republican congressman , now adds his voice .
In Reclaiming Conservatism , he warns :
" On Capitol Hill , Congress acted as though its top priority was party unity , demonstrated in the form of an almost abject subservience to the head of a constitutionally separate branch of government .
At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , in the White House , the president , who called himself ( and was called by others ) a conservative , had become the very embodiment of everything conservatives had long feared and warned against .
Operating almost unchecked by any other branch of government , he ordered wiretaps on citizens ’ phones , held prisoners without trial or charges , and refused to provide information to Congress even when federal law required him to do so .
For nearly half a century , conservatives had worried that a leftist president , if given the opportunity , might do such things .
Now those things were being done by a man who called himself a ‘ conservative , ’ and ‘ conservatives ’ cheered him on .
Those who once had wanted only that the government leave them alone as much as possible , who once had warned of the dangers of Big Brother , had created the monster government they most feared . "
Such is " modern " and " enlightened " conservatism .
Edwards ’ analysis , is , to paraphrase a common slogan , short and sour , a scathing review of the tragic deterioration of a great ideological movement that once transformed America .
Conservatism has meant different things to different people at different times in different places .
American conservatism originally was a variant of European liberalism .
The conservative movement then was dedicated to conserving traditional liberties .
Explains Edwards : " Keeping government in check was not only the primary ingredient of the Lockean and Madisonian liberalism that lay at the heart of America ’s founding document ; it was also the key element defining what a truly American conservatism was all about . "
No longer , alas .
The current administration is the culmination of several political trends .
Edwards points to the growing importance of the South to the Republican Party ’s success , as well as the rise of the Religious Right .
Moreover , he notes , " Neoconservatism clearly illustrates how much the  American , ’ or Constitution - based , conservatism of the Goldwater era has been supplanted . "
Even before plotting multiple wars , to the neoconservatives " concentrated power seemed a necessity for ensuring that their ideas were implemented , " he explains .
Of course , the neoconservatives most needed that concentrated power to inaugurate war .
Although today ’s Right promotes promiscuous war - making , it was not always so .
Writes Edwards :
" In the minds of most conservatives , the ultimate purpose of a strong national defense had been to deter war ; now war was increasingly seen not as a last option , but as a useful tool for the nation to achieve worthy ends .
Constitutional limits on the president ’s ability to wage war were considered almost quaint . "
It is easy to quibble with one or another of his points , and his analysis is sure to spark some criticism even by conservatives who agree with most of his arguments .
But there is no doubting Edwards ’ overall analysis .
He writes : " By the time George W. Bush assumed the presidency , what had once been the focus of American conservatism  personal liberty and restrained government  had almost ceased to exist as a motivating force for the movement .
Conservatives had finally attained power , but they had ceased to be conservatives , at least in the uniquely American sense of the word . "
Many conservatives were cowed by Republican politicians who demanded absolute loyalty to the new regime , acting as a Greek Chorus for every expansion of government authority .
Edwards , however , cheerfully points out that America ’s new monarchical president has no conservative clothes .
Edwards reserves perhaps his sharpest attack on the " new social vision couched in the rhetoric of traditional ’ ( that is , religious ) mores . "
But that is not the only sacred cow of modern conservatism which he shoots .
Edwards criticizes conservative support for constitutional amendments to ban flag burning and abortion , as well as federal legislation to define marriage , strip courts of jurisdiction , and prohibit gays in the military .
He argues against the constitutionality of the line item veto .
His critique of individual issues is less important than the lesson he draws from the larger political fight .
Explains Edwards :
" What once formed the core of conservative thought has been lost in the pursuit of other priorities , such as reduced spending and partisan advantage .
It is difficult to know whether today ’s conservatives have consciously chosen to disregard the Constitution or whether questions of constitutionality simply do n’t intrude on their thinking , but this avid pursuit of unconstitutional goals is of a piece with the willing surrender of Congress ’s obligation to act as a check on presidential ambition .
A Republican Congress , under conservative direction , virtually ceased any meaningful oversight over the executive branch even in the midst of a controversial and costly war . "
But that ’s not all , he contends .
The Republican congressional party emphasized acquiescence over debate when it came to administration proposals .
Moreover , he writes , " The demise of deliberation has been buttressed by impatience with the constraints of the Constitution . "
This tendency always has existed within the political system .
But Edwards is horrified that conservatives " had ceased to become the crossing guards cautioning citizens to look both ways ; they had joined in the fun of visualizing a world that looked good to them and setting about to impose it on the nation . "
And , in fact , on the entire world .
The result is what Edwards terms " the American monarchy . "
Executive aggrandizement did not begin with George W. Bush , of course .
But " defiance of Congress has been a hallmark of the Bush administration , " he writes .
Conservatives and Republicans attacked President Franklin Roosevelt for exceeding proper executive authority .
Today they applaud President Bush for doing the same .
Notes Edwards : " No president  in fact , not all of the previous forty - two presidents combined  has so aggressively or repeatedly declared the right to simply ignore laws that would restrict his power .
This is , of course , a fundamental rejection of essential conservative principles . "
But the problem runs deeper .
It is a rejection of the basis of constitutional government .
Edwards understands what so many left - wing critics of the Bush administration miss : " Ad hominem attacks on Bush ’s intellect or honesty or psychological motivations  a presumed rivalry with his father , for example  cloud the real issue .
What is frightening is to have a president who lacks an understanding of , or is dismissive of , constitutional constraints on his authority . "
Edwards extends this critique to President Bush ’s conduct of foreign policy .
Although conservatives were never pacifists , they usually were reluctant warriors .
A powerful military was meant to limit war , not conduct social engineering around the globe .
As Edwards puts it :
" The Constitution was written by individuals intimately familiar with the propensity of European monarchs to send their subjects off to die on foreign battlefields .
If the walls ’ built into [ the Constitution ] have any overriding objective , it is to prevent the same thing from happening here .
The United States might indeed choose to go to war , but that decision would be made not by a single political leader but by representatives of the people themselves .
In a document that far exceeded the practices of most other contemporary societies in limiting central authority , there was no more striking departure from the norms of the day than deliberately withholding from the chief executive the power to declare war .
No American could be sent off to fight , and possibly to die , unless the people themselves determined that the cause was one that was worth the cost . "
Edwards details conservative principles and a strategy for " reclaiming conservatism . "
He emphasizes that he is no libertarian and offers much with which to disagree .
But anyone who believes in limited government and individual liberty should endorse his call for a return to constitutional governance .
Explains Edwards :
" Every member of Congress , Republican or Democrat , conservative or liberal , should be forced by his or her constituents to demand that any president , regardless of party , follow the Constitution and abide by any statute that has been signed into law .
No exceptions .
No silence .
Here lies the line between constitutional government and unchecked power . "
Citing Article 1 , Section 8 , which enumerates the powers of Congress , Edwards suggests that the proper question for legislators is " What part of this do you not understand ? "
It ’s a great question .
Obviously , conservatives are not the only people at fault .
Admits Edwards : " liberals too often believe in enhancing the power of the state and are too willing to sacrifice the rights of individuals to the collective . "
But conservatives , at least those in power today , share the same view .
Which leaves the Constitution , and particularly its provisions restraining government power and protecting individual liberties , largely undefended .
It is a document " not to be taken lightly , not to be set aside whenever doing so might provide partisan advantage or victory on some issue that seemed important in the moment , " argues Edwards .
But much of the Right has abandoned it .
For this reason Edwards challenges conservatives .
" If the Constitution and its fervent embrace of citizen rights is lost , they will bear the responsibility for its demise . "
They will not be the only ones to blame .
But Edwards ’ essential point is critical : conservatives risk sharing responsibility for the destruction of one of the few barriers left to aggrandizing state power .
If this happens , all Americans will lose .
Let 's start a word counter for the many times John McCain says : " My friends " in his speeches .
He seems like he uses it after every sentence and it's as phony as a three dollar bill .
< correction >
Is Limbaugh or Ingraham his " friends ?
In one of the most uninspiring speeches I 've ever watched --- I think I heard some weird chanting going on in the crowd of McCain 's supporters too .
Wow , almost cult - like .
And what 's with that glassy look in his eyes ?
Jack Kemp wrote a piece that appeared on Townhall --- begging Conservative talkies to get off McCrazy 's back .
You gave him your best shots and he took it like a man .
Now , as he heads toward the nomination , I urge you to continue to be critical , but to do so in measured ways that will not damage his ability to win in November against those who would weaken our nation 's defense , wave a white flag to al - Qaida , socialize our health - care system , and promote income redistribution and class warfare instead of economic growth and equality of opportunity .
It 's Kemp that 's waving the white flag to the Hannity's ...
Five months ago , I looked at how the 45n5.com Top 100 list changed due to a PageRank update .
Since then Google has updated some PageRanks again , and I wanted to go back over the previous list and see where people stand today .
I am using my original list from the post entitled “ An Entirely Different Top 100 Make Money Online List ”
NEW Sites
When I last did this , my blog was n’t listed in the top 50 , and it really bummed me out , but since then I have made it into the top 50 and have done rather respectable in my opinion , but the one thing that strikes me about this new list is how many blogs that were n’t in the top 50 have also joined the ranks .
Look at all the ones listed as being NEW to the top 50 , and you will undestand what I mean .
This to me says two things .
The first thing it points to is something that I say all the time to people , which is , if you are passionate about any niche , no matter how saturated , take a stab at it , as you might be “ the voice ” everyone has been waiting for .
The second thing this list shows is how many really respectable and interesting bloggers run out of steam , and are unable to compete with all the new up and coming blogs in the niche .
With the “ make money online ” niche , I have found it to be very cyclical with old blogs dying off as they run out of fresh ideas and new blogs taking their place .
Near the very top of the list , you can see there are some blogs though that are just cemented in their spot , which is proof of how far and how long you can really be the expert in a niche if you really want it bad enough .
Also , if you look at the list , and compare it with the last list , there are n’t as many double digit movers and shakers in this update , but I believe that it is in part because I do n’t have the full list from five months ago .
Some of the blogs listed as NEW were most likely on the list , below the top 50 threashold , and so while they are new to the top 50 , they are n’t new to Mark ’s Top 100 List and many might have experienced double digit gains in their position over the last five months .
Interesting Drops
There are a few blogs that were n’t able to stay in the top 50 , including notable site , Cash Quests , which currently ranks at 59 .
It had a previous rank as high as 15 , but after being sold , it was n’t able to maintain its higher Alexa ranking and has dropped drastically .
Another that is sitting outside the top 50 after once being deep entrenched in it is Nate Whitehill , who with his Unique Blog Designs was very heavily linked at one point .
Five months ago his blog was ranked number 18 , and before that it was number 10 .
Now it sits at the spot number 52 .
Another blog that looks like its rank was killed thanks to a drop in its Alexa score .
Names Names Names
The final interesting note that I wanted to add to this post is something that I noticed while creating it : blog names .
It seems many people in the make money online blog scene have decided to use their own name or a pen name for the site ’s URL and title .
Over a dozen blogs in the list are currently using the real name or pen name of the author .
I am not sure why they have done that , but I think it ’s interesting to note .
Steve Ballmer kicked up a little dirt last week when he said that Microsoft could " wake up smarter " and keep selling XP after the June 30 cutoff date if customer feedback demanded it , but as you 'd expect , the company is busily trying to " clarify " that statement by saying that while it always listens to customers , XP is definitely going to die on the 30th .
Well , apart from the ultraportable exception that 'll last until 2012 or so .
And the backlog of licenses still in reseller 's hands .
Oh , and a little company called Dell , which , as rumored , is going to take advantage of a Vista licensing loophole that allows it to sell a copy of Vista but preload XP instead .
Yep , that 's the plan -- Dell 's going to report a Vista sale to Microsoft , but deliver an XP box with Vista upgrade DVD to customers .
( That sound you just heard was a million accountants sighing in appreciation . )
The program will be available for Latitude , OptiPlex , Precision , Vostro , and XPS systems ( some with a minor fee ) , and Dell says it'll keep going as long as Microsoft supports the " downgrade " license option , which could be forever .
Looks like June 30 just got a lot less scary for XP fans , no ?

John Ashcroft Yelled at Me Tonight .
No Joke .
Submitted by davidswanson
By Elsinora via Democratic Underground
Knox College is a liberal arts college , in every sense of the word “ liberal . ”
Out of approximately 1400 students , the Knox College Republicans can claim only six members .
Although we ’re a tiny college , we attract very prestigious Democrats to come speak : Barack Obama , Stephen Colbert , and Bill Clinton were our last three commencement speakers .
( This year Madeleine Albright will be commencement speaker . )
Not to be outdone , this year the College Republicans managed to raise $ 15,000 to entice Ashcroft to come speak .
Finally , I got to ask my question about waterboarding –and the result was , of course , the reason for this diary ’s title :
ME : First off , Mr. Ashcroft , I ’d like to apologize for the rudeness of some of my fellow students .
It was uncalled for–we can disagree civilly , we do n’t need that .
( round of applause from the audience , and Ashcroft smiles ) I have here in my hand two documents .
One of them , you know , is the text of the United Nations Convention against Torture , which , point of interest , says nothing about “ lasting physical damage ” …
ASHCROFT : ( interrupting )
Do you have the Senate reservations to it ?
ME : No , I do n’t .
Do you happen to know what they are ?
ASHCROFT : ( angrily ) I do n’t have them memorized , no .
I do n’t have time to go around memorizing random legal facts .
I just do n’t want these people in the audience to go away saying , “ He was wrong , she had the proof right in her hand ! ”
Because that ’s not true .
It ’s a lie .
If you do n’t have the reservations , you do n’t have anything .
Now , if you want to bring them another time , we can talk , but …
ME : Actually , Mr. Ashcroft , my question was about this other document .
( laughter and applause )
This other document is a section from the judgment of the Tokyo War Tribunal .
After WWII , the Tokyo Tribunal was basically the Nuremberg Trials for Japan .
Many Japanese leaders were put on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity , including torture .
And among the tortures listed was the “ water treatment , ” which we nowadays call waterboarding …
ASHCROFT : ( interrupting )
This is a speech , not a question .
I do n’t mind , but it ’s not a question .
ME : It will be , sir , just give me a moment .
The judgment describes this water treatment , and I quote , “ the victim was bound or otherwise secured in a prone position ; and water was forced through his mouth and nostrils into his lungs and stomach . ”
One man , Yukio Asano , was sentenced to fifteen years hard labor by the allies for waterboarding American troops to obtain information .
Since Yukio Asano was trying to get information to help defend his country –exactly what you , Mr. Ashcroft , say is acceptible for Americans to do–do you believe that his sentence was unjust ?
( boisterous applause and shouts of “ Good question ! ” )
ASHCROFT : ( angrily )
Now , listen here .
You ’re comparing apples and oranges , apples and oranges .
We do n’t do anything like what you described .
ME : I ’m sorry , I was under the impression that we still use the method of putting a cloth over someone ’s face and pouring water down their throat …
ASHCROFT : ( interrupting , red- faced , shouting ) Pouring !
Pouring !
Did you hear what she said ?
“ Putting a cloth over someone ’s face and pouring water on them . ”
That ’s not what you said before !
Read that again , what you said before !
ME : Sir , other reports of the time say …
ASHCROFT : ( shouting ) Read what you said before !
( cries of “ Answer her fucking question ! ” from the audience ) Read it !
ME : ( firmly ) Mr. Ashcroft , please answer the question .
ASHCROFT : ( shouting )
Read it back !
ME : “ The victim was bound or otherwise secured in a prone position ; and water was forced through his mouth and nostrils into his lungs and stomach . ”
ASHCROFT : ( shouting )
You hear that ?
You hear it ?
“ Forced ! ”
If you ca n’t tell the difference between forcing and pouring … does this college have an anatomy class ?
If you ca n’t tell the difference between forcing and pouring …
ME : ( firmly and loudly ) Mr. Ashcroft , do you believe that Yukio Asano ’s sentence was unjust ?
Answer the question .
( pause )
ASHCROFT : ( more restrained )
It ’s not a fair question ; there ’s no comparison .
Next question !
( loud chorus of boos from the audience )

Ken Livingstone , the Mayor of London , has five children by three different women , it was revealed last night .
The disclosure was an attempt to pre-empt a Sunday newspaper which had been investigating his personal life .
As well as two children with his partner , Emma Beal , Mr Livingstone has three other children from two previous relationships .
He has two daughters with one previous partner and a son with a third woman .
Their identities have not been revealed .
He was said last night to be an " involved father " who was in regular touch with all his children .
Mr Livingstone refused to comment directly on the disclosures in an interview last night with BBC London .
He said : " I do n't talk about my private life ; it seems like only yesterday the press was trying to imply I was gay .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I have never discussed my private life because it is not a relevant factor .
I do n't think anybody in this city will be shocked by what two consenting adults do , as long as you do n't include children , animals and vegetables . "
The Livingstone team is anxious to see whether the disclosure has any impact on the battle for City Hall on 1 May .
A poll yesterday suggested Mr Livingstone , who has been Mayor since 2000 , was one percentage point behind Boris Johnson , his Tory challenger .
Mr Livingstone dismissed the suggestion that the disclosure limited his ability to discuss moral issues and insisted he felt " no guilt whatsoever " .
He said : " I 'm quite happy with my private life and the people who have shared my private life over the last 40 years .
I do n't see any complaints , but all the people who have shared my private life at one point or another was on the basis it was private between us .
And they do n't expect me to be pontificating on TV about it . "
Ms Beal and Mr Livingstone met 12 years ago and have two children , Thomas , five , and Mia , four .
Ms Beal now helps to run his office .
The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats refused to comment last night .

Well , the horse is out of the barn on this one , but Brasscheck TV was the ONLY news outlet to point out that in spite of being a horse 's ass , Elliott Spitzer was doing the right thing on predatory lending and that 's why he was politically assassinated with the help of the FBI .
It 's one of the most amazing displays of journalistic incompetence and malpractice in recent memory .
The US news media failed to draw the obvious connection between the bizarre federal law enforcement investigation and leak campaign about the private life of New York Governor Spitzer and Spitzer 's all out attack on the Bush administration for its collusion with predatory lenders .
While the international credit system grinds to a halt because of a superabundance of bad mortgage loans made in the US , the news media failed to cover the details of Spitzer 's public charges against the White House .
Yet when salacious details were leaked about alleged details of Spitzer 's private life , they took that information and made it the front page news for days .
From the 9/11 fiasco , the Iraq War , the travesty of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina , and the shredding of the US Constitution , we can now add a deliberate and reckless undermining of the credit and banking system of the US to the list of Bush administration " accomplishments . "
No external enemy , or group of external enemies , could have done as much harm to the nation as this group has in less than eight years .
Hey , do you think it 's a coincidence that a Bush was involved the last time the US banking industry fell into a black whole because of White House - facilitated fraud ?
There 's actually a lot of money to be made blowing up banks .
Here 's how Bush Sr. and his friends in the Mafia and CIA profited from it the last time :

With Blu-ray destroying the competition , the availability of cheaper units is going to be a big part in the future success of the format .
That is why Sony 's recent success in shrinking the basic Blu-ray reader / writer module is a turn for the better .
The new modules will pave the way for thinner drive bays and cheaper players .
Advertisement
The units are only 3 mm thick , and Sony is confident that the smaller size will allow Blu-ray functionality to become mainstream in standard 9.5 mm laptop drives .
Sony are further hoping that this move towards greater ubiquity is secured by the end of this year .
Advertisement
The cost effectiveness will be due to a simpler manufacturing process , and the 3 mm modules will also be able to read dual layered BDs with organic dye in the recording layers .
Such discs can be produced from traditional DVD production lines , again driving down the costs .
Sure , this may all sound like great news , but do you not recall the movies , people ?
The hardships that were faced by a tiny Thomas Brown still bring a tear to my eye .

The current and former officials also provided new details about the role played in November 2005 by Jose A. Rodriguez Jr. , then the chief of the agency ’s clandestine branch , who ultimately ordered the destruction of the tapes .
The officials said that before he issued a secret cable directing that the tapes be destroyed , Mr. Rodriguez received legal guidance from two C.I.A. lawyers , Steven Hermes and Robert Eatinger .
The officials said that those lawyers gave written guidance to Mr. Rodriguez that he had the authority to destroy the tapes and that the destruction would violate no laws .
The agency did not make either Mr. Hermes or Mr. Eatinger available for comment .
Current and former officials said the two lawyers informed the C.I.A. ’s top lawyer , John A. Rizzo , about the legal advice they had provided .
But officials said Mr. Rodriguez did not inform either Mr. Rizzo or Porter J. Goss , the C.I.A. director , before he sent the cable to destroy the tapes .
“ There was an expectation on the part of those providing legal guidance that additional bases would be touched , ” said one government official with knowledge of the matter .
“ That did n’t happen . ”
Robert S. Bennett , a lawyer for Mr. Rodriguez , insisted that his client had done nothing wrong and suggested that Mr. Rodriguez had been authorized to order the destruction of the tapes .
“ He had a green light to destroy them , ” Mr. Bennett said .
Until their destruction , the tapes were stored in a safe in the C.I.A. station in the country where the interrogations took place , current and former officials said .
According to one former senior intelligence official , the tapes were never sent back to C.I.A. headquarters , despite what the official described as concern about keeping such highly classified material overseas .
Top officials of the C.I.A ’s clandestine service had pressed repeatedly beginning in 2003 for the tapes ’ destruction , out of concern that they could leak and put operatives in both legal and physical jeopardy .
WASHINGTON  President Bush criticized Congress Tuesday for " letting the American people down " on issues ranging from food and gas prices to foreign trade and intelligence , and he called for new bipartisan efforts to solve them .
However , the president declined to go along with congressional proposals to open the nation 's strategic petroleum reserve , declare a summer moratorium on gas taxes or add domestic priorities to a $ 108 billion spending bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Bush acknowledged the economy was having a " tough time " and said Congress was n't addressing it .
In a wide - ranging Rose Garden news conference , he accused lawmakers of " playing politics , " a " lack of leadership " and " inactivity on big issues . "
Americans , Bush said , want the White House and Congress to work together to help them pay for gas , food , housing and college costs .
" I do n't think this is too much to ask , even in an election year , " he said .
The news conference was Bush 's first in two months , and it came as Americans ' attention increasingly has turned to the presidential campaign .
As he has done before , Bush refused to opine much about the race , other than to predict Republican Sen .
John McCain will win and carry on his policies on free trade and combating terrorism .
The president said Congress has ignored his proposals , such as expanding U.S. energy production , reducing subsidies to wealthy farmers and overhauling federal mortgage lending agencies .
" Time after time , Congress chose to block them , " he said .
Bush said he would consider proposals to lower gas prices , but he did not endorse McCain 's plan for a gas tax holiday this summer , and he opposed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's proposal to open up the strategic petroleum reserve .
" I have analyzed the issue , and I do n't think it would affect price , " he said .
" If there was a magic wand ... I 'd do that , " the president said .
" There is no magic wand to wave right now .
It took us a while to get in this fix . "
In a more conciliatory tone , Bush said he would " work with Congress " to improve Iraq and Afghanistan veterans ' educational benefits .
Democrats plan to attach that and other domestic spending , including extended unemployment benefits , to the Iraq spending request next month .
Bush said he would not accept anything over $ 108 billion .
The president said he did not know what his administration would report Wednesday on economic growth in the second quarter of the 2008 fiscal year .
A second quarter of negative growth could confirm a recession .
" Economists can argue over the terminology , " he said .
On other issues , the president : • Avoided criticism of former president Jimmy Carter 's recent meeting with Hamas leaders in the Middle East .
He said he had not talked to Carter beforehand and did n't know the details of any conversations administration officials had with him .
He blamed Hamas for undermining peace talks with Israel and said , " That 's the reason I 'm not talking to them . "
• Defended his administration 's decision to withhold information from Congress until now on North Korea 's alleged role in building a nuclear reactor in Syria that was bombed by Israel .
He said 22 members were briefed immediately after the bombing but only now was the " risk of retaliation or confrontation in the Middle East " reduced sufficiently to speak openly of North Korea 's alleged involvement .
He also said the briefing was meant as a warning to Iran regarding its nuclear plans .
• Said the war in Afghanistan is " worth the fight " despite slow progress against Taliban insurgents .
" We are in a global struggle against thugs and killers , " he said .
" Is it worth the fight ?
In my judgment , yes , it is . "
• Said President Robert Mugabe 's government in Zimbabwe is waging a campaign of violence and intimidation after March 29 elections that is " simply unacceptable . "
Bush said neighboring countries " need to step up and lead and recognize that the will of the people must be respected . "
Election results have yet to be announced .
Zimbabwe 's Opposition Movement for Democratic Change says leader Morgan Tsvangirai won a majority .

Two years ago I landed a job at ITA Software , which Paul Graham called one of the “ ten or twenty places where hackers most want to work , ” along with Google .
And one of the interesting things about ITA is that the majority of their software is written in Lisp .
Now before starting there , my experience with Lisp was about the same as most CS grads .
I ’d used it as an undergrad in a programming languages course , as well as an AI course on natural language processing .
And my thoughts about it were pretty standard : it ’s a functional language , so if you ’re going to use it you ’re best off doing recursion and avoiding assignment statements ; and dynamic typing and garbage collection make it slow .
Boy , was I wrong .
It turns out , Lisp is a lot more practical than that , and we use it for the search engine that powers Orbitz.com , Kayak.com , and most of the U.S. airline websites , among others .
The main things I ’ve learned are :
It ’s not a functional language , it ’s a multi- paradigm language .
You do n’t need Monads to sequence instructions , and a lot of forms automatically sequence their bodies ( “ implicit progn ” ) .
Our code is mostly imperative , we use lots of state and assignments , and we only use recursion rarely , where it ’s clearly better than iteration .
G_Morgan put it very well .
Lisp is the only dynamic language ( that I ’m aware of ) that has optional typing for efficiency .
You can tell it the type of any expression , and it will assume the result is that type , thus skipping a potentially expensive check and branch .
Sprinkling a few type declarations here and there , along with Lisp ’s type inference , can result in compiled code equivalent to optimized C code .
Lisp ’s macros are great .
They can do arbitrary computation at compile time .
The C++ crowd has rediscovered this with template metaprogramming in the last few years , but the C++ version is awkward .
It ’s Turing complete , but the syntax is reallyawkward .
Not only is it a pure functional language , but it does n’t even have loops .
No loops !
Can you imagine programming without a loop ?
If you ’ve done template metaprogramming , you do n’t have to imagine , you ’ve lived it .
But macros are useful for a lot more .
You can use them to bind variables , to provide clean , easy access to values , much in the way that eachXXX withXXX closures are used in Groovy .
And they can even be used to develop little languages .
So why has n’t Lisp caught on more ?
Well , in a way it has : a lot of the innovation in programming languages has come out of Lisp .
Dynamic typing , syntax support for useful data types ( only Lists in Lisp ) , automatic garbage collection , hell , even the if statement appeared in Lisp first , and only made it into other languages once found to be useful .
Object Oriented programming is the only major exception that I can think of , mostly because when you have macros , you do n’t really need it .
But Lisp ’s syntax is a little off - putting .
On computers of the ’50s , ’60s , ’70s and ’ 80s ( yes , Lisp has been around that long ) , Lisp was big and slow .
But more importantly , most people ’s exposure to Lisp is as an example of a functional language .
And functional programming requires you to think like a mathematician , which is unnatural for a lot of people .
I ’m waiting for other languages to discover the second and third points above : a dynamic language that cares about efficiency , and a macro capability that ’s as powerful as Lisp’s .
When I first discovered Groovy , with it ’s Java compatibility and optional typing , I thought it was the holy grail of an efficient dynamic language .
But sadly it ’s creators subscribe to the mainstream view of “ dynamically typed languages should be slow , statically typed are fast . ”
Which is a shame , as it has a lot to recommend it , the syntax and semantics are pretty close to my ideal language .
But they seem to have a mental block on annotations or keywords for optional typing or for turning off Groovy ’s extreme dynamism when the programmer does n’t want it anyway .
But Cython looks promising .
It has optional typing for efficiency , makes it easy to integrate / recode in C , and there ’s currently a lot of debate about compile time transforms and code execution that is a step towards Lisp macros .
Let ’s hope …
That which an age feels to be evil is usually an untimely after - echo of that which was formerly felt to be good — the atavism of an older ideal .
Friedrich Nietzsche
The following writings began as a short article written in reaction to numerous interviews I had read with ‘ Satanic ’ or ‘ black metal ’ bands ( in Esoterra magazine ) .
I got very tired of their knee - jerk social Darwinism , their philosophy of “ the strong over the weak ” .
Metal bands will never be the best exponents of any philosophy , and Satanism should n’t be judged according to their interviews .
Nevertheless , their simplistic view of nature ’s laws ( which in any case should be seen as nature ’s habits ) encapsulate many quibbles I have with the social Darwinist shades of Satanism , and occultism in general .
There are a lot of much more enlightened strains of the ‘ left - hand path ’ , as these writings will hint at .
These strains usually attempt to transcend the left / right dualism of occult morality , a false dichotomy where self - interest and concern for others are seen to be mutually exclusive .
While I ’m not a Satanist , not even strictly a practising occultist , occultural philosophies have a deep influence on my world - view and life .
I read widely on these subjects , and though I love toying with ideas , maps and models for intellectual amusement , I find that I ’m with Nietzsche when he says , “ I do not know what purely intellectual problems are . ”
So what began as a somewhat playful little jab at the shaky foundations of social Darwinism gradually evolved into an outpouring of the visions and intuitions that my recent experiences , research and reflection have led me to .
It ’s an exorcism of sorts , an attempt to externalize the insights , feelings and perceptions that I often find flooding into me , seemingly unbidden , but later seen to be exactly what I needed to shift my world - view out of a stale or narrow perspective .
I find it ’s only through externalizing these cascades of insight that I can make room for more to arrive .
My research is not strictly ‘ scholarly ’ .
Dreams , drugs , sex , conversations with truckers who give me lifts , synchronicity - laden trails that lead me to books I would n’t usually notice , trashy movies , walks in the countryside , emotional breakdowns , lazy days , playing with kids … all these play a more significant role in the evolution of my ideas than the traditional academic activities of ‘ thinking ’ and ‘ reading ’ .
And , when I really look at it , I ca n’t imagine that this is anything new .
Life is n’t cut into categories in the way that the division of academia into different disciplines pretends it is .
Everything influences everything else , and I think what I ’m doing is just consciously recognizing this … and then writing .
That said , some of the material here is quite ‘ dense ’ , laden with associations which might come to me , immersed as I am in it all , without much effort , but which may ask a lot more of the reader than passive word - by - word consumption .
As far as this sort of writing goes , I try to tread a precarious path between making myself clear and passionately wanting to be a ‘ sounding board ’ .
I want to leave gaps , be oblique , allow space for the reader to enter into my thoughts , fuse with them to an extent , and come away with more than ‘ information ’ .
I ’m not in the business of handing people complete , air - tight systems of ideas on a plate .
I do n’t think you can show something to someone that they have n’t already seen ; but I know from my own experience that we ’ve all seen a lot more than we often pretend .
I want to try to help people remember this .
Also , the nature of the areas dealt with here means that words can never present a view of them that is even close to being ‘ complete ’ .
All they can do is suggest , trigger , and point .
Exactly what they will suggest , trigger off or point to will depend on who you are and where you are .
Ideally , you ’ll take more of yourself away from this than you will of me .
Many of the ideas here utterly contradict beliefs I held two years ago .
I do n’t doubt that two years from now I ’ll be off somewhere else .
As Alan Watts said , “ I am not one who believes that it is any necessary virtue in the philosopher to spend his life defending a consistent position .
It is surely a kind of spiritual pride to refrain from ‘ thinking out loud ’ , and to be unwilling to let a thesis appear in print until you are prepared to champion it to the death . ”
This does n’t mean I do n’t want people to criticize this writing .
Yes , these are my present opinions , but they will change — and I only got here by having my opinions challenged , as well as ‘ confirmed ’ by experiences and other people .
I never want this process to stop .
There are several different , but subtly related parts to these writings .
I call them “ meditations ” because although there are clear conceptual threads weaving throughout the different sections , there is no attempt at a coherent ‘ argument ’ .
Parts of it relate to and reflect off others parts in ways I never anticipated ; no doubt many of the intended resonances will fall flat .
As I said before , language , being linear , just ca n’t accurately describe the ideas and modes of experience I ’m dealing with .
All I can do is spin words , my own and the sampled words of others , around these things , revealing a fragment here , a fragment there , but still leaving mere fragments .
Each trying to describe the same underlying thing , each reflecting a different part of it , in the hope that a multitude of linear perspectives can come closer to representing this non-linear vision .
Firstly , there are some arguments about the philosophical underpinnings of what has come to be known as Satanism in modern occulture .
This section , being the original seed - article , could stand on its own , but hopefully the reader will soon see its intimate relevance to the other meditations as they ’re unravelled .
Then , taking its cue from the ubiquitous urge to uncover spiritual fertility buried beneath centuries of Christian domination , there is a speculative look at the genesis of the Devil — and what lies beyond .
The Devil & The Tao
As far as the philosophical underpinnings of Satanism go , one of the best places to start is with Friedrich Nietzsche .
While he had nothing ( consciously ) to do with Satanism , his work is frequently cited by Satanists and modern occultists , and I think more than a few Satanists see themselves as ‘ Nietzschean ’ .
It has to be said before setting off that Nietzsche was acutely , probably painfully aware of how his ideas may be misinterpreted .
He loathed the idea that people , “ like plundering troops ” , may pick and choose titbits from his books to use for their own purposes , disregarding material contrary to their own agendas .
The racist misinterpretations ( far too weak a word ! ) of the German Nazi party are the most blatant case in point .
That said , I disagree with some of his work .
In the end Nietzsche was no ‘ system - builder ’ — he erected no edifice that must be accepted entirely or fall to the ground .
He was an experimentalist , and perpetually played with and revised ideas .
It is in this spirit that I read Nietzsche ; and here I ’m looking at him with an eye to reveal a few misinterpretations less obvious than those of the half - witted anti-Semites .
No doubt I ’ll end up guilty of a bit of plundering myself , but I prefer judicious plunder to wilful misunderstanding .
Darwinism is the central concept to deal with .
It amuses me to see ‘ black metal ’ bands asked in interviews if they believe in the ( supposedly ‘ Nietzschean ’ ) philosophy of “ the strong over the weak ” , “ survival of the fittest ” — as if this would provoke some new and interesting response !
We ’re talking social Darwinism here of course , but let ’s look first at the biological argument .
Darwinian evolutionary theory often seems too obvious to bother arguing with , but this is precisely my problem with it .
It ’s too bloody obvious .
The nail was whacked on the head for me when I read Arthur Koestler ’s Janus : A Summing Up .
Here he quotes C.H. Waddington , a critical neo-Darwinian :
Survival does not , of course , mean the bodily endurance of a single individual , outliving Methuselah .
It implies , in its present - day interpretation [ 1957 ] , perpetuation as a source for future generations .
That individual ‘ survives ’ best which leaves most offspring .
Again , to speak of an animal as ‘ fittest ’ does not necessarily imply that it is strongest or most healthy or would win a beauty competition .
Essentially it denotes nothing more than leaving most offspring .
The general principle of natural selection , in fact , merely amounts to the statement that the individuals which leave most offspring are those which leave most offspring .
It is a tautology .
Further , Ludwig von Bertalanffy acutely observes that “ It is hard to see why evolution has ever progressed beyond the rabbit , the herring , or even the bacterium which are unsurpassed in their reproductive capacities . ”
The so - called rationalism of modern — usually ‘ socially Darwinian ’ — Satanism rests on very dodgy philosophical ground , simply because when you bother to try and define the terms used in the idea of “ the strong over the weak ” , you ’re invariably left with a sense of , “ Yeah , and … ? ”
It ’s like saying you believe in the philosophy of “ winners beating the losers ” .
Jello Biafra nicely undermined knee - jerk social Darwinism with his quip that “ the strong prey on the weak , and the clever prey on the strong ” ; but in the end this just begs the question .
Also , orthodox Darwinism inevitably holds that humanity is the latest in life ’s progressively ‘ better ’ attempts at creating organisms .
Surely social Darwinism would hold a similar view about contemporary culture ?
This does n’t sit too well with the misanthropy , and contempt for the ‘ lowering of standards ’ in modern society , that is prevalent among many supposed social Darwinists .
If the strong really do overpower the weak , why have we been dominated for so long by such a half - assed religion as Christianity ?
I think many Satanists , in claiming “ strong over the weak ” to be a universal principle of nature , are actually trying to say , “ I ’m harder than you and I could have you easily . ”
Or at least , “ I could out - stare you , mate . ”
That ’s another argument .
But as for universal principles — forget it .
Evolution and history are far too complex and multi-dimensional to limit themselves to the strategies of a fight in a pub .
Nietzsche was definitely not a Darwinist , and had no faith in “ survival of the fittest ” as an ‘ explanation ’ .
For him , his conception of the “ will to power ” was the driving force behind all life .
It is essentially a conception of creativity , and has far more to do with creative self - mastery than power over others .
Nietzsche ’s notion that creation must be destructive ( “ Who wishes to be creative , must first destroy and smash accepted values . ” ) is often seen in limited terms .
This is only the first step .
The second step , often left out , is that the new creation itself must again be destroyed .
And the steps go on … Zarathustra is quite explicit on this : “ And life itself told me this secret : ‘ Behold , ’ it said , ‘ I am that which must overcome itself again and again … ' ”
The famous ‘ Superman ’ is n’t a concept of some inevitable evolutionary goal toward which humanity is inexorably moving ( i.e. it ’s not Darwinian ) .
It ’s a vision of an ideal state of being , of perfect self - mastery and perpetual re-creation , which Nietzsche believed some humans — Socrates and Goethe for example — had already , to an extent , achieved .
Together with his doctrine of eternal recurrence , it ’s a glorification of the moment , of total involvement in the turbulent flow of immediate experience .
“ Not to wish to see too soon . —
As long as one lives through an experience , one must surrender to the experience and shut one ’s eyes instead of becoming an observer immediately .
For that would disturb the good digestion of the experience : instead of wisdom one would acquire indigestion . ”
( The Wanderer and His Shadow )
Comparison with Taoism is illuminating .
While our cultural filters place Taoism in some ‘ soft ’ category , and see Nietzschean values as being essentially ‘ hard ’ , the distinction blurs when you consider the supra-cultural state to which both aspire .
Nietzsche used the word ‘ hard ’ many times in describing ideals , as in “ all creators are hard . ”
( Twilight of the Idols ) But I do n’t think we can just accept this word unquestioningly .
Its modern connotations evoke more of a mindless thug than a vibrant Superman .
Words are subject to mutation ; but even if the words themselves remain the same , their meaning is always mutating , for words are “ pockets into which now this and now that has been put , and now many things at once . ”
( The Wanderer and His Shadow )
Before considering Taoism , I ’d like to follow a little tangent about Nietzsche ’s ‘ hardness ’ .
I always thought of Nietzsche ( before actually reading him ) as some grim Teutonic beast .
He was actually vehemently opposed to the Germanic temperament , which he considered mediocre ( when in a good mood ) .
He repeatedly praised the southern European disposition , that of light - heartedness , exuberance and cheerfulness .
A far cry from the fashionably serious and dreary poses of many modern ‘ Nietzscheans ’ .
A key influence on this popular misconception of Nietzsche is probably that famous portrait — the furrowed brow , the dark gaze , the amazingly bushy moustache .
It does n’t do much for his philosophy of light - heartedness .
I was tempted to just put this image , of a very stern and worried - looking guy , down to his frequent bouts of illness .
I recently found out that I was more justified in this temptation than I guessed .
Nietzsche never grew such a moustache .
These amounts of hair appeared on his upper lip only during his last ten years of life , during which he was helplessly insane .
He was unable to care for himself , and this responsibility fell to his sister , who allowed the ‘ tache to flourish and brought people in to do portraits .
Poor Freddy had no choice .
This picture of an intense mad-eyed walrus is probably not how Nietzsche would have liked to have been remembered !
His sister , who managed to distort his work as well as his image , has a lot to answer for .
To return to Taoism …
The Tao , usually translated as “ way ” , is seen as that force which underpins , interpenetrates , and flows through the universe .
Actually , “ flows through ” is misleading , as it conjures up images of ‘ things ’ as vessels through which the Tao passes .
Taoism admits of no such duality .
And the Tao ’s primary characteristic is that it can not be defined .
A definition of it , such as “ the process of the universe ” , may loosen our categories a bit in order to contemplate it , but categories ultimately have to be destroyed if that process is to be fully apprehended .
I think Nietzsche was too suspicious or ignorant of ‘ mysticism ’ to fully admit it , but I suspect any Superhuman state would involve a similar destruction — or transcendence — of categories .
So what is this process , or Tao , that we ’re trying to apprehend ?
In Nietzsche ’s words , it is “ that which must overcome itself again and again “ .
Nietzsche ’s conception of embracing this , of fully participating in the process of life , is shot through with an distinct emphasis on struggle — assertion , strife and conflict .
Regarding modern occultural misinterpretations again , it is primarily in this sense that he intended his many references to war .
Being anti-state and anti-political , Nietzsche in no way ‘ advocated ’ bloody economic and territorial battles between nations .
He did n’t ‘ condemn ’ them either .
Nietzsche was neither liberal nor fascist .
He largely used the word “ war ” in the sense of resolutely striving for self - mastery without shrinking from — rather , embracing — the inevitable conflicts this quest entails .
“ I will not cease from Mental fight , Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand … ” ( William Blake , Milton )
Reconciling this relentless struggle , which is obviously part of the path to self - perfection , with the supposed passive quiescence of Taoism , is itself an ongoing process .
Of course , it ’s ultimately a false dichotomy , and Christopher S. Hyatt seems to have summed it up best in his book The Tree of Lies :
The concept of surrender has become so distorted that many believe that “ surrendering ” is in opposition to power , sex and self mastery .
This is one of the greatest lies .
. . . self mastery is not possible without surrender .
This issue cannot be overemphasized .
Magic and Mysticism — The Will To Self Mastery and The Will To Surrender — are two sides of the same coin .
. . . when power or love are taken to their extreme they become one .
The Tao is a struggle of perpetual self - overcoming — again and again .
But as Alan Watts ceaselessly points out , it is a struggle devoid of ‘ anxiety loops ’ .
In fully surrendering to the flow of life , one surrenders one ’s resistance to the rolling process of destruction and creation , ‘ war ’ and ‘ peace ’ , that true life constitutes .
Passivity is often part of this resistance , as much as frenetic anxiety can be .
Satanism and Taoism are alike in that they are both deeply concerned with the hard / soft , strong / weak distinctions .
Satanism seems to emphasize and value ‘ strength ’ , while Taoism seems to emphasize and value ‘ weakness ’ .
I feel that both may learn from each other .
Taoists who have made the clichéd image of the quiescent oriental sage their behavioural ideal would do well to meditate on the Tao at work in an ocean whipped up by a tumultuous thunderstorm , and see how close to ‘ nature ’ they really are .
Hardened Satanists , intent on fortifying their unbending will , would do equally well to take a sword to a piece of solid wood , and then to a pond .
The wood will splinter and be destroyed .
The pond will passively accept the blade , and effortlessly flow back to perfection once it is withdrawn .

To be broken with one hard blow / I ’ve seen the ocean break on the shore / Come together with no harm done Perry Farrell , ‘ Oceansize ’
Satan ’s Ancestry
Those who point the finger at Satan , reveal Satan .
Those who fight Satan , give him power .
Those who blame Satan , give him influence .
Those who talk much of Satan , create him .
But those who worship Satan , tame Satan .
Those who passively resist him , earn his respect .
Those who accept him , diminish his influence .
And those who analyse him , learn his wisdom .
Lionel B. Snell , ‘ The Satan Game ’
The Christian devil , Satan , is an archetype .
Whether one sees archetypes as creations of the human mind , genetically - rooted universal ‘ templates ’ of conscious experience , or fully independent spiritual entities , is irrelevant here .
Even if archetypes are seen to be autonomous ‘ beings ’ — gods , goddesses , demons or spirits — they are inevitably experienced by means of our own bodies and minds .
Our experience of them is filtered through whatever biological , cultural and psychological structures we happen to find ourselves equipped with to make sense of the world .
Thus , if we ’re talking about the realms of human experience ( and what else can we talk about in a useful way ? ) , Satan may be seen to have a history , a mythical family line of descent .
Certain universal facts of life , such as the processes of sex , birth & death , will be ever - present in most mythical figures ; but the specific figures themselves evolve throughout human history to mirror the complex cultural interactions and upheavals that have ceaselessly manifested since the first time apes developed language , culture and myth — and became human .
In this speculative Satanic genealogy we shall obviously work backwards , climbing down from contemporary branches , down the trunk , and under the ground where the roots lay hidden .
So to begin with , how is Satan conceived in contemporary culture ?
Modern Christianity has lost much of the medieval iconographic vividness in its conception of Satan , as it is supposedly more ‘ sophisticated ’ , and not given to simplistic anthropomorphisms ( i.e. Satan as a reptilian , horned , cunning and wily beast - man dwelling ‘ down there ’ in his burning lair ) .
The most significant manifestation of modern Christians ’ concern with their Devil is in the phenomenon known as the ‘ Satanic Abuse Myth ’ .
‘ Satanic Abuse ’ , because the phenomenon centres around the conviction that the Western world is infested with invisible networks of evil Satanists , who ritually abuse and bloodily sacrifice people — usually children — in the service of their Dark Lord .
‘ Myth ’ , because this conviction has uniformly been found , by government - commissioned investigations and independent researchers alike , to be false .
Certain cases of abuse have been found where the perpetrators used the paraphernalia of occultism to terrify their victims into submission and silence .
But not one case of genuine Satanists , occultists , or pagans harming children for the purposes of magickal ritual has ever been found .
So we can see that these obscene Christian fantasies of blood - soaked orgies and child sacrifice are merely the modern version of the medieval equivalents , the witch - hunts ( or of the Roman equivalent , where early Christians were accused of similar crimes … ) .
The vividness of these modern scapegoating fantasies seems to have made the mythical figure of Satan himself less necessary .
Who needs an image of a subterranean Devil on which to project your repressed fears and desires when you can conjure up such horrifying scenes of ‘ actual ’ human activity ?
Often at the forefront of the cultural panic around Satanism was the self - styled leader of California ’s Church of Satan , Anton Szandor LaVey .
He seemed amused as well as indignant about the latest bouts of witch - hunt scaremongering .
He knew as well as any open - minded observer that more children have suffered abuse and molestation at the hands of trusted Christian priests than have even heard of the Church of Satan .
And his codes of Satanic practice are there for all to read : “ Do not harm little children .
Do not kill non -human animals unless attacked or for your food . ” ( from ‘ The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth ’ )
But for Satanists as well as Christians the actual mythical image of the Devil has become less central .
LaVey states that Satan is “ a representational concept , accepted by each according to his or her needs . ”
This seems mightily hazy without LaVey ’s repeated reminders that ‘ Satan ’ roughly translates from Hebrew as ‘ adversary ’ or ‘ opponent ’ .
Satanism is based on the principle of opposition .
This is usually seen as opposition to the status quo , specifically Christian morality .
Satan is an emblematic concept presiding over the practice of all those wonderful un-Christian things : free sexuality , autonomy , indulgence , harmony with ( instead of dominion over ) nature , and anti-authoritarianism .
Many Satanists seem to slip up on this last one , and it ’s here that most Satanism as it stands loses my sympathies .
Just as many people forget that Nietzsche ’s ‘ destructive - creativity ’ is meant as a perpetual process , not just a one - off revolution , Satanism can often slip from being an expedient release from Christian programming into being a dogma in itself .
It seems to find it hard to challenge itself as an institution .
There are many parallels here with the ‘ left hand path ’ of politics , Marxism .
Many unsophisticated Marxists still think that their beliefs could function wonderfully as they stand once capitalism is cast to the ground once and for all , not seeing that their present beliefs are conditioned by their capitalist context .
If Western capitalism is ever ‘ overthrown ’ , I think many Marxists will follow their historical predecessors and become the new despots , or just be at a loss as to what to do without ‘ the opposition ’ .
Substitute ‘ Satanists ’ for ‘ Marxists ’ , and ‘ Christianity ’ for ‘ capitalism ’ , and you have a wildly simplistic , but very revealing analogy .
The influence of Chaos Magick and all its kindred philosophies on modern occulture seems to be a useful counter to this tunnel vision of simple opposition .
The heart of Chaos Magick is the practical implementation of Nietzsche ’s vision of life overcoming itself again and again , and provides a good antidote to any sliding towards dogma , or dependence on a static adversarial figure .
To return to Satan , we can see that despite his modern transformations , the popular conception of the Devil still bears the unmistakable hallmarks of pre-industrial Christianity ’s vivid image of him .
He is almost always bestial .
The horns and the cloven hooves are synonymous with the Devil , and a reptilian tail is often attributed to him .
Related to this is his unmistakably sexual nature , often seen as a threatening or perverse sexuality , but definitely sexual .
The conception of Satan as the rebel angel Lucifer is a bit of an anomaly here , and this figure seems like a more refined , sublimated and ‘ humanized ’ Devil , all ferality turned into stubborn pride , and sinister sexuality emerging as cunning seductiveness .
Pre-twentieth century Satanism , exemplified by people like Phillipe the Duc D’Orleans and Sir Francis Dashwood , was the domain of rebellious and hedonic aristocrats .
Their repudiation of the asceticism of Christianity often involved the kind of debauchery modern Christians are eager to pin on modern Satanists .
There is evidence of child murder and ritual sacrifice .
Many , however , penetrated beyond frenzied opposition to the Church and discovered the intimately related , but deeper roots of Satan in pre-Christian pagan gods .
Bloody sacrifice was usually part of such old paganism , and we ’ll return to this later .
For now it is sufficient to see that the figure of Satan cannot be separated from the nature gods of the older religions .
Modern Satanists are often quick to deny this connection as being necessary or significant , probably eager to hang on to Satan ’s supposed status as a god in his own right , independent of both Christianity and nature worship .
I suppose they fear the potency of their god being quelled by his being subtly appropriated into the realm of ‘ neo - paganism ’ , derided ( in some cases accurately ) by Satanists as wishy - washy .
But the connections are there .
For a start , it ’s plain that the Christian Satan was evolved as part of the church ’s expansion into pagan or ‘ heathen ’ lands .
This process was often complicated by unforeseen overlaps between Christianity and indigenous pagan practices , to a certain extent betraying Christianity ’s pagan origins .
We see this clearly in Catholicized Central and South American countries , where many natives have blended the invading cosmology into their own .
A vivid example of this is the fact that indigenous Mexican mushroom cults call their fungal sacrament teonanácatl , meaning ‘ flesh of the gods ’ .
Those cults which survived the Spanish conquest could easily accept the god Jesus , who offers us his flesh to eat , and his mother Mary , who became the new bottle for the old wine of Earth - Mother goddess figures .
Invading Christians spreading north over Europe consciously appropriated existing pagan festivals , and built their places of worship on ancient sacred sites to win over the populace .
But they still needed to weed out the more overt paganisms .
So the widespread Horned God or Goddess , who presided over pagan nature worship and fertility rites , was demonised .
Through the installation of dualistic categories of good and evil , and the identification of pagan gods as evil , they gave themselves permission to trample paganism into the ground , and a lot of spiritual clout with which to terrorize natives into obedience .
The greatest insights into Christianity and Satan can be gleaned from exploring the Greek god Dionysus .
He is very typical of pagan nature gods : he is horned , signifying kinship with animals ( like the closely related goat - god of the Arcadian pastures , Pan , another source of Satanic iconography ) ; he is a ‘ dying - and - rising ’ god , reflecting the cyclic process of the seasons in nature ; and he has a strong wild and untamed aspect , again like Pan , forming a bond with pre-civilised humanity .
It ’s obvious how Satan , Christianity ’s repressed shadow , has derived from such an archetype .
In its irrational suppression of sexuality , nature , cyclicity and the body , Christianity latched on to this archetype and pushed it so far away from human experience that it became alien , and we became alienated .
The already feral , ego - shattering Dionysian godform became utterly evil and terrifying , a force to be held at bay at all costs .
Now things get confusing .
Did not Jesus , like Dionysus , die and rise again ?
Both are intimately associated with vines and wine ; both have been connected to the use of psychedelic mushrooms ; the flesh of both is in some way eaten as part of their worshippers ’ rites ; and both names , according to John M. Allegro ’s The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross , stem etymologically from the same Sumerian root .
There ’s almost as much evidence connecting Dionysus with Jesus as there is with Satan .
It ’s my feeling that we have here a crucial fork in the history of archetypes .
Christianity appropriated the more abstract spiritual motifs of dying - and - rising nature gods ( mainly supposed ‘ life after death ’ ) and up popped the mythical Jesus .
The chthonic associations with the Earth , with sexuality and the body , were all repressed , compressed and demonised into Satan .
In this division was lost all cyclicity , all the transformative and change - affirming power of nature ’s process .
We descended into truly profane time ; linear time instead of rhythmic , spiralling , sacred time .
Norman O. Brown has noted that “ the divorce between soul and body [ analogous to the Jesus / Satan split ] takes the life out of the body , reducing the organism to a mechanism ” .
Likewise , the conception of an extra- terrestrial , eternal time ( Heaven ) as sacred renders the Earth profane , and binds us to the linear track of uni-directional historical ‘ progress ’ .
We may see ourselves as moving towards this sacred time — but it is an ever - receding carrot - on - a- stick , and tears us away from omni-directional immersion in the moment .
“ No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn . ” ( Jim Morrison )
In Satanism , Satan is seen as embodying the principle of division and duality , that principle without which manifestation — matter , flesh , bodies & sex — cannot occur .
This is symbolized in the ‘ inverted ’ pentagram , where two points are directed upwards and one down .
The dual realm of manifestation rules over the singular , united realm of spirit .
In the ‘ normal ’ pentagram the spirit rules the flesh .
Jesus is seen as opposing Satan , and embodies the spiritual principle of unity .
So what are we to make of the actual historical beliefs and practices of the followers of these two figures ?
Christianity has turned out to be militantly dualistic , denying the body and ravaging the Earth , glorifying the ‘ spirit ’ and longing for some united heavenly kingdom .
And Satanists , while obviously prioritising flesh over spirit , ego over collectivity , are inevitably involved in many practices which approach Dionysian revelry , serving to abolish individual distinction .
Also , their emphasis on living for the moment instead of “ spiritual pipe - dreams ” could be seen to destroy the future - fixation of profane time , following Nietzsche into a whole - hearted immersion in the eternal present .
Our problems in analysing these contradictions betray our present evolutionary and cultural problems .
In looking at the splitting of Dionysus , we ’re seeing the mythical reflections of a phase in the development of the human species where the increase of city - dwelling and changes in agriculture & economics began to erode our bond with the rest of the biosphere .
City walls are the rigidification of human ego - barriers writ large .
“ When Christians first distinguished themselves from pagans , the word ‘ pagan ’ meant ‘ country - dweller ’ .
For the first centres of Christianity in the Roman Empire were the great cities — Antioch , Corinth , Alexandria , and Rome itself . ” ( Alan Watts , Nature , Man & Woman )
In our quest to urbanize our existence , to become as independent as possible from the less comfortable and benign aspects of nature , we have become lost in a mire of confusion .
Witness Blake ’s disgust at the industrial revolution in his phrase “ dark Satanic Mills ” , and the fact that most of the mill owners were probably devout Christians .
Protestantism has been intimately linked to the rise of capitalism by psychoanalytical historians ; Satanists advocate material power .
A church in Coventry recently held a service in thanks for the car industry ; and Jesus advocated shunning possessions and said rich people would have a bloody hard time getting into heaven .
Such confusion seems to be the price for living under the sway of false dichotomies like Jesus / Satan , spirit / matter , collective / individual , intellect / instinct .
Culture and civilization are inseparable from material technologies , and things are no less confused in the technophile / Luddite debate .
The real dichotomy to be tackled here is that of harmonious / unharmonious technology .
Do our tools help us achieve our desires , or do they become our desires ?
Do you browse the web to kill time and boredom , like TV , or use it to help you do what you want to do in the real world ?
Is our technology harmonious with nature ?
In most cases today , the answer is a painful no .
We have lost the vision of the first grand tool - using age of humanity , the Neolithic , where culture , agriculture and technology were used to work with and intensify the natural environment .
Reclamation
Our Satanic genealogy has so far reached the figure of Dionysus , and if we delve further back , we find his roots in the pan-European Neolithic worship of the Great Goddess .
In Greek myth , Dionysus ’ mother is identified as Semele , a mortal .
She was , however , sometimes equated with Ge , the Thracian form of the Earth Goddess Gaia .
The male god , the primeval Dionysus , is saturated with a meaning closely related to that of the Great Goddess in her aspect of the Virgin Nature Goddess and Vegetation Goddess .
All are gods of nature ’s life cycle , concerned with the problem of death and regeneration , and all were worshipped as symbols of exuberant life .
Marija Gimbutas , The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe
Now I shall lose the interest of yet more die - hard Satanists .
I think it ’s possible to trace most of Satan ’s aspects and characteristics back to the Neolithic ( and perhaps Palaeolithic ) Great Goddess .
It ’s true that if you gathered all available books on Goddess worship together , the vast majority of them — in their style , typography , illustrations and attitude — would probably be … well , twee .
It ’s obvious why the figure of the Goddess is largely consigned to the realm of New Age Pap ; but I think a serious , unromantic investigation of the religious and mythical complex termed ‘ the Goddess ’ will uncover something a lot more challenging , vital and useful than the trite New Age - isms we ’re usually presented with .
This horned aspect is thought by some researchers to derive from the ‘ horns ’ of the womb , the Fallopian tubes — the form of which can potentially be propriocepted , or felt internally , in states of heightened consciousness ( see The Wise Wound by Penelope Shuttle & Peter Redgrove ) .
The Neolithic Goddess , like Satan , was invariably horned ; the ox was one of her most revered forms .
Being associated with the Earth itself she was often a chthonic ( underworld ) Goddess , this aspect entering Greek mythology in the story of Demeter and Persephone .
It ’s worth noting that Heraclitus once said that Dionysus was another name for Hades , lord of the underworld .
The whole chthonic goddess & son complex is the basis for our image of Satan ruling over a subterranean Hell .
Another strong link between the Goddess and Satan is the serpent .
The serpent in Genesis ’ Garden of Eden is often associated with Satan , and Christianity usually extends this association to all snakes .
The snake was , along with the ox , the animal most frequently associated with the Neolithic Goddess .
The spiral , often symbolizing a coiled serpent , is one of the most common Goddess symbols .
Archaic serpent myths from around the world are far too numerous to detail here .
However , one extremely early myth ( perhaps the earliest ) , which detours us to an extremely bizarre connection with Christianity , is well worth going into .
In his book Blood Relations , anthropologist Chris Knight proposes that human culture was the result of early female Homo sapiens synchronizing their menstrual cycles .
This collectivity , he argues , empowered them to periodically ‘ sex strike ’ during menstruation — females basically refused sex with their partners ( but possibly had menstrual sex with male kin ) until the men went hunting and brought back enough meat to feed them and their children .
The full thesis is persuasive but very complex .
It is enough for now to note that the hypothesized collective act of female synchrony was achieved through tidal and lunar observances , utilizing these natural , universal cycles with which widespread groups of women could ‘ phase - lock ’ and harmonize their own blood cycles .
In the Australian Aboriginal myths of the Rainbow Snake , and its associations with menstruation , water , the moon and women , there is widespread acknowledgement that this ‘ cosmic serpent ’ ( often androgynous ) originally gave women power .
Knight ’s key argument is that this power is the power to periodically unite in saying ‘ no ’ to sex , to initiate sexual - political change ( the Snake symbolizes the united body of ‘ flowing ’ women ) .
At the same time , it is the powers of shamanism and magic , which Knight sees as evolving as a result of the first ‘ proto - cultural ’ groups of humans in Africa dispersing inland , away from their coastal origins .
The females , robbed of the tide as one of their main cyclic guides , evolved moon - scheduled ritual activities — and thus symbolic culture — to synchronize social , psychic and bodily rhythms .
“ The link of blood and magick can also be found in the German word for ‘ sorceror ’ , which is ‘ zauberer ’ .
The word goes back to OHG Zaubar , MD Tover , OE Teâfor …
All three words mean ‘ red colour , red ochre , to colour in red ’ ! ” ( Jan Fries , Helrunar )
Somewhere along the line , as the myths and practices of many surviving hunter - gatherer tribes testify , this power was appropriated by men .
Knight sees male initiation ceremonies involving cutting the penis or arm ( found among Australian Aborigines and other indigenous cultures ) , together with the existence of extreme menstrual taboos , as evidence for a male take - over of female ritual power .
One male Aborigine , speaking of their all - male rituals , told C.H. Berndt that “ all the Dreaming business came out of women — everything ; only men take ‘ picture ’ for that Julunggul [ i.e. men make an artificial reproduction of the Snake ] .
In the beginning we had nothing ; because men had been doing nothing ; we took these things from women . ”
The surviving Snake myths , propagated by all - male initiation societies , portray the Snake as threatening to women .
Part of this threat is derived from myths that describe the Snake swallowing women ; Knight feels that this once symbolized the power of synchronized menstruation to unite women , together ‘ in the belly of the Snake ’ .
Male initiation societies utilizing the Snake mythology may see this devouring serpent as somewhat threatening , but still desire the womb - return , unity and rebirth of being swallowed .
Much as Jonah is willingly cast into the sea to be swallowed , then vomited out by the “ great fish ” prepared for him by the Lord God .
Knight finds hard evidence of similar ‘ Rainbow Snake ’ myths across Africa and South America , all related closely to tides , rain , floods , menstruation and lunar cycles .
The myths perpetuate these associations , but are often configured to make women see the Snake as a threat .
There are some tribes , however , whose women still draw power from the Snake , and celebrate it in menstrual rites .
Knight also interprets the myriad ‘ dragon ’ ( i.e. mythical serpent - beast ) legends as remnants of this archaic mythical conception of women ’s culture - forming menstrual synchrony , and of the male take - over .
Many dragon myths speak of many - headed beasts ( the Hydra for instance ) , and this is possibly an echo of the menstrual Snake which comprised many women in unison .
Of course the classic dragon tale , across the world , says that valiant men rescue maidens from its clutches , destroy it , and gain power .
Given Knight ’s theories , there could be no clearer mythical equivalent of a male usurpation of female power : overcoming a reptilian representation of their blood - unity and menstrual ritual potency .
Now , let ’s have a look at the Holy Bible .
Turn to Revelations 12 :
And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars :
And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered .
And there appeared another great wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
. . .
[ She gives birth to a sort of second Christ , and flees into the wilderness .
Michael casts the dragon out of heaven .
The dragon persecutes the woman , who is given eagle wings to escape . ]
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood .
[ Aboriginal Rainbow
Snake myths are connected with great floods in Australia ’s past . ]
Very strange to find such a twisted distortion of what may be a primal human myth of the beginning ( of culture ) in the ravings of a religious visionary supposedly being granted a glimpse of the end .
This vision corresponds in some way to the frequent ‘ male - appropriation ’ myths of modern hunter - gatherers : in depicting the dragon / serpent as threatening to a woman ; and in the statement that the denizens of heaven “ overcame him by the blood of the Lamb ” ( 12:11 ) .
The Lamb is Christ , and Christ is a man who bled from his arms ( and , like all Jewish men , he presumably bled from his genitals , when he was circumcised as a child ) .
Interestingly , one New Age commentator on Revelations believes that because the many - headed dragon “ has several autonomous decision - making centers , [ it ] is therefore the very epitome of disorganization , of centrifugal or dispersive forces . ”
( F. Aster Barnwell , Meditations on the Apocalypse ) Think back to what Knight believes the original Rainbow Serpent represents , and compare .
And who was this blood - red , water - spewing , many - headed dragon ?
Saint John the Divine tells us that he was “ that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan… ” .
A day or so after making this Rainbow Snake - Dragon - Satan link , I started reading The Wise Wound by Penelope Shuttle and Peter Redgrove .
They take a Jungian approach to the few systematic instances of menstruating women ’s dreams being recorded .
Apparently , some women ’s dreams at this time contain strong male figures , often threatening or sinister .
Shuttle & Redgrove ’s idea is that menstruation can be a time of heightened sexuality and departure from conventions for women , hence its widespread repression and extreme taboo status .
They see the appearance of a compelling male figure in menstrual dreams as the appearance of the animus , a Jungian word for the masculine principle in women .
Talking about the repression of menstruation leading to a “ negative animus ” , they say : “ If the woman ’s menstruation is despised , that is , a deep instinctual process in her is ignored or hated , then its spirit will return with all the evolutionary power of those instinctual processes that grew us and continue to energize our physical being .
You could say in this way that the Christian Devil was a representation of the animus of the menstruating woman , in so far as the Christian ethic has Satanized woman and her natural powers . ”
I want to follow these Goddess / Serpent / Devil associations now by focusing on one specific place ( which will also lead us to other areas I ’m interested in ) : Avebury in Wiltshire , with its rich psychogeography and densely inter-related complex of Neolithic monuments .
Michael Dames has analysed the Avebury monuments , synthesizing archaeology , folklore & ethnography , to build a vision of a harmonious cycle of structures embedded in the local geography .
They form a ritual landscape which reflects the cyclic narrative of the seasons and of human life .
The monuments are seen to celebrate and embody the Great Goddess , conceived in the pervasive form of the Triple Goddess : Maiden , Mother & Crone .
( Being three multiplied by itself , the number nine is frequently given a high status in Goddess - based religions .
It seems no coincidence that modern Satanism has adopted this as its central number . )
The massive Avebury henge is approached from the south and west by two long , slightly winding stone avenues .
Dames ’ contention is that these two avenues are processional serpentine pathways by which young men and women approached the henge for marriage and consummation ceremonies .
The men ’s Beckhampton avenue , to the west , is largely destroyed .
It seems significant , though , that the name Beckhampton derives from the Old English word meaning ‘ back ’ .
Dames relates this to the spine , and to Tantric beliefs in the raising of the Kundalini serpent energy from the base of the spine .
Much more evidence survives in relation to the partly intact West Kennet avenue , beginning at the Sanctuary ( the name for the remains of a circular wooden temple at the southern foot of Waden Hill ) .
Comparisons with contemporary Neolithic symbolism and ethnographic studies show that the Sanctuary ( corresponding to the springtime Maiden ) was probably a site for the initiation of young girls reaching puberty .
This conjecture , along with the proposed serpentine nature of the processional avenue leading to consummation in the henge , is supported by Chris Knight ’s research .
Aboriginal mythology equates the Rainbow Snake with the ritual dance through which women collectively synchronize their menstrual periods ( or with which men are united in blood - letting initiatory rituals ) .
As the onset of a girl ’s puberty is signalled by their first menstruation , Dames ’ theories about the function of the Sanctuary and the symbolic serpentine nature of the West Kennet avenue stand on quite firm mythical ground .
At the henge , the male and female snake - avenues conjoin .
Dames argues that the so - called ‘ D ’ feature within the southernmost of the two stone circles inside the henge is a representation of the tip of the phallic Beckhampton avenue snake entering the henge .
This is ‘ swallowed ’ by the females ’
West Kennet snake , whose gaping jaws may be seen to be symbolized by the southeast and southwest quadrants of the henge , the actual stones representing its teeth .
The dual sexual symbolism of the serpent — penetrator and devourer — is not lost on Dames .
He speaks of the Beckhampton avenue ’s “ commitment to bisexuality ” as it approaches ritual sexual union in the henge ; we ’ll return to his androgynous Avebury Goddess later .
The vast stone standing at the point where the West Kennet avenue joins the henge is commonly known as the Devil ’s Chair .
Also in the Avebury area we have the Devil ’s Den long barrow ; and there are too many caverns and Neolithic standing stones in the British Isles named after the Devil to catalogue here .
The demonisation of indigenous paganism that was such an integral part of Christianity ’s conquest of these islands is prolifically demonstrated in such folkloric names .
In 634 CE a Christian church was built up against the west bank of the Avebury henge .
On its twelfth - century font is depicted a bishop , armed with a spiked crozier and a Bible , fending off two serpentine dragons .
However , the battle waged against the powerful chthonic forces of nature glorified in the Avebury monuments was n’t some abstract war of symbols .
In the fourteenth century most of the stones in the southwest quadrant of the henge were destroyed by Christian authorities trying to eradicate the many “ superstitions and questionable practices ” still connected with the stones .
These bastards destroyed part of our heritage , in the name of Jesus .
In Dames ’ ritual landscape cycle we move from the henge southwards to the awe - inspiring Silbury Hill , a flat - topped conical mound of earth which stands as the largest man-made Neolithic structure in Europe .
Known to have been built progressively over many years , added to each August ( harvest time ) , it seems likely that this was the Neolithics ’ vision of the pregnant Earth Goddess made flesh .
Natural breast - and belly - like hills and mounds were commonly worshipped in many archaic cultures , but the emergence of agriculture signified the rising importance in human participation in nature .
Silbury Hill — the Mother Goddess labouring to give birth to the year ’s crops — is a monumental testament to a culture whose technology still harmonized with nature , working mythically and practically at precisely the same time .
Excavations have revealed that at the core of Silbury lies a circular wattle fence and stacked layers of turf forming an inner mound .
The wattle fence has exactly the same diameter as the Sanctuary , and most projected reconstructions of the wooden temple at the Sanctuary reveal it to be identical in size and form to the inner Silbury mound .
Silbury , then , is a fractal reflection of the Sanctuary , which is replicated within and then magnified eight times in the total mass of the Silbury mound .
The springtime Maiden has matured into the life - giving Mother of the harvest .
A careful study of Dames ’ investigations into the harmonic fractal resonances within the Avebury complex ( all monuments being based around natural units of measurement taken from the springs feeding into the revered River Kennet ) is capable of pushing the rational mind beyond itself into a deep , awe - full respect for the powerful visionary precision of this ‘ primitive ’ culture .
Of course , being the most provocatively sensuous and voluptuous of all the Avebury monuments ( go there ! ) , Silbury failed to escape the demonisation of Christian folklore .
There is a legend that the Devil was once on his way to attack Marlborough ( just east of Avebury ) by dumping an apron , or spade full of dirt on the town .
The bishop of Marlborough apparently stopped him at the last minute ; the Devil dropped his load , and Silbury Hill was formed .
The last monument in the cycle , before it completes a total gyration and feeds back into itself at the Sanctuary , is the West Kennet long barrow .
It is located just southeast from Silbury and almost due east from the Sanctuary .
This multiple burial chamber is the Goddess in winter : the Crone , the death - dealing Dark Goddess found ( and so often repressed ) in many religions .
The barrow is constructed — like other European Neolithic burial chambers — to render yet another form of the Goddess ’ body .
You go in through her stone vulva , and enter a small corridor with five small adjoining womb - tomb chambers .
Despite its belief that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will automatically transport his followers to an eternal realm of happiness , love & old friends on dying , Christianity is terrified of death .
Most systems of belief promoting a simplistic , personal and linear form of immortality are — they deny death .
“ Hell , Luther said , is not a place , but is the experience of death , and Luther ’s devil is ultimately personified death . ” ( Norman O. Brown , Life Against Death )
Again we see that Christianity has ruptured , repressed & demonised the cyclic processes of nature .
To cultures harmonized with the seasonal rounds , death precedes life just as death follows life .
The Avebury cycle , where each distinct monument participates in the unified ritual landscape , suggests a culture where the principle of division has not yet been separated from the principle of unity ; death is part of life .
The barrow was built around 3250 BCE , and remained open until around 2600 BCE , when a huge stone forecourt was erected , and the chambers were packed with a mass of chalk rubble , organic material , and bits of bone and pottery ( resembling the chalk , soil and vegetable layering found in the core of Silbury , whose foundations are contemporary to the sealing of the barrow ) .
During its ‘ active ’ time , the barrow was almost certainly used for ritual as well as burial purposes .
Dames points out that “ the belief that the living can find meaning and reality within putrefying chaos was once widespread ” , and rightly notes the possible parallels with Tantric practices .
The loving Goddess of Creation has another face .
As she brings man into time and his world , she also removes him from it .
So she is his destroyer as well .
No -one can be a successful Tantrika unless he has faced up to this reality , and assimilated it into his image of the nature of the Goddess .
There are many rituals , some of them sexual , carried out among the corpses in real ( or symbolic ) cremation - grounds , which bring this necessity forcibly home to the practising Tantrika .
There , in the red light of funeral pyres , as jackals and crows scatter and crunch the bones , he confronts the dissolution of all he holds dear in life .
Philip Rawson , Tantra : The Indian Cult of Ecstasy
We can never know the exact nature of the rites enacted in the West Kennet long barrow , but many of skulls and thigh bones from the dead buried there were found to be absent .
The obvious explanation for this is that they were used in Neolithic rituals , probably at the nearby causewayed camp on Windmill Hill , northwest from the henge , where many individual skulls were found .
Dames notes that “ the widespread use of skull and femur in fertility rites was maintained down to classical times , when the rotting flesh fell off to reveal the clean tools of a new sexuality , with skull acting as female container , encompassing the thigh bone - phallus . ”
I ’m also reminded of the use of skulls and thigh bones in various ‘ left - hand path ’ ( i.e. frowned upon ) cultic practices in Tibet .
It ’s clear that any study of Neolithic Goddess - orientated cultures will fruitfully profit from comparisons with non-mainstream Asian religious beliefs .
“ Although there is very little information concerning the megalithic monuments of the West , Hindu texts contain the entire ritual for setting them up , and for the orientation of sanctuaries , etc .
All studies on European prehistoric religions should thus be based on the Indian documents available . ”
( Alain Daniélou , Gods of Love and Ecstasy )
The Snake Goddess
A few years ago , shortly after I had become interested in paganism , but well before I began any of the above research , I had a very bizarre dream .
I dreamt I was an actor in the process of making a film whose director was a very sinister and shadowy figure .
There was an unnerving atmosphere on the set , and I kept finding small , partially hidden pentagrams and other similar symbols — sewn into the undersides of cushions and so on .
I became convinced that the script and set were devised so that the specific motions and gestures the unwitting cast made during filming would have the equivalent effect of a ritual to evoke the Devil .
In the half - dream hypnopompic state before fully waking up , I had the distinct sensation of physical pressure around my anus .
Dream logic convinced me that this was in fact Satan .
I was vaguely disturbed during the following day , but the dream quickly faded into the past .
In The Wise Wound , Shuttle & Redgrove investigate the possibility that menstrual cycles have the potential to be affected by lunar cycles in that the pineal gland , which may also affect sexual development , can sense subliminal changes in light .
Noting its traditional association with the ‘ third eye ’ of inner visions , they speculate that “ Just as our visible eyes obtain visual information from the outer world , so does our invisible third eye , the pineal , convert into visual images experiences from within the body .
This argument is supported by painstaking evidence . ”
Earlier this year , I was writing something about the idea that dreams and vision states are in fact the perceptual flip - side to interior bodily sensations .
The two realms can be seen as two different ‘ channels of perception ’ conveying information about the interior processes of the human organism , from visceral energy streams to the sub - molecular goings - on in the brain .
Going to sleep one night , having just finished the section on this particular subject , I had a hypnagogic experience that seemed to confirm my theory , and shed revealing light on the dream of the Devil a couple of years before .
I was in a pretty low state , and half - heartedly ( pathetically actually ) called on the Earth Goddess to visit me in my dreams that night .
Soon after , I found myself getting up from the bed and walking across my room .
I was suddenly overpowered by incredibly intense body sensations , and felt my mind ‘ blacking out ’ as if I was fainting .
I instinctively ‘ knew ’ that this was the power of the Goddess overtaking me , and tried hard to surrender to it as I fell down ( ‘ trying hard ’ in these situations is a classic mistake ! ) .
I found myself lying on the floor , a huge lump obscuring my vision in my right eye .
I heard the woman who lives across the hall from me trying to get in .
My fall must have been loud , I thought .
I took the lump on the right side of my face to be a result of the fall , and desperately tried to work out how I could get up to open the door and let the woman in .
I could n’t move , and feared that I ’d really injured myself .
At the same time I became aware of rattling noises in my kitchen .
There was a distinctly female presence in there .
Then I snapped out of it — I had been half - dreaming .
I was still in my bed , and the ‘ lump ’ was a bit of the duvet against my face .
I instantly connected the two instances of female presence , one seemingly trying to help me , with my vague plea to the Goddess .
Suddenly , immense surges of energy began to flow around my body , intense and strangely familiar streamings that pushed me into a delicious and frighteningly precarious balance between waking and dreaming .
Then I felt pressure around my anus… and what followed can only really be described as being fucked by the , or at least a Goddess .
A stupendous thrust of energy rushed up me , and I was immediately propelled into a highly vivid and intense lucid dream .
I was flying high above a scintillatingly real landscape , a deep blue summer sky above me , a daytime sky yet dotted with stars .
Part of the subsequent dream involved fishing a demonic - looking pike out of a lake — this seemed to be the culmination of a series of intense dreams I had recently had about seeing fish swimming underwater .
The pike , once on land , turned into a cute brown seal .
I awoke from the dream after escaping from a very nasty situation by flying straight up through the building I was in , bursting through each floor successively and waking with a jolt on blasting out the top .
It did n’t take much meditating on all the sensations and symbols to realize I had almost certainly just experienced a bizarre manifestation of the Kundalini serpent energy .
Tantrism holds that the deities presiding over the base chakra are Brahman and Dakini — who is the red , menstruating goddess .
The Kundalini serpent is envisioned in traditional Tantric yoga as being a coiled - up ( spiral ) reservoir of normally untapped psychosomatic energy , stored in the Muladhara , or base chakra .
The base chakra is located in the perineum , just in front of the anus .
Kundalini is a goddess at the same time as being a spiral snake energy .
Kundalini Shakti is the female principle to Shiva ’s male principle in Tantra ’s erotic cosmology .
The goal of Tantric practice is to awaken the dormant snake Goddess through various yogic methods , causing her to surge up the body and ecstatically unite with Shiva at the highest chakra .
This rising can be seen clearly at either end of my dream ( and body ) — both in the energy thrust up me from my perineum just before sleeping , and in the climactic flight through the floors of a building , eventually out of the top , into waking consciousness .
The !
Kung , a southern African tribe , describe their entry into trance ( which they call ! kia ) in a way that strongly reflects Kundalini experiences .
They believe that a primal supernatural potency , n/um , resides in the pit of the stomach or the base of the spine .
Frenetic dancing causes the n/um to ‘ boil ’ , and it ascends the body until it peaks in or near the skull ?
inducing full ! kia , and initiating shamanic soul - flight .
It is interesting that the social and ritual life of the !
Kung has retained one of the most vivid emphases on menstrual puberty rites known .
Also , they believe that the power of n/um is most efficiently transferred via the sense of smell .
In Tantra , the Muladhara chakra is associated with this sense .
Many insights ( and a tremendous feeling of well - being ) flooded through as a result of my Kundalini dream .
Firstly , there was the gnostic confirmation of my theories about Satan being ( for me at least ) a demonised remnant of a primal serpentine Goddess .
My dream of a few years ago was undoubtedly the same Kundalini phenomenon , distorted by the Christian cosmology virus , and undeveloped .
It seemed to be a ‘ confirmation ’ , rather than being an experience induced by my research , because the Kundalini dream reflected so precisely back onto a dream I had long before any of my research began .
And at the time of the second dream , although I had been looking into Goddess myths , I had not really looked at Kundalini .
The fish symbolism seemed to flesh out my feeling that the Kundalini phenomenon is the prime model for looking at this experience .
In Indian mythology , the fish symbolizes Kundalini ’s most primitive form .
Interestingly , early Christians represented Jesus ( eternal opponent of the serpent Satan ) with a fish symbol .
Jesus opposes fish to serpents in Matthew 7:10 — perhaps yet another example of divisive Christian mythologizing .
Kundalini has been connected by Gene Kieffer ( a president of the Kundalini Research Institute in New York ) to the UFO contact experience , after personal psychic activity that involved both phenomena .
This connection and the sensations I experienced of pressure around the anus ( or nearby perineum ) inevitably brought to mind the infamous reports from supposed UFO ‘ abductees ’ , who believe themselves to have been improperly probed up the arse by bug - eyed scientists from other planets .
Are we looking here at spontaneous Kundalini vision states , either distorted through confusion or overlaid with a space - age clinical myth - structure ?
My current belief that visions and the body ’s energy processes are complementary has given me a rough rule of thumb in understanding mythology : all the most resonant and meaningful myths will reflect some aspect of biology and evolution .
As Shuttle and Redgrove say in The Wise Wound , “ mythology and physiology are only two sides of the same thing , which is alive . ”
Of course , evolutionary theory and the physical sciences can be seen as yet another myth - structure ; and seen in this way they should , if they are to relate to the general human experience of life , somehow echo the more primeval and recurrent mythologies and archetypes of our cultural ancestry .
The idea that the Kundalini serpent , which ascends the spinal column , is the psychosomatic evolutionary force in the human body , can be seen to relate to the fact that we are vertebrates .
Our common evolutionary inheritance , along with all mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fishes , is that we have a backbone .
We have all physically relived the evolutionary journey of bodily mutation as we gestated in our mother ’s wombs .
Human embryos , in their earliest stages of development , are successively indistinguishable from fish , reptile , bird and other mammal embryos — at one stage , recognizable gills emerge , and then atrophy .
Our individual lives begin in the amniotic ocean of the womb .
Organic life on Earth began in the oceans .
And humanity itself may have emerged from a partial return to the ocean .
Many anthropologists believe that humans evolved on the shores of east Africa , as hominid apes returned to a semi-aquatic lifestyle .
This is seen to account for our hairless bodies , the layer of buoyant fat beneath our skin , and possibly our upright posture ( a distinct advantage if you ’re trying to keep breathing whilst wading through deep waters ) .
It seems quite fitting that Indian mythology should symbolize evolutionary power through the snake , the skeleton of which is basically a backbone , and the fish , the original spine , which still inhabits life ’s womb .
“ In the human body , the strait gate leading to the earth - centre , or snake goddess , is the anus . ” ( Alain Daniélou , Gods of Love and Ecstasy )
Any form of anal stimulation contains the possibility of ecstatic spiritual experience .
Phil Hine has pointed out that Ramakrishna experienced Samadhi whilst having a dump on more than one occasion , and this is interesting in relation to Martin Luther ’s so - called Thurmerlebnis ( “ experience in the tower ” ) , a revelation about faith that was to inaugurate Protestant theology .
The ‘ tower ’ was where the toilet was located in Luther ’s Wittenburg monastery .
“ This knowledge the Holy Spirit gave me on the privy in the tower . ” ( Luther )
In his analysis of Protestantism in Life Against Death , Norman Brown hones in on the centrality of the Devil to Luther ’s theology , and on the ‘ anality ’ ( a Freudian term needing no explanation , for once ) of the Devil .
He documents Luther ’s numerous associations of the Devil with ‘ filth ’ , ‘ blackness ’ and foul odours , and notes his methods of counter - attack to the Devil ’s assaults — at one revealing point he threatens to “ throw him into my anus , where he belongs . ”
These scraps of information , the traditional location of the base chakra , and my intuition that Satan may be related back through history to a primeval serpent goddess , seem to be no coincidence .
Many traditions , from male Aboriginal initiation ceremonies to Aleister Crowley ’s magick , recognize the power of sodomy to elicit altered states of consciousness , but this is mostly ignored in our own culture due to the extreme taboo associated with anal eroticism ( and with altered states themselves ) .
This taboo is clear in homophobia , but is equally present in heterosexuality .
Often , sodomy is not merely tabooed , but actually illegal — such is the continuing power of old Judeo - Christian restrictions over modern secular prohibitions .
Perhaps ( as far as our own culture is concerned ) the strength of the taboo against sodomy , and not necessarily the physical act in itself , accounts for its potential to induce powerful spiritual experiences .
Spirituality is , at heart , a breakthrough into a wider realm of consciousness , and is thus frequently associated ( as in Tantra , Chaos Magick and Satanism ) with breaking the conventions and laws that inevitably shape consciousness .
The danger here , as ever , is that of becoming obsessed with the breaking of a single restriction .
Once a restriction is overcome , new and different restrictions may fall into place .
For instance , a Satanist who has endeavoured to break the traditional Christian taboo against rational self - interest and ego - gratification may find him or herself liberated in many ways .
Eventually , though , this process of liberation may restrict that person from expressing spontaneous selflessness .
The path of liberation has no end .
Sodomy , then , may well be a powerful step on the path of spiritual and sexual liberation , but rigid correlations and associations may eventually become obstacles .
Regarding the association of the base chakra with the anus , Phil Hine has cautioned against the idea that chakras , or energy centres , have literal physical locations : “ I ’m working on a body - alchemy centred approach to the chakras at the moment , and the muladhra , for me , relates to one ’s physical sensation of the here & now .
A great deal is made of the muladhra being the ‘ seat ’ of Kundalini - shakti — but again , too many people have interpreted Kundalini stuff in terms of getting away from the body , towards some kind of rarified ‘ spiritual ’ state .
My own feeling is that the Tantric perspective is less about ‘ awakening kundalini ’ as though it were something static , and more about ‘ becoming aware ’ of kundalini ’s living presence in , and around us .
This necessitates , of course , a change in how we perceive ourselves , and the world we are enmeshed in . ” ( personal correspondence )
Hine ’s first ‘ Kundalini ’ experience involved an influx of energy coming down his body .
This ‘ contradiction ’ of the traditional experience can also be seen in Reichian therapy .
Wilhelm Reich ’s theory of bodily ‘ armour ’ ( rigidified musculature , seen to be arranged in sections like the head , throat , chest , etc. ) corresponds well with the chakra system .
But in opposition to the yogic assertion that one must work from the bottom up when opening the chakras , Reich advised therapists to work from the top down in undoing armour .
So , anal eroticism is merely one of many gateways to sexual and spiritual ecstasy .
And while individual proclivities and specific cultural circumstances channel erotic bodily energy through particular pathways , any broad overview must take into account a holistic view of the body .
The many ‘ maps ’ of the body , from the chakra system to Freud ’s anal , oral and genital organizations of sexual energy , are all ultimately limited .
The least limited map of bodily energy , the map under which all others may be subsumed , is that described by Freud as ‘ polymorphous perversity ’ and by mystics as ‘ oceanic consciousness ’ .
It is the chaotic , spontaneously self - organizing state a baby experiences before the narrower maps of its culture impose themselves on its body — and which anyone may experience in ecstatic release from cultural boundaries .
In Love ’s Body , Norman Brown has pointed out that the human body , in its deepest levels , is not as linear and static as our culture ’s vision of it suggests .
There is a profound interconnectedness and interpenetration at work .
The main component of our linear vision of the body is the divided polarity of the head and the groin , the brain and the genitals .
But …
“ The word cerebral is from the same root as Ceres , goddess of cereals , of growth and fertility ; the same root as cresco , to grow , and creo , to create .
[ Richard ]
Onians , archaeologist of language , who uncovers lost worlds of meaning , buried meanings , has dug up a prehistoric image of the body , according to which the head and genital intercommunicate via the spinal column : the gray matter of the brain , the spinal marrow , and the seminal fluid are all one identical substance , on tap in the genital and stored in the head . ”
An aspect of this ancient model can be seen to derive from agricultural fertility symbolism .
In corn , the seed is literally in the head of the plant .
Further , echoing our discussion of Kundalini , Brown remarks : “ The classic psychoanalytical equation , head = genital .
Displacement is not simply from below upwards ; nor does the truth lie in simply reducing it all downwards ( psychoanalytical reductionism ) .
The way up is the way down ; what psychoanalysis has discovered is that there is both a genitalization of the head and a cerebralization of the genital .
The shape of the physical body is a mystery , the inner dynamical shape , the real centers of energy and their interrelation … ”
The ‘ genital organization ’ of sexuality , where the genitals are the prime channel for sexual energy , is seen by both Freud and Reich as the ‘ healthy ’ , ‘ normal ’ mode of eroticism in humans .
Neither could conceive of a culture that could withstand the dissolution of this pattern and support groups of polymorphous humans , people for whom sexuality pervades their entire body , and thus their whole lives .
Evidently we ’re still a long way off from such a culture , but it seems important to recognize that anything less is a limitation of our potential for generating , using and exchanging energies .
Brown ’s refutation of purely genital sexuality applies equally to all forms of restricted eroticism or spirituality :
Erect is the shape of the genitally organized body ; the body crucified , the body dead or asleep ; the stiff .
The shape of the body awake , the shape of the resurrected body , is not vertical but perverse and polymorphous ; not a straight line but a circle ; in which the Sanctuary is in the Circumference , and every Minute Particular is Holy …
The Androgyne
Most striking , perhaps , is the sexual ambiguity of the goddess in my dream .
She was definitely a feminine presence , yet the rising snake - energy nature of her conjunction with my body put her in the cock - bearing masculine role .
This perception was given a bit of consensus validation when I visited a friend in Brighton , who I had n’t related my dream experience to .
He was skimming through another piece I wrote relating to the World Tree being seen as the spine up which the Kundalini serpent rises .
Out of the blue , he said , “ Oh yeah !
I had a Kundalini thing once when I was tripping , lying on the ground at a festival .
It was like being fucked by Mother Earth . ” ( I had related the Kundalini goddess to the Earth goddess myself — I had an strange experience of energy rushing up into me from the ground at a Dreadzone gig months before my dream .
Also , the base chakra , where the Kundalini serpent is traditionally seen to be coiled and dormant , is connected in the chakra system to the earth element . )
On the same journey , I visited a friend who I did tell my dream to .
He quickly related it to an experience he had had while on mushrooms next to a vast boulder in the place where the sarsens ( local sandstones ) used to build the Avebury henge were taken from .
He experienced it as a bolt of energy penetrating him from below , and nicely called it “ an amphetamine pessary up the psychic jaxxee . ”
The Goddess is an hermaphrodite .
In Neolithic thought , maleness was an aspect of the universal being , or vessel , which was regarded as female .
How could it be otherwise , if she truly encompassed everything ?
An architectural expression of this view is often found in Indian temples , where the overall form displays the feminine creative shape , based on the womb cell which contains the Lingam or male element .
Michael Dames , The Avebury Cycle
On Windmill Hill near Avebury , the oldest structure to be found is a cluster of 32 pits dug around 3700 BCE .
Dames points out that this pit grouping can be seen to form the outline of a goddess figure , squatting with upturned arms in the traditional stylization of a woman in labour .
The pit corresponding to the vulva is “ the largest and most fully furnished of all the pits ” , containing pottery , worked flint flakes , hammerstones , and sarsen balls similar to others found beneath Silbury .
However , if one does take the formation to be a squatting goddess , two of the central pits clearly form a penis shape .
A small chalk slab , known as the Windmill Hill amulet , found in an adjacent ditch , bears a design similar to the pit goddess , and also displays lines apparently describing a phallus .
Hermaphroditic motifs can be seen in two other carved chalk figurines found on the hill , and Dames also notes an androgynous Neolithic figurine found in Somerset and a Bronze Age goddess figure with a beard which was found in Denmark .
The heretical Knights Templar reputedly worshipped a ‘ demon ’ named Baphomet , most famously depicted by Eliphas Lévi as a goat - headed half - human deity , clearly male and yet breasted — with two intertwining snakes rising from his lap ( an important image in Tantra ) .
Baphomet was naturally taken by the Church to be Satan .
The Templars were accused of Devil worship and sodomy , and in the early fourteenth century King Philip IV of France had 54 of them arrested , tortured and killed on heresy charges .
Satan himself sometimes has shades of androgyny .
Phil Hine has informed me that Robertson Davies , in his collection of short stories High Spirits , holds Satan to be an hermaphrodite .
And the figure of the Devil in a seventeenth century drawing called Witchcraft ( left ) , by Claude - Françoise Menestrier , clearly has big dangling breasts .
Kucumatz is equivalent to the Mayan resurrection god Kuculcan and the Aztec culture - hero , moon - god and creator of humanity , Queztalcoatl ( both these names mean ‘ feathered serpent ’ ) .
Hunbatz Men , a modern Mayan daykeeper and ceremonial leader , has attempted to reconstruct the initiatory sciences of the ancient Maya in his book Secrets of Mayan Science / Religion .
In analysing etymology and surviving Mayan temples , he concludes that the Mayan religion was based around a system of seven energy centres , very similar to the Hindu chakras .
In both systems , the realization of a divine serpent - power is the goal .
In Tantra , it is Kundalini .
In Mayan tradition , the serpent is Kuculcan , but there is also the Mayan word k?ultanlilni — built up from k’u ( ‘ sacred ’ ) , k’ul ( ‘ coccyx ’ , the base of the spine ) , tan ( ‘ place ’ ) , lil ( ‘ vibration ’ ) , and ni ( ‘ nose ’ ) .
This amalgamated word embodies the Mayan equivalent of a yogic tradition .
Men also discusses a seven - headed serpent form carved on a monolith in Aparicio , Veracruz , Mexico ( below ) , and notes that the Buddha was bitten by a seven - headed serpent while in the river of initiation .
“ This serpent is called chapat in India .
Curiously , the people of the Yucatan , Mexico have the same word and it , too , refers to the seven - headed serpent , just as in India . ”
Dionysus , familiar to us here as precursor of the Jesus / Satan split and son of the Earth , was raised by women , often jeered at for his effeminate appearance , and referred to by a king in a text by Aeschylus as “ man-woman ” .
Alain Daniélou presents copious documentation , in his book Gods of Love and Ecstasy , that Dionysus is almost precisely equivalent to the Indian god Shiva — from whom we may also derive another traditional aspect of Satan , the trident , which is closely associated with Shiva .
One of Shiva ’s principal aspects is the Ardhanarâshvara , the hermaphrodite .
“ The Prime Cause may be conceived as masculine or feminine , as a god or a goddess , but in both cases it is an androgynous or transexual being . ”
In Siberian shamanism , as in many shamanic traditions , ritual bisexuality is held to be a sign of sacred power , of dealings with other worlds .
Daniélou also notes that the Etruscan prophetess wore a phallus attached to her girdle .
Kucumatz ( inset ) , the supreme god of the Quiché Indians , is androgynous , both father and mother of all creation .
Jewish mysticism elaborates on the creation myth of Genesis in the idea of the primordial androgynous being , Adam Kadmon , a perfect reflection of the divine ( see Genesis 1:27 —
” So God created man in his own image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them . ” ) .
S/ He is split into Adam and Eve to form humans .
Androgynous figures in mythology represent a state of diversity - in - unity and unity - in - diversity that transcends the apparent opposition of sexes and genders .
They are vivid , bodily images of a recurrent spiritual impulse to unite , but not leave behind the ecstatic interplay of opposites — without which unity would be a bland mess , with no contrasts , dynamism or fun .
This impulse can be seen more abstractly in the Taoist yin -yang symbol , and the coincidentia oppositorum , or union of opposites , in medieval alchemy .
Referring to androgynous motifs in mythology , Mircea Éliade says that this “ nostalgia for primordial completeness . . . is found almost everywhere in the archaic world . ”
So what does this mean for us ?
A recognition that , potentially at least , gender is less a barrier than a permeable membrane ( to paraphrase Carol J. Clover in Men , Women & Chainsaws ) , and that this membrane may be a gateway to magickal consciousness .
Whatever the sexual orientation involved , truly ecstatic sex ( ritualized or not ) can lead to a psychic intertwining and transmutation of sexual identities .
Even in ( or maybe especially in ) the exploration of the extremities of sexual difference , this potential may emerge .
As Chris Hyatt says , opposites taken to their extremes become one .
Or — as in the yin -yang symbol , where at the extreme of dark yin we find light yang emerging , and vice versa — the opposites become each other .
“ If no attempt is made to induce the orgasm by bodily motion , the interpenetration of the sexual centres becomes a channel of the most vivid psychic interchange .
While neither partner is working to make anything happen , both surrender themselves completely to whatever the process itself may feel like doing .
The sense of identity with the other becomes peculiarly intense , though it is rather as if a new identity were formed between them with a life of its own . ”
( Alan Watts , Nature , Man & Woman )
I once went to a talk by two practising process - oriented psychotherapists ( therapy based on the work of Arnold Mindell ) , and the woman there responded to a question about Freud by deriding his ‘ oppressive ’ theory of ‘ penis - envy ’ , the idea that women are all screwed up because they have n’t got that all - important cock .
Later in the talk she got round to talking about sexual experimentation , and expressed tingling excitement about the possibilities raised by strap - on dildos .
Now , I think Freud was pretty ridiculous in a lot of his thinking — but not always because he was necessarily wrong , just distorted and one - sided .
The pendulum ’s swung right across to the other side in many feminist circles , where ‘ penis - envy ’ is refuted because it ’s ‘ oppressive ’ , and then men ’s ‘ womb - envy ’ or ‘ menstrual - envy ’ is given as an explanation for why men are all screwed up .
Hang on !
Learn from the androgyne .
Maybe both these ‘ envies ’ exist .
And maybe we can ditch that word ‘ envy ’ , and all its associations with eternal frustration .
Both Freud and the fundamentalist feminists base their theories on the supposedly unchangeable biological foundation of our sex .
But these immutable biological ‘ envy ’ theories just seem to me to be signs of a lack of imagination .
Change ‘ envy ’ to ‘ desire ’ and cross - dressing or role - playing may be sufficient to transcend biology , for a time , with enough imaginative energy .
Strap - on dildos for women and arses in men need a little less imagination .
Still further , there are the presently available surgical techniques of transexualism .
And if the permanence of this step scares you off , perhaps soon the intelligent and creative application of new technologies , such as virtual reality or nanotech biomechanics , could offer us unlimited exploration of our inherent sexual plasticity and mutability .
Flesh
It is evident that certain rites and practices of ancient Shivaism or Dionysism , such as human sacrifices , could not be contemplated nowadays .
Perhaps I should have avoided mentioning them , as they could easily be used as a pretext for rejecting the whole of Shivaite concepts , but , in my opinion , it was necessary to do so because they reflect tendencies of the human being and aspects of the nature of the world , which it would be imprudent to ignore .
They form part of our collective unconscious and risk being manifested in perverse ways if we are afraid to face up to them .
Alain Daniélou , The Gods of Love and Ecstasy
Going right back to where we started , let ’s recall that the primary manifestation of the modern Church ’s concern with the Devil is its fantasy of rampaging Satanists or pagans sacrificing animals and children to the Dark Lord .
Modern human sacrifice is largely a myth ; however , I see no reason for doubting that animal sacrifices occur , though not necessarily just by ‘ Satanists ’ ( note Anton LaVey ’s 10th Satanic Rule : “ Do not kill non - human animals unless attacked or for your food . ” ) .
Almost all religions have a deep , intrinsic history of animal sacrifice , and some still practice it .
The Massai of Kenya and Tanzania , though nominally Christian , continue to practice blood sacrifice .
So do followers of Santeria , a combination of African religion and Christian symbolism , in the States .
They regularly ignore U.S. laws ( which prohibit the killing of animals except in licensed butcheries and for animal experimentation ) in order to practice their religion .
The chief contemporary practitioners of ritual sacrifice seem to be Christians themselves , who slaughter and eat tens of millions of turkeys every year as part of their celebrations of the birth of their god .
This myth is cleverly played upon in the early seventies horror film The Wicker Man , which on the surface seems to be a standard cash - in on these lingering suspicions about paganism .
However , the way the Christian copper ( who is eventually burnt ) is lured into the trap is revealing .
It ’s only because he ’s so repressed and suspicious of pagans that he falls for the bait .
He comes to the island and is convinced that a ‘ missing ’ girl is going to be sacrificed — what else would these phallus - worshipping heathens who cavort naked around bonfires be up to ?
All the ‘ evidence ’ turns out to be carefully contrived to play upon his rampant Christian suspicions : the girl is part of the plot , he is trapped by his own projected fears , and sacrificed in a ritual for crop success .
If this was real life , of course , all the islanders should be up on conspiracy to murder .
As the piece of art that it is , the story works perfectly as a delicious example of poetic justice .
Human sacrifice also has a long history .
It seems to be the main element of Neolithic Goddess cultures that most modern popularisers of Goddess religions have neglected to deal with .
Joseph Campbell has said that “ human sacrifice is everywhere characteristic of the worship of the Goddess in the Neolithic sphere ” ; Avebury is no exception .
Dames details many instances of human sacrifice in Neolithic Avebury : a prehistoric urn full of human bones was found in the southern inner stone circle of the henge ; an adolescent male was found in the foetal position , with all bones broken , within the Sanctuary ; other young men have been found buried along the West Kennet avenue .
One was found with a thigh - bone jammed into his jaw — sexual / fertility symbolism which involves these sacrifices in one of the primary concerns of the Avebury monuments , the success of the crops .
Dames speculates that the sacrificial victims could have actually been honoured to play this part : “ For the victims , the opportunity to end their lives in physical incorporation with the Great Serpent [ the West Kennet avenue ] may have been regarded as an awesome privilege , an ultimate union with the godhead — son and parent united in divinity . ”
The overwhelming holism of the surviving monuments seems to suggest that life for these people may well have been so unified , and death so deeply intertwined with life in their psyches , that young men could have felt their death to be a privilege , an opportunity to spill their life - blood into the ground and magically give life to the crops and the community — as well as return to the womb of the Earth - Mother .

The idea of sacrifice , bloody or not , is at the heart of human religious life .
Its basis is surely the food chain — the interdependence of all life on all other life , the fact that nothing lives save by another ’s death .
Alain Daniélou has called blood sacrifice “ the sacralization of the alimentary function ” , that is , the ritualisation of killing and eating .
“ The whole universe is really only food and eater . ” ( Brihat Aranyaka Upanishad )
“ The world as sacrifice ; this world as food ; to be is to be eaten . ” ( Norman O. Brown , Love ’s Body )
If the world is conceived of as one divine body , the process of life is divine autophagy — self - eating .
It seems that all religious sacrifices may be derived from the recognition of this fact .
Most practices are distorted to a greater or lesser degree , but the original function of sacrifice was probably part of the human urge to intensify the processes of nature .
Vegetarianism and veganism do not negate the fact that life thrives on death — only an unmagickal , unholistic view of life would hold that plants are not living creatures like the rest of us .
And while modern technology makes vegetarianism viable for us all ( and meat - eating cruel , relying as it does on modern techniques of slaughter ) , the symbolism of sacrifice and blood are rooted in the consumption of animal flesh .
What do we actually mean by ‘ sacrifice ’ ?
The dictionary definition is “ the act of giving up something valued for the sake of something else more important or worthy . ”
Alan Watts says that it is an act which makes something holy ( sacer - facere ) , arguing that “ sacrifice is only accidentally associated with the cessation , death or mutilation of the offering because it was once supposed that , say , burning bulls on an altar was the only way of transporting them to heaven . ”
( Nature , Man & Woman )
This idea is used to stress that ‘ sacrificing ’ one ’s sexuality to God does not mean chastity , because if you ’re not fucking , there ’s nothing there to ‘ sacrifice ’ , or ‘ make holy ’ .
These two definitions , ‘ giving up ’ and ‘ making holy ’ , seem to be at odds — you ca n’t make your cake holy and eat it — until we look at Shivaite ( Shiva - worshipping ) practices that forbid anyone to eat any flesh that is not the result of a ritual sacrifice .
“ One should not eat the flesh of living beings without killing them oneself , i.e. , taking a conscious part in their slaughter and making the gods a party to it , since the world which they have created and uphold is itself a perpetual sacrifice . ” ( Daniélou )
In a system where “ the gods must be offered the first - fruits of the harvest , the first mouthful of all nourishment ” , this practice makes an offering — gives something up — as well as making the act ‘ holy ’ .
In killing for food in the name of Shiva , the sacrifice forms a ritual intensification of nature , of divine autophagy .
As in Dionysian rites , the animal is seen as a manifestation of the god , with whom the worshipper communes through the act of eating .
You are what you eat .
The pagan origins of the Christian communion should be plain .
“ Eating is the form of redemption .
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you . ” ( Brown )
The practice of Shivaites , of only eating what you yourself ritually kill , seems diametrically opposed to the systems of hunting and eating taboos anthropologists have discovered among hunter - gatherers .
Chris Knight postulates a primitive ‘ own - kill ’ rule : “ Culture starts not only with the incest taboo , but also with its economic counterpart in the form of a rule prohibiting hunters from eating their own kills . ”
One ’s ‘ own blood ’ , in both senses of blood lineage and totem animal blood , is forbidden .
This ‘ rule ’ , he argues , is demonstrated by the fact that their exist so many methods of getting around it .
Rules are there to be broken ; their boundaries , and thus the rules themselves , are defined by how they are circumscribed .
The ways of getting around this rule can be seen in its application only to a man ’s ‘ first kill ’ ; in tribes where you can eat your own kill provided you apologize to the animal ’s spirit ; and in customs where you symbolically offer your kill to someone else first , whether it ’s another person or a god .
Knight sees the latter as the basis of most ‘ sacrifice ’ .
His reason for postulating this ‘ rule ’ is that his model of the origins of human culture sees the first proto - human apes involved in an evolving system of menstrual , sexual , hunting and economic taboos .
We looked earlier at how Knight envisions culture as emerging from women synchronizing their menstrual periods .
Tied up to this is the idea that the time of menstruation , the dark moon , would be immediately followed by hunting trips , as the moon waxed .
Because proto - human females were more burdened by their offspring ( human infants take a lot longer to mature ) , they needed to secure a sure supply of food for themselves and their young .
In short , they needed to make damn sure the males did n’t go off hunting , scoff the lot while they ’re away , and only come back with scraps ( as often happens in groups of apes ) .
Knight believes that part of the women ’s menstrual ‘ sex - strike ’ ( against procreative , ‘ domestic ’ sex at least ) involved a growing system of associations between menstrual blood and the blood of game animals .
The taboo against ‘ domestic ’ sex during menstruation would be psychically linked to a taboo against eating raw , bloody flesh .
In Knight ’s model , the women control the fire hearth , and thus it is only through presenting their kills to the women that the men can have cooked flesh , free of the tabooed blood .
This way , food for the women and children is assured .
Survivals of this taboo system are found in most contemporary hunter - gatherer tribes .
To take one example , hunters of the Urubu tribe in the Amazonian basin may not bring deer into the village .
The hunter deposits his kill at the edge of the clearing , and sends a woman to get it .
The Urubu believe that “ a hunter who brought his own game into the village would be punished with a terrible fever and become kaù , crazy . ”
Californian Indians even have a special verb , pi’xwaq , which means “ to get sick from eating one ’s own killing ” .
Knight ’s model is interesting in that so many ecstatic nature - based religious cults directly contravene these postulated ‘ primeval taboos ’ .
“ Ancient Shivaite or Dionysiac ritual does not allow the cooking of the flesh of the animal victim , which had to be captured after a chase , torn apart and eaten raw . ” ( Daniélou )
If prohibitions against eating raw meat form part of the basis of human culture , these later ritual practices may be seen as counter - cultural forces .
They evolved during times when human life was beginning to be urbanized , and ‘ culture ’ was becoming something very alienated from nature .
Shivaism and Dionysism all stand against conventional civilization , and aim to ecstatically commune with the natural forces and spirits of the land .
Humans irrevocably evolved into cultural beings in eastern Africa long ago .
Some development beyond animal existence was obviously necessary for ‘ culture ’ to exist at all ; thus the raw / cooked , nature / culture , animal / human oppositions .
But when the rural / urban opposition arose , as the great cities of Europe , the Middle East and Asia formed , something was slowly lost .
Evolution was turned back on itself as human culture , a profound outgrowth of nature , began to isolate and alienate itself from its source .
“ The Dionysiac rite takes its followers back to a primitive stage , which is the antithesis of the city cults in which the victim is eaten cooked .
Here we find a very ancient contrast between the two concepts of food and its associated rites .
When Dionysus is himself the victim of the Titans who put him to death and boil and roast him , his being cooked implies that Dionysus , as the god of Nature , is the victim of the gods of the city . ” ( Daniélou )
The menstrual blood and animal blood connection also reveals the second source of sacrificial blood symbolism : menses , the blood which women shed every month as part of their bodily fertility cycles .
This may be the original ‘ human sacrifice ’ , in that menstruating women ‘ give up ’ their womb - lining and their unfertilised egg .
It is possible that shamanistic practises of possession by articulate and helpful spirits originally came from the upsurge of energies at the period .
There are indications that these spirits were sometimes seen not only as animals , but as the spirits of unborn children .
That is , the blood of the period would come instead of the pregnancy , and the blood spoke with the spirit of the unconceived child .
A distressing development of this would be in the rumoured cults where children were aborted for magical purposes : there would be no need for this in a menstrual cult where the natural energies were listened to by women aware of their existence .
Penelope Shuttle & Peter Redgrove , The Wise Wound
Throughout history , many diverse groups have been accused of child murder or ritual abortion : Dionysian cults , medieval witches , early Christians , Jews in Nazi Germany , Satanists ( and non-Satanic pagans ) in the modern West .
The widespread repression of menstrual power seems to be a good explanation for the projected fantasies that such accusations usually are .
Throughout Aboriginal Australia , there is no other way to arouse the Rainbow Snake than by bleeding , whether this is menstrual blood or the blood of men who cut themselves .
The Snake is summoned by and attracted to blood .
Perhaps this archaic myth - logic is the origin of the reasoning behind the modern occult theory of blood .
Talking of larvæ , or elemental spirits , Eliphas Lévi , a nineteenth century French occultist , says that “ such larvæ have an aërial body formed from the vapour of blood , for which reason they are attracted towards spilt blood [ “ hence come the histories of vampires ” , he says later ] and in the older days drew nourishment from the smoke of sacrifices . ”
In connection with this , he notes that “ according to Paracelsus , the blood lost at certain regular periods by the female sex and the nocturnal emissions to which male celibates are subject in dream people the air with phantoms . ”
( Note that Paracelsus includes semen along with menses — both are in some sense ‘ unborn children ’ , and both are highly valued in most sex-magickal traditions . )
Blood is seen in such occult theory to contain the ‘ life - force ’ of the organism , and spilling the blood is thought to release this energy — usually to ‘ feed ’ a god or spirit , so that it can be manifested , or empowered to do the sorceror ’s bidding .
Such sacrifice is part of many voodoo traditions .
Christopher Hyatt and Jason Black , in Pacts with the Devil , concisely reveal the modern double standards surrounding the issue of animal sacrifice .
Recently , on a national new broadcast , there was a segment taped in New York .
The video showed ranks of cages containing sheep and chickens , with NYPD officers standing with military solemnity in front of them .
The police , the commentator informed us , had just “ rescued ” these animals .
Not from torture or some other form of lingering abuse , but from a place where a major Santeria festival was about to be celebrated .
What was to be the fate of these livestock animals ?
They would be killed expertly and quickly by a Santero , the blood given to the Orishas as a gift , and most likely ( depending on the ritual ) the animals would be cooked and eaten that same evening by the men women and children at the celebration .
They point out that we live in a society where someone could be sat at home eating a steak ( from an animal cruelly , sometimes slowly killed in a slaughterhouse ) , spy someone living next door swiftly killing a chicken as part of a ritual , and run terrified to the phone to inform the police about this ‘ Satanist ’ , even if the ritualist ate the chicken later for dinner .
Who is more humane ?
Hyatt & Black also note that all ‘ kosher ’ meat , drained of blood while a rabbi says a blessing , is by definition ritual sacrifice ; yet this is legal .
Now , I ’m wholly and unreservedly against any animal being killed if it is n’t eaten ( unless in self - defence ) .
When it is eaten , I think this falls into the category of personal choice .
It ’s not my business if people want to eat animals without cruelty .
Likewise , it ’s not my business if they want to use the animal ’s death for spiritual purposes before they eat it .
Or if they want to kill it cleanly , then rip it to shreds and eat it raw with their bare hands .
What Hyatt & Black show is the hypocrisy surrounding blood sacrifice in moder
NEW YORK / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Platinum surged 3 percent to hit a record high for the 12th successive day on Friday , with acute power problems in top producer South Africa encouraging investors and consumers to buy up the metal .
Spot metal hit a high of $ 2,060 an ounce before easing to $ 2,050/2,055 by 2:59 p.m. EST , against $ 1,997/2,007 in New York late on Thursday .
It has jumped more than 34 percent this year on the top of 37 percent gains recorded in 2007 .
“ It ’s panic , panic , panic .
If you are a platinum consumer , you are not going to sleep at night , ” said Robin Bhar , metals analyst at UBS Investment Bank .
“ The price move shows you the unprecedented nature of the market .
People can see actual physical shortages somewhere down the road and prices moving away from them .
It ’s not a case of just speculation .
There is genuine demand coming through . ”
South Africa , which accounts for 80 percent of global platinum supply , has been hard hit by power cuts since early January , forcing mines to shut for five days last month .
South Africa ’s state power firm Eskom said on Thursday it would increase coal purchases and buy back electricity from those industrial users able to reduce consumption under a plan to address crippling shortages .
Analysts say the platinum deficit could widen to 400,000 to 500,000 ounces by the end of 2008 , compared with about 265,000 ounces in 2007 .
The market had a surplus of 65,000 ounces in 2006 following seven successive years of deficits .
Impala Platinum IMPJ.J , the world 's No. 2 producer , on Thursday forecast " very tight market conditions . "
The top producer Anglo Platinum AMSJ.J said this week the power problem alone would cut output by 120,000 ounces in 2008 .
It has shut it Polokwane smelter for weeks of repairs .
However , some traders warned that a sharp pullback could be possible after the white metal ’s breakneck rally .
“ We already know that platinum is a news - driven market .
It ’s all coming out of South Africa .
If everything stays the same right now , and if the shortfall is not going to get greater , this market will not go substantially higher , ” said Ralph D’Esposito , NYMEX floor trader with RJ Futures in New York .
D’Esposito said that even if Eskom went back to producing at full capacity for only a week or two , the platinum market could be vulnerable to a sharp pullback of as much as $ 200 .
GOLD FALLS AS OIL RALLY FAILS
Gold reversed initial gains as a rally energy prices lost steam .
U.S. crude futures settled way off their intraday highs at $ 95.50 a barrel .
Spot gold rose as high as $ 915.20 an ounce and was at $ 903.00/903.80 an ounce by New York ’s last quote at 2:15 p.m. , against $ 907.10/907.90 late in the U.S. market on Thursday .
The gold contract for April delivery at the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange settled down $ 4.70 at $ 906.10 an ounce .
George Gero , vice president of RBC Capital Markets Global Futures in New York , said that liquidation and short - covering could be seen and an increase in volatility could be possible in the near term .
However , Gero said that buying in gold was steady on perennial economic worries and possible further rate cuts ahead of the long U.S. weekend , Gero said .
Markets will be closed Monday in observance of U.S. Presidents Day .
Harmony Gold HARJ.J , the world 's fifth - biggest producer , posted a wider second - quarter loss per share after an accident closed a mine and warned the power crisis was hitting output .
Palladium firmed to $ 444.00/449.00 an ounce from its Thursday close of $ 433/437 , while silver eased to $ 17.11/17.16 an ounce from its previous finish of $ 17.24/17.29 .
Russia has threatened to target the Ukraine with nuclear warheads if the former Soviet republic joins Nato and accepts the deployment of United States anti-missile defences on its territory .
President Vladimir Putin of Russia warned Viktor Yushchenko , Ukraine 's leader , of " retaliatory actions ' ' should his country join the Western alliance .
" It 's frightening not just to talk about this , but even to think about , that in response to such deployment , the possibility of such deployments -- and one can't theoretically exclude these deployments -- that Russia will have to point its warheads at Ukrainian territory , '' he said during a joint press conference in Moscow .
The Russian and Ukrainian leaders had just held emergency talks in the Kremlin to avert a energy supply crisis over Kiev 's gas bill -- a similar dispute two years ago led to power cuts across Europe .
Mr Yushchenko responded to the Russian pressure by insisting on Ukraine 's right to decide its own foreign policy while stressing that his country 's constitution would not allow US military bases on its territory .
Mr Putin has condemned Washington 's plans to include Poland and the Czech Republic in a missile defence shield as a " new phase in the arms race ' ' .
Russia fears the shield will threaten its national security and tip the strategic military balance in Europe .
Moscow has already declared that Russia will pull out of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty ( CFE ) , which came into force in 1992 and restricts the deployment of troops near sensitive European frontiers .
Warning
Last week , John Chipman , the head of the International Institute for Strategic Studies , gave warning that the " next target of Moscow 's assertive revisionism ' ' could be the Intermediate Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty of 1987 .
Both moves would allow Russia to build a new generation of medium - range nuclear missiles capable of striking Western Europe .
Ukraine 's membership request to Nato will be considered at a summit in the Romanian capital of Bucharest in April .
Mr Putin has accepted an invitation to attend .
The prospect of Nato membership is controversial in the Ukraine , where opinion polls show more than half of the country opposes it .
Russia has revived the long - range air patrols that were a feature of the Cold War and US defence officials confirmed that a pair of Russian TU - 95 Bear bombers flew at 2,000 feet over the US aircraft carrier Nimitz in the western Pacific at the weekend .

An increasing number of British servicemen are seeking help
They sit around his bed and stare at him .
" One of them used to come up to my face but he had lips and no eyes , just sockets and they were badly burnt " , he recalls .
Without the sleeping tablets , the British serviceman would be up several times a night with these nightmares - often waking up screaming .
Cpl Meighan had 10 tours of duty during his 14 years in the army .
He witnessed the consequences of allied bombing on the so - called Highway of Death , the road out of Kuwait City where retreating Iraqi columns were decimated during the first Gulf War .
It was when he returned home from this campaign that the nightmares began .
He is one of the 260 regular clients of retired Sqn Ldr Steve Pettitt , the east of England 's Welfare Officer for Combat Stress , the ex-services mental welfare charity .
Sqn Ldr Pettitt spends his days driving around the region visiting men and women who are suffering psychological problems arising from their time in the armed forces .
Usually it is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) which develops after someone has been exposed to some sort of traumatic event .
Sqn Ldr Pettitt said : " I have clients who at the sound of a plastic water bottle going pop in the street might hit the ground because they think it 's a mortar . "
They send us out to war but they do n't pick up the pieces when they come back
Cpl John Meighan
Those affected can see relationships breaking down along with problems with alcohol , violent outbursts , difficulties in holding down a job , even homelessness .
Sqn Ldr Pettitt currently works with Northern Ireland veterans and people who have served in Bosnia and the first Gulf War .
But he believes the intensity of fighting in Afghanistan , and the operations in Iraq over the past five years , will see a big increase in his caseload .
He said PTSD can take hold more than a decade after the sufferer has left the forces .
Combat Stress nationally is facing a 27 % increase in referrals in the past two years with 175 Iraq and 29 Afghanistan veterans currently being helped .
The charity has had to deal with nearly 1,000 new cases in the past year alone and more than 8,000 veterans are now registered with them .
Among the Iraq and Afghan vets being helped by Combat Stress , the eldest is 60 , the youngest 21 .
Their average age is 32 .
Regular mental health services can often not meet the needs of veterans
Half of Combat Stress ' £ 6.5 m annual expenditure is met by the Ministry of Defence and last October the Veteran 's Minister Derek Twigg announced a 45 % increase in the government 's contribution .
Additionally , six special treatment centres are being set up around the UK as part of a two - year pilot scheme , with each one offering specialist therapy .
If these centres are a success , then the scheme will be expanded .
This is a recognition that regular NHS mental health services are often not able to meet the specific needs of veterans .
Sqn Ldr Pettitt said : " We 've found that a client will go to the NHS and find they 've nothing in common with what 's being discussed in the therapy group , that the therapist does n't understand at all what the person has seen . "
Some of the experiences recounted by veterans during NHS group therapy sessions have been so horrifying that it left everyone in the room traumatised .
Cpl Meighan said he felt abandoned when he developed PTSD .
He said : " They send us out to war but they do n't pick up the pieces when they come back . "
He has a son who is a soldier currently serving with the Royal Anglians .
Kenny Meighan said some of his colleagues suffered mental distress following a recent tour which saw hard fighting in Helmand Province .
He said : " You live in a room with eight men and you see them sleeping and you see them having nightmares , shouting out .
" It just worries me because I 've seen it first hand with my father - I do n't want to come out like that and I do n't want my friends to come out like that . "
Children in England read less outside school and the performance of bright youngsters has dropped since 2001 , according to an international research report published today .
The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study ( Pirls ) showed that the amount of reading overall outside school has fallen since the last study , six years ago .
More than a third ( 37 % ) of 10 - year - olds in England play computer games for more than three hours a day , the study found .
This represents an increase since 2001 and one of the highest proportions internationally , and researchers found a link between high use of computer games and lower attainment in reading and literacy .
According to the report , England still scores well above the international average , but has fallen since 2001 and the lower achievement of better readers has had the most influence on the overall fall .
England has dropped from third to 19th in the international reading literacy league table since 2001 , with an average scale score of 539 .
The Russian Federation got the highest score of 565 and South Africa the lowest of 302 .
Of the 10 highest achieving countries in the last survey in 2006 , seven fell while three rose .
Only 33 % of children in England and Scotland read for pleasure , compared with the international average of 40 % .
There is a strong link between this and their achievement in Pirls tests .
The children 's secretary , Ed Balls , said : " This study shows that our highest achieving children are reading less , with children 's busy days leaving less time for books at home .
As parents we have to get the balance right and as a society we have to send the right messages about the value of reading to our children . "
He said next year 's National Year of Reading would provide help and encouragement for parents and children .
Researchers in 41 countries and regions tested 215,000 10 - year - olds on their reading and writing skills and quizzed them on their reading habits , including how many books they have at home .
They were asked who had helped them to learn to read and how much they read at home and in school .
Researchers from the National Foundation for Educational Research conducted the study in 150 schools in England and 130 more in Scotland in May and June 2006 .
A total of 4,036 pupils in England took part and 3,775 in Scotland .
The research was funded by the Department for Children , Schools and Families , and the Scottish executive .
Teachers in the survey reported a level of job satisfaction that was around the international average - teachers of 70 % of the pupils were very satisfied with their current teaching post .
In almost all countries , including England , girls achieved significantly higher mean scores than boys .
In England girls ' performance fell slightly more than boys ' but both fell significantly since 2001 .
Shadow children 's secretary Michael Gove said : " This is the second report in a month by academic experts underlining the failure of the government 's reading plans .
" We are falling dangerously behind other countries and we know that those from the poorest backgrounds are suffering most .
It 's time the government stopped blaming parents and accepted the case we 've been making for a new focus on teaching reading using tried and tested methods , with a test after two years in primary school to ensure our children are being taught properly . "
Liberal Democrat shadow children 's secretary David Laws said ministers should be ashamed that England has plummeted down the international league table :
" Despite the success of books like Harry Potter , there is still a worryingly large group of our young people who have absolutely no interest in reading .
" We have to ensure that youngsters can not only read and write but that schools and parents breathe enjoyment back into what otherwise can be a rigid programme of learning . "
On Wednesday , March 13 , Rep. Ron Paul addressed the House of Representatives on the costs of intervening around the world .
I am pleased to address the House tonight about the budget because there has been a lot of concern expressed here today on both sides of the aisle about the kind of financial trouble we ’re in .
And there ’s no doubt about that .
But sometimes I think we go back and forth spending more time blaming each other rather than dealing with the real problem .
One of the contentions I ’ve had about the budget is that we look at it as an accounting problem rather than a philosophy problem because the spending occurs because of what we accept as the proper role of government .
And right now , it ’s assumed by the country as well as the Congress that the proper role of government is to run our lives , run the economy , run the welfare state , and police the world .
And all of a sudden , it puts a lot of pressure on the budget .
Today , the national debt is going up almost $ 600 billion .
And the economy is getting weaker , there ’s no doubt about it .
We ’re in a recession , it ’s going to get much worse , which means that the deficit is going to get a lot worse .
And I ’m predicting within a couple of years , it will not surprise me one bit to see the national debt , the national obligation for future generations to rise in 1 year three - quarters of $ 1 trillion .
And that is a very possible number .
And like it has been expressed so often today , we need to do something about it .
The question is , what are we going to do about it ?
One side , it seems like , well , if we just raise taxes , we ’re going to solve the problem .
The other side says , well , all we have to do is get rid of the earmarks .
Well , that argument , I think , falls short , too , because you can vote to cut all the earmarks , but it does n’t cut any spending , it just delivers the authority to spend the money to the executive branch .
I think the job of the Congress is to earmark the money .
It ’s our obligation to tell people how the money is spent .
And those who think that we can solve this problem by just getting rid of earmarks , they never talk about the earmarks overseas , the hundreds of millions , if not billions , of dollars we spend overseas .
We earmark them to certain countries , into building military buildings overseas .
What about the earmark for the embassy in Iraq ?
It has cost $ 1 billion .
That ’s an earmark .
But the side that said that we can solve this problem by cutting earmarks never talks about these earmarks .
Just think of the earmarks in the military budget .
I mean , billions .
We finally elect a different Congress to deal with some of these supplementals and emergency spending that we do n’t have the guts to put on the budget .
And what do we do ?
We have the continuation , in all the budgets presented today , we ’re still going to finance the war as an off - budget emergency item .
We ’re not being honest with ourselves .
And we pretend that the problem is there , and that if you talk about it , it ’s going to go away .
The way I see it is there ’s only one way that we ’re going to attack this , and that is , decide what our government ought to be doing .
And the Constitution is very clear , the government ought to preserve our liberties and give us a strong national defense .
It should n’t run our lives , it should n’t run the economy , it should n’t police the world .
We ’re not supposed to be the policemen of the world .
But everybody talks about it .
And both sides of the aisle have no hesitation to spend every cent the executive branch asked for to run a war that was never declared .
We now spend $ 1 trillion a year going up , this year it ’s going to go over $ 1 trillion to run the operations overseas .
That means all the foreign aid and all the military , $ 1 trillion to do things we should n’t be doing .
They interviewed 3,400 military personnel just recently , military leaders , and 82 percent of them said our military is weaker today than it was 5 years ago .
So , all of this money spent and all this policing in the world , and all this deficit .
And financially we ’re coming down .
I mean , just today the dollar went down 1.2 percent in one day , after this steady erosion .
It comes from the fact of deficits .
And why does that hurt the dollar ?
Because we do n’t have enough money .
We do n’t tax enough .
We ca n’t tax anymore .
People are overtaxed .
We ca n’t borrow anymore because interest rates will go up .
So , we print the money .
And the more money you print , the further the dollar goes down , and then everything goes up in price .
So it ’s a cycle that ’s coming to an end .
The value of the dollar is really telling the whole story .
We ’ve overextended ourselves because we do not challenge the whole notion of what we ought to be doing here and what our government ought to be all about because we have drifted so far from the original intent of the Constitution .
There is no hesitation , there are debates that go on here endlessly .
One side of the aisle says , well , we need more and more money for the military ; we ca n’t cut one single cent on overseas expenditure .
And the other side says , oh , no , we ca n ’t cut the entitlements .
And then there ’s an agreement , we raise both .
My idea is to have a strong national defense and to get this budget under control .
Reject the notion that we need to run an empire ; we ca n’t afford it , it ’s going to come down , it always comes down .
It has come down all throughout history because eventually the currency is destroyed .
We ’re in 130 countries .
We have 700 bases .
Our military now is in worse shape than it was 5 years ago , according to our military .
So it ’s time we look at the strategic , the philosophic problems .
And I will say , unless we do this , this will end badly .
It ’s going to end with a major economic crisis .
It ’s going to be worldwide , and we here at home will suffer , not only economically but inevitably .
Under these conditions the people lose their liberty , and our liberties are being eroded every single day .
So , yes , we take an oath to obey and uphold the Constitution against foreign and domestic .
But we ’re domestic , and we should protect our rights and our budget and the greatness of this country .
I like Digg .
I ca n’t say I ’m an overly active user , but I genuinely enjoy perusing through the top links every so often .
The comments , most often comprised of witty banter , are often as entertaining as the link itself .
Digging around through Digg last night though , I noticed how the Digg user base pretty much represents this single collective personality with a fairly predictable set of views .
If we call Digg…umm … " Dougg " for a brief moment , a particular character with very clear ideas , beliefs and interests materializes .
So what ’s Dougg like ?
Well , I ’d venture to say :
He is clearly a guy ( probably between 18 and 25 years old ) .
He ’s politically far left .
He ’s against the war in Iraq .
He ’s either an atheist or agnostic .
He ’s voting for Obama .
He detests Microsoft and loves Apple .
He ’s generally anti-establishment and anti-status quo .
He plays a whole lot of video games .
He ’s far too impressed with HDR photos .
So in short , Dougg is pretty predictable and not very diverse .
It would n’t be a stretch to conclude that Dougg does n’t like country music or say , Ronald Reagan ’s legacy .
What ’s interesting about this characterization of Digg is that highlights the tendency of mobs to eventually settle into a recognizable identity that reinforces itself and as a result , does n’t really evolve over time .
While Digg does allow anyone to post virtually anything , the stuff that ’s going to rise to the top and get " published " for the world to see is fairly easy to predict .
In other words , Dougg is pretty set in his ways .
Digg is n’t a megaphone that presents wildly divergent views and ideas .
It ’s really no different than pegging The FillInTheBlank Tribune as a " beacon of liberal thinking " or a " conservative rag . "
While publications may actually go to great lengths to put forth some level of objectiveness , Dougg makes no such apologies .
He does n’t have to .
He has the luxury of hiding behind his supposedly democratic flavor of editing and publishing .
Who knew that this experiment in pluralism and community would end up so lop - sided ?
ANNANDALE , Va. ( MarketWatch ) --
The parallels between today 's market and those preceding the 1987 Crash are several -- and disturbing .
Then , the dollar was in a free fall against foreign currencies .
Today , as well .
And then , as now , the U.S. government showed no signs of being particularly concerned .
Furthermore , over the October 1987 weekend prior to what would eventually become known as Black Monday , foreign stock markets plunged .
The same is happening today too .
( Read full story . )
It was obvious to almost everyone , prior to the market 's opening on Oct. 19 , 1987 , that the Dow would have a terrible day .
And sure enough , it did , losing 508 points .
U.S. stock markets likewise appear poised to have just as big a point loss this time around .
As this is written , on Monday afternoon , the futures contract on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % is off by some 520 points .
( Read full story . )
Of course , the DJIA today is at a much higher level than in 1987 .
So this benchmark would have to drop more than 2,700 points on Tuesday to match the percentage loss from the 1987 Crash .
This contrast may prove to be only small solace to beleaguered investors , though .
More solace may be provided by another parallel with the 1987 Crash , however :
The crisis then was primarily confined to the financial markets ; the economy as a whole , as judged by the scorekeepers at the National Bureau of Economic Research , was not then in a recession ; nor was it about to enter into one .
To be sure , it would be premature to declare that today 's economic slowdown will not develop into a full - fledged recession .
But some of the newsletter editors I monitor do believe that the extent of any economic weakness is being exaggerated .
One such editor is Norman Fosback , editor of Fosback 's Fund Forecaster .
The latest issue of his newsletter was emailed Monday afternoon .
And though Fosback does not focus specifically in that issue on the global markets ' freefall over the past two sessions , his analysis speaks directly to the question of whether or not the crisis the markets face currently will be primarily confined to the financial markets .
Fosback suspects it will be relatively narrowly confined .
" The prospective business slowdown does not appear all that serious , " he writes .
This is for a variety of reasons , the most important of which , according to Fosback , is the strength in the global economy :
" The global economy is plugging along in reasonably good shape , thanks in no small part to the weak U.S. dollar ( that is even now boosting foreign demand for U.S. products ) , and thanks as well to the economic boom in the developing world ( most significantly the emerging economic giants of China and India , that are providing an awesome supply of low - priced goods and services to U.S. consumers ) .
This global economic boom is the golden egg for us all . "
What about the subprime mortgage crisis ?
Fosback says its impact is being exaggerated too .
" As horrendous as seems the current round of write - offs by financial companies , these same firms profited immensely from the subprime boom in the first place , and are now merely giving back some of their gains .
The great myth is that individual Americans were reaping the windfall benefit of absurdly low interest rates on their mortgages .
This belies the fact that not only are the borrowers ' mortgage loans secured with their own homes , but the average adjustable - rate subprime mortgage borrower is paying a 9 % interest rate .
That hefty consumer cost has produced , and is still largely producing , a lot of annual profit for the loan financiers .
In the long run , these yields will offset all of the defaults , and in a very real sense the current default losses are simply one of the foreseeable costs of making the higher - risk loans in the first place . "
The bottom line , according to Fosback : " The recession , if one even comes , should prove to be relatively mild .
Although corporate earnings will certainly fall , this is not the doomsday end of the global business expansion . "
Fosback deserves to be paid attention to because he has been a newsletter editor since the mid-1970s , more than three decades ago , and has a creditable track record .
Among his noteworthy accomplishments is the creation of the stock market timing system that , far and away , has the best long - term track record of any that the Hulbert Financial Digest tracks .
Python templating

Python code plus some examples : templat.zip
In the book " Game programming gems " , edited by Mark DeLoura , at pages 20 - 35 there is a chapter by Pete Isensee that talks about a complex use of C++ templates to do some computations at compile time .
Template programming is Turing - complete , and it can be used to compute some constant values , to unroll loops and so on , that can be useful to speed up the code at runtime , without the need to put the unrolled code inside the source itself .
The idea is neat , but the syntax of templates is far from being nice , and some C++ compilers are unable to do their work correctly .
This is a simple example that computes Fibonacci number at complile time :
// Template Factorial // Copyright © 2000 Pete Isensee ( PKIsensee@msn.com ) . //
All rights reserved worldwide .
template < unsigned N > struct Fact { enum {
Val = N * Fact < N - 1 >:: Val } ; } ; // Specialization for base cases ( termination conditions ) template <> struct Fact< 0 > { enum { Val = 1 } ; } ; template <> struct Fact< 1 > { enum { Val = 1 } ; } ; //
Make the template appear like a function # define FactT ( n ) Fact < n >:: Val
This is a more complex example , that creates identity matrixes at compile time :
// Identity matrix // Copyright © 2000 Pete Isensee ( PKIsensee@msn.com ) . //
All rights reserved worldwide .
# pragma warning ( disable : 4127 ) // ignore conditional expression is constant # pragma inline_depth ( 255 ) # pragma inline_recursion ( on ) // N is matrix size template < class Mtx , unsigned N > struct IdMtx { static inline void eval ( Mtx& mtx ) { IdMtxImpl< Mtx , N , 0 , 0 , 0 >::eval ( mtx ) ; } } ; //
Assigns each element of the matrix template < class Mtx , unsigned N , unsigned C , unsigned R , unsigned I > struct IdMtxImpl { enum { NxtI = I + 1 , // Counter NxtR = NxtI % N , // Row ( inner loop ) NxtC = NxtI / N % N // Column ( outer loop ) } ; static inline void eval ( Mtx& mtx ) { mtx [ C ] [ R ] = ( C == R ) ?
1.0 : 0.0 ; IdMtxImpl < Mtx , N , NxtC , NxtR , NxtI >:: eval ( mtx ) ; } } ; // Specialize for 3x3 and 4x4 matrix template <> struct IdMtxImpl < matrix33 , 3 , 0 , 0 , 3*3 > { static inline void eval ( matrix33& ) {} } ; template <> struct IdMtxImpl < matrix44 , 4 , 0 , 0 , 4*4 > { static inline void eval ( matrix44& ) {} } ; //
Make the template appear like a function # define Identity MtxT ( MtxType , Mtx , N ) IdMtx < MtxType , N >:: eval ( Mtx )
Lisp programmers are probably smiling at such pieces of code .
Instead of using a language with awful syntax , that some compilers can't execute well , why do n't we use the language itself and its compler / interpreter to create the templates ?
So we have a better syntax and a better compiler .
So I have chosen Python as the language to express the templates , it 's simple , and the template parser is little more than an exec of the template blocks .
The Python parser can work on all kind of sourcecode , Python , C , C++ , ObjectPascal , Java , etc .
How to identify the template blocks ?
A syntax has to be invented .
For templates inside Python source code I have chosen {{ ... }}. Python syntax does n't allow a dict as a dict key , so this syntax is surely absent from Python sources . {( ... ) } can't be used , because { ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) } is acceptable syntax .
{{{ ... }}} is a too much long syntax .
I have chosen to keep the scope of the names defined into a block inside the scopes of all the following blocks in the same source code .
For simpler situations an expression can be useful too , so I have defined the { [ ... ] } syntax too , that return the repr( eval ( ... ) ) .
This is the ( working ) core of this program , templating with Python is really easy :
import glob , re , sys , cStringIO , textwrap def repl ( mobj ) : # uses " scope " global name indent , block , expression = mobj.groups ( ) if block : sys.stdout , oldstdout = cStringIO.StringIO ( ) , sys.stdout exec textwrap.dedent(block.rstrip ( ) ) + "
" in scope result , sys.stdout = sys.stdout.getvalue( ) , oldstdout return "
" . join ( indent + line for line in result.splitlines ( ) ) else : return repr( eval ( expression , scope ) ) finder = re.compile(r " ( [ \t ] * ) {{ (.*? ) }} | { \ [ (.*? ) \]} " , re .
DOTALL|re.VERBOSE ) for filename_in in glob.glob ( " *.pyt " ) + glob.glob ( " *.ct " ) : scope = {} code_in = file ( filename_in ) .read ( ) file ( filename_in [ : - 1 ] , " w " ) .write ( finder.sub( repl , code_in ) )
The complete code is longer and it has some safes , some speeds up , looks for templated files recursively , etc .
As you can see , the output of the prints contained inside the blocks to be executed is grabbed inside a cStringIO , and the output file has the same name of the input file minus the last " t " of the suffix ( t is for template ) .
Python is really good for such kind of jobs , I have created the core of this program in a short time , about two hours .
This is a small example input of templated Python :
{ {from math import sin identity = lambda n : [ [ [ 0,1 ] [ i==j ] for i in range ( n ) ] for j in range ( n ) ]
# With Python2.5 you can use if i==j else 0 instead of [ 0,1 ] [ i==j ] }} print { [ sin( 5.5 ) ] } {{print " print " , repr ( sin ( 5.5 ) ) }} {{ for i in xrange ( 0 , 20 , 6 ) : print " a%d = %d " % ( i , i ) }}# Extra space to test m = { [ [ [ [ 0,1 ] [ i==j ] for i in range ( 4 ) ] for j in range ( 4 ) ] ] } n = { [ identity ( 3 ) ]}
print sin( 5.5 ) print - 0.70554032557039192 print -0.70554032557039192 a0 = 0 a6 = 6 a12 = 12 a18 = 18 # Extra space to test m = [ [ 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ] ] n = [ [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 1 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] ]

When it was announced that William Kristol had been hired as a columnist for the New York Times , the editorial page editor dismissed critics of the move as intolerant , saying that Kristol was a " a serious , respected conservative intellectual . "
Well , that 's one way to look at it .
But I think the words of Ernest Benn provide a more accurate description of the wisdom of Mr. Kristol :
Politics is the art of looking for trouble , finding it whether it exists or not , diagnosing it incorrectly , and applying the wrong remedy .
That one line perfectly encapsulates the career of William Kristol .
And in fact , because he has been so consistently , so overwhelmingly wrong on so many occasions , I soon realized that it could not be covered in just one sitting , and so today I will focus on his writings between the terrorist attacks on September 11th and the United States invasion of Iraq .
In 1997 , William Kristol co-founded the Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) , a neoconservative think tank created to , " rally support for a vigorous and principled policy of American international involvement , " with one of the key goals of that vigorous policy being the removal of Saddam Hussein from power .
And with the terrorist attacks of September 11th , Kristol was handed the , " catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor , " that he and his merry band of warmongers had dreamed of .
Nine days later , in an open letter to George Bush , the drumbeat for war with Iraq began :
It may be that the Iraqi government provided assistance in some form to the recent attack on the United States .
But even if evidence does not link Iraq directly to the attack , any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq .
Failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism .
It should be noted here that while Kristol allowed for the possibility that Saddam Hussein was n't involved in the September 11th attack , he was quick to embrace the notion , and even after the 9/11 Commission debunked any connection between Iraq and al - Qaeda three years later , Kristol continued to insist that the connection existed .
Of course he also continued to insist that Hussein had WMD , but that 's a story for another Sunday .
But the bottomline here was , Saddam Hussein must go and anything less would mean surrender .
And in the months that followed , Kristol resorted to distortions and fear - mongering to press the case for war :
Last week we lost more than 6,000 Americans to terrorism .
How many more could we lose in a world where Saddam Hussein continues to thrive and continues his quest for weapons of mass destruction ?
Do we really want to find out ?
The Iraqi threat is enormous .
It gets bigger with every day that passes .
It is a tough and dangerous decision to send American soldiers to fight and possibly die in Iraq .
But it is more horrible to watch men and women leap to their deaths from flaming skyscrapers .
... even as he downplayed the difficulty of such an undertaking :
Yes , it is essential to capture bin Laden and destroy al Qaeda .
It is necessary to stabilize Afghanistan and back a functioning government there .
And , yes , we have to roll up the al Qaeda operations in other troublesome parts of the world ... But none of this precludes dealing with Iraq , or makes the obligation of dealing with Iraq less urgent .
The United States can , after all , walk and chew gum at the same time .
The president 's duty is no longer to make the case for war or to prepare the nation for a necessary war .
It is to win it as quickly , as decisively and with as few casualties as possible .
The case for war , over the past few weeks , required clarity and truth .
Victory in war , over the next few weeks or months , will require using the fog of war -- creating that fog -- to keep Hussein off balance , wishful and confused .
We talk here about Shiites and Sunnis as if they 've never lived together .
Most Arab countries have Shiites and Sunnis , and a lot of them live perfectly well together .
Actually , saying he 's wrong does n't even begin to describe the mendacity of William Kristol .
Here is a man who was n't satified with the deaths of 2,996 people on September 11th , instead claiming that more than 6,000 died in his own bloodlust for Saddam Hussein .
A man who used the horrible images of people leaping to their death from the World Trade Center to justify soldiers possibly dying in Iraq .
Who dismissed the strain fighting two wars would have on our military forces as walking and chewing gum , because after all , it would only last a few weeks or months .
And who ignored history in rejecting the possibility that Iraq would be torn apart by sectarian strife .
And 18 months after William Kristol began beating the drums for war , and two days before George Bush obliged him , Kristol wrote :
But we feel no joy and little satisfaction ...
We are tempted to comment , in these last days before the war , on the U.N. , and the French , and the Democrats .
But the war itself will clarify who was right and who was wrong about weapons of mass destruction ...
History and reality are about to weigh in , and we are inclined simply to let them render their verdicts .
Actually , I 'm guessing that there were champagne corks popping .
After writing more than 30 columns in the 18 months betweeen September 11th and the invasion that advocated overthrowing Saddam Hussein , it 's a bit more than disingenuous for Mr. Kristol to claim he felt no joy or satisfaction .
Of course he may have been able to pull it off had he left out the gratuitous dig at the people who opposed the war .
The ones who history and reality have proven to be right .
And next week , I will clarify just how wrong Mr. Kristol was and is about weapons of mass destruction and the war in Iraq .
Any analysis of the current state of the ongoing U.S. occupation of Iraq that relied solely on the U.S. government , the major candidates for president or the major media outlets in the United States for information would be hard pressed to find any bad news .
In a State of the Union address which had everything except a “ Mission Accomplished ” banner flying in the background , President Bush all but declared victory over the insurgency in Iraq .
His recertification of the success of the so - called surge has prompted the Republican candidates to assume a cocky swagger when discussing Iraq .
They embrace the occupation and speak , without shame or apparent fear of retribution , of an ongoing presence in that war - torn nation .
Their Democratic counterparts have been less than enthusiastic in their criticism of the escalation .
And the media , for the most part , continue their macabre role as cheerleaders of death , hiding the reality of Iraq deep inside stories that build upon approving headlines derived from nothing more than political rhetoric .
The war in Iraq , we ’re told , is virtually over .
We only need “ stay the course ” for 10 more years .
This situation is troublesome in the extreme .
The collective refusal of any constituent in this complicated mix of political players to confront Bush on Iraq virtually guarantees that it will be the Bush administration , and not its successor , that will dictate the first year ( or more ) of policy in Iraq for the next president .
It also ensures that the debacle that is the Bush administration ’s overarching Middle East policy of regional transformation and regime change in not only Iraq but Iran and Syria will continue to go unchallenged .
If the president is free to pursue his policies , it could lead to direct military intervention in Iran by the United States prior to President Bush ’s departure from office or , failing that , place his successor on the path toward military confrontation .
At a time when every data point available certifies ( and recertifies ) the administration ’s actions in Iraq , Iran and elsewhere ( including Afghanistan ) as an abject failure , America collectively has fallen into a hypnotic trance , distracted by domestic economic problems and incapable , due to our collective ignorance of the world we live in , of deciphering the reality on the ground in the Middle East .
Rather than offering a word - for - word renouncement of the president ’s rosy assertions concerning Iraq , I will instead initiate a process of debunking the myth of American success by doing that which no politician , current or aspiring , would dare do : predict the failure of American policy in Iraq .
With the ink on the newspapers parroting the president ’s words barely dry , evidence of his misrepresentation of reality begins to build with the announcement by the Pentagon that troop levels in Iraq will not be dropping , as had been projected in view of the “ success ” of the “ surge , ” but rather holding at current levels with the possibility of increasing in the future .
This reversal of course concerning troop deployments into Iraq highlights the reality that the statistical justification of “ surge success , ” namely the reduction in the level of violence , was illusory , a temporary lull brought about more by smoke and mirrors than any genuine change of fortune on the ground .
Even the word surge is inappropriate for what is now undeniably an escalation .
Iraq , far from being a nation on the rebound , remains a mortally wounded shell , the equivalent of a human suffering from a sucking chest wound , its lungs collapsed and its life blood spilling unchecked onto the ground .
The “ surge ” never addressed the underlying reasons for Iraq ’s post - Saddam suffering , and as such never sought to heal that which was killing Iraq .
Instead , the “ surge ” offered little more than a cosmetic gesture , covering the wounds of Iraq with a bandage which shielded the true extent of the damage from outside view while doing nothing to save the victim .
Iraq is dying ; soon Iraq will be dead .
True , there will be a plot of land in the Middle East which people will refer to as Iraq .
But any hope of a resurrected homogeneous Iraqi nation populated by a diverse people capable of coexisting in peace and harmony is soon to be swept away forever .
Any hope of a way out for the people of Iraq and their neighbors is about to become a victim of the “ successes ” of the “ surge ” and the denial of reality .
The destruction of Iraq has already begun .
The myth of Kurdish stability — born artificially out of the U.S. - enforced “ no - fly zones ” of the 1990s , sustained through the largess of the Oil - for - Food program ( and U.S. - approved sanctions sidestepped by the various Kurdish groups in Iraq ) and given a Frankenstein - like lease on life in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion and occupation — is rapidly unraveling .
Like Dr. Frankenstein ’s monster , present - day Iraqi Kurdistan has been exposed as an amalgam of parts incompatible not only with each other but the region as a whole .
Ongoing Kurdish disdain for the central authority in Baghdad has led to the Kurds declaring their independence from Iraqi law ( especially any law pertaining to oil present on lands they control ) .
The reality of the Kurds ’ quest for independence can be seen in their support of the Kurdish groups , in particular the PKK , that desire independence from Turkey .
The sentiment has not been lost on their Turkish neighbors to the north , resulting in an escalation of cross - border military incursions which will only expand over time , further destabilizing Kurdish Iraq .
Lying dormant , and unmentioned , is the age - old animosity between the two principle Kurdish factions in Iraq , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) and the Kurdish Democratic Party ( KDP ) .
As recently as 1997 , these two factions were engaged in a virtual civil war against one another .
The strains brought on by the present unraveling have these two factions once again vying for position inside Iraq , making internecine conflict all but inevitable .
The year 2008 will bring with it a major escalation of Turkish military operations against northern Iraq , a strategic break between the Kurdish factions there and with the central government of Baghdad , and the beginnings of an all - out civil war between the KDP and PUK .
The next unraveling of the “ surge ” myth will be in western Iraq , where the much applauded “ awakening ” was falling apart even as Bush spoke .
I continue to maintain that there is a hidden hand behind the Sunni resistance that operates unseen and uncommented on by the United States and its erstwhile Iraqi allies operating out of the Green Zone in Baghdad .
The government of Saddam Hussein never formally capitulated , and indeed had in place plans for ongoing active resistance against any occupation of Iraq .
In October 2007 the Iraqi Baath Party held its 13th conference , in which it formally certified one of Saddam ’s vice presidents , Izzat Ibrahim al - Douri , as the supreme leader of the Sunni resistance .
The United States ’ embrace of the “ awakening ” will go down in the history of the Iraq conflict as one of the gravest strategic errors made in a field of grave errors .
The U.S. military in Iraq has never fully understood the complex interplay between the Sunni resistance , al - Qaida in Iraq , and the former government of Saddam Hussein .
Saddam may be dead , but not so his plans for resistance .
The massive security organizations which held sway over Iraq during his rule were never defeated , and never formally disbanded .
The organs of security which once operated as formal ministries now operate as covert cells , functioning along internal lines of communication which are virtually impenetrable by outside forces .
These security organs gave birth to al - Qaida in Iraq , fostered its growth as a proxy , and used it as a means of sowing chaos and fear among the Iraqi population .
The violence perpetrated by al - Qaida in Iraq is largely responsible for the inability of the central government in Baghdad to gain any traction in the form of unified governance .
The inability of the United States to defeat al - Qaida has destroyed any hope of generating confidence among the Iraqi population in the possibility of stability emerging from an ongoing American occupation .
But al - Qaida in Iraq is not a physical entity which the United States can get its hands around , but rather a giant con game being run by Izzat al - Douri and the Sunni resistance .
Because al - Qaida in Iraq is derived from the Sunni resistance , it can be defeated only when the Sunni resistance is defeated .
And the greatest con game of them all occurred when the Sunni resistance manipulated the United States into arming it , training it and turning it against the forces of al - Qaida , which it controls .
Far from subduing the Sunni resistance by Washington ’s political and military support of the “ awakening , ” the United States has further empowered it .
It is almost as if we were arming and training the Viet Cong on the eve of the Tet offensive during the Vietnam War .
Keeping in mind the fact that the Sunni resistance , led by al - Douri , operates from the shadows , and that its influence is exerted more indirectly than directly , there are actual al - Qaida elements in Iraq which operate independently of central Sunni control , just as there are Sunni tribal elements which freely joined the “ awakening ” in an effort to quash the forces of al - Qaida in Iraq .
The diabolical beauty of the Sunni resistance is n’t its ability to exert direct control over all aspects of the anti-American activity in Sunni Iraq , but rather to manipulate the overall direction of activity through indirect means in a manner which achieves its overall strategic aims .
The Sunni resistance continues to use al - Qaida in Iraq as a useful tool for seizing the strategic focus of the American military occupiers ( and their Iraqi proxies in the Green Zone ) , as well as controlling Sunni tribal elements which stray too far off the strategic course ( witness the recent suicide bomb assassination of senior Sunni tribal leaders ) .
2008 will see the collapse of the Sunni “ awakening ” movement , and a return to large - scale anti-American insurgency in western Iraq .
It will also see the continued viability of al - Qaida in Iraq in terms of being an organization capable of wreaking violence and dictating the pace of American military involvement in directions beneficial to the Sunni resistance and detrimental to the United States .
One of the spinoffs of the continued success of the Sunni resistance is the focus it places on the inability of the Shiite - dominated government in Baghdad to actually govern .
The U.S. decision to arm , train and facilitate the various Sunni militias in Iraq is a de facto acknowledgement that the American occupiers have lost confidence in the high - profile byproduct of the “ purple finger revolution ” of January 2005 .
The sham that was that election has produced a government trusted by no one , even the Shiites .
The ongoing unilateral cease - fire imposed by the Muqtada al - Sadr on his Mahdi Army prevented the outbreak of civil war between his movement and that of the Iranian - backed Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , and its militia , the Badr Brigade .
When Saddam ’s security forces dissolved on the eve of the fall of Baghdad in March 2003 , the security organs which had been tasked with infiltrating the Shiite community for the purpose of spying on Shiites were instead instructed to embed themselves deep within the structures of that community .
Both the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigade are heavily infiltrated with such sleeper elements , which conspire to create and exploit fractures between these two organizations under the age - old adage of divide and conquer .
A strategic pause in the conflict between the Mahdi Army and the U.S. military on the one hand and the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigade on the other has served to strengthen the hand of the Mahdi Army by allowing time for it to rearm and reorganize , increasing its efficiency as a military organization all the while its political opposite , the SCIRI - dominated central Iraqi government , continues to falter .
Further exacerbating the situation for the American occupiers of Iraq is the ongoing tension created by the war of wills between the United States and Iran .
The Sunni resistance has no love for the Shiite theocracy in Tehran , or its proxies in Iraq , and views creating a rift between the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigade as a strategic imperative on the road to a Sunni resurgence .
Any U.S. military strike against Iran will bring with it the inevitable Shiite backlash in Iraq .
The Shiite forces that emerge as the most independent of the American occupier will be , in the minds of the Sunni resistance , the most capable of winning the support of the Shiites of Iraq .
Given the past record of cooperation between the Mahdi Army and the Sunni resistance , and the ongoing antipathy between Sunnis and SCIRI , there can be little doubt which Shiite entity the Sunnis will side with when it comes time for a decisive conflict between the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigade , and 2008 will be the year which witnesses such a conflict .
The big loser in all of this , besides the people of Iraq , is of course the men and women of the armed forces of the United States .
Betrayed by the Bush administration , abandoned by Congress and all but forgotten by a complacent American population and those who are positioning themselves for national leadership in the next administration , the soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines who so proudly wear the uniform of the United States continue to fight and die , kill and be maimed in a war which was never justified and long ago lost its luster .
Played as pawns in a giant game of three - dimensional chess , these brave Americans find themselves being needlessly sacrificed in a game where there can be no winner , only losers .
The continued ambivalence of the American population as a whole toward the war in Iraq , perhaps best manifested by the superficiality of the slogan “ Support the Troops , ” all the while remaining ignorant of what the troops are actually doing , has led to a similar amnesia among politicians all too willing to allow themselves to seek political advantage at the expense of American life and treasure .
January 2008 cost the United States nearly 40 lives in Iraq .
The current military budget is unprecedented in its size , and does n’t even come close to paying for ongoing military operations in Iraq .
The war in Iraq has bankrupted Americans morally and fiscally , and yet the American public continues to shake the hands of aspiring politicians who ignore Iraq , pretending that the blood which soaks the hands of these political aspirants has n’t stained their own .
In the sick kabuki dance that is American politics , this refusal to call a spade a spade is deserving of little more than disdain and sorrow .
While the American people , politicians and media may remain mute on the reality of Iraq , I wo n’t .
There is no such thing as a crystal ball which enables one to see clearly into the future , and I am normally averse to making sweeping long - term predictions involving a topic as fluid as the ongoing situation in Iraq .
At the risk of being wrong ( and , indeed , I hope very much that I am ) , I will contradict the rosy statements of the president in his State of the Union address and will throw down a gauntlet in the face of ongoing public and media ambivalence by predicting that 2008 will be the year the “ surge ” in Iraq is exposed as a grand debacle .
The cosmetic bandage placed over the gravely wounded Iraq will fall off , and the damaged body that is Iraq will continue its painful decline toward death .
If there is any winner in all of this it will be the Sunni resistance , or at least its leadership hiding in the shadow of the American occupation , as it continues to exploit the chaotic death spiral of post - Saddam Iraq for its own long - term plan of a Sunni resurgence in Iraq .
That the Sunni resistance will continue to fight an American occupation is a guarantee .
That it will continue to persevere is highly probable .
That the United States will be able to stop it is unlikely .
And so , the reality that the only policy direction worthy of consideration here in the United States concerning Iraq is the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of American forces continues to hold true .
And the fact that this option is given short shrift by all capable of making or influencing such a decision guarantees that this bloody war will go on , inconclusively and incomprehensibly , for many more years .
That is the one image in my crystal ball that emerges in full focus , and which will serve as the basis of defining a national nightmare for generations to come .
What 's wrong with the standard undergraduate computer science curriculum
What 's right with graduates of a standard U.S. CS program ?
Sadly this turns out to be an increasingly poor match with the marketplace .
Consider an employer with a big stack of well - defined clearly specified problems to be solved .
That stack of problems is ideal for handing off to programmers in a low - wage country on the other side of the globe .
Top graduates from a standard Computer Science undergraduate program are well - prepared to go on to graduate school in Computer Science and ultimately to become professors of Computer Science themselves .
In other words academics are doing a fine job of replicating themselves .
But the majority of graduates will be looking for jobs as software engineers and the focus of this article will on how best to prepare people for those jobs .
What 's wrong with graduates of a standard U.S. CS program ?
Graduates have n't done much group work .
Universities spend $ billions on facilities so that students can sleep together ; $ 0 on facilities so that students can work together .
We have a society that , at least to judge by the prescriptions written by pediatric psychiatrists , is suffering an epidemic of Attention Deficit Disorder .
We have students who watched MTV in their cradles .
Yet we structure learning so that students take homework back to their dorm rooms and try to work on problems by themselves while fighting off distraction from dormmates in unrelated majors , TV , DVDs , video games , instant messages , email , and the Web .
Students who come to the university with pre-existing excellent study habits will still get an excellent education .
Students who managed to hop over the low hurdles of junior high and high school despite poor study habits may get minimal benefit from college .
Graduates are not good at taking vague goals from a non-technical person and turning them into concrete specifications that can be implemented within a fixed budget of time and resources .
Graduates are not good at communicating ( writing , presentations , asking questions of users and customers ) .
Lack of experience with user interface design and testing and no experience handling real users ' suggestions , complaints .
Lack of professionalism , i.e. , graduates are not dedicated to completing something of value to end -users .
Students learn to feel good about themselves when they solve well - specified problems and get something for themselves , usually a good grade .
Students do not learn that value is generated only when the first end - user accomplishes a task with the new information system .
Consequently most CS graduates are happy to draw a salary for building a system that is 90 percent finished but never installed or used .
Lack of focus on big picture ; graduates can't understand how their work relates to larger organizational goals .
Graduates are not very experienced with quickly making sense of large commercial tools and libraries and writing small pieces of code that control or extend those libraries .
The result is a tendency to start from scratch or rewrite code that is not fully understood rather than reuse .
Many early
Web applications were plagued with bugs from half - tested database management systems written by computer science graduates who were more interested in writing C code than in learning to apply standard relational database management systems .
What do we want graduates to be able to do ?
The news articles are correct but not complete .
While it is true that U.S. employment for software development has shrunk and hundreds of thousands of people are being fired it is also true that hundreds of thousands of people are being hired .
The newspapers are correct in that number of people hired has been smaller than the number fired .
The question that journalists have n't asked is " Who is getting fired ? "
For nimble employers the first people to get pink slips are older programmers whose performance is average but whose salaries and benefits costs are high .
Who is getting hired ?
New college graduates , thanks to youth , have a high energy level and low employment costs .
Among those desirable young relatively cheap workers the ones who get hired first will be those whose education matches current employer needs .
For the foreseeable future , every young person graduating in Computer Science who gets a job in the United States will owe his or her career to the firing of an older worker .
It is a cruel marketplace but our task in this document is to improve computer science education and help young people , not to reduce cruelty in the American employment market .
Thus our goal during a computer science bachelor 's program ought to be to give a young energetic person the open - ended project and group work experience that the best older programmers have .
Second , we want our graduates to have satisfying careers where they have autonomy , responsibility , and job security .
Consider the typical computer programmer who takes specifications for a subsystem from a manager , unthinkingly produces a program to meet the spec , and hands the resulting code back for testing , integration , and evaluation by other departments .
This is really a factory job where the workers ' hands do n't get dirty .
What 's wrong with that ?
Sociologists have tracked a substantial loss in worker satisfaction as craft jobs were replaced by factory jobs .
A craftsman builds a complete product and delivers it directly into the hands of a customer , seeing and hearing the satisfaction that the new product delivered .
A factory worker , by contrast , builds a small component of a product and is typically several distribution layers removed from the customer .
A craftsman is responsible for whether and when a product goes out the door to the customer .
In a classical factory a totally separate part of the bureaucracy , the quality control department , decides whether or not a product should be shipped .
A craftsman listens to customer needs and adapts the resulting product accordingly .
Factory workers never talk to customers ; a separate marketing department assesses customer needs and determines changes in product design .
Not only is a job in a code factory not very satisfying it is neither very secure .
There is a near - perfect abstraction barrier between the manager and the programmer : specs in , code out .
One of the things that students learn as computer science undergraduates is the virtues of abstraction barriers .
You can replace Module A ( expensive programmer in the U.S. ) with Module B ( cheap programmer in another country ) and never notice as long as Modules A and B present the same interface to the outside world ( email specs in ; source code out ) .
What actual skills will a graduate need in order to get a job ?
To get a satisfying job ?
To keep a job in the face of pressure from younger and / or cheaper workers ?
A professional programmer ought to be able to pick worthwhile problems to attack .
Engineering is the art of building cost - effective solutions to problems that society regards as significant .
A person who blindly does what he or she is told , without independently figuring out the context and significance of the problem , is not doing engineering .
A professional programmer needs to be able to sit at a meeting with decision makers , prepared with substantial domain knowledge , and make significant contributions to the discussion .
A professional programmer needs to be skilled at clean - sheet - of - paper designs .
Some Ideas for a 21st - Century Undergrad Computer Science Program
Our students should be able to study 48 weeks per year , perhaps in four 12 - week quarters , and finish their bachelor 's degree in 30 - 36 calendar months .
Most universities operate in most respects as copies of Ivy League schools .
In many ways it makes sense to copy leaders such as Harvard and Yale but the calendar is n't one of them .
Top universities in the United States are only in session for 26 - 28 weeks .
It makes sense if the customers are wealthy families .
There needs to be a long summer break so that the kids are free to join the family on its yacht in the Mediterranean .
And there needs to be a long winter break so that the kids can come down to the beach house in the Caribbean tax - haven .
And what fun is spring skiing in Aspen if Biff and Muffy can't take a week off from school ?
Computer science , however , is not a commonly chosen major for children of the American aristocracy .
For a middle class parent the traditional university calendar means that not only do they have to pay tuition but they also have to pay for the spring break trip to South Padre Island and , in a world where summer jobs are scarce , support the kid through long summer and winter breaks .
Why not have Johnny , Jr. in school on a more - or - less full - time basis so that he graduates and is off the family payroll by age 20 ?
Students should graduate with a portfolio of work and credentials to show employers .
Nearly all programmers think that they are above average in talent and achievement .
Precious few have any concrete evidence to support this belief .
The curriculum needs to include enough open - ended projects and time for producing good write - ups and presentations that every student graduates with a portfolio showing what problems were attacked , what designs were produced , and to what extent a complete solution was implemented .
The curriculum should also provide opportunities for achieving recognized national certifications .
As of the date of this writing the most common certification standards are from Cisco , Microsoft , and Oracle and are too closely tied to those companies ' products for most academicians ' taste .
Unless and until a consortia of universities and employers develops a competing set of standards it is probably worth helping students meet the currently recognized standards .
Grade inflation is so rampant at most good schools that a transcript is no longer meaningful .
Students should be graded exclusively by outsiders .
In some cases it will be a computer scanning the results of their Microsoft certification test .
In some cases it will be an external client for whom a student team has built a project .
In some cases it might be professional engineers or academics in a low - wage foreign country applying written standards .
But in no case should it be a teacher whose salary is being paid by the student 's tuition .
The potential for conflict of interest and therefore grade inflation is too high and furthermore we want the faculty to be regarded as coaches rather than evaluators .
All student work should have the character of an engineering project : client talks about a problem ; student team prepares a written plan for solving the problem ; student team discusses the plan with the client ; student team builds a prototype ; student team tests the prototype with the client and users ; student team refines the prototype in response to the testing ; student team documents its results .
Everything in a standard engineering curriculum can be taught with this process .
For example , students building a flight simulation game might need to refer to a Physics textbook and do some practice Physics problems in order to learn enough to build their prototype .
This makes it a bit tough for the faculty , who need to be clever enough to weave such courses as Physics , Calculus , and Biology into engineering projects .
The payoff is that by the time the student graduates he or she will be completely comfortable with the engineering process of listen , design , discuss , implement , test , refine , and write up .
Weaving such subjects as literature and history into the curriculum present more of a challenge and are left as an exercise for the reader :-) .
