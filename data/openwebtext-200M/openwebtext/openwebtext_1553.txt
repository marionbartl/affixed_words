Talk of homosexuality in Grade 3 . Masturbation in Grade 6 .
Ontario ’s revamped sex ed curriculum may have some family groups hot under the collar — but the material is age - appropriate and reflects students ’ lives , say sexual health experts .
Evangelist Charles McVety — a politically savvy religious leader who is close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper — who has opposed the “ hostile ” new curriculum all along , is organizing a May 10 protest in Toronto .
But Premier Dalton McGuinty played down McVety ’s concerns on Tuesday , saying “ either we can provide ( this information ) in a format and in a venue where we can have some control or they can get it on their own and be informed by potentially uninformed sources like their friends at school ” or the Internet .
The province is rolling out a new physical health and education curriculum starting this fall — the first in 12 years — that is based on healthy living and making good choices .
It includes discussions about relationships and respecting differences — including same - sex couples — in Grade 3 .
Grade 6 covers the emotional and physical changes of adolescence ; teacher discussion points include talking about how wet dreams are natural , and masturbation is something people “ find pleasurable . ”
In Grade 7 , students learn about delaying sexual activity , sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) and how to prevent them , including abstinence .
That could spark discussion about oral sex or anal intercourse and how they too can be risky .
“ This is primary prevention , ” said Lyba Spring of sexual health promotion at Toronto Public Health .
“ When they are learning about STIs , they have to learn about transmission . ”
While kids in Grade 7 are n’t likely having oral sex , by Grade 9 about one - third of Canadian teens are .
“ We are preparing them with information , and we are also preparing them with skills to make good decisions , ” she added .
Lance McCready , of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education , said “ progressive educators ” talk about homosexuality in terms of diverse families .
“ It 's not talking about sexual practices . . . it ’s basically saying that it ’s not right to discriminate against people based on sexual orientation or sexual identity . ”
Education Minister Leona Dombrowsky emphasized that at the end of the day , parents can have the final say on what their children are learning about sex .

The Pope is under pressure over abuse allegations in the Catholic Church The Pope has spoken of the need not to be intimidated by critics , in a veiled reference to anger at the Catholic Church over past sex abuse scandals .
At a Mass in Rome 's St Peter 's Square , he said his faith would help give him the courage to deflect " petty gossip " .
The Pope has been accused of failing to act over the case of a US priest alleged to have abused 200 deaf boys .
But the Archbishop of Westminster defended the Pope , saying he had introduced rules to protect children .
' Swamp of sin '
At the Palm Sunday service , Pope Benedict , 82 , did not directly mention the wider scandal - involving the abuse of children by priests in several countries .
But he told the tens of thousands of people gathered to hear him that God helped lead " towards the courage of not allowing oneself to be intimidated by the petty gossip of dominant opinion " .
The buck stops with [ the Pope ] and he should resign
Activist Peter Tatchell
He also said man sometimes fell to the " lowest , vulgar levels " and sank " into the swamp of sin and dishonesty " .
The most senior Catholic in England and Wales , Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols , said just one case of child abuse was enough to create " justifiable anger " .
He said the " anger and dismay " over the alleged cover - up by some Catholic clergy was " proper " .
However , he added allegations about the Pope 's involvement were unfounded .
Vatican denial
He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show : " He [ the Pope ] pushed forward for example a fast - track to defrock priests who have committed abuse .
He changed the statute of limitations in Church law .
" He changed the law so that sexual offences committed with anyone under the age of 18 would be a crime in Church law . "
The Pope has been accused of failing to act over complaints during the 1990s about Fr Lawrence Murphy , who was alleged to have abused some 200 deaf boys in Milwaukee .
Protesters at Westminster Cathedral call for the Pope to step down
As head of the Vatican office dealing with sex abuses , the Pope - then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger - allegedly did not respond to letters about the case from a archbishop concerned about the abuse .
The Pope 's intervention , following a plea by the priest concerned , is also said to have resulted in the halting of a church trial .
The Vatican newspaper denied this , calling the claims a " smear " attempt .
Meanwhile on Sunday , members of Westminster Cathedral 's congregation clashed with placard - carrying protesters calling for the Pope to resign .
The Protest the Pope coalition said he should go because he failed to ensure priests who abused young people were reported to police .
Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell alleged the pontiff ordered a cover - up in a 2001 edict to Catholic Bishops worldwide .
Mr Tatchell said : " The buck stops with him and he should resign . "
The Pope has apologised to victims of abuse before and recently said sorry to them in a pastoral letter to Irish Catholics .
He said he acknowledged the sense of betrayal in the Church felt by victims and their families .

However , a friend said : “ Roy made a joke along the lines that his friend had better hide in case the officers found him .
It was nothing more than a good - humoured joke but apparently someone overheard it and made an official complaint because they thought it was racist .

Yes , it 's the moment you 've been waiting for : The Insane Clown Posse just came out with a new song .
It 's called " Miracles , " and it is n't just any old cut of sick joker mayhem ; it 's something special : an opportunity for the ICP to celebrate all of the mysteries of the universe .
There is so much magic , so many unexplained phenomena occurring every day , that the Detroit Clown Madness Duo simply can't contain its awe .
Oddly , what the Insane Clown Posse categorize as " magical unexplained mysteries " involve things like " rainbows " and " giraffes " and " magnets . "

Juggaloco Psycho Clown - speak is a shockingly complex language .
The President of the United States travels down Pennsylvania Avenue to rally the House Democratic Caucus .
He does so without a TelePrompTer and without a prepared text ( which puts THAT stupid meme to bed , does n’t it ? ) , and makes a rousing , emotional plea to pass the damned bill .
OK , he did n’t say that .
But he did say this :
Sometimes I think about how I got involved in politics .
I did n’t think of myself as a potential politician when I get out of college .
I went to work in neighborhoods , working with Catholic churches in poor neighborhoods in Chicago , trying to figure out how people could get a little bit of help .
And I was skeptical about politics and politicians , just like a lot of Americans are skeptical about politics and politicians are right now .
Because my working assumption was when push comes to shove , all too often folks in elected office , they ’re looking for themselves and not looking out for the folks who put them there ; that there are too many compromises ; that the special interests have too much power ; they just got too much clout ; there ’s too much big money washing around .
And I decided finally to get involved because I realized if I was n’t willing to step up and be true to the things I believe in , then the system would n’t change .
Every single one of you had that same kind of moment at the beginning of your careers .
Maybe it was just listening to stories in your neighborhood about what was happening to people who ’d been laid off of work .
Maybe it was your own family experience , somebody got sick and did n’t have health care and you said something should change .
Something inspired you to get involved , and something inspired you to be a Democrat instead of running as a Republican .
Because somewhere deep in your heart you said to yourself , I believe in an America in which we do n’t just look out for ourselves , that we do n’t just tell people you ’re on your own , that we are proud of our individualism , we are proud of our liberty , but we also have a sense of neighborliness and a sense of community — ( applause ) — and we are willing to look out for one another and help people who are vulnerable and help people who are down on their luck and give them a pathway to success and give them a ladder into the middle class .
That ’s why you decided to run .
( Applause . )
And now a lot of us have been here a while and everybody here has taken their lumps and their bruises .
And it turns out people have had to make compromises , and you ’ve been away from families for a long time and you ’ve missed special events for your kids sometimes .
And maybe there have been times where you asked yourself , why did I ever get involved in politics in the first place ?
And maybe things ca n’t change after all .
And when you do something courageous , it turns out sometimes you may be attacked .
And sometimes the very people you thought you were trying to help may be angry at you and shout at you .
And you say to yourself , maybe that thing that I started with has been lost .
But you know what ?
Every once in a while , every once in a while a moment comes where you have a chance to vindicate all those best hopes that you had about yourself , about this country , where you have a chance to make good on those promises that you made in all those town meetings and all those constituency breakfasts and all that traveling through the district , all those people who you looked in the eye and you said , you know what , you ’re right , the system is not working for you and I ’m going to make it a little bit better .
And this is one of those moments .
If you have n’t heard by now , it ’s true : after nearly a decade serving the wonderful people of Wallingford and beyond , the Grizzled Wizard is calling it quits .
It ’s been a great run and it was our pleasure being here for you .
It ’s no exaggeration to say that we have the best goddamn customers , and many of whom are practically family to the staff , and to each other .
Our last day of operations will be Tuesday , December 31st , exactly 10 years to the day from when we got the keys to what would become The Most Extreme Dive in the Multiverse™ .
You may know someone who is guilty of it and not even aware of it .
It is one of the many ways that the discounting , stereotyping and stigma of mental disorders is perpetuated .
It is discriminatory , in the same way that sexism and racism are .
It is one of the ways the media distorts the symptoms of mental illness to suit the ends of comedy and drama .
And it is dangerous .
Very dangerous .
Well , what is it , then ?
What is clinomorphism ?
Clinomorphism is the deliberate or unintentional simplification , alteration , exaggeration , or amplification of the term for a medical condition , usually for dramatic effect :
It simplifies by using a caricature to which sufferers of ( or care providers for those with ) the condition may object vehemently .
to which sufferers of ( or care providers for those with ) the condition may object vehemently .
It amplifies and exaggerates by the frequent over - use of a medical term , in the absence of genuine symptoms .
of genuine symptoms .
It shows the leakage of misunderstood medical terminology into popular language , most often in a caricatured or stereotypical manner .
What are some examples of clinomorphism ?
The simplest example is panic attacks .
Panic attacks are a real psychological disorder .
The sufferer experiences a sudden , devastating attack of choked breathing , pounding heart , wrenching muscle tension and other mental and physical symptoms .
It is no joke .
Yet many people will describe their having a “ panic attack ” when they mean they had a moment of unpleasant surprise , embarrassment or confusion .
This diminishes the very real suffering of people who have Panic Disorder , whose lives can be wrecked by it .
One of the most frequent use of clinomorphisms is the confusion between the symptoms of Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) and Obsessive - Compulsive Personality Disorder ( OCPD ) .
These are entirely different psychological diagnoses that the media and the public confuse .
How many times have you heard someone described as being picky and pedantic about something as “ OCD ? ”
That ’s wrong , wrong , wrong .
Those are symptoms of OCPD .
And how many offhand remarks have you heard about someone being “ OCD ” who checks that the front door is locked ?
While checking and rechecking are a symptom of OCD , the use of the term without the person ’s having genuine symptoms is a clinomorphism .
People with schizophrenia are commonly referred to by the public and the media as having “ split personalities . ”
That is a symptom of Dissociative Identity Disorder , not schizophrenia .
And that schizophrenics see hallucinations , when the vast majority who experience hallucinations have the auditory type .
Two more examples of clinomorphisms .
And we laugh at geeks all the time .
However , the media continually misapplies mental disease labels to geeks who are actually displaying only variants of normal behavior .
For example , Wired Magazine published an article in 2001 entitled “ The Geek Syndrome ” in which they speculated that geeks displayed the signs of autism or Asperger ’s Syndrome .
While shyness , lack of athletic ability or social skills , and intellectual interests may be unusual to some , they definitely are not signs of autism or Asperger ’s syndrome .
This is an example of the media ’s clinomorphism .
Do clinomorphisms just result in hurt feelings , or are they dangerous ?
Sure , clinomorphisms hurt people ’s feelings and make them and their caregivers hopping mad .
But dangerous ?
Yes , definitely .
First , let ’s recap what clinomorphisms do :
They make people assign false labels to themselves and others based on half - knowledge and cultural mythology .
Every headache is a ” migraine , ” every reaction to a surprise is a “ panic attack . ”
And clinomorphisms make people distill real symptoms into something that is culturally acceptable , easily understood , and completely false .
They make the ridiculing and discounting of the symptoms of mental disorders easy and almost unavoidable .
So , people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) are simply “ malingering . ”
Those with Generalized Anxiety Disorder are “ worry warts . ”
People with ADHD are being “ disobedient . ”
And those with dyslexia become “ stupid . ”
People who have Social Phobia are only “ very shy . ”
Clinomorphisms promote such statements as “ just snap out of it , ” and “ get a grip ” when these people need professional treatment .
Because clinomorphisms have become the cultural standard , the sufferers themselves think of themselves in these terms .
Thus , the person with PTSD thinks that they can “ just snap out of it ” and that they are a malingerer for not being able to do so .
Clinomorphisms are responsible for many , many people not getting the mental health care they so desperately need !
So what ’s to be done ?
Just as all politics are local , all change starts with you .
In the same way that you filter your speech to remove sexism and racism , you can monitor your speech to avoid clinomorphisms .
And you can help other people be aware of what they are inadvertently saying .
If you are really worked up about this , as I am , you can write to the media outlets when you see examples of clinomorphisms in the media .
Clinomorphisms only continue the stigma of mental illness , and only reinforce discrimination against people who suffer with it .
You can do something about it !
What do you think ?
I know I have uttered many clinomorphisms in my life and now regret it .
How about you ?
Can you detect clinomorphisms in the media ?
Am I making a mountain out of a molehill with all this clinomorphism stuff ?

Falling Debt Dynamite Dominoes , The Coming Financial Catastrophe
Understanding the Nature of the Global Economic Crisis -
The people have been lulled into a false sense of safety under the rouse of a perceived “ economic recovery . ”
Unfortunately , what the majority of people think does not make it so , especially when the people making the key decisions think and act to the contrary .
The sovereign debt crises that have been unfolding in the past couple years and more recently in Greece , are canaries in the coal mine for the rest of Western “ civilization . ”
The crisis threatens to spread to Spain , Portugal and Ireland ; like dominoes , one country after another will collapse into a debt and currency crisis , all the way to America .
In October 2008 , the mainstream media and politicians of the Western world were warning of an impending depression if actions were not taken to quickly prevent this .
The problem was that this crisis had been a long - time coming , and what ’s worse , is that the actions governments took did not address any of the core , systemic issues and problems with the global economy ; they merely set out to save the banking industry from collapse .
To do this , governments around the world implemented massive “ stimulus ” and “ bailout ” packages , plunging their countries deeper into debt to save the banks from themselves , while charging it to people of the world .
Then an uproar of stock market speculation followed , as money was pumped into the stocks , but not the real economy .
This recovery has been nothing but a complete and utter illusion , and within the next two years , the illusion will likely come to a complete collapse .
The governments gave the banks a blank check , charged it to the public , and now it ’s time to pay ; through drastic tax increases , social spending cuts , privatization of state industries and services , dismantling of any protective tariffs and trade regulations , and raising interest rates .
The effect that this will have is to rapidly accelerate , both in the speed and volume , the unemployment rate , globally .
The stock market would crash to record lows , where governments would be forced to freeze them altogether .
When the crisis is over , the middle classes of the western world will have been liquidated of their economic , political and social status .
The global economy will have gone through the greatest consolidation of industry and banking in world history leading to a system in which only a few corporations and banks control the global economy and its resources ; governments will have lost that right .
The people of the western world will be treated by the financial oligarchs as they have treated the ‘ global South ’ and in particular , Africa ; they will remove our social structures and foundations so that we become entirely subservient to their dominance over the economic and political structures of our society .
This is where we stand today , and is the road on which we travel .
The western world has been plundered into poverty , a process long underway , but with the unfolding of the crisis , will be rapidly accelerated .
As our societies collapse in on themselves , the governments will protect the banks and multinationals .
When the people go out into the streets , as they invariably do and will , the government will not come to their aid , but will come with police and military forces to crush the protests and oppress the people .
The social foundations will collapse with the economy , and the state will clamp down to prevent the people from constructing a new one .
The road to recovery is far from here .
When the crisis has come to an end , the world we know will have changed dramatically .
No one ever grows up in the world they were born into ; everything is always changing .
Now is no exception .
The only difference is , that we are about to go through the most rapid changes the world has seen thus far .
Assessing the Illusion of Recovery
In August of 2009 , I wrote an article , Entering the Greatest Depression in History , in which I analyzed how there is a deep systemic crisis in the Capitalist system in which we have gone through merely one burst bubble thus far , the housing bubble , but there remains a great many others .
There remains as a significantly larger threat than the housing collapse , a commercial real estate bubble .
As the Deutsche Bank CEO said in May of 2009 , “ It 's either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning . ”
Of even greater significance is what has been termed the “ bailout bubble ” in which governments have superficially inflated the economies through massive debt - inducing bailout packages .
As of July of 2009 , the government watchdog and investigator of the US bailout program stated that the U.S. may have put itself at risk of up to $ 23.7 trillion dollars .
[ See : Andrew Gavin Marshall , Entering the Greatest Depression in History .
Global Research : August 7 , 2009 ]
In October of 2009 , approximately one year following the “ great panic ” of 2008 , I wrote an article titled , The Economic Recovery is an Illusion , in which I analyzed what the most prestigious and powerful financial institution in the world , the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) , had to say about the crisis and “ recovery . ”
The BIS , as well as its former chief economist , who had both correctly predicted the crisis that unfolded in 2008 , were warning of a future crisis in the global economy , citing the fact that none of the key issues and structural problems with the economy had been changed , and that government bailouts may do more harm than good in the long run .
William
White , former Chief Economist of the BIS , warned :
The world has not tackled the problems at the heart of the economic downturn and is likely to slip back into recession .
[ He ] warned that government actions to help the economy in the short run may be sowing the seeds for future crises .

Crying Wolf or Castigating Cassandra ?
While people were being lulled into a false sense of security , prominent voices warning of the harsh bite of reality to come were , instead of being listened to , berated and pushed aside by the mainstream media .
Gerald Celente , who accurately predicted the economic crisis of 2008 and who had been warning of a much larger crisis to come , had been accused by the mainstream media of pushing “ pessimism porn . ” [ 1 ]
Celente ’s response has been that he is n’t pushing “ pessimism porn , ” but that he refuses to push “ optimism opium ” of which the mainstream media does so outstandingly .
So , are these voices of criticism merely “ crying wolf ” or is it that the media is out to “ castigate Cassandra ” ?
Cassandra , in Greek mythology , was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy , who was granted by the God Apollo the gift of prophecy .
She prophesied and warned the Trojans of the Trojan Horse , the death of Agamemnon and the destruction of Troy .
When she warned the Trojans , they simply cast her aside as “ mad ” and did not heed her warnings .
While those who warn of a future economic crisis may not have been granted the gift of prophecy from Apollo , they certainly have the ability of comprehension .
So what do the Cassandras of the world have to say today ?
Should we listen ?
Empire and Economics
To understand the global economic crisis , we must understand the global causes of the economic crisis .
We must first determine how we got to the initial crisis , from there , we can critically assess how governments responded to the outbreak of the crisis , and thus , we can determine where we currently stand , and where we are likely headed .
Africa and much of the developing world was released from the socio-political - economic restraints of the European empires throughout the 1950s and into the 60s .
Africans began to try to take their nations into their own hands .
At the end of World War II , the United States was the greatest power in the world .
It had command of the United Nations , the World Bank and the IMF , as well as setting up the NATO military alliance .
The US dollar reigned supreme , and its value was tied to gold .
In 1954 , Western European elites worked together to form an international think tank called the Bilderberg Group , which would seek to link the political economies of Western Europe and North America .
Every year , roughly 130 of the most powerful people in academia , media , military , industry , banking , and politics would meet to debate and discuss key issues related to the expansion of Western hegemony over the world and the re-shaping of world order .
They undertook , as one of their key agendas , the formation of the European Union and the Euro currency unit .
[ See : Andrew Gavin Marshall , Controlling the Global Economy : Bilderberg , the Trilateral Commission and the Federal Reserve .
Global Research : August 3 , 2009 ]
In 1971 , Nixon abandoned the dollar ’s link to gold , which meant that the dollar no longer had a fixed exchange rate , but would change according to the whims and choices of the Federal Reserve ( the central bank of the United States ) .
One key individual that was responsible for this choice was the third highest official in the U.S. Treasury Department at the time , Paul Volcker . [ 2 ]
Volcker got his start as a staff economist at the New York Federal Reserve Bank in the early 50s .
After five years there , “ David Rockefeller ’s Chase Bank lured him away . ” [ 3 ]
So in 1957 , Volcker went to work at Chase , where Rockefeller “ recruited him as his special assistant on a congressional commission on money and credit in America and for help , later , on an advisory commission to the Treasury Department . ” [ 4 ]
In the early 60s , Volcker went to work in the Treasury Department , and returned to Chase in 1965 “ as an aide to Rockefeller , this time as vice president dealing with international business . ”
With Nixon entering the White House , Volcker got the third highest job in the Treasury Department .
This put him at the center of the decision making process behind the dissolution of the Bretton Woods agreement by abandoning the dollar ’s link to gold in 1971 . [ 5 ]
In 1973 , David Rockefeller , the then - Chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank and President of the Council on Foreign Relations , created the Trilateral Commission , which sought to expand upon the Bilderberg Group .
It was an international think tank , which would include elites from Western Europe , North America , and Japan , and was to align a “ trilateral ” political economic partnership between these regions .
It was to further the interests and hegemony of the Western controlled world order .
That same year , the Petri-dish experiment of neoliberalism was undertaken in Chile .
While a leftist government was coming to power in Chile , threatening the economic interests of not only David Rockefeller ’s bank , but a number of American corporations , David Rockefeller set up meetings between Henry Kissinger , Nixon ’s National Security Adviser , and a number of leading corporate industrialists .
Kissinger in turn , set up meetings between these individuals and the CIA chief and Nixon himself .
Within a short while , the CIA had begun an operation to topple the government of Chile .
On September 11 , 1973 , a Chilean General , with the help of the CIA , overthrew the government of Chile and installed a military dictatorship that killed thousands .
The day following the coup , a plan for an economic restructuring of Chile was on the president ’s desk .
The economic advisers from the University of Chicago , where the ideas of Milton Freidman poured out , designed the restructuring of Chile along neoliberal lines .
Neoliberalism was thus born in violence .
In 1973 , a global oil crisis hit the world .
This was the result of the Yom Kippur War , which took place in the Middle East in 1973 .
However , much more covertly , it was an American strategem .
Right when the US dropped the dollar ’s peg to gold , the State Department had quietly begun pressuring Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to increase the price of oil .
At the 1973 Bilderberg meeting , held six months before the oil price rises , a 400 % increase in the price of oil was discussed .
The discussion was over what to do with the large influx of what would come to be called “ petrodollars , ” the oil revenues of the OPEC nations .
Henry Kissinger worked behind the scenes in 1973 to ensure a war would take place in the Middle East , which happened in October .
Then , the OPEC nations drastically increased the price of oil .
Many newly industrializing nations of the developing world , free from the shackles of overt political and economic imperialism , suddenly faced a problem : oil is the lifeblood of an industrial society and it is imperative in the process of development and industrialization .
If they were to continue to develop and industrialize , they would need the money to afford to do so .
Concurrently , the oil producing nations of the world were awash with petrodollars , bringing in record surpluses .
However , to make a profit , the money would need to be invested .
This is where the Western banking system came to the scene .
With the loss of the dollar ’s link to cold , the US currency could flow around the world at a much faster rate .
The price of oil was tied to the price of the US dollar , and so oil was traded in US dollars .
OPEC nations thus invested their oil money into Western banks , which in turn , would “ recycle ” that money by loaning it to the developing nations of the world in need of financing industrialization .
It seemed like a win - win situation : the oil nations make money , invest it in the West , which loans it to the South , to be able to develop and build “ western ” societies .
However , all things do not end as fairy tales , especially when those in power are threatened .
An industrialized and developed ‘ Global South ’ ( Latin America , Africa , and parts of Asia ) would not be a good thing for the established Western elites .
If they wanted to maintain their hegemony over the world , they must prevent the rise of potential rivals , especially in regions so rich in natural resources and the global supplies of energy .
It was at this time that the United States initiated talks with China .
The “ opening ” of China was to be a Western project of expanding Western capital into China .
China will be allowed to rise only so much as the West allows it .
The Chinese elite were happy to oblige with the prospect of their own growth in political and economic power .
India and Brazil also followed suit , but to a smaller degree than that of China .
China and India were to brought within the framework of the Trilateral partnership , and in time , both China and India would have officials attending meetings of the Trilateral Commission .
So money flowed around the world , primarily in the form of the US dollar .
Foreign central banks would buy US Treasuries ( debts ) as an investment , which would also show faith in the strength of the US dollar and economy .
The hegemony of the US dollar reached around the world .
The Hegemony of Neoliberalism
In 1977 , however , a new US administration came to power under the Presidency of Jimmy Carter , who was himself a member of the Trilateral Commission .
With his administration , came another roughly two - dozen members of the Trilateral Commission to fill key positions within his government .
In 1973 , Paul Volcker , the rising star through Chase Manhattan and the Treasury Department became a member of the Trilateral Commission .
In 1975 , he was made President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , the most powerful of the 12 regional Fed banks .
In 1979 , Jimmy Carter gave the job of Treasury Secretary to the former Governor of the Federal Reserve System , and in turn , David Rockefeller recommended Jimmy Carter appoint Paul Volcker as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board , which Carter quickly did . [ 6 ]
In 1979 , the price of oil skyrocketed again .
This time , Paul Volcker at the Fed was to take a different approach .
His response was to drastically increase interest rates .
Interest rates went from 2 % in the late 70s to 18 % in the early 1980s .
The effect this had was that the US economy went into recession , and greatly reduced its imports from developing nations .
A the same time , developing nations , who had taken on heavy debt burdens to finance industrialization , suddenly found themselves having to pay 18 % interest payments on their loans .
The idea that they could borrow heavily to build an industrial society , which would in turn pay off their loans , had suddenly come to a halt .
As the US dollar had spread around the world in the forms of petrodollars and loans , the decisions that the Fed made would affect the entire world .
In 1982 , Mexico announced that it could no longer service its debt , and defaulted on its loans .
This marked the spread of the 1980s debt crisis , which spread throughout Latin America and across the continent of Africa .
Suddenly , much of the developing world was plunged into crisis .
Thus , the IMF and World Bank entered the scene with their newly developed “ Structural Adjustment Programs ” ( SAPs ) , which would encompass a country in need signing an agreement , the SAP , which would provide the country with a loan from the IMF , as well as “ development ” projects by the World Bank .
In turn , the country would have to undergo a neoliberal restructuring of its country .
Neoliberalism spread out of America and Britain in the 1980s ; through their financial empires and instruments – including the World Bank and IMF – they spread the neoliberal ideology around the globe .
Countries that resisted neoliberalism were subjected to “ regime change ” .
This would occur through financial manipulation , via currency speculation or the hegemonic monetary policies of the Western nations , primarily the United States ; economic sanctions , via the United Nations or simply done on a bilateral basis ; covert regime change , through “ colour revolutions ” or coups , assassinations ; and sometimes overt military campaigns and war .
The neoliberal ideology consisted in what has often been termed “ free market fundamentalism . ”
This would entail a massive wave of privatization , in which state assets and industries are privatized in order to become economically “ more productive and efficient . ”
This would have the social effect of leading to the firing of entire areas of the public sector , especially health and education as well as any specially protected national industries , which for many poor nations meant vital natural resources .
Then , the market would be “ liberalized ” which meant that restrictions and impediments to foreign investments in the nation would diminish by reducing or eliminating trade barriers and tariffs ( taxes ) , and thus foreign capital ( Western corporations and banks ) would be able to invest in the country easily , while national industries that grow and “ compete ” would be able to more easily invest in other nations and industries around the world .
The Central Bank of the nation would then keep interest rates artificially low , to allow for the easier movement of money in and out of the country .
The effect of this would be that foreign multinational corporations and international banks would be able to easily buy up the privatized industries , and thus , buy up the national economy .
Simultaneously major national industries may be allowed to grow and work with the global banks and corporations .
This would essentially oligopolize the national economy , and bring it within the sphere of influence of the “ global economy ” controlled by and for the Western elites .
The European empires had imposed upon Africa and many other colonized peoples around the world a system of ‘ indirect rule ’ , in which local governance structures were restructured and reorganized into a system where the local population is governed by locals , but for the western colonial powers .
Thus , a local elite is created , and they enrich themselves through the colonial system , so they have no interest in challenging the colonial powers , but instead seek to protect their own interests , which happen to be the interests of the empire .
In the era of globalization , the leaders of the ‘ Third World ’ have been co-opted and their societies reorganized by and for the interests of the globalized elites .
This is a system of indirect rule , and the local elites becoming ‘ indirect globalists ’ ; they have been brought within the global system and structures of empire .
Following a Structural Adjustment Program , masses of people would be left unemployed ; the prices of essential commodities such as food and fuel would increase , sometimes by hundreds of percentiles , while the currency lost its value .
Poverty would spread and entire sectors of the economy would be shut down .
In the “ developing ” world of Asia , Latin America and Africa , these policies were especially damaging .
With no social safety nets to fall into , the people would go hungry ; the public state was dismantled .
When it came to Africa , the continent so rapidly de-industrialized throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s that poverty increased by incredible degrees .
With that , conflict would spread .
In the 1990s , as the harsh effects of neoliberal policies were easily and quickly seen on the African continent , the main notion pushed through academia , the media , and policy circles was that the state of Africa was due to the “ mismanagement ” by Africans .
The blame was put solely on the national governments .
While national political and economic elites did become complicit in the problems , the problems were imposed from beyond the continent , not from within .
Thus , in the 1990s , the notion of “ good governance ” became prominent .
This was the idea that in return for loans and “ help ” from the IMF and World Bank , nations would need to undertake reforms not only of the economic sector , but also to create the conditions of what the west perceived as “ good governance . ”
However , in neoliberal parlance , “ good governance ” implies “ minimal governance ” , and governments still had to dismantle their public sectors .
They simply had to begin applying the illusion of democracy , through the holding of elections and allowing for the formation of a civil society .
“ Freedom ” however , was still to maintain simply an economic concept , in that the nation would be “ free ” for Western capital to enter into .
While massive poverty and violence spread across the continent , people were given the “ gift ” of elections .
They would elect one leader , who would then be locked into an already pre-determined economic and political structure .
The political leaders would enrich themselves at the expense of others , and then be thrown out at the next election , or simply fix the elections .
This would continue , back and forth , all the while no real change would be allowed to take place .
Western imposed “ democracy ” had thus failed .
An article in a 2002 edition of International Affairs , the journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs ( the British counter - part to the Council on Foreign Relations ) , wrote that :
In 1960 the average income of the top 20 per cent of the world ’s population was 30 times that of the bottom 20 per cent .
By 1990 it was 60 times , ad by 1997 , 74 times that of the lowest fifth .
Today the assets of the top three billionaires are more than the combined GNP [ Gross National Product ] of all least developed countries and their 600 million people .
This has been the context in which there has been an explosive growth in the presence of Western as well as local non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) in Africa .
NGOs today form a prominent part of the ‘ development machine ’ , a vast institutional and disciplinary nexus of official agencies , practitioners , consultants , scholars and other miscellaneous experts producing and consuming knowledge about the ‘ developing world ’ .
[. . . ]
Aid ( in which NGOs have come to play a significant role ) is frequently portrayed as a form of altruism , a charitable act that enables wealth to flow from rich to poor , poverty to be reduced and the poor to be empowered . [ 7 ]
The authors then explained that NGOs have a peculiar evolution in Africa :
[ T[heir role in ‘ development ’ represents a continuity of the work of their precursors , the missionaries and voluntary organizations that cooperated in Europe ’s colonization and control of Africa .
Today their work contributes marginally to the relief of poverty , but significantly to undermining the struggle of African people to emancipate themselves from economic , social and political oppression . [ 8 ]
The authors examined how with the spread of neoliberalism , the notion of a “ minimalist state ” spread across the world and across Africa .
Thus , they explain , the IMF and World Bank “ became the new commanders of post - colonial economies . ”
However , these efforts were not imposed without resistance , as , “ Between 1976 and 1992 there were 146 protests against IMF - supported austerity measures [ SAPs ] in 39 countries around the world . ”
Usually , however , governments responded with brute force , violently oppressing demonstrations .
However , the widespread opposition to these “ reforms ” needed to be addressed by major organizations and “ aid ” agencies in re-evaluating their approach to ‘ development ’ : [ 9 ]
The outcome of these deliberations was the ‘ good governance ’ agenda in the 1990s and the decision to co-opt NGOs and other civil society organizations to a repackaged programme of welfare provision , a social initiative that could be more accurately described as a programme of social control .
The result was to implement the notion of ‘ pluralism ’ in the form of ‘ multipartyism ’ , which only ended up in bringing “ into the public domain the seething divisions between sections of the ruling class competing for control of the state . ”
As for the ‘ welfare initiatives ’ , the bilateral and multilateral aid agencies set aside significant funds for addressing the “ social dimensions of adjustment , ” which would “ minimize the more glaring inequalities that their policies perpetuated . ”
This is where the growth of NGOs in Africa rapidly accelerated . [ 10 ]
Africa had again , become firmly enraptured in the cold grip of imperialism .
Conflicts in Africa would be stirred up by imperial foreign powers , often using ethnic divides to turn the people against each other , using the political leaders of African nations as vassals submissive to Western hegemony .
War and conflict would spread , and with it , so too would Western capital and the multinational corporation .
Building a ‘ New ’ Economy
While the developing world fell under the heavy sword of Western neoliberal hegemony , the Western industrialized societies experienced a rapid growth of their own economic strength .
It was the Western banks and multinational corporations that spread into and took control of the economies of Africa , Latin America , Asia , and with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 , Eastern Europe and Central Asia .
Russia opened itself up to Western finance , and the IMF and World Bank swept in and imposed neoliberal restructuring , which led to a collapse of the Russian economy , and enrichment of a few billionaire oligarchs who own the Russian economy , and who are intricately connected with Western economic interests ; again , ‘ indirect globalists ’ .
As the Western financial and commercial sectors took control of the vast majority of the world ’s resources and productive industries , amassing incredible profits , they needed new avenues in which to invest .
Out of this need for a new road to capital accumulation ( making money ) , the US Federal Reserve stepped in to help out .
The Federal Reserve in the 1990s began to ease interest rates lower and lower to again allow for the easier spread of money .
This was the era of ‘ globalization , ’ where proclamations of a “ New World Order ” emerged .
Regional trading blocs and “ free trade ” agreements spread rapidly , as world systems of political and economic structure increasingly grew out of the national structure and into a supra-national form .
The North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) was implemented in an “ economic constitution for North America ” as Reagan referred to it .
Regionalism had emerged as the next major phase in the construction of the New World Order , with the European Union being at the forefront .
The world economy was ‘ globalized ’ and so too , would the political structure follow , on both regional and global levels .
The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) was formed to maintain and enshrine global neoliberal constitution for trade .
All through this time , a truly global ruling class emerged , the Transnational Capitalist Class ( TCC ) , or global elite , which constituted a singular international class .
However , as the wealth and power of elites grew , everyone else suffered .
The middle class had been subjected to a quiet dismantling .
In the Western developed nations , industries and factories closed down , relocating to cheap Third World countries to exploit their labour , then sell the products in the Western world cheaply .
Our living standards in the West began to fall , but because we could buy products for cheaper , no one seemed to complain .
We continued to consume , and we used credit and debt to do so .
The middle class existed only in theory , but was in fact , beholden to the shackles of debt .
The Clinton administration used ‘ globalization ’ as its grand strategy throughout the 1990s , facilitating the decline of productive capital ( as in , money that flows into production of goods and services ) , and implemented the rise finance capital ( money made on money ) .
Thus , financial speculation became one of the key tools of economic expansion .
This is what was termed the “ financialization ” of the economy .
To allow this to occur , the Clinton administration actively worked to deregulate the banking sector .
The Glass - Steagle Act , put in place by FDR in 1933 to prevent commercial banks from merging with investment banks and engaging in speculation , ( which in large part caused the Great Depression ) , was slowly dismantled through the coordinated efforts of America ’s largest banks , the Federal Reserve , and the US Treasury Department .
Thus , a massive wave of consolidation took place , as large banks ate smaller banks , corporations merged , where banks and corporations stopped being American or European and became truly global .
Some of the key individuals that took part in the dismantling of Glass - Steagle and the expansion of ‘ financialization ’ were Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve and Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers at the Treasury Department , now key officials in Obama ’s economic team .
This era saw the rise of ‘ derivatives ’ which are ‘ complex financial instruments ’ that essentially act as short - term insurance policies , betting and speculating that an asset price or commodity would go up or go down in value , allowing money to be made on whether stocks or prices go up or down .
However , it was n’t called ‘ insurance ’ because ‘ insurance ’ has to be regulated .
Thus , it was referred to as derivatives trade , and organizations called Hedge Funds entered the picture in managing the global trade in derivatives .
The stock market would go up as speculation on future profits drove stocks higher and higher , inflating a massive bubble in what was termed a ‘ virtual economy . ’
The Federal Reserve facilitated this , as it had previously done in the lead - up to the Great Depression , by keeping interest rates artificially low , and allowing for easy - flowing money into the financial sector .
The Federal Reserve thus inflated the ‘ dot - com ’ bubble of the technology sector .
When this bubble burst , the Federal Reserve , with Allen Greenspan at the helm , created the “ housing bubble . ”
The Federal Reserve maintained low interest rates and actively encouraged and facilitated the flow of money into the housing sector .
Banks were given free reign and actually encouraged to make loans to high - risk individuals who would never be able to pay back their debt .
Again , the middle class existed only in the myth of the ‘ free market ’ .
Concurrently , throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s , the role of speculation as a financial instrument of war became apparent .
Within the neoliberal global economy , money could flow easily into and out of countries .
Thus , when confidence weakens in the prospect of one nation ’s economy , there can be a case of ‘ capital flight ’ where foreign investors sell their assets in that nation ’s currency and remove their capital from that country .
This results in an inevitable collapse of the nations economy .
This happened to Mexico in 1994 , in the midst of joining NAFTA , where international investors speculated against the Mexican peso , betting that it would collapse ; they cashed in their pesos for dollars , which devalued the peso and collapsed the Mexican economy .
This was followed by the East Asian financial crisis in 1997 , where throughout the 1990s , Western capital had penetrated East Asian economies speculating in real estate and the stock markets .
However , this resulted in over - investment , as the real economy , ( production , manufacturing , etc. ) could not keep up with speculative capital .
Thus , Western capital feared a crisis , and began speculating against the national currencies of East Asian economies , which triggered devaluation and a financial panic as capital fled from East Asia into Western banking sectors .
The economies collapsed and then the IMF came in to ‘ restructure ’ them accordingly .
The same strategy was undertaken with Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2001 .
Throughout the 2000s , the housing bubble was inflated beyond measure , and around the middle of the decade , when the indicators emerged of a crisis in the housing market a commercial real estate bubble was formed .
This bubble has yet to burst .
The 2007 -2008 Financial Crisis
In 2007 , the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) , the most prestigious financial institution in the world and the central bank to the world ’s central banks , issued a warning that the world is on the verge of another Great Depression , “ citing mass issuance of new - fangled credit instruments , soaring levels of household debt , extreme appetite for risk shown by investors , and entrenched imbalances in the world currency system . ” [ 11 ]
As the housing bubble began to collapse , the commodity bubble was inflated , where money went increasingly into speculation , the stock market , and the price of commodities soared , such as with the massive increases in the price of oil between 2007 and 2008 .
In September of 2007 , a medium - sized British Bank called Northern Rock , a major partaker in the loans of bad mortgages which turned out to be worthless , sought help from the Bank of England , which led to a run on the bank and investor panic .
In February of 2008 , the British government bought and nationalized Northern Rock .
In March of 2008 , Bear Stearns , an American bank that had been a heavy lender in the mortgage real estate market , went into crisis .
On March 14 , 2008 , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York worked with J.P. Morgan Chase ( whose CEO is a board member of the NY Fed ) to provide Bear Stearns with an emergency loan .
However , they quickly changed their mind , and the CEO of JP Morgan Chase , working with the President of the New York Fed , Timothy Geithner , and the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ( former CEO of Goldman Sachs ) , forced Bear Stearns to sell itself to JP Morgan Chase for $ 2 a share , which had previously traded at $ 172 a share in January of 2007 .
The merger was paid for by the Federal Reserve of New York , and charged to the US taxpayer .
In June of 2008 , the BIS again warned of an impending Great Depression . [ 12 ]
In September of 2008 , the US government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two major home mortgage corporations .
The same month , the global bank Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy , giving the signal that no one is safe and that the entire economy was on the verge of collapse .
Lehman was a major dealer in the US Treasury Securities market and was heavily invested in home mortgages .
Lehman filed for bankruptcy on September 15 , 2008 , marking the largest bankruptcy in US history .
A wave of bank consolidation spread across the United States and internationally .
The big banks became much bigger as Bank of America swallowed Merrill Lynch , JP Morgan ate Washington Mutual , and Wells Fargo took over Wachovia .
In November of 2008 , the US government bailed out the largest insurance company in the world , AIG .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , with Timothy Geithner at the helm :
[ Bought out ] , for about $ 30 billion , insurance contracts AIG sold on toxic debt securities to banks , including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Merrill Lynch & Co. , Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank AG , among others .
That decision , critics say , amounted to a back - door bailout for the banks , which received 100 cents on the dollar for contracts that would have been worth far less had AIG been allowed to fail .
As Bloomberg reported , since the New York Fed is quasi - governmental , as in , it is given government authority , but not subject to government oversight , and is owned by the banks that make up its board ( such as JP Morgan Chase ) , “ It ’s as though the New York Fed was a black - ops outfit for the nation ’s central bank . ” [ 13 ]
The Bailout
In the fall of 2008 , the Bush administration sought to implement a bailout package for the economy , designed to save the US banking system .
The leaders of the nation went into rabid fear mongering .
The President warned :
More banks could fail , including some in your community .
The stock market would drop even more , which would reduce the value of your retirement account .
The value of your home could plummet .
Foreclosures would rise dramatically .
The head of the Federal Reserve Board , Ben Bernanke , as well as Treasury Secretary Paulson , in late September warned of “ recession , layoffs and lost homes if Congress does n’t quickly approve the Bush administration ’s emergency $ 700 billion financial bailout plan . ” [ 14 ]
Seven months prior , in February of 2008 , prior to the collapse of Bear Stearns , both Bernanke and Paulson said “ the nation will avoid falling into recession . ” [ 15 ]
In September of 2008 , Paulson was saying that people “ should be scared . ” [ 16 ]
The bailout package was made into a massive financial scam , which would plunge the United States into unprecedented levels of debt , while pumping incredible amounts of money into major global banks .
The public was told , as was the Congress , that the bailout was worth $ 700 billion dollars .
However , this was extremely misleading , and a closer reading of the fine print would reveal much more , in that $ 700 billion is the amount that could be spent “ at any one time . ”
As Chris Martenson wrote :
This means that $ 700 billion is NOT the cost of this dangerous legislation , it is only the amount that can be outstanding at any one time .
After , say , $ 100 billion of bad mortgages are disposed of , another $ 100 billion can be bought .
In short , these four little words assure that there is NO LIMIT to the potential size of this bailout .
This means that $ 700 billion is a rolling amount , not a ceiling .
So what happens when you have vague language and an unlimited budget ?
Fraud and self - dealing .
Mark my words , this is the largest looting operation ever in the history of the US , and it's all spelled out right in this delightfully brief document that is about to be rammed through a scared Congress and made into law . [ 17 ]
Further , the proposed bill would “ raise the nation 's debt ceiling to $ 11.315 trillion from $ 10.615 trillion , ” and that the actions taken as a result of the passage of the bill would not be subject to investigation by the nation ’s court system , as it would “ bar courts from reviewing actions taken under its authority ” :
The Bush administration seeks “ dictatorial power unreviewable by the third branch of government , the courts , to try to resolve the crisis , ” said Frank Razzano , a former assistant chief trial attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission now at Pepper Hamilton LLP in Washington .
“ We are taking a huge leap of faith . ” [ 18 ]
Larisa Alexandrovna , writing with the Huffington Post , warned that the passage of the bailout bill will be the final nails in the coffin of the fascist coup over America , in the form of financial fascists :
This manufactured crisis is now to be remedied , if the fiscal fascists get their way , with the total transfer of Congressional powers ( the few that still remain ) to the Executive Branch and the total transfer of public funds into corporate ( via government as intermediary ) hands .
[. . . ]
The Treasury Secretary can buy broadly defined assets , on any terms he wants , he can hire anyone he wants to do it and can appoint private sector companies as financial deputies of the US government .
And he can write whatever regulation he thinks [ is ] needed .
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . [ 19 ]
At the same time , the US Federal Reserve was bailing out foreign banks of hundreds of billions of dollars , “ that are desperate for dollars and ca n’t access America ’s frozen credit markets – a move co-ordinated with central banks in Japan , the Eurozone , Switzerland , Canada and here in the UK . ” [ 20 ]
The moves would have been coordinated through the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) in Basle , Switzerland .
As Politico reported , “ foreign - based banks with big U.S. operations could qualify for the Treasury Department ’s mortgage bailout . ”
A Treasury Fact Sheet released by the US Department of Treasury stated that :
Participating financial institutions must have significant operations in the U.S. , unless the Secretary makes a determination , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , that broader eligibility is necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets . [ 21 ]
So , the bailout package would not only allow for the rescue of American banks , but any banks internationally , whether public or private , if the Treasury Secretary deemed it “ necessary ” , and that none of the Secretary ’s decisions could be reviewed or subjected to oversight of any kind .
Further , it would mean that the Treasury Secretary would have a blank check , but simply would n’t be able to hand out more than $ 700 billion “ at any one time . ”
In short , the bailout is in fact , a coup d’état by the banks over the government .
Many Congressmen were told that if they failed to pass the bailout package , they were threatened with martial law . [ 22 ]
Sure enough , Congress passed the bill , and the financial coup had been a profound success .
No wonder then , in early 2009 , one Congressman reported that the banks “ are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill .
And they frankly own the place . ” [ 23 ]
Another Congressman said that “ The banks run the place , ” and explained , “ I will tell you what the problem is - they give three times more money than the next biggest group .
It 's huge the amount of money they put into politics . ” [ 24 ]

I 'm still working on " Rule 34 " ( due from Ace in 2011 ) , but as some of you probably noticed I 've reached a stopping place in my Merchant Princes series ( published by Tor ) and need a break .
More importantly , I 've been ploughing a stony field for the past few years ; writing the same stuff time and again is draining .
So it should be no surprise to you to learn that I 've been discussing possible new projects with my agent for the past year .
There are other factors at work besides a lack of fresh ideas , of course .
We 've been taking a hard look at the market realities ; things have been particularly grim in SF / F publishing ever since November 2008 , and it has become clear that in light of a downward spiral of diminishing sales things can't go on as before .
The poor market conditions ( Tim Holman of Little , Brown says the British publishing industry as a whole shipped 1 % fewer books in 2009 ) are resulting in downward pressure on new book advances : as an agent of my acquaintance put it , with respect to advances , " five grand is the new twenty grand " .
Despite my editor 's kind offer to increase my advance by 50 % in real terms if I 'd accept payment in repossessed Hummer H2's , I am afraid that for me , the opportunity cost of producing science fiction has become too high relative to the untapped revenue potential inherent in other genres .
So it 's time to branch out .
Late last year my agent and I conducted an exhaustive review of my skill - set and background , to the extent of commissioning a focus group to look into my work to date and suggest new directions .
Readers commented favourably on the interpersonal romance subplots in the Merchant Princes series and the depiction of sexual relations in " Saturn 's Children " ; they also liked the paranormal elements in my Laundry novels , but expressed reservations about the tentacle count .
A/B testing of a series of book proposals yielded some interesting insights into why people read books carrying the Charles Stross brand , and what could be done to improve their sell - through and market penetration .
Finally , after a mammoth overnight brainstorming session , we put together a collection of new and extremely promising proposals for works that I feel are compatible with my interests and the reality of this age of changing market conditions we live in .
My agent issued a proposal package and deadline for auction among the most likely - to - be- interested New York publishing houses .
One thing led to another , by way of one of those whirlwind romances for which the publishing industry is famous , and we 're now engaged : I 'm pleased to announce my new five book deal , for a very strong six - digit sum , with one of the largest publishers in the United States !
Harlequin Romance will publish my first paranormal romance , " Unicorn School™ : The Sparkling " , in Q1/2012 .
US : TS is the first book of the projected series , and introduces Avril Poisson , who moves with her family from Phoenix , Arizona , to Forks , Washington with her divorced father , and finds her life in danger when she falls in love with a Sparkly Unicorn™ called Bob .
Stalked by and in fear of a mysterious horse - mutilator , Avril must practice her dressage skills with Bob and qualify her steed for a scholarship to the elite Unicorn School™ , where he will be safe to grow ( and sparkle ) without fear of the vampires who infest the senior 's common room .
In the second book , " Unicorn School™ : The Exsanguination " Bob and Avril must stalk a Vampire Unicorn ™ who is draining her fellow pupils of the will to live back to the rocky outcrop where he lives .
In book three , " Unicorn School™ : The Deflowering " , Bob and Avril confront their most ghastly foe yet , a moustache - twirling villain who is intent on seducing all the pupils ( as we all know , unicorn / human relationships are only possible if the human party is a virgin ) in order to sell their heart - broken steeds to evil French multinational meat conglomerate Hachette .
In book four , " Unicorn School™ : The Big Chill " the swindle that is global warming is exposed and , as glaciers pounce on the Louisiana Bayou , Avril and Bob are hunted by monstrous black - and - white swimming birds .
And in book five , " Unicorn School™ Forever " , our young lovers are going to get married — but not if the evil , bigoted anti-unicorn Sheriff Osama gets his anti-unicorn - marriage by - law passed first !
Editorial director Connie Cozened said , " we 're delighted to have Stross on board , bringing his inimitable style and fizzing dialogue to the fastest growing sector of the romance market !
( If only from a very small base . )
His Sparkly Romance Unicorns™ marketing concept is sure to be a massive summer hit with immense spin - off marketing potential , and we 've already been in discussions with Archie McPhee about co-branding .
Movie rights are still available , but hurry !
Stocks wo n't last ! "

Limiting their leverage is another way to begin defanging these monsters , Mr. Fisher said .
But he concedes that there is little will to do either .
“ It takes an enormous amount of political courage to say we are going to limit size and limit leverage , ” he said .
“ But to me it makes the ultimate sense .
The misuse of leverage is always the root cause of every financial crisis . ”
The idea for a special resolution authority appears to rest on the belief that large , troubled institutions cannot be allowed to go bankrupt because their collapse will cause other entities to fail .
Again , this seems exactly backward .
If imperiled banks are too large and interconnected to go through our nation ’s time - honored bankruptcy process , then they are too big to exist .
A TWO - TIERED system , where large entities are more equal than others , is also deeply unfair .
Smaller banks cannot hope to compete with institutions that have significant cost advantages .
“ Why should you have a small group of institutions get an advantage simply because they have grown too large ? ” Mr. Fisher asked .
“ It ’s un-American ; it ’s not what makes this country great . ”
Indeed , removing the subsidies awarded to big banks would give Main Street lenders — most of which did not bring the financial system to its knees — a chance to win market share .
Mr. Fisher also disputes the view often taken by defenders of the status quo that financial institutions hoping to compete for business in huge global markets must be gigantic .
“ There are those who say that America has to have the largest financial institutions to be an international player , ” he said .
“ But I do n’t think that ’s a strong argument .
Good companies will always find bankers and investors . ”
Edward Kane , a finance professor at Boston College and an authority on financial institutions and regulators , said that it was not surprising that substantive changes for both groups are not on the table .
After all , powerful banks want to maintain their ability to privatize gains and socialize losses .
“ To understand why defects in insolvency detection and resolution persist , analysts must acknowledge that large financial institutions invest in building and exercising political clout , ” Mr. Kane writes in an article , titled “ Defining and Controlling Systemic Risk , ” that he is scheduled to present next month at a Federal Reserve conference .
To the many and storied benefits of the Premier League revolution , chalk up the increasing requirement for committed fans to have a finance qualification .
" Three years ago , " reflects Everton supporter Dave Kelly , " if you 'd have said ' enabling grant ' to a supporter on the Goodison Road , they 'd have thought you were talking about Tony Grant 's brother . "
Tony Grant is a former Everton midfielder , should you be unfamiliar with his work , while his brother Enabling is viewed by some as the saviour of any number of successful football clubs who bafflingly find themselves financially embarrassed .
You can find local variants on this learning curve from Portsmouth to Manchester and beyond , among supporters to whom the men who remade football promised the moon on a stick .
As Kelly , chair of an Everton supporters ' association , puts it : " What has happened in football has politicised fans . "
It was never likely to do anything else in Liverpool Walton , a constituency within a city where sport and politics have long entwined , a relationship idealised in Bill Shankly 's passionate socialism but reaching its nadir in the continuing struggle to call authority to account for the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989 .
Within this Labour stronghold sit two Premier League clubs , Everton and Liverpool , the former chaired by Bill Kenwright , the latter owned — if owned does n't seem a quaint euphemism for the toxic cocktail of debt and leveraged buyout that these days constitutes purchase — by the American businessmen Tom Hicks and George Gillett .
After three years of broken promises over a new stadium , and increasingly bitter protests by supporters , it emerged on Saturday that a refinancing deal will lead to the sale of the club .
There are not believed to be plans to give the famous Shankly statue two new bronze friends .
On the Premier League form book , Liverpool could end up in the hands of Kim Jong - il or a mystery consortium of penniless sheikhs , but in the future , under an expected Labour manifesto pledge , clubs could be forced to hand a 25 % stake to fans in recognition of their importance to the local community .
If " forced " feels a little optimistic , given that the inevitable legal challenges would make legitimising the Iraq invasion look like a cakewalk , Liverpool Walton nevertheless feels a useful place to consider the impact of a policy under which FSA - recognised and audited supporters ' trusts would be responsible for fostering and maintaining links with the surrounding area .
Wander the dilapidated streets round Goodison Park and the fabled trickle - down of football riches is undetectable , while on the other side of Stanley Park , the contrast is even more grimly pronounced .
Most of the roads fanning out from Anfield are nothing but boarded - up houses , with unemployment running as high as 43 % .
The dissonance is not lost on Labour candidate Steve Rotheram , a former lord mayor of Liverpool who seeks to succeed the retiring Peter Kilfoyle as Walton MP .
" Should the football clubs want to , " he says , " they could have a major impact on the lives of the people most affected by their presence .
They do n't take corporate social responsibility as seriously as fans would like them to , but I have no doubt fan representation would articulate that and stand up for the local people . "
In the US , the radical sportswriter Dave Zirin has repeatedly highlighted the glaring contrast between almost spaceship - like stadia plonked down in cities to rake in money while deprived communities around them struggle to get by – a chasm most depressingly evident in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , which Zirin branded " a gruesome collision of sports and politics , as thousands sat stranded in a sports arena where most could never have afforded even the cheapest ticket " .
Football , as in the version without helmets , is different .
Roaming franchises do n't just blow into town : here , football clubs sprang from the streets and factories surrounding them and for decades remained firmly rooted in the communities .
Yet walking the eerily derelict streets round Anfield on a match day it is difficult not to conclude that football 's current model is dysfunctional .
" That two - way relationship [ between club and community ] was there , but it has gone , " laments James McKenna of the Liverpool supporters ' group Spirit of Shankly .
It should n't just be about football clubs progressing as businesses and leaving the communities behind in their wake , " concurs Dave Kelly .
" It should be hand in glove .
Big business has let both the clubs and the community down . "
Indeed , the hokey - cokey over the redevelopment or relocation of both grounds has paralysed much of Walton for years .
" They talk about this business model that 's awash with money , " says Kelly , " but in essence they have had the whole of north Liverpool on hold while the football clubs decide what to do .
These communities have served those clubs for decades – it's about time they put something back .
There 's a moral obligation .
' The people 's club ' should n't just be a banner draped off the Park End stand . "
Even so , despite inevitable local support for a supporter representation policy , it would be misleading to cast it as a vote - winner in an area where since 1992 , Labour has polled over 70 % .
To lose this one , Steve Rotheram would probably have to be found in flagrante with Gary Neville , and the policy is n't the talk of the doorstep .
" I 'm afraid , " he sighs , " that I 'm hearing mostly about the apathy towards politics and politicians . "

When I printed the recipe it cut off one ingredient so I have been making these without FLOUR all along .
My gluten free friends have been thrilled and everyone else has told me they 're the best brownies they 've ever had .
I also quadruple the salt , for what it 's worth .
I only discovered my error when a friend asked for the recipe , I sent it to her and she responded asking if I sent the right recipe because it did call for flour .
LOL .
I may try to make them once WITH the flour but I 'll likely stick to without .
Who 'da thunk it ?!

I said this a million times already but Ohayocon was a blast , mostly because of all the people that got to go .
I met so many new people and saw many familiar faces as well .
It was hard to keep up with everyone at times , I even almost lost my voice at the end of Friday because of all the talking I did .
Anyway here is a couple good shots EurobeatKing tookI Finished my Ordon sheath !
I love it to pieces , pics of that soon to come - construction notes :
The shield is made of blue insulation foam , high density foam for the border - hand sanded to the correct curved shape .
Two part epoxy clay was used to hand mold the raised details featured on the front of the shield .
I cut a large wood dowl rod to mount the leather strap with screws , and PVC pipe was for the handle ( all set in place by carving out the foam and using two part epoxy to keep it set in ) .
The bolts of the shield I had made a mold for and casted them out of polyurethane plastic .
The helmet base is paper - clay , two part epoxy for the raised details , and the side pieces were molded and casted out of polyurethane plastic .
For the scales I decided to go with craft foam as opposed to the actual metal scale - mail so that I could get the size of the scales accurate to the game .
Each craft foam scale was coated with one coat of white school glue , minwax silver polish , polyurethane , and fabric glue .
Some scales were reinforced with fabric backing in areas that would receive a lot of stress .
In the end I never really kept track of the final amount , but I estimate this costume cost ( at minimum ) $ 400 .
Each part took a good amount of time - I would say that the helmet was probably the most difficult out of the entire costume .
It was interesting trying to get the helmet to fit comfortably and get it to stay on my head without any problems ( lots and lots of hidden velcro ! ) .
The hat is filled with poly - fill to give it a more full overall look .
The sheath base was constructed from wondererflex for the base - molded over the sword for a perfect fit .
Vinyl was then applied over the wonderflex with contact cement .
The finished metal details on the sheath was constructed of craft foam coated with glue to seal it off for paint. other shots of the costume :
I ’ve written enough over the years about people who tried and failed to get money back from banks after seeing transactions on their accounts that they did not recognise .
Now I ’ve had to go through the process myself .
I got a refund from the NatWest after a dodgy debit appeared on the credit card my wife uses .
The bank ’s dispute resolution mechanism turned out to be unserviceable , but we got the money back promptly when we sued them in the small claims court .
The story is , I believe , an instructive one for people interested in bank security or payment systems regulation .
I have put online the documents which tell the story .
A debit of £ 126.51 appeared last June from “ Ian Travel Services ” about which there are many complaints online .
My wife phoned the bank and did n’t get anywhere .
So I wrote to them asking to reverse the transaction or provide evidence that it was made with our mandate .
The bank insisted that I fill out two declarations – one saying I did n’t recognise the transaction and the second saying that I had n’t made it .
When I replied that only the first of these was true and demanded evidence that the debit was made by myself or my wife , in line with the Distance Selling Directive if it were by a card - not - present transaction and otherwise by providing the relevant log entries , the reply was that MasterCard required them to obtain duly completed and signed declaration forms although “ these are not legally binding ” ( an assertion that appears to be false ) .
The bank said it had nonetheless asked for a copy of the voucher “ through the retailers acquiring bank ” .
Two months later , they got back to me and said that “ the only information the retailer provided us with is that the debit relates to a transaction made through hotels.com ” .
I replied to them that we had received a notification from hotels.com that another of our credit cards had been compromised by the loss of a laptop by their auditors and asserted my rights under the Distance Selling Directive .
The following month they wrote back saying that “ we are governed by MasterCard International , who are the governing body for credit card transactions ” and had to abide by their rules , under which our complaint was now out of time .
This is nonsense on stilts ; my contract is with the bank , who may not debit my account without my mandate , and if the bank enters into a contract with MasterCard that prevents it from discharging its obligations to me then that ’s the bank ’s problem , not mine .
The bank suggested i get legal advice , or go to the Citizens ’ Advice Bureau , Local Trading Standards or the Financial Ombudsman Service .
Now I documented the failings of the Ombudsman in an earlier post , so I decided to go straight to the heart of the matter and sue the bank in the small claims court .
The bank settled at once .
This may be entirely rational behaviour on the bank ’s part .
If it can fob off most complainants with tiresome call - centre procedures , or tell them they ’re out of time , or pass them off on Citizen ’s Advice , then it will only have to refund the minority who ignore this flummery and go to court .
Even then , the bank only has to pay an extra £ 25 for the court fee .
So now you know – suing the bank is the fastest , simplest and least - hassle way of getting your money back .
I ’ve come across the same phenomenon elsewhere : when Easyjet cancelled a flight , the only way I could get the compensation to which EU law entitles me was by suing them , and then getting the bailiffs to enforce the judgement .
( The bailiff told me on the phone that she enforces lots of these . )
Another Easyjet customer writes : suing in the County Court for small claims should be part of citizenship lessons for teenagers .
So it seems that the optimal bank complaint procedure is one letter , then a writ .
But do take care that your case remains on the small claims track .
In the Alain Job case , the bank persuaded the judge to move the case from the small claims track to the fast track , the effect of which was that Alain was ordered to pay the bank £ 15,000 in costs after he lost .
If a bank tries that on you , you ’d maybe better tell the judge that you ’d have to abandon the case and thus your human rights would be infringed .
But IANAL , this is n’t legal advice , and your mileage ( as they say ) may vary .

Tear downs of the Nexus One revealed components capable of handling FM radio and Wireless N signals ( the chip being the Broadcom BCM4329 EKUBG to be exact ) .
At least one of these protocols seems to be finding its way to the N1 in a set of updated drivers just released for Google ’s handset .
Steve Kondik got a hold of the files and they were compiled to bring Wireless N capabilities to his Nexus One .
The video below puts the proof in the pudding :
Could this be just one of the updates that will accompany Android 2.2 , now rumored to be coming much sooner than later ?
It definitely is one more piece of evidence to support that Google will be shortly unveiling a brand new update to the Android OS .

A controversy is erupting over Sarah Palin 's June speaking engagement at a campus of California State University .
A student protest group and other critics want the university to reveal how much they 're paying her , which they suspect might be more than $ 100,000 .
A professor has started a Facebook gripe group .
And a state senator is pressuring university officials to disclose Ms. Palin ’s compensation or be prosecuted under state law .
The CSU speech , held at the Stanislaus campus in Turlock , will celebrate the university ’s 50th year .
CSU officials have publicly stated they cannot release Palin ’s compensation due to a confidentiality term in her contract .
But Sen. Leland Yee ( D ) of San Francisco , who chairs of the committee on public records and open meeting laws , says the public – including students – have a legal right to the information .
The incident has ignited debate over the role of university speakers and free speech .
Controversial speakers stir the pot
“ Most sensible people understand that colleges should give a forum to controversial speakers in order to make students and others think and react , ” says Larry Sabato , a political scientist at the University of Virginia .
“ We have a ‘ stirring - the - pot ’ role to play in society .
But that does n’t mean you have to pay big bucks in tough times to give controversial speakers a platform .
Expenses are one thing ; a big fat speaking fee is n’t free speech . ”
On campus , the vitriol erupted almost as soon as Palin ’s engagement was announced .
“ We are demanding that the CSU Foundation disclose the full amount paid for Mrs. Palin 's speaking fee and all other expenses associated with the contract that both parties have entered , ” said Alicia Lewis , CSU Stanislaus student leader , in a statement .
Zoology professor Patrick Kelly , who started the anti-Palin Facebook page , says , “ The Foundation ’s board of directors are not only dismissive of the need to involve faculty , staff and students in the selection of the keynote speaker for the 50th anniversary gala , they apparently are also tone deaf to the mission and purpose of our university . ”
“ Do they understand how disrespectful and damaging this secretly - conducted pursuit of celebrity and controversy is to the faculty , staff , students , graduates and legacy of CSU Stanislaus ? ” asked Professor Kelly in a statement .
State politics involved
The controversy has found its way to the state capitol .
“ CSU Stanislaus officials sought out Sarah Palin , negotiated her contract behind closed doors , and are now welcoming her to our public university , yet they think they are above the law in disclosing to the public the cost of her appearance , ” said Senator Yee , in a statement .
A law authored by Yee in 2008 states that regardless of any contract term to the contrary , a contract between a private entity and a state or local agency is subject to the same disclosure requirements as other public records .
Yee says if the university ’s administration has documentation of the Palin contract – which he claims “ would be logical ” considering the foundation is fully staffed by public employees within the administration – then state law would require the release of such information at the request of a member of the public .
“ State law is explicitly clear that such confidentiality clauses hold no legal bearing , ” he says .
“ If the CSU administration has documentation of this compensation contract , then they need to immediately disclose it .
Students and members of the public deserve and have a right to view this contract . ”
Add another speaker for balance ?
Others say the speaker should be broadly acceptable to avoid spoiling the day for some grads and their families .
Still others say an opposing speaker could balance the festivities .
" The Palin invite is good , " says Robert Langran , political science professor at Villanova University .
" It would also be good for the school to bring in another speaker with the opposite point of view to try to achieve a balance . "
Whatever the objections , many say they are exacerbated by tough economic times .
A national day of action saw student rallies that began in California spread nationwide in protest of cuts in education .
There were campus strikes and sit-ins .
“ Our students are being slammed by enormous fee hikes while cuts mean they ca n’t get the classes they need , ” says Lillian Taiz , president of the California Faculty Association .
“ This resistance to transparency is another slap in the face .
CSU executives are at the top of these so - called auxiliaries , and they need to show more respect for the people they supposedly serve . ”
CSU Stanislaus President Hamid Shirvani has declined to comment about Palin 's appearance , referring questions to Matt Swanson , president of the university foundation which invited Palin .
" I am thrilled that we 're in a country where we can exercise our free speech , " Swanson told the Sacramento Bee .
Rome , Italy ( CNN ) --
A top Vatican official has harshly criticized The New York Times ' coverage of the Catholic sexual abuse crisis in a lengthy article posted on the Vatican Web site .
Cardinal William Levada , an American who heads the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , said the newspaper " lacks fairness " and that it accuses the pope of " leniency and inaction " in dealing with abuse cases .
" I ask the Times to reconsider its attack mode about Pope Benedict XVI and give the world a more balanced view of a leader it can and should count on , " Levada wrote in the article , dated March 26 but posted online Wednesday .
Levada succeeded the pope in leading the congregation , which oversees Catholic doctrine and issues of faith and morals .
When Benedict was in the role , Levada said , he helped enact new church legislation that greatly helped in dealing with abuse cases .
That new legislation included designating the sexual abuse of minors by clerics as " graviora delicta , " or most grave crimes ; streamlining the administrative process for judgments ; and adjusting the maximum age of a minor to 18 to correspond with civil law in many countries , Levada said .
He said the pope 's legacy with the congregation has benefited the entire Catholic Church .
" It seems to me , " he wrote , " that we owe Pope Benedict a great debt of gratitude for introducing the procedures that have helped the church to take action in the face of the scandal of priestly sexual abuse of minors . "
Though Levada criticized the Times for a " series of articles " that lack fairness and are " rushing to a guilty verdict , " the cardinal was particularly angered by a Friday report about the abuse of as many as 200 deaf boys in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee , Wisconsin , by the now - deceased Rev. Lawrence Murphy .
The Times alleged top Vatican officials , including the future pope , failed to discipline or defrock Murphy despite warnings from American bishops .
In its article Thursday about Levada 's remarks , the Times said the allegations " drew on documents obtained from lawyers suing the church that showed that Vatican officials had at first ordered a secret canonical trial , then asked the archdiocese to suspend it after the priest pleaded for leniency to Cardinal Ratzinger .
Wisconsin church officials protested the suspension , but followed it . "
Ratzinger later became Pope Benedict XVI .
Levada also takes issue with a Maureen Dowd opinion piece , which he said displays the newspaper 's " usual bias . "
" Both the article and the editorial are deficient by any reasonable standards of fairness that Americans have every right and expectation to find in their major media reporting , " Levada wrote .
Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki apologized repeatedly Tuesday night for the way his archdiocese handled the Murphy case , and he defended the Vatican , saying church officials and civil authorities in Milwaukee made mistakes , not Rome .
BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki announced Monday that two top insurgent leaders had been killed , including a somewhat mythic figure who has operated under the name Abu Omar al - Baghdadi .
Mr. Baghdadi has been reported dead or detained several times previously , and his very existence had been called into question a few years ago by American military leaders .
After Mr. Maliki ’s press conference , the American military released a statement verifying that Mr. Baghdadi was killed in a joint raid between Iraqi and United States forces in the dark hours of Sunday morning near Tikrit , near Saddam Hussein ’s hometown .
Also killed , according to Mr. Maliki and American officials , was Abu Ayyub al - Masri , the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , also known as Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , a largely Iraqi group that includes some foreign leadership .
Both men were found in a hole in the ground .
“ The security forces surrounded the hole , and when they got them out they were dead , ” Mr. Maliki said at the news conference .
Mr. Maliki said computers and letters were found that included communication between the men and Osama bin Laden .
Every 27 years , the star Epsilon Aurigae is swallowed up , and scientists had no idea why .
Now , using a special technique that produces images 140 times clearer than the Hubble Space Telescope , we 've finally gotten images of it happening .
Advertisement
Researchers at the University of St. Andrews were able to combine light from four different telescopes , to produce the super - clear images of the Epsilon Aurigae eclipse .
Here 's a video showing it happening :
Scientists were n't sure whether the eclipse was caused by an invisible companion star , a black hole , or some other cause .
But now , with these new images , the mystery is solved .
Says physicist Ettore Pendretti :
From the image , we can confirm that the eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae is caused by a thin disc of opaque dust trailed by a massive and unseen companion .
Like David , tiny particles of dust are able to kill the light of this ' Goliath ' star .
It resembles an image from a book by J.R.R. Tolkien .
It is like seeing the vessel of the sun , guided by the Maya Arien , being swallowed by the dragon Smaug and plunging Middle Earth in a second - age of darkness .
It is a terrifying image .

The results will be published in the journal Nature .

As I see it , there are two basic ways to do character creation , though there are a lot of variations on these two methods .
You can have everyone come together as a group to build characters , or you can have players build characters on their own , then bring them to the group .
Both methods , naturally , have some good points and bad points , though you can mitigate some of the bad points if you know what to look for .
Group character creation is what a lot of people start out with .
Many times , everyone is learning the game for the first time , and players and gm alike will be helping everyone pull together the character they want .
Everyone will probably take on a different role in order to have a balanced party , and eventually a group of adventurers will be formed .
Players may or may not think of ways everyone is connected , but it probably wo n’t matter .
Since it ’s the first game , they ’ll likely do an easy meet - up , such as meeting in a tavern or everyone will start out in jail or something along these lines .
Fun will be had by all .
Of course , what might also end up happening is that one player may get shoehorned into a role he ’s unhappy with for the sake of party balance .
Typically , this is someone who plays the cleric in a game of D&D , before everyone realizes just how powerful clerics are .
Using this example of the cleric , in a good scenario , this player will actually find out clerics are a lot of fun for him to play , or players will realize it ’s okay to go without a healer and the player will choose a role he ’s happy in playing .
In a bad scenario , he ’ll stick it out and not have a whole lot of fun with it .
A clever gm might even realize that it ’s not necessary for all party roles to be filled for everyone to have fun .
In this case , he might take each player aside to build their characters separately , so each player builds what is fun for him to play .
In this case , the players do n’t worry about party balance , and just play what they want .
This has the added benefit that characters randomly meeting up do n’t just happen to fit the mold of “ standard adventuring party , ” which can help preserve verisimilitude for people who care about this .
However , this method has it ’s own issues .
Some players like a well balanced party , and would fill a less fun role before having a skewed party .
Additionally , if players do n’t talk about their characters ahead of time , it ’s harder to establish relationships between the characters .
This can be done in game , but by the time gms are pulling this trick out , players are often used to establishing relationships ahead of time , so it feels clunky to do this in game for some people .
Finally , if two or more people are fulfilling the same role , it may lead to one player handling the role much better than the other player , so the weaker player feels overshadowed and like he ’s not contributing to the party ’s success .
Now , you might have guessed this by now , but I prefer to take elements of both methods and put them to work , though I favor the group method in this blend .
So , I ask players to build characters in a group , but also stress it ’s absolutely not necessary to fill every role unless that ’s the way they strongly prefer to play .
I ’d rather see them all have characters they enjoy playing themselves .
Furthermore , if it looks like one player will overshadow another in a similar role in a cooperative game , I ’ll ask them to help the other player bring his character up to snuff if he ’d like the help .
Some players do have roleplaying ideas in mind that work better when they are a weak link , and they always have the option to go that route , but I ’ve found more often than not they ’re happy to have some help in optimizing .
Finally , I make sure players establish some relationships within the party so they have a reason to stick together .
They can worry about any other backstory later , but having some established in - party relationships really makes the starting sessions of a campaign run smoother .
The hardest part of this third blended approach is getting players to buy into the idea that every role does n’t need to be covered .
So , I tend to explain that this party weakness can lead to creative problem solving when they do n’t have the typical solution on hand , as well as good roleplaying opportunities when seeking help outside the party .
Or , using another example from D&D , perhaps a player might find leadership a good feat to cover these weaknesses via a cohort and some followers , which also leads to good roleplaying opportunities .
Similarly , taking the allies or contacts background in World of Darkness might provide similar help in overcoming obstacles not handled directly by the characters , though likely not quite as directly .
Once I ’ve laid these thoughts out , players usually buy into this idea .
If not , or if they still strongly prefer a traditional party structure , they ’re certainly welcome to play that way .
I just think it ’s good to stress it ’s not necessary to do so to have a great campaign .
Iceland volcano ash cloud latest : all UK flights now grounded until 1 am on Saturday
After yesterday 's blanket ban on flights in and out of the UK stranded travellers would have awoken this morning hoping to find a chink of light in the dust cloud that is covering the country .
However , the news that the National Air Traffic Service ( NATs ) will keep all planes on the tarmac of UK airports until at least 1 am tomorrow will heap more misery on those needing to travel .

With the source of the ash - a volcano 700 miles away in Iceland - still spewing smoke into the atmosphere , there are already fears the chaos could go on for days if not weeks .
Some experts said there could be disruption for six months as a result of contaminated air drifting over northern Europe .
No jet planes can fly except in an emergency because the dust causes their engines to fail .
Health officials have told those with conditions such as asthma to stay indoors .
The cancellations have already caused the greatest mayhem to air travel since the Second World War .
This morning there were few passengers at UK airports - which usually cater for 500,000 people a day - with most choosing to stay home .
At 7 am , normally one of the busiest times of the day , Newcastle International Airport was deserted .
Check - in desks were unstaffed and the only people waiting around appeared to be airport employees , police or air crew .
A spokesman for Heathrow confirmed staff were coming into work as usual but said passengers were still being advised to keep away .
Aberdeen airport also remained open but was ' very quiet ' .

WE WANTED TO BE IN SHARM EL SHEIKH - NOT STALYBRIDGE Fraser Morson , Lee Dinsdale and Rob Ellans ( left to right ) had to scrap their holiday to Egypt after all flights from Manchester were cancelled yesterday .
The construction students , had spent £ 420 each on the trip and were told they would not get their money back by insurers .
There are still no flights out of Manchester today as the airspace lockdown continues .
Lee , 20 , said : ' All my savings have gone inot this trip and we 've been told it 's an act of God , so there is no refund .
' We wanted to be in Sharm El Sheikh not Stalybridge . '
Glasgow Airport , meanwhile , was preparing to deal with a handful of flights made possible by a ' window of opportunity ' in the volcanic ash .
Three flights diverted from Gatwick are expected to land at the site where conditions are better than further south .
An Air Transat flight from Glasgow to Toronto in Canada left this morning .
The three services due to land at Glasgow are Thomson Airways flights from the Dominican Republic , Orlando Sanford and Cancun in Mexico .
BAA Glasgow spokesman Donald Morrison said : ' The vast of majority of flights will not be operating , however between 1 am and 1 pm today there is a window of opportunity that might allow for some flights between Glasgow , the western isles , Northern Ireland and the North Atlantic if weather conditions permit .
' We have staff on stand - by to allow for flights to operate .
We 've got check in and security staff on the ground to facilitate that . '
He advised passengers to check with their airline before leaving for the airport as most flights are still suspended .
A limited number of flights are also running to and from Northern Ireland .
Last night the Irish Aviation Authority ( IAA ) lifted restrictions on flights to and from Cork and Shannon Airports and some of the regional airports , but restrictions would remain in force in Dublin until late this morning .
The services will do little to help hundreds of thousands of travellers stranded by the chaos .
Families returning from the Easter break will be particularly affected with many children due to return to school on Monday .
The Health Protection Agency said the ash will cause itchy eyes , a runny nose , sore throat or dry mouth when the particles land .
Those with bronchitis , emphysema and asthma were advised to stay inside because the ash could seriously inflame their conditions .
The ash , which will drift down from the north of the country , was predicted to appear as a dusty haze and may smell of sulphur or rotten eggs , or strongly acidic .
A spokesman for the HPA said : ' Any health effects are likely to be short term . '
Reports from Iceland said the eruption spewing ash into the atmosphere from Mount Eyjafjallokull showed no sign of abating after almost two days of activity .
A spokesman for the Icelandic Met Office said : ' It is likely that the production of ash will continue at a comparable level for some days or weeks .
But where it disrupts travel , that depends on the weather .
It depends how the wind carries the ash . '
Even if the current eruption subsides within days , it may not be the end of the travel chaos that the volcano can cause .
It last erupted in the 19th century and Bill McGuire , professor at the Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre , based at University College London , said if the volcano continued erupting for more than 12 months , as it did the last time , periodic disruptions to air traffic could continue .
He added : ' A lot depends on the wind .
I would expect this shutdown to last a couple of days .
But if the eruption continues - and continues to produce ash - we could see repeated disruption over six months or so . '
Even without further groundings , the knock - on effect of the initial disruption will take days to clear with planes , passengers and crew all in the wrong place .
In a blanket move - worse even than in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror atrocity - air traffic controllers were forced to completely close British airspace at midday yesterday as the volcano pumped massive clouds of ash thousands of feet into the air .
The huge dust cloud , unseen from the ground , slowly drifted across northern Europe at the height that jets cruise across the skies .

The volcanic ash contains tiny particles of rock and even glass which , when sucked into an aircraft 's jet engine , can potentially cause them to fail .
While skies above the UK remained clear but eerily quiet , runways emptied and planes were grounded , the air lockdown - the first in living memory - meant misery for millions .
The travel chaos spread across mainland Europe , with airspace closed in Norway , Sweden , Finland and Denmark and all northbound flights from France and Spain cancelled .
The closing of UK skies led to a rush for seats on Eurostar , bus and train operators and ferries .
Millions face losing their holidays or the prospect of punishing bills as a result of the airport shutdown .
Those who booked flights as part of holidays they organised themselves are being offered a refund of their ticket price , but there is no right to compensation .
Airlines were yesterday clinging to a smallprint get - out clause in EU law that means they are not liable where cancellation is ' caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided ' .
Many airlines will allow people to transfer their booking to the next available flight without extra charge .
However seats are scarce and this could be days away .

The net result is that people who have lost their flights face being hit with big penalty charges associated with any hotel and car hire bookings that they can not take up .
In theory , airlines should step in and help people who are stranded overseas because their return flights have been cancelled .
This means providing hotel accommodation , meals and telephone calls until a new flight has been arranged .
However , it could be days before their airline finds them a flight home because most seats are fully booked around the Easter holidays .
As passengers scrambled to find other means of leaving the UK , Gordon Brown said the suspension of flights was a temporary decision and would be reviewed ' at all times ' .
But he added : ' Safety is the first and predominant consideration , and if any travelling public are inconvenienced I apologise for that , but it is important that everybody 's safety comes first . '
Nobody was able to beat the flying ban .
Those caught up included the Duchess of Cornwall , who had been due to fly from Aberdeen to London , and LibDem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable , who had to cancel election campaigning in Scotland .
There was one upside , however , with weather experts predicting that the particles in the atmosphere could cause some spectacular sunsets over the coming days .

New Doctor Who Matt Smith gets more than 8 m viewers
Matt Smith is the youngest actor to take on the role
The first episode of the new series of Doctor Who was watched by more than eight million viewers , the BBC says .
In a dramatic opening sequence , the new Time Lord Matt Smith was clinging to the open door of the Tardis as it hurtled across the London skyline .
Smith , 27 , is the 11th and youngest actor to take on the role of the BBC 's time travelling Doctor .
He replaces David Tennant , whose final outing as Doctor Who was watched by 10.4 million viewers on New Year 's Day .
Tennant 's first appearance as the Doctor in April 2006 also attracted eight million viewers .
The BBC said audience figures for Smith debut's on Saturday peaked at 8.4 million and averaged eight million , an audience share of 36.9 % .
Over on ITV1 , Harry Hill 's TV Burp was watched by an average of 3.5 million viewers .
' Bonkers Doctor '
In the Doctor Who episode , The Eleventh Hour , the newly - regenerated Doctor crashed the Tardis on Earth and found himself battling a shape - shifting alien .
Matt Smith and Karen Gillan star in the 13 - part series The Doctor 's new companion is Amy Pond , played by Karen Gillan , who spent most of the episode in a kissogram policewoman 's uniform .
As well as a new Doctor and companion , the episode also unveiled a new - look Tardis interior .
The new 13 - part series was overseen by a new creative team , led by TV writer Steven Moffat , after Russell T Davies stood down as the show 's producer and chief writer .
Moffat has said Smith 's Doctor was very different from his predecessor .
" David was sort of neat and fastidious like a humming bird .
Matt is gangling and shambling - he's like a terrible mess that somehow becomes elegant by magic , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" He brings back genuine madness to the role of the Doctor - Matt 's Doctor is bonkers . "
Doctor
Who began in 1963 , and seven actors played the Doctor before the show was dropped in 1989 .
After a TV movie in 1996 - starring Paul McGann - the TV series returned in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role .
Tennant took over in the same year and played the time travelling hero for four years .

As so often happens with controversial content , and especially videos showing military crimes , You Tube has blocked the viral spread of the powerful and damning Wikileaks video by imposing age verification and a required log -in .
Yesterday , Alex Jones addressed the video the Pentagon never wanted the public to see in the first place .
Now , simply viewing the video requires going through two levels of confirmation– requiring users to log - in , certify being over 18 years of age and confirming the “ wish ” to view the video .
( Both messages are displayed below . )
“ This video or group may contain content that is inappropriate for some users , as flagged by YouTube ’s user community .
Please confirm that you wish to view this video . ”
“ This video or group may contain content that is inappropriate for some users , as flagged by YouTube ’s user community .
To view this video or group , please verify you are 18 or older by signing in or signing up . ”
The age certification pretense for offensive content is at best selectively enforced , and also effectively blocks anyone without a You Tube account from viewing the video .
Further , violent and offensive content saturates our culture , with little restraint .
No one thinks twice about killings on TV , movies or video games , but it becomes taboo when it is real .
As if teenagers about to be faced with pressure to join the military do n’t deserve to know the truth about what goes on in war as they consider possible recruitment .
At any rate , requiring a log - in definitely establishes limitations on how many people , including those over 18 years old , will know about this important news story .
However , we are still able to embed this video here .
So please , spread this website link to everyone you know and help this video get seen .

Senator Mitch McConnell continues to insist that the Dodd bill creates permanent bailouts – and that it would be definitely better to do nothing .
Apparently , he has indicated a willingness to make a Senate floor statement to that effect every day .
Senator McConnell is completely wrong on this issue – and , if he gets any traction , we will feel the need to point this out every day .
His remarks today and yesterday go far beyond any reasonable level of partisanship .
This is about playing games with the financial stability of this country and the world ; it should stop .
Do n’t take my word for it – Senator Ted Kaufman is a strident critic of our current financial system and a tough voice for greatly strengthening the Dodd bill .
But today he was as clear and as forceful as you can be on the floor of the Senate : Senator McConnell ’s proposed approach is “ dangerous and irresponsible . ”
Senator Kaufman continues , bluntly :
“ If we do nothing , and wait for another crisis , future presidents – whether Republican or Democrat – will face the same choices as President Bush : whether to let spiraling , interconnected too - big - to - fail institutions , like AIG , Citigroup and others , collapse in a contagion , sending the economy into a depression , or step in ahead of bankruptcy and save them with taxpayer money .
If that happens , the choice of allowing bankruptcy will mean tremendous economic pain for Main Street America . ”
If you think bankruptcy for megabanks is the solution , you need to get over this .
“ If bankruptcy was a cure in Lehman Brothers , it was one that almost killed the patient – the U.S. economy .
When former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson decided to let Lehman Brothers go into bankruptcy , our global credit markets froze and creditors and counterparties panicked and headed for the hills . ”
“ Instead of imposing market discipline , it only prompted more bailouts and almost brought down our entire financial system . ”
“ It ultimately took 18 months to close out the case on Lehman Brothers , an eternity for financial institutions that mark to market and fund their balance sheets on an interday basis .
Bankruptcy is an even more unattractive option when one considers that Lehman was an investment bank , while today ’s megabanks operate under the bank holding company umbrella . ”
We ’re all in favor of effective regulation , more capital , and greater controls on derivatives trading .
And passing a resolution authority , as proposed in the Dodd bill , would be a step in the right direction for purely domestic financial entities .
But Senator Kaufman is exactly right to press for more .
The resolution authority will not end “ too big to fail ” for large complex cross - border financial institutions .
It simply will not – if you think differently , just go talk to our G20 counterparts , as I have done .
There is no cross - border resolution mechanism , there is no international process to negotiate one , and there is no chance you will see such a process in the next 20 years .
Breaking up big banks is not sufficient for financial stability – no one would suggest that .
But it is necessary .
Again , Senator Kaufman nails this :
By Mara Altman
Barry Komisaruk studies the female orgasm .
But not in the way most men do , between the sheets .
His research is done in a laboratory .
The Rutgers neuroscientist analyzes brains in their most enthusiastic state , hoping to strengthen women ’s orgasms and aid the climax - challenged .
“ We want to find ways to increase pleasure in people ’s lives , ” he says .
To do this , Komisaruk selects volunteers to self - stimulate inside an fMRI machine so he and his team can study which areas of the brain — the body ’s sexiest organ — are activated by arousal .
And this is why I ’m here .
Today I will donate an orgasm to science .
While the 68 - year - old Komisaruk has been witness to more than 200 live - action orgasms in his lab , he ’s too busy nerding out on stuff such as surging hormones , bonding peptides and synapsing neurons ( when amplified , he says they sound like popcorn popping ) to view the process in any way other than clinically .
Though he does maintain a sense of humor about his research .
“ I got into vaginal stimulation about 25 years ago , ” he says .
“ That is , professionally speaking . ”
Among the things Komisaruk has discovered so far is that orgasm is a natural pain - blocker , lessening it by up to 50 percent .
Orgasm also maintains or heightens a woman ’s sensitivity to touch , making a lover ’s caresses all the sweeter .
( The business - savvy Komisaruk already has taken out a patent on the peptide that creates this response . )
But plenty of mysteries remain .
The comprehension of this bodily function is still in its infancy .
Despite our ability to plow through the atmosphere and land on the moon , we have yet to figure out the reasons behind what makes our own bodies undulate .
Some contend it ’s just evolutionary leftovers from the man ’s ejaculatory climax .
Others , such as Komisaruk , believe there ’s a purpose to a woman ’s flush - faced ecstasy — but he ’s not quite sure what it is yet .
It could be that the contractions of the uterus during orgasm help draw semen into the Fallopian tubes to aid pregnancy , that the pleasure tempts the woman to copulate repeatedly , or that orgasm allows a healthy release of muscle tension from the body .
On the day I donate my orgasm , I bring along my hot pink dildo .
But as I enter the sterile lab , I wish I had chosen something subtler .
Komisaruk and his four associates , all in white lab coats , greet me .
As they hand me my very unsexy pale blue gown to change into , I have second thoughts —
“ How am I going to orgasm with five scientists watching me ? ” — but decide to push myself .
Science needs my climax !
The first thing I am asked to do is give a urine sample .
This is for a pregnancy test :
There must be no fetus endangerment under the fMRI ’s three teslas of magnetic strength .
Then my dildo must be checked for metals — anything magnetic will fly toward the machine .
I try to remain calm as a vision of dangerous flying dildos passes through my mind .
The scientists load me into the machine and put a sheet over me , preserving my modesty .
Next step :
They strap my head down , because any movement distorts the brain imaging .
Ever try to have an orgasm without facial contortions ?
I feel as if I ’m being shoved into the middle of a toilet paper roll , the walls so close my eyelashes almost graze them .
Then I hear a voice through the earphones I ’m wearing .
It ’s Komisaruk .
“ You okay in there ? ” he asks .
Graduate student Nan Wise , 52 , puts a dollop of lube on my hand before running around to join the other scientists in the control room .
Born and raised in Jersey City , Wise now lives in West Orange and works closely with Komisaruk .
She began her career as a therapist because she was interested in what makes people tick and wanted to help them “ regulate their emotions . ”
With the invention of the fMRI only 20 years ago , along came the ability to look at brain activity .
She says that by understanding a function as gigantic as the orgasm , a response that hijacks all of one ’s attention , she might also learn how smaller emotions affect behavior and decision making .
“ The more we understand how the brain works , ” she says , “ the more we will be able to help people modulate its activity . ”
Wise once volunteered to donate her orgasm .
During the experiment , she lost her grasp and her purple dildo went flying .
It remains a popular subject during many grad - student happy hours .
“ It was the worst orgasm I ever had , ” she says .
As the machine switches on , it sounds like a jackhammer .
I follow Komisaruk ’s instructions and as I do , the group watches my brain on their computer monitors .
Komisaruk , who lives in Maplewood , is the co-author of “ The Science of Orgasm ” and “ The Orgasm Answer Guide ” ( both of the Johns Hopkins University Press ) .
He never expected his interest in science to lead to a career researching women ’s sexual responses .
He grew up in Brooklyn and went on to attend City College of New York .
From there , he got a doctoral degree from Rutgers , did a post - doc at UCLA and then returned to Rutgers to join the faculty .
He ’s been at the New Brunswick campus since 1966 , and now is also associate dean of the graduate school .
From the beginning , one question shaped his research : How do neurons produce awareness ?
When he was just starting out , he met with scientists , many of whom became mentors , and participated in their projects .
He cut his teeth manipulating the hormones of doves and rabbits .
Working with the celebrated psychologist B. F. Skinner , endocrinologist C. H. Sawyer and psychologist James Olds , he even inserted rods into rats ’ genitals to study the rodents ’ pseudo - pregnancy response .
He discovered that during vaginal stimulation , the rats looked somewhat paralyzed .
They would n’t respond to sensory input .
Through trial and error with the rats , Komisaruk found vaginal stimulation was causing not paralysis , but a painblocking response .
Around this time , Komisaruk ’s wife was diagnosed with breast cancer .
She was often in a lot of discomfort or extreme pain .
She died in 1982 at just 40 years old , and her experience affected her husband ’s career path .
Having watched her suffer , Komisaruk decided to apply his research with animals to humans .
“ I felt like a dummy standing there helplessly watching my wife in terrible , unrelenting pain , ” he says .
“ I felt I should use what I was taught as a scientist to do something that would be directly useful to people , and there is a real need to control people ’s pain . ”
Komisaruk was able to reconfigure a lot of the experiments he did on female rats to women .
He found many similarities , even the pain - blocking peptide that is released during vaginal stimulation .
As most answers in research lead to more questions , so did this .
These days , Komisaruk is trying to learn how to augment pleasure , which goes hand in hand with lessening pain .
Research and teaching take up most of his time , but when he has a spare moment , he visits with his two adult sons .
He says they have always supported his interests .
“ They ’re never embarrassed , at least not to my face . ”
During my first hour in the fMRI machine , researchers map my genitals to find out which parts — cervix , uterus , clitoris — correlate to which regions of the brain .
A similar map , called the cortical homunculus , was published for the male body in 1951 .
The one Komisaruk is working on will be the first of its kind for women .
( Wise calls it the “ hermunculus . ” )
Finally , it ’s time for the climax .
And thank goodness , because I ’m getting sleepy touching myself to the rhythm of the machine ’s droning .
“ You have 10 minutes , ” Komisaruk says through my earphones .
“ Stimulate to orgasm . "
I ’m told to signal orgasm by raising my left hand .
The goal - oriented part of myself overwhelms my embarrassment .
On the other side of the glass pane , the scientists can see my brain getting happy .
Regions light up as sensation begins building .
They are watching my brain on orgasm — brain porn .
“ The brain becomes very active as someone approaches orgasm , ” Komisaruk explains .
He , Wise and the other research associates have found that four different pairs of nerves — hypogastric , vagus , pudendal and pelvic — carry information from the woman ’s genital area via the spinal cord to her brain .
As this information registers in the brain , chemical messengers start doing their work .
Dopamine and oxytocin are let loose — the dopamine stimulates the pleasure sensations as oxytocin , which is released throughout the bloodstream , initiates the uterine contractions that often accompany orgasm .
A woman also experiences accelerated heartbeat , blood pressure , flushness , pupil dilation and sweating — orgasm is a full - body workout .
Because there are so many pathways for sensation , Komisaruk believes a woman has the capacity to experience a more intense and complex orgasm than a man .
Wise , who also is a relationship psychotherapist , says it ’s worth knowing your nerves .
“ To know how to play your instrument , ” she says , “ you have to learn your range . ”
Komisaruk proudly discusses what his research — and knowing another ’s range — has done for his own sex life .
“ I understand better how to elicit sexual pleasure in a woman , ” he says , “ and it seems to work .
It ’s a validation of my own research . ”
Some women can create the sensation of orgasm from thought alone , without touch .
In slang , the phenomenon is called “ thinking off . ” Komisaruk and Wise have studied these women with extreme interest .
“ Our mind is much more powerful than we imagine , ” says Wise .
“ If we can become aroused by thoughts , why not orgasm from them ? ”
Traci , a 30 - year - old woman who has given an orgasm to Komisaruk ’s fMRI , discovered her ability to “ think off ” while chatting online .
“ It just kind of happened , ” she says , “ I do n’t know how it happened .
I think I ’m just really horny . ”
Though she has harnessed a skill many women would pay big money for , she rarely will just pop one out while she ’s out and about .
“ I have n’t really done it much , ” she says , “ but you know what ?
I probably should . ”
When she went through the fMRI , she brought herself to orgasm using her special skill — without touching herself .
“ If it could somehow help people who ’ve never had an orgasm before , that ’d be cool , ” she says .
Komisaruk is not sure if women such as Traci are tricking their brains into thinking there is real sensory input — or , if the ability is actually a shortcut to an “ orgasm center ” of the brain .
“ If we can understand their process , ” says Komisaruk , “ we might be able to teach these techniques to women who have trouble with orgasm . ”
One of Komisaruk ’s ideas for a therapeutic practice is to put people who are having trouble with orgasm into the fMRI and do neurobiofeedback , meaning they will see their own brains in close to real time and have the chance to try to manipulate the regions of their brains that are activated — and hopefully , in this way , learn to achieve orgasm .
At about the five - minute mark through my own path to orgasm in the lab , I ’m worried I ’m going to let everyone down .
They had paid me a $ 100 subject fee , and I wanted to give them their money ’s worth .
After all , it ’s not easy to get funding for this stuff —
Komisaruk says he spends at least half of his time applying for grants .
Once , he had to agree to take out the word “ vaginal ” from the title of one of his studies before a foundation would release funds already allocated to him .
“ There ’s no premium on studying pleasure in this society , ” he tells me as Wise murmurs , “ What do you expect ?
We were founded by Puritans . ”
So I am really glad — not to mention pleased , sensationally — when I start to feel those familiar contractions .
I raise my left hand in the nick of time and break into a smile inside my little toilet paper roll .
Komisaruk and Wise run into the room and high - five me .
It ’s strange at first , but then I start to think that all orgasms should end that way .
They ca n’t stop talking about my brain : “ Your brain — it ’s such a good brain ! ”
I regain my embarrassment and hide my dildo under the sheet .
The scientists will first store all my data , then convert it and analyze it .
The data takes two hours to convert , but it can take much longer to make sense of it .
“ We ’ll be at this for a while , ” Komisaruk says .
One of the biggest conundrums of the orgasm turns out to be a nagging question for all mankind :
The orgasm activates the same part of the brain — the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula — as pain .
Komisaruk gives me a visual example , showing me images of people making O - faces .
Their faces are tweaked completely sideways with mangled mouths and eyes shut tight .
I would n’t have been surprised if he ’d told me they all had just had their feet run over by a semi truck .
“ What is the difference between pleasure and pain ? ” Komisaruk asks .
“ What makes something feel good ? ”
He begins slipping more and more into his thoughts .
“ Neurons , little bags of chemicals , create awareness , ” he says , “ but how ?
How does the brain create the mind ? ”
I see that at the heart of all his orgasmic research , there is a philosopher trying not only to augment pleasure , but also figure out the nuts and bolts that make up the human experience .
“ It ’s the hard question I want to answer , ” he says .
“ What creates consciousness ?
“ I find that , ” he adds , “ and I find the Nobel Prize . ”
Mahjong solitaire games are one of the most sought after games in the online world .
It is a simple and to an extent an addictive tile matching game that can be both relaxing as well as stressful .
Undoing hints and many other hidden treasures make this game attractive and fabulous among the long array of online games available .
Interestingly Mahjong solitaire game is not an ancient game as many of the users may think .
It was made available in few universities as projects for students .
Later with the passage of innovation and technology embracement , Mahjong Solitaire game took the form of online game format .
American company game , Activision , created the first popularly distributed Mahjong solitaire game in the year 1986 .
The game was then named " Shanghai " by the company and was created for the Macintosh platform .
Brodie Lockard and Brad Fregger are considered to be the creative brains behind this popular game .
The game proved to be an immediate success as it sold over ten million copies worldwide in all versions including Mac , DOS , Commodore etc .
The Mahjong game board is composed of 144 tiles ( the number can vary depending on different versions and levels of game ) .
Each tile has different images such as numbers , seasons and flowers .
The tiles are arranged in a certain layout which varies according to the game 's difficulty .
The board layout is created randomly by the computer and these layouts can differ in pattern , size and height .
There are over hundred varieties of layouts and some of them are designed with time implementations - so when the time runs out , the game will end .
Game Objective :
The main goal of the Mahjong Solitaire game is to clear the board by removing all the matching pairs from the given layout .
A so called " valid pair " consists of two tiles which are both " free " and " identical " .
In general you can remove a pair of tiles if the following conditions are satisfied :
1 . The tiles are of identical in nature , for example - 6 and 6 or East and East .
2 . All the seasons and flowers can be matched with each other even if they are not identical in nature , for example - the Winter tile can be matched with Spring tile .
3 . Each tile of the pair must be subjected to following conditions ;
a. no other tile is lying above or partially covering the chosen one
b. no other tile is lying to the left or right of it .
A set of mahjong solitaire consists of 144 pieces or " bones " and includes :
1. Colors - consisting of characters , bamboos and circles .
2. Honors - consisting of winds and dragons
3. Bonuses - consisting of seasons and flowers .
The most popular categories of Mahjong solitaire games are the traditional one and the European one .
Mahjong Solitaire game : How to play ?
Colors -
It consists of three categories ; characters , bamboos and circles which are also called " dots " or " balls " and are given numbers from 1 to 9 .
There are four bones in each category which adds up to 108 bones in the set .
The bones numbered 1 - 9 are called sets and the bones numbered 2 - 8 are called the ordinary ones .
Honors -
It consists of two categories , the " winds " and the " dragons " .
The winds are divided as West , East , North and South and the dragons are divided into Red , Green and White .
Similar to colors there are four bones of each kind which sums up to 28 honors .
Bonuses -
It consists of " seasons " and " flowers " .
Both category have just one bone which are numbered from 1 - 4 .
since there is only one piece in each kind bonuses can be achieved by matching it in any way , not only within a category but also within the whole bonuses set , note that not all implementations of Mahjong Solitaire will have these bonus tiles .
For example - Winter can be combined with any tile or bone in the seasons category .
Scoring
A player gets points for each identical pair taken from the table .
The point value of each set is multiplied by the number of pairs left behind on the table .
They are calculated in the following manner with the point value of each set multiplied by the number of pairs untouched on the board .
Mahjong Solitaire Scoring Type of Tile Points Awarded Number of Tiles Characters 1 point 36 Circles 2 points 36 Bamboos 3 points 36 Winds 4 points 16 Dragons 5 points 12 Flowers 6 points 8 Seasons 7 points 8
For example , when a game is begun there are 72 pairs on the table .
When a player removes a pair of wind from the table , he gets 4 ( set value ) multiplied by 72 ( pairs left on the table ) .
So his score is counted as 4 X 72=288 .
As the player removes another pair from the table , his set value is multiplied by what is left on the table i.e. 71 .
In case of the bonuses category , the bone having highest value is multiplied with the set value .
For example , a season plus flower pair in the first move is calculated 7 X 72=504 points whereas flower plus flower can fetch only 6 X 72=432 points .
Mahjong Solitaire : Gameplay Tips
Following are few tips and strategies :
1 . When choosing between few possible tiles to match , try to find and remove a pair that will blocks the most tiles
2 . Try to make an effort to eliminate tall stacks and long rows .
3 . Each tile appears four times , hence choose wisely .
For example , if you have 3 free tiles from the same category , calculate and look ahead to figure out which two tiles will be the better choice .
4 . Do n't depend on computer hints as it may not show the best move on the board but the first possible move .
Featuring sleek graphics , good Chinese music , ability to find solutions and undo moves make Mahjong solitaire game all the more exciting than the earlier Shanghai version .
Overall Mahjong Solitaire game play is fun to play and definitely brain racking .
There are over hundreds of game levels and multiple levels of difficulty .
The easier levels may not be much of a challenge and can be a great source to relax .
However difficult levels can be harder that can stretch your brain .
We wish you hours of fun !
Teabag Plutocrat
Meet Don Blankenship , CEO of Massey Energy Company .
Blankenship is also on the Board of Directors of the US Chamber of Commerce .
In this speech above , he denies climate change , derisively refers to Speaker Pelosi , Senator Reid , and others as " greeniacs " , and calls them all crazy .
Watch the speech , you 'll see .
In his mind , " the greeniacs are taking over the world . "
Massey Energy Company , Blankenship 's highly successful strip - mining and mountaintop removal operation is the parent company of Performance Coal Co , where a tragic explosion occurred on April 5th .
As of this writing , 25 miners have died and 4 more are still missing .
Twenty - five families are without a loved one .
Four more may discover they have lost someone they love too .
29 families in all , forever changed by one single , violent event in a coal mine .
One single violent event in a coal mine run by a company so obsessed with profit it runs roughshod over employees ' and neighbors ' health and safety .
Erlyndon Joseph Lo , 27 , graduated from Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law in 2007 .
Lo is a devout Catholic and has been using his knowledge of the law to fight abortion .
We must add that his knowledge of the law appears to be shaky .
In March , he sued the U.S. Supreme Court , asking the justices to render abortion illegal .
He also asked for $ 999 trillion in damages and $ 1,000 / hour for attorney ’s fees .
According to his website :
The “ CAUSE STYLE : ” is ERLYNDON J. LO V. ROBERTS , ET AL .
( This is a class action lawsuit , with me versus the 9 members of the Supreme Court . )
This cause of action ( lawsuit ) will take place in the “ UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS ” .
Ultimately , I will win this case without any doubt .
While that case is pending , Lo decided to take another legal action on Friday : seeking a restraining order against police as he planned to use “ deadly force ” against an abortion clinic that afternoon …
From the Dallas Morning News :
On Friday morning , Lo went to the Plano federal courthouse and filed a court document saying that at noon that day , he was planning to go to the Southwestern Women ’s Surgery Center in the 8600 block of Greenville Avenue in Dallas and “ use deadly force to defend the innocent life of another human being , ” according to court documents .
Lo ’s filing specifically sought a restraining order against law enforcement , asking that officers not be allowed to harm him if he had to harm someone else .
The FBI was notified .
Lo was arrested Saturday and charged with “ using interstate commerce to communicate a threat to injure , and threatening force to intimidate and interfere with clients and employees of a reproductive health service in order to intimidate that facility ’s clients and employees from obtaining and providing reproductive health services . ”
According to the FBI press release , Lo had visited the clinic a few weeks earlier with a receipt , asking for confirmation that his wife had an abortion .
The clinic would not give him any information .
Lo ’s website details his life history , but does not mention a wife .
It does say he took the New York bar in February , that he thinks women are awesome , and that he teaches piano and violin .
Oh , and that he challenged Obama to a debate and won :
I challenged President Barack Obama to a public debate on abortion , which he lost by not responding .
He must have accepted my challenge before March 26 , 2010 at 5:00 p.m .
Therefore , he lost , I won .

A perspective on Particulate 7 : HiNRG & B - OND
Venue : Maastricht Hilton Travelodge International Hotel , 30 March - 2 April 2018
This was the seventh and biggest Particulate .
It 's fair to say that these cons have come of age ; with about seven hundred guests and maybe three - hundred walk - ins on the door there 's no longer any question that the concom can make ends meet .
Indeed they 're already hard at work scoping out a venue for Particulate # 8 .
I checked in on Friday morning to find that about a hundred die - hard geeks had hit the con the night before , and the registration desk 's bookings system was toast .
The hotel has hosted the last two Particulates , and they knew what to expect ; as I arrived two bemused porters were helping a spotty youth hump weird - shaped bits of gear crusted in radiation trefoils into the baggage lifts .
Everyone had to pass a check at a discreet security booth by the door , to prevent any recurrence of the regrettable incident that nearly wrecked last year 's con .
The first thing I noticed in reception was a big whiteboard beside the main lifts .
Various messages were scribbled on it , but right in the middle , written in big blue letters , was a notice :
DONT TRY CRITICALITY EXPERIMENTS IN YOUR BEDROOM -- UNLESS YOU WANT TO TEST THE SPRINKLERS .
I started by checking out the cafe , which was blue with dope fumes by the time I arrived and which got steadily worse until the end of the con ( when the Bremsstrahlung Regressives tried to use it as a cloud chamber ) .
The usual suspects were there , sipping capuccino and smoking like there was no tomorrow .
And lo , who should I run into at the bar but my old acquaintance , Doktor Strangelove ?
I first met the Dok back at Criticality II ( though I 'd run across him before on the net ) .
That was back when his home town ( Buttfahrk , Ontario ) was trying to prosecute him for attempting to assemble a fissile device within city limits -- of which charge , incidentally , he was found not guilty -- and it struck me as unusually harsh that a local prosecutor was calling for a twenty - four year sentence on a guy who was still , basically , a kid .
Since then the Dok has done some growing up , and I can safely say that if he was n't a menace to society then , he certainly is now .
Or he'd like to think he was .
Dok : Hiya Betsy , howzit going ?
Me : Oh , I dunno .
Just got here , dumped my bags , thought I 'd take a sniff of the breeze .
Dok : Huh - huh - huh .
Me : Anything cool going ?
Dok : [ pushes glasses up bridge of nose , fidgets with head - up projector on left spectacle frame ] : I guess it depends what splices your code .
The Fabulous Rubensteins say they 're gonna do something weird tomorrow lunchtime during the birds - of - a- feather on fusion experiments , and like Sunday morning word is that Pion Overdrive are building a long column down the banquet hall and coopting some heavy control bandwidth .
Should be fireworks , maybe some stray neutron soup boiling off of that if they kick it into the fifty TeV range .
And there 's some dude from CERN knocking around to give a talk on law 'n 'order and basement nucleonics .
He 's kind of weird , but I do n't think he 's stasi .
Me :
What 's with the fusion gig ?
Dok : [ raises eyebrow suspiciously ] : mean you have n't heard ?
Me : [ hastily ] : well , there 've been rumours about a breakthrough in self - criticalizing muon - catalysis reactions ...
Dok : [ playing hard to get ] : that remains to be seen .
Buy me a drink ?
Me : I thought you were ...
Dok : Minimum drinking age is 21 here .
Me : Okay .
That 's the way it is .
The nerds are on parade .
They 've always been paranoid about the way outsiders see them .
First it was SF fans .
Then computer hackers and phone phreaks .
These days it 's extropians , roboticists , and hard physics geeks .
But the character type is the same : very bright , highly strung , defensive about their hobby , competitive within their field .
They realize it's not something the rest of society understands or cares much about , but they care and that 's what makes the difference .
I staggered out of the cafe with my lungs on fire and my eyes streaming and headed for the swimming pool .
The swimming pool is a really good place to hang out at a Particulate gig , but it 's not worth bringing your swimsuit : it 's where the re-enactment crowd get together .
A bunch of kids in sarongs and TELLER IS GOD t- shirts were pouring ion-exchange beads into the pool and there was a suspicious - looking bunch of metal piping already sitting in racks on the bottom .
The pool looked very blue .
When I asked what they were doing they stared at me as if I was crazy : " dechlorinating the moderator , " one of them finally deigned to tell me .
I nodded and backed out fast ; I could see I was n't wanted .
Opening speech .
Some middle - aged American guy in a three - piece suit , probably ex- Wall Street rocket scientist , told the assembled geekswarm that they were the future of mankind .
He said it in a voice choking with deep emotion .
Physicists always did their best work by thirty , and this guy talked about his own career on the SSC project out in Texas , before the Death of Big Physics in the mid-nineties .
The audience were hushed , as if chastened by the idea of being deprived of their accelerators by fiat .
Next on was a gangling youth named Curtis in baggy shorts , baseball cap , and iguana .
( It was green , about half a metre long , and sat placidly on his shoulder throughout the talk . )
Curtis talked very fast indeed about the fractal dimensionality of the universe as measured using the Genocide Mechanics ' new beat - wave petatron and some really eldritch decay paths they scoped out in a quark - gluon plasma when they cranked it up high enough to fuse the power supply .
" I tell ya , at first I thought it was the drugs , man , but then I realized it was the bats .
The vampire bats from beyond spacetime . "
He was talking about a fractal map they derived for a scalar field decay process ; and it did look sort of like a bat , if you squinted at it by the light of a lava lamp after smoking too much dope .
Curtis got a standing ovation ( whether for the delivery or the message ) , and the iguana made a mess down the back of his t- shirt .
He did n't seem to mind .
Everyone then pissed off to the cafe or the bar , leaving a rather sad - looking Englishman to talk about cross-section derivatives in subcritical masses of plutonium to a nearly - empty auditorium .
I do n't remember much about that evening , except that I woke up at ten the next morning with a splitting hang - over and three teenagers crashed out in the bathroom suite .
Breakfast was black coffee and codeine , washed down with runny scrambled eggs a la hotel .
Back to the program :
A talk about positronium , the care and feeding thereof , and how to bottle it for storage .
One of the problems modern particle physicists face -- besides the lack of funding -- is that they do n't have huge relativistic storage rings any more .
The maximum energies the big old synchrotrons could get up to were pretty puny by current standards , but the one thing they were good at was acting as a relativistic reservoir .
Stick a bunch of particles with a half life of a billionth of a second into a storage ring at close enough to the speed of light and they 'll hang around for tea .
But modern accelerators are all linear , and nobody can afford the big metal power bills .
The panel discussed various condensation traps and magnetic bottle topologies ( including a really weird five - dimensional Klein bottle ) but did n't really resolve the issue .
Lunchtime : the Fabulous Rubensteins ( who looked more like Shyster , Shyster and Flywheel ) presented their pion - catalysed criticality experiment .
It was the size of a truck fuel cell , and pumped out four watts of power less than it took to run -- but they said it had sucked in thirty watts two weeks earlier , and could theoretically achieve fusion bootstrap and run hot with a bit more tuning .
More intrusions from the world of high finance : they cited some algorithms patented by Barclays de Zoet Webb and Whole Earth Systems in their control rig , and a couple of suits from Exxon were seen lurking at the back of the lecture hall .
modeling systems ( agoric decision processorsÑ basically evolutionary algorithms used for market simulations ) on predicting particle state decay options .
A lot of the weird shit the hard physics dudes get up to these days drops back to ground state via some really strange nondeterministic transition states .
Zap some of them with enough energy along the way and you get even weirder , less probable , transitions .
Financial modeling protocols evaluate particle decay chains in terms of " bid " and " offer " prices on their probability , and give really neat derivatives for that big discovery - killing .
( No wonder the guys who wrote that software did well on Wall Street before the Softlanding . )
There was a cool cocktail party that night by the poolside , ghostly blue illumination courtesy of cerenkov radiation from the slow neutrons in the pond .
I was surrounded by crazed physics geeks and geek - ettes , stoned on the most bizarre mixtures of smart drugs and neurotransmitter analogues imaginable : the introspection mixes actually slowed them down enough for a mere mortal to talk to them and get something interesting back .
It was really good .
For a while I actually felt as if I understood the Pauli exclusion principle -- not as a law handed down from on high , but from the inside out .
It did n't last , though .
I went to bed , and the next morning the equations were as dry and cracked as the surface of my tongue .
Sunday morning I skipped breakfast .
The Pion Overdrive Grrrls were bolting their petatron together in the banquet hall and I did not feel like receiving an intimate lesson in scattering effects if they got enthusiastic about testing it before the demo .
It looked impressive -- all of ten metres long .
A seminar entitled : " embedded universes 101 " , discussing the possibility of creating Linde - Mezhlumian fractally - embedded self - reproducing universes -- in effect , mini - big - bangs contained within pocket black holes -- which rapidly deteriorated into quasi-religious ranting when someone in the audience asked a remarkably convoluted question about the practicality of " implementing the preconditions for a Barrow - Tipler strong anthropic cosmology " within the toy universes .
Some time during that last talk my brain underwent a loss of coolant accident and melted down .
I confess : I 'm not a true geek .
The theological significance of the Higgs scalar field leaves me cold .
I do n't really understand how to create a pocket universe , or what it means .
I 'm just repeating what I heard there .
These dudes are beyond it .
Way beyond it .
Whatever it is .
I wandered back into the banquet hall to see the grrrls demonstrate top quark decay characteristics .
It went smoothly and for an encore they manufactured some W's and a handful of Higgs bosons .
Then one of their laser stages failed and they shut the rig down .
I got chatting to one of them afterwards and it turned out they were using home - brewed chirped - pulse amplifiers bolted straight in front of simple high - gigahertz network driver diodes -- lasers produced by the million for wavelength multiplexed networks like your cable video system .
I kid you not .
Thirty years ago it cost ten billion ecus and a machine thirty kilometres in diameter .
Today a bunch of teenagers spend maybe a couple of thousand ecus , build a Rube Goldberg contraption three metres long , and achieve a hundred times the peak energy .
And this is what a Particulate is about .
Fast , cheap , and out of control .
That law -- Moore 's Law -- used to be just computers .
But computers peaked , and now they 're stitched into the collar of your shirt to tell the washing machine how much detergent it takes .
Next it was biotechnology , but after the cancer fix and the old age hack all the really hot biogeeks went underground ... or became merchant bankers .
That left physics .
The old physicists hit Wall Street , leaving the field clear for the old - time hackers and phreaks .
Raw enthusiasm , and left - recursive universe generators .
But they still get carded at the bar and they still can't blow up the world .
Physics may have a bad rap these days , but it 's harmless enough : a fine subject for kids to get enthusiastic about .
I never did find out what happened to the Vampire Bats from Beyond Spacetime , though .
Un an après la clôture de la procédure d’indemnisation lancée par la DGCCRF et malgré les relances de l’UFC - Que Choisir , ni la Répression des fraudes ni le procureur de la République de Paris n’ont communiqué le moindre bilan .
Un manque de transparence d’autant moins rassurant que les problèmes …
The Player 's Handbook 3 .
The very name implies a " C " list of offerings that somehow did n't rate getting in the first two .
At first glance , a casual page - flipper might find confirmation in some of the entries .
New classes Ardent and Battlemind do n't seem as iconic as some of the classes we saw in previous PHBs .
New hyper-alien races Shardmind and Wilden likewise lack the punch of , say , PHB2's half - orc or drow .
But then you run across the monk and all is forgiven .
Of all the classes I 've seen that most benefit from 4E 's power - centric game structure , the monk tops the list .
Its powers ( er , disciplines ) read like moves pulled from Shaw Brothers kung fu flicks – Fist of One Hundred Strikes , Steel Warrior Technique , etc. – which they probably were .
There are even classic AD&D moves like Quivering Palm !
Which is not to suggest that only the monk redeems this book .
It has other awesome topics that are sure to excite a sizable chunk of D&D fans : for instance , githzerai , minotaurs , runepriests and psions .
Githzerai are a great match for the book because they 're the quintessential monks and psion ( icist ) s and have many fans from previous editions .
Introduced in the original Fiend Folio , githzerai are enigmatic planars with an obsession for knowledge and secrecy , and an unceasing hatred for githyanki and mind flayers .
Obviously , minotaurs are big hulking warrior types , though of course in 4E there are no limitations on what race can choose what class , so I 'm looking forward to outlandish combinations like minotaur rogues .
The psion is a revamped psionicist from previous editions of D&D , and I 'm sorry to say the 4E rules have taken the punch out of this character 's unique feel .
In the old days of 2E , a character having mental powers that could be activated at will was a special thing indeed .
Wizards needed to memorize spells and gather components , priests needed to pray , but psionicists held all their power in their brains .
Well , guess what ?
All classes have been given powers to one degree or another , and psionicists ( oops , psions ) do as well .
I 'm sure they make fine characters , but the uniqueness is largely gone .
Lastly , I did n't think I 'd like the runepriest but it 's actually pretty cool .
Very Dwarven in feel , it 's basically a front - line fighter with combat - related runic magic .
In addition to new races and classes there are two more rules for customizing characters : hybrids and skill powers .
Hybrids work similar to a multiclassed character but instead of stopping one class and beginning a new one , both classes advance simultaneously and the character choses among both sets of powers .
I did n't mention three new classes that relate to hybrids : Ardents are basically warrior - psions , while Battleminds also rock psionic powers but are more defensive in nature .
Seekers are magic - heavy rangers .
All three of these , honestly , reminded me more of hybrids than unique characters unto themselves .
The last topic I want to mention about the PHB3 are skill powers .
This rule lets you choose a power associated with a skill rather than choosing a utility power , allowing you to hone in on a core strength rather than being forced to choose one of a small number utility powers that may not fit your vision for the character .
Just another another way to customize your D&D experience .
Player 's Handbook 3 , more ways to build a unique character in D&D !
And now for a giveaway ...
Holding off on the PHB3 because you do n't have the first two ?
Now you do n't have an excuse .
We have five sets of Player 's Handbook 1 & Player 's Handbook 2 to go out to GeekDad readers .
To qualify , all you have to do is leave a comment describing a character you 'd like to create with these books .
Half - orc bard ?
Dragonborn warlord ?
Do it !
I 'm closing comments Noon CST Saturday .
Note : This Contest is not administrated , sponsored , or endorsed by Wizards of the Coast .
Update : Congrats Mordicai , Briwei , Thomar , Buckyn1 and jayson_peters !
They each won a set of rulebooks .
When driving cars in videogames , you 're often forced to see everything from a third - person perspective .
Now , what would happen if you tried to drive while limited to that odd view in real life ?
These folks decided to find out .

Every year , energy giant ExxonMobil presents its own " Outlook for Energy " , its view of the world 's energy future until 2030 .
Although ExxonMobil 's outlook is based on essentially the same historical data as similar " outlook " reports from the International Energy Agency in Paris and the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) in Washington , it offers in many ways a different - and fascinating - perspective on the world .
It may well be - although this is something no one can say for sure - a more realistic , anticipatory vision than the one offered by the " official " energy institutions .
The realists at ExxonMobil , unsurprisingly , see continued dominance of fossil fuels over the next 25 years - coming mainly from growth in emerging markets as rich countries .
There 's a lot of interesting data in the full report ( 6MB PDF ! ) , but I especially like this graph :
Source : European Energy Review
In dotted lines : the price of coal - and gas - fired electricity without any carbon pricing .
Note that this is based on unknown fuel price hypotheses , but given how the report writes about the abundance of natural gas , one can expect them not to be too high ...
Click for larger version
In other words , wind power is already amongst the cheapest source of electricity , and if any minimal accouting for some externalities is put in place ( such as a price for carbon emissions ) , it becomes the cheapest .
Of course , as we know , " cheapest " does not necessarily translate into " most profitable . "
And as an aside , they are also sayign that carbon capture will never make any kind of sense .
And it 's not me saying it , but ExxonMobil .

Editor 's note : Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School .
His new book is " Arsenal of Democracy : The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism " published by Basic Books .
Zelizer writes widely on about current events .
( CNN ) -- Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele might be reminding conservative activists of a past Republican leadership turned arrogant with power .
Under Michael Steele 's leadership , the RNC has been accused of spending campaign funds on private jets , booze , limousines , five - star hotels , overseas resorts and a party donor 's trip to a Hollywood bondage club .
Most conservatives will agree that these expenditures are a horrible waste of funds at a time when Republicans are hoping to enjoy sizable gains in the 2010 midterm elections .
After the devastating results of the 2006 and 2008 elections , conservatives were unexpectedly able to energize their followers as the Tea Party movement emerged and President Obama experienced first - year difficulties .
Local Republican victories in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey boosted the spirits of conservatives who feared Democrats might be on the verge of another New Deal .
But along comes the RNC scandals , which have had the exact opposite effect .
Tony Perkins , the president of the Family Research Council , told his followers that they should not write checks to the national party .
Perkins said : " This latest incident is another indication to me the RNC is completely tone - deaf to the values and concerns of a large number of people they are seeking financial support from . "
The RNC scandals smack of the type of arrogance that was at the heart of the scandals that brought down key Republicans in 2005 and 2006 .
During these critical years , it became clear that party leaders had been abusing their influence by focusing on expanding their own power rather than advancing the agenda of the right .
House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was forced to resign in early 2006 after being accused of violating campaign finance laws in Texas .
He was also tied to the lobbying scandals that centered on Jack Abramoff .
California Rep . Duke Cunningham ended his career for accepting bribes from defense contractors who benefited from his decisions on appropriations .
There was also the case of Florida Rep.
Mark Foley , to whom Republican leaders turned a blind eye despite his highly inappropriate text messages to underage male pages .
Even Ralph Reed , the darling of the Christian Coalition , had been in cahoots with Abramoff in schemes to mobilize activists to protest gaming with the intention of drumming up business for his long - time friend .
It seemed that the attitude of Republicans in Washington had become " anything goes . "
The results were devastating .
Many Republicans were forced to resign , and Democrats regained control of Congress in 2006 .
Polls showed that corruption was a major issue on Election Day .
The chickens had come home to roost .
Not only did the scandals offer campaign fodder for Democrats who wanted to challenge the Republicans ' self - promotion as the righteous party , but even more importantly , they deflated the enthusiasm of conservative activists who believed their energy and money had been wasted and that their party was just as corrupt as the opposition .
Rather than the party of Ronald Reagan , the GOP looked more like the party of Tammany Hall .
The Steele scandals point to that same kind of arrogance .
This time around , Republicans are in an even weaker position , given that they are in the minority and out of the White House , struggling to rebuild their battered party .
In addition , Democrats have just achieved a major victory with health care , and it seems that the jobs market is finally starting to improve .
Republicans will need to clean their house quickly and find leaders who do not look more interested in the lavish ways of Washington than in the more modest ways of Main Street .
On Monday , the Republican National Committee chief of staff resigned , with many assuming he was fired by Steele in an effort to clean house .
The resignation is a start .
But much more needs to be done .
If the Republican leadership does not respond more aggressively , recent efforts to revive the party wo n't amount to very much .
Conservative voters will not be enthusiastic about supporting a party whose leaders partake in lavish and questionable activities , and Democrats will have more evidence that their opponents cannot be trusted with power .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer .
Making the impossible , possible : Climber scales the Eiger without safety equipment , then jumps off
Whether it is jumping off the world famous Eiger , flying through the air in a wing suit or perilously balancing on a 30 - foot long ' slack line ' hundreds of feet above a valley floor , American adventurer Dean Potter has it covered .
Constantly pushing the boundaries of human endurance , 38 - year - old Dean is revered among the extreme sports community and these incredible photographs offer a small glimpse into his ability .
Captured by his friend and climbing colleague Beat Kammerlander , Dean displays his array of differing free climbing , base - jumping and slack - lining skills across the world .
Most spectacularly is Dean 's ascent of the 13,000 ft Eiger mountain in Switzerland using his free - base climbing method for the first ever time .
Scroll down to see video
Climbing legend : Dean Potter climbs the north face of the Eiger without any safety equipment .
Once he reached the top , the legendary climber jumped off and opened his specially designed 6lb parachute
' Free - base is a combination of free climbing and base jumping , ' said the American , who is planning a European slideshow presentation tour detailing his greatest achievements later this year .
' Free climbing is an ascent of a mountain without any safety equipment and base jumping involves diving off high buildings and mountains , flying through the air and breaking your fall with a parachute .
' So I designed a parachute that weighs only 6lbs and which I carry in a small pack on my back .
' A normal parachute weighs up to 14lbs , which is too heavy to carry when climbing up a mountain .
' Using the new parachute enables me to climb to previously unthinkable heights because I know I have the safety of the parachute if I slip or can not continue .
' So in the summer of 2008 I became the first man to free - base to the summit of the Eiger and return myself to the ground with my parachute . '
[ caption ]
Spending the summer in Lauterbrunnen , in Switzerland , near to the Eiger , Dean trained on the limestone cliffs that surround the Eiger waiting for the perfect weather conditions to climb the sheer face .
' I practised my free climbing and base jumping all round the area before my ascent on 6th August , ' said Dean .
' Myself and Beat had mapped out an ascent of the Deep Blue Sea route up the Eiger .
' It is called that because of the distinctive blue limestone colour of the rock .
It is also an incredibly difficult climb .
' But with the parachute I felt confident . '
Despite the parachute , some sections of the climb offered severe dangers .
' Even though I had the parachute , there were still some sections of the climb that could have killed me , ' said Dean .
' Right at the start of the Eiger the rock is very loose for the first 50 feet and if I slipped and fell the parachute would offer little protection and I would probably die . '
[ caption ]
' It was crazy after the Eiger , ' said Dean .

Aijalon Mahli Gomes reportedly admitted his wrongdoing in court
North Korea has sentenced a US citizen to eight years ' hard labour for illegally entering the country , state news agency KCNA has said .
The man , named as 30 - year - old Aijalon Mahli Gomes , from Boston , admitted his wrongdoing in court , KCNA reported .
Gomes had worked as an English teacher in South Korea , and reportedly crossed the border from China on 25 January .
Swedish diplomats were allowed to attend the trial , as the US has no diplomatic presence in North Korea .
Gomes , described by colleagues as a devout Christian , was also fined 70 million won ( $ 700,000 ; £ 460,000 at the official exchange rate ) .
It is not clear why he entered North Korea .
Goodwill gesture ?
Despite the jail sentence , analysts suggested Gomes could be freed before too long as Pyongyang tries to improve bilateral relations with the US .
" The North is not going to hold him for eight years , " Professor Kim Yong - Hyun of Seoul 's Dongguk University told the AFP news agency .
" It is likely to suspend the implementation of the sentence and expel him as a goodwill gesture toward the United States . "
Gomes was the fourth American citizen to be accused of entering the country in the past year .
In February , North Korea freed Robert Park , who had entered the country from China by walking over a frozen river .
He had reportedly wanted to highlight human rights issues in North Korea , but was said before his release to have admitted his " mistake " .
Last year two US journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , were also arrested by North Korea on the border with China .
They were sentenced to 12 years ' hard labour but freed in August after four months in captivity , as part of a diplomatic mission spearheaded by former US President Bill Clinton .
In the race to genetically engineer food that is tastier and cheaper , Canada ’s University of Guelph is instead finding a way to produce meat that may be more environmentally friendly .
For more than a decade the UoG has been developing the ‘ enviropig ‘ , a genetically modified line of pigs that are better able to digest and process phosphorus .
They are cheaper to feed because they do not require separate phosphorus food supplements , and they are better for the environment because they release up to 70 % less phosphorus in their waste .
Now in their eighth generation of enviropigs , the University of Guelph is still pursuing US FDA approval , and recently applied for the same from the Canadian Regulatory Agency .
If successful , enviropigs could be the first transgenic meat to make a big impact on both pollution and your plate .
Should the other billion or so pigs on the planet be nervous ?
Genetically modified food is already on your table .
Corn , soy , and rice ( the big staple foods ) have been GM for a while now , especially in the US , and the practice is growing all over the world .
Generally the aim is to modify food so that it is pest and herbicide resistant , as well as bigger , juicer , tastier , etc – and there have been some promising results .
Most countries have stalled in accepting genetically engineered meat , however .
GE animals seem like a larger risk than plants .
It ’s unclear if or when the public will warm up to the idea of modified meat , but genetic engineering has far more applications than just dinner .
GM animals are likely to provide insights into how we may engineer ourselves for longevity , health , and intelligence – though probably not for taste .
For now , the enviropig has some promising advantages to offer , and they all center on phosphorus .
Phosphorus is an important element , it ’s the ‘ P ’ in the famous NPK fertilizer approach to increasing crop yields .
But that agricultural benefit can also be a curse .
When pigs on modern farms defecate and urinate , they release a lot of phosphorus in the environment .
With our centralized industrial agricultural system , this means that there is occasionally huge amounts of phosphorus dumped into a small area .
When this element is washed into rivers and other bodies of water it can lead to steep increases in algae .
Algae blooms disrupt natural oxygen levels and kill fish .
In short , pig waste can be an environmental hazard .
Enviropigs release up to 70 % less phosphorus in their urine and feces .
That means a smaller impact and a better chance of keeping balance in the ecosystems surrounding pig facilities .
Enviropigs also eat better than their non-genetically modified brethren .
DNA from mice and Escherichia coli bacteria have been spliced into their genome giving them saliva that helps to digest the phosphorus in grain .
Most phosphorus ( 50 - 75 % ) in standard grain feed is indigestible to traditional pigs .
Farmers have to give pigs supplements , or feed them phosphorus digesting enzymes ( phytase ) to keep them healthy .
With the mouse and bacteria genes , enviropigs can eat a steady diet of feed grain without supplements , making them cheaper ( and easier ) to raise .
Why not just feed pigs something other than these grains ?
Well , those grains are cheap ( sometimes because they are subsidized ) and can be acquired in the huge amounts necessary to raise the millions of pigs we eat every year .
Organic farmers ( and other food advocates ) point to the subsequent need for genetic modifications as a sign that the entire industrial - agricultural system needs rethinking .
Another concern about GM animals is the narrowing of the gene pool .
Already the pigs we eat come from a very restricted number of bulls – yielding piglets that gain weight faster and produce juicer cuts of meats .
This narrow gene pool , however , has also made the pigs more vulnerable to infection ( amplified by the factory - style conditions of the modern farm ) .
It ’s important to note that the FDA and CRA applications for the enviropig involve just one lineage of stock ( the Cassie line , descended from one of the originally modified pigs ) .
Proper breeding practices would keep the introduction of the enviropig from developing into a monoculture , but GM animals are undoubtedly going to narrow gene pool even further .
Whenever politics and economics come into play it ’s hard to predict how science will develop .
Certainly there are some amazing benefits to be had by exploring genetic modification in animals .
Those benefits probably need to be considered in the larger context of our modern industrial agricultural system .
There ’s no reason why we ca n’t pursue the best of all worlds : organic distributed farming ( “ traditional ” agricultural ) coupled with a polyculture approach to genetic engineering .
No matter what the current politics and economics trends may be , there ’s little doubt that genetics will have an increasing role in agriculture in some fashion .
Dairy cows are being genetically tested for breeding , flowers are being engineered to have different smells – the genie ’s already out of the bottle .
It may be that GE foods , including pigs , will continue to form an increasing portion of our diets .
Or we could jump ahead and just start eating artificial meat .
Either way we ’re soon to find out just how tasty science can be .

SYRACUSE , NY — Despite overcoming long odds as the lowest seed remaining in the NCAA Tournament , Cornell 's basketball team had on Wednesday squandered most of its underdog goodwill by using every opportunity to explain that , given a finite set of possible outcomes and a sufficient period of time , the sheer quantity of opportunities available to accomplish an improbable outcome makes its achievement likely if not almost certain .
" It 'd be foolish to ascribe any of the properties of a pan- dimensional function space to the NCAA Tournament , " said Cornell center Jeff Foote , who has averaged 14 points per game in the first two rounds .
" However , bear in mind that we 're not talking about a null probability space .
With eight teams in the Ivy League and 65 in the tournament , you eventually run out of possible permutations .
One could even make the case for historical inevitability ; we won , so we were always going to win .
I think my good friend Baron d'Holbach would agree — that 's decidedly nonzero .
Decidedly . "
Foote excused himself after the interview upon receiving a fifth rejection - of - transfer letter from Harvard .

They were n’t looking to make a political statement or to be pioneers of gender liberation .
Each just wanted a familiar , decent roommate rather than a stranger after their original roommates left to study abroad .
That ’s how Pitzer College sophomores Kayla Eland , female , and Lindon Pronto , male , began sharing a room this semester on Holden Hall ’s second floor .
They are not a couple and neither is gay .
They are just compatible roommates in a new , sometimes controversial , dormitory option known as gender - neutral housing that is gaining support at some colleges in California and across the nation .
Eland , a biology major who hopes to become a doctor , said that a roommate ’s personality and study habits are more important than gender .
“ This might not be right for everyone , ” she said of sharing the small , cinder block - walled room with a man .
“ But I think it ’s important to have the right to choose where you want to live , how you want to live and who you want to live with . ”
Pronto , an environmental studies major who works each summer as a forest firefighter , agreed .
Apart from remembering to lower the toilet seat , he said , living with a woman friend is not much different from rooming with a man .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , a roommate is a roommate , ” he said .
Although the number of participants remains small , gender - neutral housing has gained attention as the final step in the integration of student housing .
In the 1970s , many U.S. colleges moved from having only single - sex dormitories to providing coed residence halls , with male and female students typically housed on alternating floors or wings .
Then came coed hallways and bathrooms , further shocking traditionalists .
Now , some colleges allow undergraduates of opposite sexes to share a room .
Pitzer , which began its program in the fall of 2008 , is among about 50 U.S. schools with the housing choice , according to Jeffrey Chang , who co-founded the National Student Genderblind Campaign in 2006 to encourage gender - mixed rooms .
Participating schools include UC Riverside , UC Berkeley , Stanford , Cornell , Dartmouth , Sarah Lawrence , Haverford , Wesleyan and the University of Michigan .
College officials say the movement began mainly as a way to accommodate gay , bisexual and transgender students who may feel more comfortable living with a member of the opposite sex .
Most schools say they discourage couples from participating , citing emotional and logistical problems of breakups .
Officials say most heterosexuals in the programs are platonic friends .
“ College students are adults , ” said Chang , who is gay and is now a law student at Rutgers University in New Jersey .
“ They have every single right to choose the person they feel most comfortable living with . ”
He estimates that at schools where the option exists , only 1 % to 3 % of students living on campus choose a roommate of the opposite sex .
Officials at the Assn. of College & University Housing Officers - International say the trend has accelerated , but they do n’t expect most schools to adopt it .
Experts note that most students prefer a same - sex roommate , and some colleges are reluctant to antagonize parents , legislators and donors who view the option as immoral or even dangerous .
Pepperdine University in Malibu , which is affiliated with the Churches of Christ , maintains separate dorm wings and apartments for men and women .
Asked whether it would consider going gender neutral , Sue Gamboa , a housing department office manager , said : “ Not in the wildest dream would Pepperdine move in that direction . ”
Harvey Mudd College , next to Pitzer in the Claremont Colleges , began gender - neutral housing last fall mainly as an option for gay and transgender students , said Guy Gerbick , dean of residential life .
Seven students joined ; among them are a man and two women , all straight , who share a triple room .
Parents cannot veto such a decision at Harvey Mudd , but Gerbick asks students to discuss it with their families ahead of time .
He also asks applicants whether they are romantically involved ; all of this year ’s participants said no .
But if they were , the school could not forbid them from rooming together .
“ If we are going into a post - gender world , then the regulation of private behavior is just not practical , ” he said .
Several years ago , an earlier proposal for gender - neutral housing was killed at Harvey Mudd by skeptical administrators and older , more conservative trustees , Gerbick recalled .
More recently , 74 % of Harvey Mudd students voted in a survey to allow the option and , to Gerbick ’s satisfaction , a new administration agreed .
UC Berkeley senior Rose DeLeon - Foote , who has a male roommate , laughed at fears that gender - neutral housing might promote promiscuity .
In fact , she said , the opposite is true when roommates see each other “ all gnarly in the morning . ”
“ It ’s not sexual , it ’s just not , ” said DeLeon - Foote , 19 , of Sacramento .
Many schools restrict the option to upperclassmen , to certain floors or to residence halls with gay themes .
Pitzer , which has about a dozen students participating this year , avoids such limits out of concern that they may marginalize students , said Chris Brunelle , director of residence life .
Pitzer housing applications ask whether students prefer a roommate to be woman , man , “ other , ” or have no preference .
Or students can request to live together , as Eland and Pronto did after losing their original roommates .
Their room , which shares a tiny bathroom with two men next door , has the usual collegiate trappings of beer bottles and political posters .
The only unusual sight is women ’s clothes in one closet and men ’s in another .
The pair seem to have a warm brotherly - sisterly friendship and , while they try to be respectful , they say they are not inhibited about being in underwear or even nude while changing clothes in the room .
They insist their living situation does not interfere with romantic relationships with other people .
And although they have not been teased on campus , they face curious questions from relatives and friends .
“ I definitely think it ’s generational , ” said Eland , 20 , of Seattle .
“ For my grandparents , living with someone of the opposite sex , if he is not your serious boyfriend or husband or brother , would be very strange . ”
Pronto , 21 , of Weimar , north of Sacramento , said his mother at first worried that he might be distracted by having a female roommate .
And fellow firefighters at his “ macho ” summer barracks may joke about it , he said .
But at colleges , he said , “ I think those old - fashioned ways of thinking are kind of dissipating .
. . .
Over the years , this division between men and women , which was so big , is slowly closing . ”
Eland ’s and Pronto ’s living arrangement wo n’t last long .
Both will be studying overseas next fall , she in Spain , he in Costa Rica , and they are not sure where -- or with whom -- they will live when they return to school .

Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the Palestinians continue to toughen their standpoint on negotiations .
" There is absolutely no sign of moderation , and I am not expecting the discussions within the Arab League to make the process any easier , " Netanyahu said at a government meeting .
" We are continuing to see the Palestinian rigidity .
There are no signs of cooperation , " the prime minister said , adding that Israel would nevertheless continue to negotiate , in conjunction with US efforts .
Earlier on Sunday , Netanyahu distanced himself from severe criticism leveled at US President Barack Obama which was attributed to the Israeli premier ’s associates .
Speaking at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting , Netanyahu stressed that the remarks quoted insaying that Obama was a “ tragedy ” for Israel , were unacceptable .
" I have recently heard anonymous , unworthy remarks in the media regarding the American administration and the American president , " he said .
" I would like to make it clear : I find these remarks to be unacceptable .
They are from nobody acting on my behalf .
Relations between Israel and the US are those between allies and friends and reflect longstanding tradition .
Even when there are differences of opinion , they are differences of opinion among friends and will remain so .
" The prime minister said that when speaking on Capitol Hill with leaders from both houses of Congress last week , he found there was " very strong support for Israel 's positions and the desire that Israeli - US relations should remain such that even when there are disagreements , they will be resolved as is proper among allies .
"
He said that during the talks in Washington , a range of issues were discussed , including Iran and " our common desire to resume and restart the peace process .
" Netanyahu said that there were areas in which there was full agreement , as well as those where there was disagreement .
"
We tried to take – and we took – various steps to reduce the gaps inorder to advance the process , " emphasized the prime minister .
" We arecontinuing these efforts .
" Netanyahu also referred to the weekend clashes in Gaza in which Maj.
Eliraz Peretz , and St.- Sgt. Maj .
Ilan Sviatkovsky were killed .
He said the Peretz family had lost two sons in " the continuing conflictthat we are waging against Iran 's emissaries of terrorism . " " Israel 's policy of response is sharp and vigorous , " he vowed .
" We willrespond sharply to any attack on our citizens and soldiers .
This policyis well - known and will continue .
Hamas and the other terroristorganizations must know that will bear the responsibility for theiractions . "
Today , British civil aviation authorities ordered the country 's airspace closed as of noon , due to a cloud of ash drifting from the erupting EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano in Iceland .
The volcano has erupted for the second time in less than a month , melting ice , shooting smoke and steam into the air and forcing hundreds of people to flee rising floodwaters .
The volcanic ash has forced the cancellation of many flights and disrupted air traffic across northern Europe , stranding thousands of passengers .
Collected here are photos of the most recent eruption , and of last month 's eruptions , which were from the same volcano , just several miles further east .

Senior Editor of MAKE magazine Phil Torrone joins us to celebrate more modern - day MacGyvers as we continue DIY week at Lifehacker .
Today he celebrates mischief maker and non-lethal weapons engineer ( her flashlight can make you throw up ) Limor " Ladyada " Fried .
Video above :
An episode of MAKE television where Ladyada shows how she developed , designed , and engineered a homemade cell phone jammer .

Lifehacker readers , you 're in luck today ; if you 've ever wondered what a real life MacGvyer does for a living , I 'm about to show you .
I work with Limor at my " other " job designing educational electronics .
It 's a dream come true .
Ladyada is perhaps the smartest person I 've met on the planet .
I 've always called her " Lex Luthor smart " or " MacGyver clever " , and most people seem to understand those analogies .
She uses her smarts for mostly " good " and of course some mischief , which I would say is also good on a long enough timeline .
That said , her work speaks for itself , so let 's take a look and listen ...
Here 's what Ladyada 's research page says :
I spent the two years of my Masters of Engineering in Electrical Engineering at the Computing Culture Group in the Media Lab at MIT ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) .
During that time , I did some engineering , and a little thinking .
You can download the 14M PDF here .
In contemporary Western society , electronic devices are becoming so prevalent that many people find themselves surrounded by technologies they find frustrating or annoying .
The electronics industry has little incentive to address this complaint ; I designed two counter - technologies to help people defend their personal space from unwanted electronic intrusion .
Both devices were designed and prototyped with reference to the culture - jamming " Design Noir " philosophy .
The first is a pair of glasses that darken whenever a television is in view .
The second is [ a ] low - power RF jammer capable of preventing cell phones or similarly intrusive wireless devices from operating within a user 's personal space .
By building functional prototypes that reflect equal consideration of technical and social issues , I identify three attributes of Noir products : Personal empowerment , participation in a critical discourse , and subversion .

She updated and released this project on Christmas day of 2006 .
It can also jam Wi -Fi , Bluetooth and more — perfect for schools , prisons , and coffee shops !
The video above has the segment from Make : television Episode 10 , public television .
Wave Bubble : a self - tuning , wide - bandwidth portable RF jammer .
The device is lightweight and small for easy camouflaging : it is the size of a pack of cigarettes .
An internal lithium - ion battery provides up to 2 hours of jamming ( two bands , such as cell ) or 4 hours ( single band , such as cordless phone , GPS , WiFi , bluetooth , etc ) .
The battery is rechargeable via a mini-USB connector or 4 mm DC jack ( a common size ) .
Alternately , 3 AAA batteries may also be used .
Output power is .1W ( high bands ) and .3W ( low bands ) .
Effective range is approximately 20 ' radius with well - tuned antennas .
Less so with the internal antennas or poorly matched antennas .
Self - tuning is provided via dual PLL , therefore , no spectrum analyzer is necessary to build this jammer and a single Wave Bubble can jam many different frequency bands - unlike any other design currently available !
To reconfigure the RF bands , simply plug it into the USB port of your PC and type in the new frequencies when prompted .
Multiple frequency ranges can be programmed in , each time the device is power cycled it will advance to the next program in memory .
While the documentation here is both accurate and complete ( as much as possible ) , the construction of such a device is still an advanced project .
I would not suggest this as even an ' intermediate ' skill project , considering the large amount of difficult SMT soldering ( multiple TSSOP and SOT chips , 0603 RC's ) , obscure parts , and [ equipment ] necessary to properly construct and debug .
This design is not for sale or available as a kit and never will be due to FCC regulations .
Please do not ask me to assist you in such matters .

Next up , Ladyada teamed up with Mitch Altman to develop and design the high powered TV - B - Gone kit .
This allows anyone to turn off any TV in public , or in private if you were so inclined .
The project is used in workshops around the world to teach electronics , it 's fun to use and Mitch has some good thoughts on why this might be a good idea ...
How much of the TV that you watch do you really like a lot ?
If you could choose whatever it is that you 'd like to be doing right now , anything at all , what would it be ?
Was your answer , " Watch TV ! " ?
Whatever your answer was , my wish for you is that you have time in your life to do it .
Please make time in your life for what you really like .
Better yet , please make time to do what you love .
Would n't that be great ?
Do n't know what you love ?
Try out a few things , see what happens .

Like all things , from chainsaws to credit cards , the TV - B - Gone can be abused .
So with the mighty power of TV - turning - off - IR - LEDs , please be responsible folks — and CES is not a good place for testing these , okay ?
Confessions : The Meanest Thing Gizmodo Did at CES CES has no shortage of displays .
And when MAKE offered us some TV - B - Gone clickers to bring to the… Read more

Moving along , you know all those old pagers from 1990s everyone uses ?
Turns out they 're still around , and Ladyada demonstrates how to take a $ 10 pager and make a " pager scanner " so it can see all the pages and pager data on the pager networks .
Surprisingly it 's still used for a lot of interesting things and for transmitting data to many devices .
( Breadboarding diagram for 2 - fsk decoding here & download PDW here . )
If you want to see how she got it to work , check out part one first ( reverse engineering a pager ) .
And last but not least , a flashlight that makes you vomit ( and yes , that 's me in the video ) .
The Bedazzler DIY non-lethal weaponry .
She writes :
Our first open source Homeland Security non-lethal weapon project - The " THE BEDAZZLER : A Do-it - yourself Handheld LED - Incapacitator " .
After attending a conference where the $ 1 million " sea - sick flashlight " ( named " THE DAZZLER " ) was demonstrated by the US Dept. of Homeland Security , we decided to create our own version .
For under $ 250 , you can build your own dazzler and we 've released the source code , schematics and PCB files to make it easy .
A great Arduino project for people who really like blinking LEDs .
We also added in a mode selection so you can put it into some pretty color - swirl modes , great for raves and parties !
Yes this project does indeed cause : Nausea , dizziness , headache , flashblindness , eye pain and ( occasional ? ) vomiting !
So do n't use it on your friends or pets

All of her kits are " open source hardware " , meaning she gives away all the designs .
You do n't need to buy anything — you can make your own kits and even start a business selling them if you wanted ( some have ! ) .
If you check the Maker Faire site you can see if and when a Maker Faire is in your area .
Ladyada is usually at each fair and doing some type of electronics workshop .
She also has a weekly video show called " Ask an engineer " if you need engineering questions answered , too .

Throughout the week I picked my favorite makers — I 've got more than five , of course — but what I wanted to say in closing is that we 're all makers , we all start out making things .
Somewhere along the way many of us lose that feeling of creating something and sharing it .
My hope is that you 've been inspired by one or all of these makers , and I 'm looking forward to seeing your projects here on Lifehacker .
I 'd like to thank the Lifehacker gang and all of the great discussions , comments and support .
The makers profiled really appreciate it and I really enjoyed doing this .
See you soon , and keep making !

Jospeh Cassano , the guy who brought down AIG – and maybe the world economy – with trillions in risky derivatives deals which AIG could n’t back up , is getting prosecuted … and the government will claw back all the money he made , right ?
Uh , no .
In reality , Cassano is walking away scott - free with $ 315 million .
As Cent Uygur points out :
Prosecutors will likely not charge him with fraud .
They are not going to try for clawbacks to get some of the money back .
In the end , he gets away scott - free .
But it ’s better than free , he gets to keep all the money he never really made in the first place … I told you about his $ 35 million thank you note [ his exit bonus ] for robbing the place clean .
But how about the original robbery ?
How much did he make for himself from 2000 to 2008 by gambling with the company ’s money ?
Only $ 280 million .
In the end , he walked away with over $ 315 million for destroying the company and maybe the whole economy .
So , why would n’t he do it again ?
Well , next time it wo n’t be him .
We ’re on to him , so he ’s going to have spend his retirement on his yacht .
It ’ll be someone else .
It ’ll be another Cassano .
And we ’ll fall for it then as well .

The offbeat bride : Rebekah , Designer / Wannabe Entomologist
Her offbeat partner : Shayne , Computer Programmer ( AI )
Location & date of wedding : Beth Israel Hospital , Manhattan , NY — November 24 , 2009
What made our wedding offbeat :
To start with , we were married in Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan .
Shayne and I knew as soon as we started dating that we would be together for a long time to come .
About six months prior , we packed up everything we owned into a van and moved to Brooklyn .
I was going to Parsons to get my MFA and Shayne was taking a leap of faith to become a full - time musician .
A few months later , Shayne was diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma and we decided not to wait any longer .
We got married in the hospital a week after we got the diagnosis .
We thought we would n't have enough time to get wedding rings , so we decided on matching Converse – gray with pink shoelaces instead .
We considered finding a tuxedo and dress last minute , but shirts and jeans are more our style .
Then at the last minute , I went to a little jewelry store across the street and got simple silver rings .
We decided to not take one another 's last names , but instead we intertwined the first two letters of my last name ( Meek ) and the last two of his ( O' Neill ) to come up with Miel .
It also happens to mean honey in French and Spanish which is fitting considering we got matching honeybee tattoos seven months ago .
Oh , and instead of saying , " you may kiss the bride , " our officiator said , " you may high five the bride " – then we kissed .
Our biggest challenge : Shayne 's inability to leave the hospital was our biggest obstacle .
I did everything , from getting the marriage license to getting the rings , on my own or with a few people 's help .
Shayne weighed in on which shade of pink shoelaces and what kind of rings via cell phone in between procedures and talking to doctors .
The hospital , my family , friends , and co-workers were all amazing in helping put together the wedding in less than a week .
The hospital let us get married in their " Urban Zen " room , my co-workers sent flowers for my bouquet , and since I was staying at the hospital , my mom and sister took care of everything at our apartment .
Shayne and I had to focus on his health most of that week , so we had to rely on our community to support us .
My favorite moment :
After the ceremony , most folks had left for the night and Shayne and I were talking in the hallway outside of his hospital room .
One of the coordinators of the " Urban Zen " program asked if he could read us the " Apache Wedding Blessing , " because it had been read to him and his wife at their wedding .
Even though he was a complete stranger , it was that first moment we realized that we were married .
We were now a team , which meant we could get through anything .
I was expecting to bawl through the ceremony , but that was the first time we cried , but ( as cheesy as it sounds ) they were tears of joy .
My advice for offbeat brides : Remember why you want to spend the rest of your life with your partner and try to capture that in your ceremony .
We were lucky that our decision to get married and the actual ceremony were so close , so we did n't have time to perseverate over center pieces or invitations .
We 're looking forward to celebrating again when Shayne gets better – one that celebrates our community and all of the support they 've shown us .
However , we were glad to have an intimate ceremony for just the two of us , which included : a couple of t- shirts , the loved one who were nearby , and a pair of silly , in - love grins .
We had originally struggled with the idea of getting legally married – we wanted to wait until it was legal for everyone .
Once Shayne got sick , it logistically made sense for us to get married so that I could legally have the right to access his medical records , stay with him at the hospital , and make sure we had continuous insurance .
We are grateful that since we have to wait a year or more to have the wedding celebration , that by then the legal side will be so far away , it will feel like two completely different events .
Care to share a few vendor / shopping links ?
Enough talk — show me the wedding porn !
A huge offshore crane is being used to salvage parts of the sunken ship
North Korea has denied sinking a South Korean warship near their disputed maritime border last month .
" As South Korea ca n't identify the cause of the accident , they are using the media to attribute it to us , " said a statement carried by state media .
It is the first official comment by Pyongyang on the incident , in which more than 40 sailors were killed .
South Korean media has has pinned the blame on the North , but official statements have been more circumspect .
There has been speculation in the South that the naval vessel was hit by a North Korean torpedo .
South Korean officials have also previously suggested the ship could have struck an old mine left over from the 1950 - 1953 Korean War .
North Korea accused the South of " a foolish attempt " to link the incident to Pyongyang , said an official statement published by the Korean Central News Agency .
Salvage operation
Fifty - eight crew survived , but 46 sailors died in the incident on 26 March .
Salvage workers found 36 bodies in the shattered hull of the Cheonan , a 1,200 - tonne navy gunboat .
Two more bodies were recovered earlier , and another eight sailors remain unaccounted for .
The bow section of the vessel is due to be raised in about a week 's time .
The Cheonan sank close to the sea border which marks North and South Korean territorial waters .
The North does not accept the maritime border , known as the Northern Limit Line , which was drawn unilaterally by the US - led United Nations Command at the end of the Korean War .
The sea border has been the scene of deadly clashes between the navies of the two Koreas in the past .
When Georgia Peschel first heard police had raided CALM , a compassion club in Toronto , her initial panicked reaction was this : “ Now where will my son get his marijuana ? ”
For the past three years , Peschel and her 17 - year - old have made the hour - long drive into Toronto every two weeks .
They would knock on a darkened Queen St. E. storefront , follow a doorman inside , and buy $ 140 worth of marijuana from the people at CALM , or Cannabis As Living Medicine .
The Newmarket - area , church - going family hardly seem the type to frequent drug dens .
But Storm Peschel — named for his tendency to “ kick up a storm ” while in his mother ’s womb — is no regular kid .
At the age of four , Storm was diagnosed with Multiple Synostosis Syndrome , an extremely rare genetic disorder that causes his bones to slowly fuse .
Eventually , his vertebrae will meld and his cartilage will turn hard as bone .
Storm doubts he will live past 30 .
On a bad night , the pain would cause Storm to scream for hours .
When he was eight , doctors began prescribing him codeine , but the drug made him groggy , nauseated and unable to go to school .
It also made him depressed .
When Storm was 15 , Peschel decided to let her son try marijuana .
She knew this was a startling proposition for a parent to make , but her doubts went up in smoke with Storm ’s first toke .
“ I felt it lift away , ” Storm says of the pain that creaks in his hands and joints .
“ I ( now ) live a fairly normal life .
I do n’t actually feel my bone disease takes anything away anymore . ”
Since discovering cannabis , Storm has lost 75 pounds from being able to ride his bike and do other activities , and he improved his marks to make the honour roll .
He says marijuana has given him a life ; his mother says it ’s given him hope .
But to date , Storm has found just one source for easily accessible , high - quality cannabis : CALM , a compassion club that sells medical marijuana to some 3,000 registered members .
But CALM , like the dozens of other compassion clubs across Canada , is unlicensed and therefore illegal .
And at about 3:40 p.m. on March 31 , the club was raided by police and shut down for business .
“ It ’s a matter of necessity , ” says lawyer Alan Young , an advocate of medical marijuana and defender of compassion clubs .
“ There ’s a sense of necessity when you need to break the law in order to achieve a greater good . ”
In 2001 , in response to a court order , the federal government introduced the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations ( MMAR ) , which established guidelines for allowing sick Canadians to possess marijuana .
But for stakeholders of the program , there is still one vital thing missing when it comes to medical marijuana : reasonable access .
“ I think the Medical Marijuana Access Division of Health Canada is the biggest oxymoron we have in federal government , ” says Philippe Lucas , a Victoria city councillor and founder of the Vancouver Island Compassion Society .
He uses marijuana to treat the symptoms of hepatitis C , which he contracted in Ontario from a tainted blood transfusion .
“ It ’s not about improving access ; it ’s about restricting access , to the point where we literally force people to break the law in order to treat their symptoms . ”
There are two ways of getting marijuana legally , both condemned by medical cannabis users as grossly flawed .
The first is to buy from Health Canada , which contracts its supply from Saskatchewan ’s Prairie Plant Systems .
The contract expires in the fall of 2011 , and Health Canada says a “ new competitive procurement process ” was opened in April 2009 .
It is currently evaluating new bids .
But currently , the government grows only one strain of cannabis , despite research and patient feedback that show different strains have varying therapeutic effects .
Many users also complain the marijuana is vastly inferior to black market supplies , describing it as weak , irradiated ( repugnant to many medical users ) and inconvenient ( orders are currently sent by mail ) .
As of June 2009 , about 20 per cent of the 4,029 licensed Canadians were buying marijuana from the government .
Health Canada declined to provide an interview for this story but answered a few questions via email .
The second way to legally obtain marijuana is grow it yourself , or designate another person to do it for you .
This option Young calls a “ slap in the face ” — what other patients are required to grow their own medication , he asks ?
“ Pretty much the day the MMAR was proclaimed into force was the day I knew it was defective , ” Young says .
“ The routes for access to medicine were so limited that we argued they were constitutionally deficient . ”
And the courts have largely agreed .
According to Young , the government has lost as many as six court challenges related to medical marijuana , each time a judge deeming the system unconstitutional .
“ It ’s insulting and it ’s irrational , ” says Lucas .
“ If this was any other program but medical marijuana , there would be an incredible uproar right now .
This would be a government scandal of the highest order . ”
Young criticizes the government for only improving the program reflexively when forced by the courts .
And even when changes are made , they are often minimal ; in 2003 , Young successfully challenged an MMAR restriction that forbade pot growers from supplying to more than one user .
A federal court deemed this “ one - to - one ” restriction unconstitutional and ordered Health Canada to expand it .
Health Canada did , just barely , to two - to - one .
“ If you do n’t tell me that ’s the ultimate disrespect and contempt to me , to patients and to the court , I do n’t know what is , ” Young says .
Compassion club owners say they ’re simply doing what Health Canada wo n’t .
“ We bridge the gap between regulation and reality , ” says CALM owner Neev Tapiero .
“ I knew I was helping people and I was quite confidant a jury trial would never convict me . ”
Tapiero started CALM in 1996 and moved it to its current location in 2004 .
The club ’s exterior is unmarked , its windows blackened , but inside , CALM has all the trappings of a clinic : waiting room , pamphlets , customer kiosks with scales and hand sanitizer .
CALM rules say all members must be licensed or have doctor ’s notes confirming their condition .
But the shadowy nature of compassion clubs can invite skepticism about their true motivations , and certainly some of them are shady .
Prominent AIDS activist Jim Wakeford , the first Canadian granted federal exemption for marijuana possession , has accused compassion clubs of profiting off sick people by selling at black market prices ( most clubs charge between $ 6 to $ 12 per gram ; Health Canada charges $ 5 ) .
Tapiero insists CALM steers clear of organized crime and also inspects its marijuana with a microscope .
As for the prices , Tapiero says they ’re regrettably high , but he has four employees , legal fees , rental payments and a two - year - old son to provide for .
He declined to disclose his earnings but says he pays taxes .
Police contend compassion clubs are definitely making profits and that when CALM was raided , cops seized three bags of cash and some 18,700 grams of marijuana and hashish , with a total estimated street value of more than $ 200,000 .
( Tapiero says quantities were exaggerated by police . )
Tapiero was arrested , along with eight CALM employees and volunteers , and all are now facing drug trafficking charges .

The raid was captured by CALM ’s security cameras , however , and the club has since posted the video online , prompting outrage from members and supporters .
“ It ’s a public relations nightmare , ” Young says .
“ The officer who decided imprudently to raid the club did not know the bigger picture , and I ’m assuming he must regret his decision because you ca n’t win . ”
Detective Jim Brons , who conducted the raid , admits he was unaware of the legal context swirling around medical cannabis prior to making the arrests .
He also recently learned of the club ’s existence after transferring to 51 Division last summer .
Brons sympathizes with patients who rely on CALM , but says that as a police officer , he simply could n’t ignore the “ numerous ” community complaints being made about the club .
“ Nobody really wants to engage a compassionate centre in an investigation , ” he says .
“ But they can not supersede the laws . ”
The detective does concede the issue is ambiguous , however , and that he ’d like to see clarification from higher - ups .
“ Give us some guidelines because right now , there are no guidelines for the Toronto police in relation to compassionate centres , ” he says .
“ I think that ’s why they have n’t been enforced . ”
If history is any indication , the CALM arrests are unlikely to result in convictions .
In 2002 , the Toronto Compassion Centre was raided but all the drug - related charges were dropped 17 months later .
The federal justice department said proceeding with a prosecution would be against the public interest .
Tapiero ’s lawyer , Ron Marzel , is confident CALM ’s charges will similarly disappear .
But changes are afoot , according to Health Canada .
In an email to the Star , a spokesperson said the government is considering “ longer - term measures ” to revise the medical marijuana program , focusing on “ key areas ” such as reasonable access .
Public safety and security and overall costs to the government are also being evaluated .
Alan Young has a tiny spark of hope .
In December , for the first time ever , he secured a meeting with Health Canada officials to discuss improving the program .
He will meet with them again on Monday .
“ It may be that the tide is turning and Health Canada will try to fix the problem , ” he says , cautiously optimistic .
“ I think they know they ’re vulnerable .
They ’ve played their hand too far now . ”
Young is proposing that Health Canada end its monopoly on marijuana production and start regulating the private sector .
He already has a person in mind for Canada ’s first supplier of medical marijuana : Sam Mellace , a former Torontonian now living near Vancouver .
Mellace was once connected with CALM but the relationship dissolved over personal differences with Tapiero .
He is now critical of compassion clubs but says he shares the same goal : to bring accessible and affordable marijuana to sick Canadians .
He suffers from chronic pain himself and has one of the biggest licences in Canada , permitting him to grow nearly 300 plants .
Because of the scale of his grow - op , Mellace thinks his company , New Age Medical Solutions , is ready to start legally producing on an industrial scale for no more than $ 5 a gram .
He is also developing alternatives to smoking cannabis , such as creams and butters .
Health Canada killed a 2006 pilot project to examine marijuana distribution through pharmacies , citing provincial and territorial barriers , but Mellace envisions a future where clinics can prescribe medical marijuana and patients can buy their dosages at Shoppers Drug Mart .
Such a future would certainly the Peschels ’ lives easier .
But for now , the reality is that Georgia will continue buying marijuana for Storm any way she can .
“ I will do whatever it takes to take away my son ’s pain , ” she says fiercely .
“ If it means I have to go downtown and try and find someone to buy drugs off of , I would do it .
“ Tell me any mother who would n’t . ”
Do n't tell your kids , but we snuck a whole head of cauliflower into these garlic mashed potatoes .
The cauliflower , garlic and potatoes are all cooked at the same time and mashed with butter and cream cheese .
Your kids will love this side dish and the best part is you wo n't have to remind them to eat their vegetables !
Boiled peanuts are the official snack food of South Carolina , says alkapal .
They have a similar texture to edamame ( Japanese boiled soybeans ) , although edamame have a flavor more reminiscent of green lima beans ; alkapal prefers boiled peanuts .
They have to be made fresh , from raw peanuts in the shell , and they need to boil for six hours , with lots of salt .
But it ’s worth it : “ Better than caviar , ” says alkapal .
For Chinese - style boiled peanuts , “ boil raw , shelled peanuts with the skin on , preferably , in salted water and a few star anise , ” says cimui .
Cook until tender , about an hour , and drizzle with sesame oil , if you like .
In Hawaii , boiled peanuts are also prepared the Chinese way , with star anise , says KaimukiMan .
And a last word : “ Chinese boiled peanuts and some Rémy Martin go together like peanut butter and jelly , ” says ipsedixit .

Food stamp usage is up again except the program is now called SNAP Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program .
Inquiring minds are looking at a SNAP Participation Table that shows a record 39,430,724 receive SNAP benefits , a 22.4 % increase from a year ago .
Biggest State Increases
Arizona - 32.9 %
Colorado - 32.9 %
Florida - 38.6 %
Idaho - 45.7 %
Nevada - 46.9 %
Rhode Island - 42.4 %
South Dakota - 32.6 %
Utah - 37.3 %
Wisconsin - 38.9 %
Wyoming - 40.0 %
Those numbers are as of January 2010
Households
Household SNAP participants increased from 12,728,981 in Fiscal Year 2008 to 15,232,105 in fiscal year 2009 , a 16.4 % increase .
For comparison purposes , watch the growth in household participation .
SNAP Household Participation
FY 2005 - 11,197,377
FY 2006 - 11,734,491
FY 2007 - 11,789,594

FY 2007 - $ 33.19 Billion
FY 2008 - $ 37.66 Billion
FY 2009 - $ 53.63 Billion
Household and cost numbers are as of March 30 , 2010 .
Clearly the recession took its toll , and will continue to do so until there is a dramatic decrease in the unemployment rate .

BOULDER — A 20 - year - old Boulder man was arrested early Sunday after police said he crawled naked into a woman ’s bed , then refused to cooperate with officers who arrived at the apartment .
Boulder police were called to a woman ’s apartment in the 1000 block of 12th Street about 4:30 a.m.
Sunday on a report that an unknown man — later identified as Stuart Wilkinson — had crawled into bed with the woman while she slept , according to police spokeswoman Sarah Huntley .
The woman told officers she hurried out of bed and went into her roommate ’s room to call police , Huntley said .
Officers determined that another roommate had come back from a party with Wilkinson , who wandered into the wrong room by mistake , Huntley said .
Wilkinson , who officers said was drunk , refused to cooperate with police when they knocked on the bedroom door and ordered him to come out , Huntley said .
Wilkinson was arrested on suspicion of minor in possession of alcohol and obstructing a peace officer .
The woman who he crawled into bed with did n’t want to press charges , Huntley said .

Jimmy Choo , a world - renowned footwear brand , is organizing a real - time treasure hunt around London via Foursquare .
One pair of Jimmy Choo trainers will check in at various locations and those who follow the campaign and are lucky enough to arrive at a venue before the trainers leave will get to pick a pair in the style and size of their choosing .
Contestants must be at least 16 years old .
The sneakers — and , presumably , the marketing minion assigned to carry them around — are checking in at trendy spots such as Lounge Lover , The Hummingbird Bakery and the members - only Mortons .
The campaign is Jimmy Choo brand 's first foray into social media marketing ; a rep said they wanted to use Foursquare to engage fans both online and off .
She also believes that this is " the first time Foursquare has been used to check in an object ( rather than a person ) at locations . "
Interested parties in London can follow the shoes on Foursquare .
The rest of us can stay updated via the campaign 's Twitter account .
What do you think of this marketing ploy ?

KVM , QEMU , and kernel project management

The KVM virtualization subsystem is seen as one of the great success stories of contemporary kernel development .
KVM came from nowhere into a situation with a number of established players - both free and proprietary - and promptly found a home in the kernel and in the marketing plans of a number of Linux companies .
Both the code and its development model are seen as conforming much more closely to the Linux way of doing things than the alternatives ; KVM is expected to belong - term virtualization solution for Linux .
So , one might well wonder , why has KVM been the topic of one of the more massive and less pleasant linux - kernel discussions in some time ?
Yanmin Zhang was probably not expecting to set off a flame war with the posting of a patch adding a set of KVM - related commands to the " perf " tool .
The value of this patch seems obvious : beyond allowing a host to collect performance statistics on a running guest , it enables the profiling of the host / guest combination as a whole .
One can imagine that there would be value to being able to see how the two systems interact .
The problem , it seems , is that this feature requires that the host have access to specific information from the running KVM guest : at a minimum , it needs the guest kernel 's symbol table .
More involved profiling will require access to files in the guest 's namespaces .
To this end , Ingo Molnar suggested that life would be easier if the host could mount ( read - only ) all of the filesystems which were active in the guest .
It would also be nice , he said elsewhere , if the host could easily enumerate running guests and assign names to them .
The response he got was " no way . "
Various security issues were raised , despite the fact that the filesystems on the host would not be world - readable , and despite the fact that , in the end , the host has total control over the guest anyway .
Certainly there are some interesting questions , especially when frameworks like SELinux are thrown into the mix .
But Ingo took that answer as a statement of unwillingness to cooperate with other developers to improve the usability of KVM , especially on developers ' desktop systems .
What followed was a sometimes acrimonious and often repetitive discussion between Ingo and KVM developer Avi Kivity , with a small group of supporting actors on both sides .
Ingo 's position is that any development project , to be successful , must make life easy for users who contribute code .
So , he says , the system should be most friendly toward developers who want to run KVM on their desktop .
Beyond that , he claims that a stronger desktop orientation is crucial to our long - term success in general :
I.e. the kernel can very much improve quality all across the board by providing a sane default ( in the ext3 case ) - or , as in the case of perf , by providing a sane ' baseline ' tooling .
It should do the same for KVM as well .
If we do n't do that , Linux will eventually stop mattering on the desktop - and some time after that , it will vanish from the server space as well .
Then , may it be a decade down the line , you wo n't have a KVM hacking job left , and you wo n't know where all those forces eliminating your project came from .
Avi , needless to say , sees things differently :
It 's a fact that virtualization is happening in the data center , not on the desktop .
You think a kvm GUI can become a killer application ?
fine , write one .
You do n't need any consent from me as kvm maintainer ( if patches are needed to kvm that improve the desktop experience , I 'll accept them , though they 'll have to pass my unreasonable microkernelish filters ) .
If you 're right then the desktop kvm GUI will be a huge hit with zillions of developers and people will drop Windows and switch to Linux just to use it .
But my opinion is that it will end up like virtualbox , a nice app that you can use to run Windows - on - Linux , but is not all that useful .
Ingo 's argument is not necessarily that users will flock to the platform , though ; what seems to be important is attracting developers .
A KVM which is easier to work with should inspire developers to work with it , improving its quality further .
Anthony Liguori , though , points out that the much nicer desktop experience provided by VirtualBox has not yet brought in a flood of developers to fix its performance problems .
Another thing that Ingo is unhappy with is the slow pace of improvement , especially with regard to the QEMU emulator used to provide a full system environment for guest systems .
A big part of the problem , he says , is the separation between the KVM and QEMU , despite the fact that they are fairly tightly - coupled components .
Ingo claimed that this separation is exactly the sort of problem which brought down Xen , and that the solution is to pull QEMU into the kernel source tree :
If you want to jump to the next level of technological quality you need to fix this attitude and you need to go back to the design roots of KVM .
Concentrate on Qemu ( as that is the weakest link now ) , make it a first class member of the KVM repo and simplify your development model by having a single repo .
From Ingo 's point of view , such a move makes perfect sense .
KVM is the biggest user of the QEMU project which , he says , was dying before KVM came along .
Bundling the two components would allow ABI work to be done simultaneously on both sides of the interface , with simultaneous release dates .
Kernel and user - space developers would be empowered to improve the code on both sides of the boundary .
Bringing perf into the kernel tree , he says , grew the external developer community from one to over 60 in less than one year .
Indeed , integration into the kernel tree is the reason why perf has been successful :
If you are interested in the first - hand experience of the people who are doing the perf work then here it is : by far the biggest reason for perf success and perf usability is the integration of the user - space tooling with the kernel - space bits , into a single repository and project .
Clearly ,
Ingo believes that integrating QEMU into the kernel tree would have similar effects there .
Just as clearly , the KVM and QEMU developers disagree .
To them , this proposal looks like a plan to fork QEMU development - though , it should be said , KVM already uses a forked version of QEMU .
This fork ,
Avi says , is " definitely hurting . "
According to Anthony , moving QEMU into the kernel tree would widen that fork :
We lose a huge amount of users and contributors if we put QEMU in the Linux kernel .
As I said earlier , a huge number of our contributions come from people not using KVM .
The KVM / QEMU developers are unconvinced that they will get more developers by moving the code into the kernel tree , and they seem frankly amused by the notion that kernel developers might somehow produce a more desktop - oriented KVM .
They see the separation of the projects as not being a problem , and wonder where the line would be drawn ;
Avi suggested that the list of projects which do n't belong in the kernel might be shorter in the end .
In summary , they see a system which does not appear to be broken - QEMU is said to be improving quickly - and that " fixing " it by merging repositories is not warranted .
Particular exception was taken to Ingo 's assertion that a single repository allows for quicker and better development of the ABI between the components .
Slower , says Zachary Amsden , tends to be better in these situations :
This is actually a Good Thing ( tm ) .
It means you have to get your feature and its interfaces well defined and able to version forwards and backwards independently from each other .
And that introduces some complexity and time and testing , but in the end it 's what you want .
You do n't introduce a requirement to have the feature , but take advantage of it if it is there .
Ingo , though , sees things differently based on his experience over time :
It did n't work , trust me - and i've been around long enough to have suffered through the whole 2.5.x misery .
Some of our worst ABIs come from that cycle as well ...
And you can also see the countless examples of carefully drafted , well thought out , committee written computer standards that were honed for years , which are not worth the paper they are written on .
' extra time ' and ' extra bureaucratic overhead to think things through ' is about the worst thing you can inject into a development process .
As the discussion wound down , it seemed clear that neither side had made much progress in convincing the other of anything .
That means that the status quo will prevail ; if the KVM maintainers are not interested in making a change , the rest of the community will be hard - put to override them .
Such things have happened - the x86 and x86 - 64 merger is a classic example - but to override a maintainer in that way requires a degree of consensus in the community which does not appear to be present here .
Either that , or a decree from Linus - and he has been silent in this debate .
So the end result looks like this :
Please consider ' perf kvm ' scrapped indefinitely , due to lack of robust KVM instrumentation features : due to lack of robust + universal vcpu / guest enumeration and due to lack of robust + universal symbol access on the KVM side .
It was a really promising feature IMO and i invested two days of arguments into it trying to find a workable solution , but it was not to be .
Whether that 's really the end for " perf kvm " remains to be seen ; it 's a clearly useful feature that may yet find a way to get into the kernel .
But this disconnect between the KVM developers and the perf developers is a clear roadblock in the way of getting this sort of feature merged for now .
Many people who install Linux on a machine at their workplace or university also wish to connect their machine to the local area network , so that they can make use of an Internet connection or other machines on the network .
If you are one of these people and the only thing that has been stopping you is not knowing where to start , I hope this article will demonstrate that it is easy to do so - as long as you are properly prepared and know what things to watch out for .
The following are a few key areas to consider when connecting your Linux machine to a network :
The type of network you are connecting to .
The type of network interface card ( NIC ) you will need .
Configuring the kernel to support the network interface card .
Addresses - Host , network , broadcast and router .
Configuring Linux for your network connection .
Routing .
Names and nameservers .
The type of network you are connecting to is very important for a number of reasons .
Most important is the many different network types .
Currently Linux provides good support for Ethernet networks , but not much support for other network types such as ARCNet , Token Ring , FDDI and wireless LANs .
If you intend to use an Ethernet network , keep reading .
If not , do n't despair — some very promising development efforts are under way to provide support for the other types of networks .
Ethernet
If you are fortunate enough to have an Ethernet network to connect to , then you still have to determine what type of cabling has been installed .
Two popular types of cabling are employed , and you will need to find out which has been installed so you can choose an appropriate type of network interface card .
The most popular cabling types are 10 base2 , commonly called “ ThinNet ” , which uses 5 mm diameter coaxial cable and BNC ( bayonet type ) connectors , and 10 baseT , commonly called “ twisted pair ” or “ unshielded twisted pair ” , which uses a cable with four conductors and an RJ - 45 ( telephone type ) connector .
The type of cabling will help determine what type of network interface card to choose for your Linux machine .
Ethernet Card
Your network interface card needs to have a connector that suits the cabling type you have installed .
A number of modern cards come with both types of connector , and these are generally called “ combo ” cards .
You should also think about whether you want a card suitable for an 8 bit slot or a 16 bit slot .
The 16 bit cards perform better but are generally slightly more expensive .
Another factor to consider is the bus type .
If you are using a PCI machine , naturally you will need a NIC that suits a PCI bus .
Be careful : you must also ensure that the type of card you choose is supported by a Linux kernel driver .
It is best to avoid “ clone ” cards .
While Linux supports some clones of popular cards , not all clones are the same .
To be sure there are no problems , obtain the genuine article or try the card before you buy it .
The Ethernet - HOWTO lists the types of cards supported by Linux and contains descriptions of each of them .
You should refer to it before spending any money on a card .
The HOWTO recommends you opt for a 16 bit card such as the 3Com 3c503/16 or the SMC Elite 16 / WD8013 .
Other cards which you might consider if you have a Vesa Local Bus or PCI motherboard are the BOCA Research cards .
You might also choose an NE2000 , but be careful , since some cards that claim 100 % compatibility are not 100 % compatible .
( Their claims are based on being “ 100 % software compatible ” , meaning that they provide drivers for DOS that allow , for example , NetWare access .
These drivers are useless with Linux . )
Cards to avoid are the 3Com 3c501 card ( it performs badly and is broken by design ) and Cabletron and Xircom cards , since free Linux drivers are unlikely ever to be available for their products , because these companies have chosen to require a non-disclosure agreement before releasing programming information , which would make it illegal to write a freely distributable Linux driver .
When installing the NIC you must make sure that the card 's configuration does not clash with any other installed hardware .
Some cards come with a DOS program to configure them .
They use a programmable interface , and you should run this to “ strap ” the card with the configuration you want .
You should be particularly careful of the IRQ , control port address and shared memory address settings .
Each of these must be free for your NIC to use and be unused by any other hardware in the computer .
I use a WD8003 strapped for control port 0x280 , IRQ 7 and Shared Memory 0xD0000 .
Be careful if you use specialized hardware such as SCSI controllers or Multiport Serial cards , as they often use IRQ or Control Port settings in similar ranges , and may conflict .
After you have physically installed the NIC , your next step is to check if your kernel already has support for your card .
If it does n't , recompile it so that it does .
The easiest way to check if your kernel already supports your card is to reboot your machine .
Check that the card is properly detected by the kernel by reading the messages the kernel prints when it is booting .
If your card is properly detected , the kernel will print a message something like : eth0 : WD80x3 at 0x280 , 00 00 C0 AD 37 1C WD8003 , IRQ 7 , shared memory at 0xd0000 - 0xd1 fff .
wd.c:v1.10
9/23/94 Donald Becker ( becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov )
The settings listed should match those that you configured your card for .
If your card has not been properly detected , rebuild your kernel to make sure the kernel has support .
This is pretty straightforward and you have likely done it before .
You simply change to the /usr / src / linux directory and run make config .
You will be prompted as to whether to include various drivers .
The most important sections for you to answer Yes to are : Networking Support ?
TCP / IP networking ?
Network device support ?
The driver for your card .
After you have configured the kernel to support all of the hardware you have installed , you do a make dep ; make to build the kernel .
Do n't forget to do a make zlilo so that lilo will run your new kernel when you reboot .
If you are happy that all has gone well , then you can reboot your machine and check that your card is properly detected as described earlier .
If it is n't , double check that you have done everything correctly and that you have no hardware conflict .
If you still have problems , refer to the Ethernet - HOWTO again , as it has lots of information to help guide you through determining what might be the problem .

" It 's tough to compete in an industry where your customers expect your product to be free .
Such is the case with software , where giveaways have seemingly become the norm .
( Try selling a Web browser or an audio player in 2010 . )
Some developers have turned to advertising to underwrite their efforts .
More recently , a few software vendors have begun offering Internet services as a way to add value to their products and raise revenue .
But the latter model is not without its pitfalls .
" Take Canonical , for example .
The company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution now offers cloud - based data synchronization services under the Ubuntu One brand .
You can get 2GB of storage for free ; $ 10 per month gets you 50GB .
Soon Canonical will be expanding its offering to include contact synchronization for smartphones -- also for a fee -- and an Ubuntu One Music Store as a Linux - based competitor to iTunes .
" These are bold moves , to be sure .
Canonical seems to be borrowing a page from Microsoft 's playbook , where " software plus services " is the new mantra .
But there 's just one problem :
For a small company whose core competency is software development , an online service - based business is a whole new ballgame .
Software vendors who hope to follow in Canonical 's footsteps should tread carefully . "
Drop7 , the simple puzzle game that made a splash on the iPhone in January 2009 , was released on the Android Market in late March .
The port was released to little fanfare , but anybody who loves games and owns a smartphone that runs Google 's Android operating system should stand up and take notice .
Drop7 , priced at $ 3 , is the first truly great game available for the platform .
If you 're not already familiar with the game from peering jealously over the shoulders of your iPhone - equipped friends , here 's how it works :
Players slide and drop numbered dots into a Tetris - style playfield .
If the rows or columns they create are as deep or wide as the values on one of the dots , those dots will disappear .
Until now , gaming on the Android platform has been in dire straits .
But last month , Google hoped to motivate developers to make more games by delivering a series of talks at the Game Developer 's Conference in San Francisco .
Attendees were schooled in the ways of Android game development and given a Droid or Nexus One phone just for showing up .
If you 're like me , and invested in the notion of playing great games on your phone , you 'd be wise to reward Area Code Inc. for porting Drop7 to Android .
In other words : Buy this game .

After weeks of debate over whether the measure should be paid for , the Senate today approved an $ 18 billion short - term extension of unemployment and medical benefits that will affect hundreds of thousands of out - of - work Americans .
The legislation , approved 59 - 38 , would extend through June 2 unemployment insurance for people who have been out of work for several months and have exhausted their state - paid unemployment program .
" We have a responsibility to make sure out - of - work Americans can still access the vital safety - net programs they need to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table while Congress works to pass a longer - term solution , " said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont .
Action on the bill comes on the same day the Labor Department reported that first - time requests for jobless benefits rose by 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 484,000 , the highest level since late February , according to the Associated Press .
The measure also extends the COBRA program -- which allows people to continue to receive the health insurance they had from a former employer -- and delays a 21 % cut in Medicare reimbursements to doctors .
The bill now heads to the House , which is expected to vote on it later tonight .
Some Republicans , including Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky , have opposed the legislation because the measure will add to the nation 's budget deficit .
" We all want to make sure that the unemployed continue to receive these important benefits so they can make ends meet while they search for work , but we also need to make sure this spending is paid for , " Bunning said in a statement .
Updated 7:27 p.m. ET .
Three Republicans voted with Democrats on the bill : George Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine .
Three Democrats did not vote : Evan Bayh of Indiana , Bill Nelson of Florida and Mark Warner of Virginia .

A Tokyo Agriculture and Technology ( TAT ) University postgraduate student is seen demonstrating the new power - assist suit for elderly agriculture workers , developed by TAT professor Shigeki Toyama .
The power assist suits are said to reduce the user 's physical effort by about 62 percent .
While Robocop and Iron Man can dodge bullets and crush villains , a new powered suit from Japan promises its elderly users more modest powers , such as pulling up radishes without getting a backache .
Unlike its heavily - armed Hollywood counterparts , the Power Assist Suit aims to make life easier for Japan 's army of greying farmers .
The metal - and - plastic exoskeleton boasts eight electric motors that amplify the strength of the wearer 's arms and legs , as well as sensors that can detect movements and respond to commands through a voice - recognition system .
Professor Shigeki Toyama and his team developed the power - enhancing suit at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology , and Toyama plans to set up a company to start producing the futuristic outfit by the end of the year .
" If the farmer bends over to grasp a radish , his back will be firmly supported , " said Gohei Yamamoto , one of the students working on the team , as he recently demonstrated the suit on his university campus .
" A brief vocal instruction will instantly straighten the rods along his legs , giving him the power he needs to pull the vegetable without effort . "
Fifteen years in the making , the robosuit will soon hit the market in Japan to help ageing farmers harvest their fruit and vegetables while avoiding backaches and nasty cramps , its developers say .
Japan , with a low birthrate and a high life expectancy , is facing a demographic crisis as its population rapidly ages and shrinks .
Industrial robots have long been common in Japan , and robo - suits are making inroads in hospitals and retirement homes , where they can help carers lift patients or aid in physical rehabilitation exercises .
But with two thirds of the country 's farm - workers already over 65 years old , the agriculture sector is a potentially lucrative untapped market .
The suit should hit the Japanese market in 2012 , when it will initially retail for about one million yen ( 11,000 dollars ) , a price tag its makers hope to halve if the device is mass - produced , the team said .
There are however no plans so far to sell the suits overseas .
" I doubt that the suit would sell in Europe and in America , where foreign migrants workers often perform farm - related tasks , " Toyama said .
The team has developed a heavy - duty 30 kilogram ( 66 pound ) model , for lifting big loads and pulling vegetables out of the ground , and a 23 kilogram version designed for lighter tasks such as picking grapes .
The robo-suits can reduce the user 's physical effort by 62 percent on average , the inventors say .
When bending knees the muscular activity is reduced by half , and the suit can also take most of the strain out of crouching .
" We conducted a survey of 102 people for the latest model , asking what part of the body hurt when they picked grapes , " Yamamoto said .
" Most farmers complained about aches in their arms , necks and lower backs . "
The suits are already tough , but soon they will also become smarter .
By the end of the year Toyama plans to start working on augmented reality goggles on which useful information could be displayed for the farmer , in much the same way as data is projected onto the inside of a fighter jet 's cockpit .
Useful information might include how ripe the grapes are , or the user 's heart rate and calorie consumption , said Toyama .
" The goggles would tell you for instance how long you 've been working and when you should rest . "

The WWF sponsored Earth Hour has already come and gone in the Korean time zone , and the North Korean proletariat has claimed a stunning victory over its evil capitalist neighbor , South Korea .
Oh , wait .
Seems it is always that way .
I like this line from Alan Caruba at the link above :
Like fire , electricity is truly a gift of the gods .
It is the difference between the Dark Age and the present age …
I know WUWT carried this photo before , but it is always good to regularly remind ourselves how much we have to be thankful for .
It also reminds me that if we could get our hands on North Korean surface temperature records , we ’d be able to get a minimally UHI polluted signal .

This is one of the strangest things I 've watched .
I 'm still shaking my head over this one .
Intel is developing an edition of the Linux - based Meego OS that will work on mainstream laptops and desktops , a company executive said this week .
The chip maker released the first editions of Meego to developers in late March .
One edition was for netbooks running on Intel 's Atom chips , and another was for Nokia 's N900 smartphone .
Beyond netbooks and smartphones , the company is also focusing Meego development around entry - level desktops with Intel 's Atom processors , said Doug Fisher , vice president of the software and services group at Intel , in an interview this week .
The company plans to release an edition of Meego for entry - level desktops that will also work with mainstream laptops and desktops running on Intel 's faster Core processors , Fisher said .
He did not provide a specific release date for the Meego desktop edition .
Nevertheless , a bulk of the development around Meego will be focused on netbooks , smartphones and devices like TVs and set - top boxes , Fisher said .
A Meego edition for handset devices will be released in October , and netbooks with Meego will appear in the second half of this year , Fisher said .
Many laptop makers , including Asustek Computer and Acer , have already voiced support for Meego .
Intel is also keeping tabs on emerging form factors such as tablets .
The company is adding touch capabilities to the OS and has said that an edition for tablets was under consideration , Fisher noted .
The user experiences on smartphones , netbooks and PCs differ , and separate editions have to be developed for those devices , Fisher said .
The differences depend on features including user interfaces , screen sizes and processors , Fisher said .
For example , the smartphone editions have user interfaces designed for smaller screens , while desktops need user interfaces for larger screens .
Smartphones also use different processors , and most of the smartphones today are based on Arm processors .
Intel has opened up Meego to Arm processors but is also investing heavily in software development for its upcoming Moorestown chips , which will go into smartphones .
The Meego OS , announced in February , merges Intel 's Moblin and Nokia 's Maemo Linux - based operating systems .
Meego 's development is managed by The Linux Foundation .
Intel and Nokia are pouring resources into development of the OS .
Fisher said the aim behind Meego is to provide an OS optimized to allow devices with Intel chips to easily communicate with each other .
Many devices have multiple operating systems and cannot interact with each other .
Meego will allow interoperability between devices based on similar architectures , which could reduce software development costs for service providers .
Meego also helps consolidate an open - source landscape that is highly fragmented , Fisher said .
Multiple versions of Linux are available today for netbooks and smartphones .
Google is developing the Chrome OS for netbooks and has released the Android OS for smartphones and tablets .
Canonical is offering an edition of its Linux - based Ubuntu OS for netbooks .
But Fisher said that Ubuntu and Google are partners , and as a chip maker , Intel 's competition comes from chip designers like Arm .
Intel 's main goal is not to put Meego on as many devices as possible , but to ensure that the device works with Intel architecture .
" We want to ensure that it has an optimized operating environment , " Fisher said .
Abercrombie & Fitch is known for its edgy adverts featuring teenage models
The chief executive of Abercrombie & Fitch is being paid $ 4 m ( £ 2.6 m ) to curb his personal use of the company plane .
Michael Jeffries previously had unlimited use of the firm 's aircraft .
In 2008 , his personal use incurred costs of $ 1.1 m .
Now , if he exceeds $ 200,000 a year he must reimburse the teen retailer .
Mr Jeffries would also have to pay some of the $ 4 m back if he were to leave the company without " good reason " before his contract runs out in February 2014 .
CORPORATE JET SET
In late 2008 , executives from Ford , Chrysler and GM looking for a taxpayer - funded bail - out were criticised for taking private jets from Detroit to Washington Enron had seven private jets .
And while its stock was plunging , it is reported that chairman Ken Lay was examining fabric swatches to decide on the interior for his firm 's newest plane Last year , RBS sold the jet used by former boss Sir Fred Goodwin .
It had bought the plane in 2002 just as it was cutting about 18,000 jobs following the takeover of Natwest
The move was revealed in a US Securities & Exchange Commission filing which has been released .
Mr Jeffries ' personal use of the plane averaged about $ 850,000 a year between 2006 and 2008 , according to previous company regulatory filings .
Many companies have been cutting down on executives ' personal use of the corporate jet in the last couple of years , although compensation for doing so is unusual .
Mr Jeffries has been chief executive since 1992 and is widely credited with revitalising the brand in the 1990s by marketing its preppy clothing to teenagers .

NASA 's Goddard Space Center has released a fascinating time lapse video of Earth 's North Pole turning into a popsicle from orbit .
So much for global warming :
Sea ice coverage over the Arctic Ocean oscillates over the course of a year , growing through winter and reaching a maximum extent by February or March .
This year , Arctic sea ice grew to levels beyond those measured in recent years but slightly below average when compared to the 30 - year satellite record .

The video goes from September 1 , 2009 — minimun Artic ice levels — to March 30 , 2010 — the day before the maximum 2010 levels .

Beijing scientists are poised to carry out DNA testing on a mystery beast captured by hunters and dubbed the " oriental yeti " , the Telegraph reports .
The creature was snared in Sichuan province " after locals reported spotting what they thought was a bear " .
Hunter Lu Chin said : " It looks a bit like a bear but it does n't have any fur and it has a tail like a kangaroo .
It also does not sound like a bear - it has a voice more like a cat and it is calling all the time - perhaps it is looking for the rest of its kind or maybe it's the last one ?
He concluded : " There are local legends of a bear that used to be a man and some people think that 's what we caught . "
A quick trawl of the interwebs reveals a rather more plausible explanation for the animal : it 's simply a Binturong with a nasty case of mange .
Aficionados of legendary beasts may recall the case of the Texan chupacabras - the fearsome goat - sucking hell critter which , some suggested , was actually either a Xoloitzcuintli or mangy coyote :

For all the current buzz about Marvel Studios ’ Iron Man 2 , which has already opened in some regions and opens in the U.S. on May 7 , there ’s already a slightly lower hum generating for Marvel ’s next movie , the first feature film based on Stan Lee and Jack Kirby ’s Norse God Thor .
Although the movie has been shooting for months , it ’s somewhat surprising how little has gotten out other than a recent spy picture , so many have been wondering when we might get a chance to see the film ’s unconventional choice to play the Thunder God , little known Australian actor Chris Hemsworth , in costume .
Well , the wait is over and Yahoo !
Movies are the lucky mortals who have received the very first picture of just that .

OSLO ( Reuters ) - A thaw of Iceland ’s ice caps in coming decades caused by climate change may trigger more volcanic eruptions by removing a vast weight and freeing magma from deep below ground , scientists said on Friday .
An aerial handout photo from the Icelandic Coast Guard shows melting ice caused by a volcanic eruption at Eyjafjalla Glacier in southern Iceland April 14 , 2010 .
The volcanic eruption on Wednesday partially melted a glacier , setting off a major flood that threatened to damage roads and bridges and forcing hundreds to evacuate from a thinly populated area .

They said there was no sign that the current eruption from below the Eyjafjallajokull glacier that has paralysed flights over northern Europe was linked to global warming .
The glacier is too small and light to affect local geology .
“ Our work suggests that eventually there will be either somewhat larger eruptions or more frequent eruptions in Iceland in coming decades , ” said Freysteinn Sigmundsson , a vulcanologist at the University of Iceland .
“ Global warming melts ice and this can influence magmatic systems , ” he told Reuters .
The end of the Ice Age 10,000 years ago coincided with a surge in volcanic activity in Iceland , apparently because huge ice caps thinned and the land rose .
“ We believe the reduction of ice has not been important in triggering this latest eruption , ” he said of Eyjafjallajokull .
“ The eruption is happening under a relatively small ice cap . ”
Carolina Pagli , a geophysicist at the University of Leeds in England , said there were risks that climate change could also trigger volcanic eruptions or earthquakes in places such as Mount Erebus in Antarctica , the Aleutian islands of Alaska or Patagonia in South America .
MAGMA
“ The effects would be biggest with ice - capped volcanoes , ” she said .
“ If you remove a load that is big enough you will also have an effect at depths on magma production . ”
She and Sigmundsson wrote a 2008 paper in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters about possible links between global warming and Icelandic volcanoes .
That report said that about 10 percent of Iceland ’s biggest ice cap , Vatnajokull , has melted since 1890 and the land nearby was rising about 25 millimetres ( 0.98 inch ) a year , bringing shifts in geological stresses .
They estimated that the thaw had led to the formation of 1.4 cubic km ( 0.3 cubic mile ) of magma deep below ground over the past century .
At high pressures such as under an ice cap , they reckon that rocks cannot expand to turn into liquid magma even if they are hot enough .
“ As the ice melts the rock can melt because the pressure decreases , ” she said .
Sigmundsson said that monitoring of the Vatnajokull volcano since 2008 suggested that the 2008 estimate for magma generation was “ probably a minimum estimate .
It can be somewhat larger . ”
He said that melting ice seemed the main way in which climate change , blamed mainly on use of fossil fuels , could have knock - on effects on geology .
The U.N. climate panel says that global warming will cause more floods , droughts and rising seas .

THE GRIP OF LOVE - Tom Verlaine
Over the years , here at Moistworks , we 've considered love in all its forms , at least as seen through the prism of the pop song .
This year , we are standing down .
Our weapons are holstered .
Orders from above : the topic has been deemed too tragicomic .
We got a note that explained the orders , from above .
The note read , in part , " Give it a rest .
If you see it out and about , arrest it .
If you see something about it , give it back . "
The note had tears on letters like magnification and torn sides like amplification .
But it 's Valentine 's Day , and we have a responsibility , so we 're reposting last year 's entry .
Happy Unhurt Heart .
Why are people so quick to love movies , books , songs , paintings , restaurants , and sports teams but so slow to love other people ?
Sages have been debating this issue for centuries , and continue to the present day .
Bill Sage , a kid I went to high school with , used to talk about the girl he was dating , how she was a hot girl who was smart or maybe a smart girl who was hot .
" Maybe she 's the overlap , " he said .
" I love the idea of the overlap . "
But he never loved her , and she found that out a few years later in college , and promptly slept with someone else .
It was n't me , but I knew the guy , and after she got rid of him , too , we became friends .
Now she 's living in a western state , where she works for a company that helps other companies manage inventory .
I spoke to her not so long ago , and she said that her personal life was frustrating , not exactly loveless but not exactly love - filled .
Work , on the other hand , was rewarding .
" You would n't think it , " she said , " but I like the purely logistical issues .
For example , in most companies , sending things out of the warehouse is a relatively trivial matter compared to bringing things into the warehouse . "
She went on to explain that since no free sex chat system is perfect , especially when so many moving parts are involved , a certain amount of management is management of inevitable errors in counting , logging , and ordering .
" You have to be precise about imprecision , " she said .
I digress .
Or rather , she digresses .
Or does she , and do I ? Bob Sage , Bill 's brother , used to say that it was easy to love people so long as they did n't look at you , and we would laugh at him , because he was always making these kinds of jokes , but it 's entirely possible that he was n't joking at all .
People are quick to love movies , books , songs , paintings , restaurants , and sports because those things do n't love back -- or rather , can't love back .
There is no expectation of reciprocation and consequently never any disappointment when reciprocation falls short .
Each and every time you listen to " Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell , " say , it produces the same experience for you .
If the experience is different , you will quickly understand that the shift has occurred within you rather than within the work .
And it 's rare that love is withdrawn from a song or a book : you can come to see its flaws , or come to be embarrassed by your earlier ardor , but that might just make you drive your love deeper inside .
It wo n't , for the most part , make you bring your love to a full stop .
Loving people , on the other hand , is a dangerous business , because love is n't just about what you feel .
It 's an economy in which what you feel must be matched with something of equivalent value , as well as one in which your expectations for ongoing supply can quickly reach self - annihilating levels .
Not to mention the fact that you may feel you are not equipped to handle what you are receiving : expectations from another person that are as interdependent and volatile as yours .
Love , or whatever you want to call it ( pick a less romantic word if you 'd prefer ) is a frightening prospect .
When you accept it , you are assuming risk at a level that often overloads the human organism .
Two people acting with single purpose but retaining their separateness ?
That 's an overlap , and nobody likes -- let alone loves -- the idea of the overlap .
Giving love refines the sexchat spirit ; worrying about getting it clouds and clots that same spirit .
Or , to reinvest the digression , sending out of the warehouse is a relatively trivial matter compared to bringing things into the warehouse .
This may be obvious , but it 's Valentine 's Day , the commemoration of the obvious .
My friend in the western state who manages warehouse inventory recently went through a breakup .
I think maybe she was trying to hold on until Valentine 's Day , but that became untenable for several reasons , some of which I have listed above .
The person she was seeing was not a movie or a book or a painting , and so , in trying to love him , she quickly found herself concerned with trying to accept his love , which led to expectations he could not satisfy .
These were not unreasonable expectations , not as far as I was concerned -- and , sometimes , not as far as she was concerned .
They mostly involved him offering to drive her to work some mornings , or offering to pick her up some afternoons , or leaving little notes in her jacket pockets , or calling in the afternoon and assuming a funny accent to ask if she knew where he might find the " best little wharehouse in the state . "
Whatever .
The specifics are n't important , not to me .
The point is that all the things she admired about him statically , all the things that would have worked to his advantage if he was a TV show or a sculpture , dissipated when he could n't -- or would n't -- understand the issues of inventory management .
She was able to give him love , for a time , but witnessed repeatedly how pained he was to give in return , and that returned her to a point where giving seemed more like someone else 's taking .
After the breakup , she said , she thought often about whether she had give him enough chances .
" He made mistakes but so did I , " she said .
" Why should that be unacceptable ? "
This was a fair question with a fairly obvious answer .
In love , or commitments , or relationships , you do n't have to avoid error .
In fact , you should embrace it .
But you should embrace the proper type of error .
This is another way in which static artworks are easier to love than people .
As we have said , artworks do n't change , really , so they can't disappoint you .
But they also can't try to accommodate you and , in doing so , show you that they are utterly insensible about how to find your heart .
My friend told me one story that stuck out like a stalactite .
After the breakup , the guy came by her office .
He took her to lunch .
He ate a meal that he would never eat -- a big burger , she said , when he was mostly no - red - meat -- and asked questions he would never ask .
" I know he was trying to be a different , " she said , " but it only made me feel more the same .
The root him and the root me did n't intertwine . "
It is easy to believe unverifiable things about a song or a book , but harder to do so about a person .
So for this unholy coming holiday , and for my friend , and for the guy , even -- who I never met and probably would n't have liked , at least from the description , but who has the same right to be happy as anyone else -- here 's Tom Verlaine 's " The Grip of Love , " which not only contains some of the finest electric rock guitar of the last century ( try it , you 'll love it ) , but has a comprehensively elliptical lyric that says most of what I 've been trying to say :
You do the moon
You do the snake
Everywhere you go
You make the right mistake
You take a picture
And lay it on my tray
Some kind of window
Just like the Milky Way
The song does n't end well -- the girl tells him to get lost , and he says , desperately but slyly , " Well , do n't that buckle my belt ? " -- but it starts beautifully , and that 's something .
Inventory is managed , at least for a little while , and it 's managed exactly as he says it is , exactly as my friend said it is : " Everywhere you go you make the right mistake . "
So find that person , get in the grip , do the moon , do the snake .
Happy Valentine 's Day .
The following is a guest post by D. Salmons from iGadget Life .
If you are looking for the television reviews or interested in some other products , this website is good for you .
We all know about the major holidays , and most of us celebrate at least a few of them .
But , underneath those happy holidays that we all share , there lurks a mass of lesser known holidays that beg for our attention .
As it would happen , there exists a segment of our population that closely mirror these unsung holidays .
These people work under the radar , providng society with the technology to keep life interesting .
These hardworking and dedicated people , that we affectionately refer to as geeks , should get their own holiday .
Well , we 've found some that seems to celebrate the geekiness in all of us .
So , we offer these holidays in tribute to those socially crippled huddled masses that keep life advancing forward .
The geek in all of us ( including you Facebookers out there ) can appreciate this holiday .
This is the time to take a look at our computers and give them the attention they so desperately need .
We can check disk space , remove old programs , finally empty the trash , and even clean up around the computer itself .
A great holiday for geeks everywhere .
The Apple geeks in the crowd get to have a double computer holiday this month as January 25th is Macintosh Computer Day .
If you have n't already this month ( see above ) , spend some time cleaning up your Macbook , MiniMac , or iMac .
This would also be a great day to dig out those Apple stickers in any product boxes lying about and proudly display them .
You are an Apple Geek , show it !
I did not realize there was a day dedicated to thinking .
I personally believe that every day should be a day dedicated to thinking , at least on some level and at some point during said day .
However , there is such a holiday , and what better day to dedicate to our ever thinking friends than World Thinking Day .
Geeks are not just guys - there is a very strong and dedicated segment of the population that do have double X chromosomes .
The geek gals have proven to be an equal and capable group , so they definitely deserve a special holiday for themselves .
What can be better than a two - day global holiday blowout that celebrates women in engineering and technology ?!
Geeks everywhere have heard about Morse code .
Even though that has been superseded by ASCII code in most memorized tables , a tribute to the original geek code seems like a fitting way to celebrate the classic geek .
From the telegraph to the cell phone , geeks have influenced our lives and given us new ways to play together online .
It is everyone 's right to be a geek , and Geek Pride Day celebrates this on one of the most important dates in geek history , the opening day of the original " Star Wars " movie .
The holiday even comes with its own geek Bill of Rights ( meant to not be taken seriously , of course ) : 1 . The right to be even geekier2 .
The right to not leave your house3 .
The right to not have a significant other and to be a virgin4 .
The right to not like football or any other sport5 .

( I guess it is a good thing that we are giving geeks their holidays now , it can't hurt to be on their good side ... )
Pocket protectors everywhere , rejoice !
Without the ubiquitous ball point pen , then geeks everywhere would have no need of the pocket protector .
It would be like Superman without his cape , or Batman without his utility belt .
So , I think we should really take note of this day , and everyone out there write an email to pass the word - even if ironically the emails hasten in a small way the eventual demise of the ball point pen .
When you get up on a chilly winter morning and check your favorite news site and weather for the day , you should thank a geek for making sure that the server is up and running .
The specialized geek responsible for doing this , is known as a webmaster , and they work tirelessly ( more or less ) to keep the web communicating .
So , celebrate this day by taking your favorite webmaster geek to lunch .
And please , keep all jokes about " downloading lunch " to a minimum .
Some people are ashamed of their inner geek - they are afraid to be stereotyped as anti-social , and have an innate fear of fixing things for others .
But on this day you can cast away your fears and embrace your desire to defrag your computer drive .
Who knows , by the end of the day , you too may have an appreciation for the geek culture .
Where would we be without the geeks known as inventors ?
From the automobile to the TV , from the typewriter to the internet , inventors have given us ways to make our lives better and more interesting .
During the month of August we can pay tribute to those inventive folks who saw the need and a way to fulfill it .
The IBM PC has probably had one of the biggest impacts on early computing than any other product , and its influence is still felt to today .
Generations of geeks have cut their computing teeth on IBM PC clones , and Microsoft would not be as big as it is if it were not for the IBM PC .
Geeks everywhere , wave a lighter in the air for IBM PC Day .
Google is everywhere , and apparently all types of geeks love ( and built ) Google .
So it seems natural that a day celebrating Google - ness would also be a tribute to geek - ness .
Where would we be without those techie geeks that keep our office computers humming along ?
Without them we would soon be reduced to pen and paper , and getting a fax or email would literally take days .
This October 3rd take time to appreciate your local techie geek , and give them their day by trying to avoid breaking things until at least after lunch that day .
Geeks everywhere , take note - there are such things as evil tech people , and they want to enslave your computer for their nefarious uses .
Take this day to celebrate the comfort of knowing that you have taken steps to keep your computer safe .
And if you need help , go find a computer geek !
Rounding out our geek holidays for the year is International Shareware Day .
Shareware was created ( or at least named ) by uber geek Bob Wallace , and the premise is simple - try it before you buy it .
This concept thrives today , where computer users everywhere download programs on a wide variety of topics daily .
It just goes to show - geeks know business .
Hopefully this list of holidays will give our geeks a reason to celebrate being what they are .
Without them , the world is a slower , uncommunicative , and boring place ( no video games ) .
More importantly , we all have a little geek inside of us , so we in turn celebrate ourselves . ( image credits : Flickr users Sidereal mr.beaver , and x-ray delta one
One the most enduring ( and consistently entertaining )
Internet memes of the past few years has been remixes of the bunker scene from the German film , The Downfall : Hitler and the End of the Third Reich ( aka Der Untergang ) .
EFF Boardmember Brad Templeton even got in on it , creating a very funny remix with Hitler ranting about troubles with DRM and the failure of DMCA takedowns to prevent fair uses .
( Ironically enough , that video resulted in the Apple Store rejecting an EFF newsfeed app . )
In a depressing twist , these remixes are reportedly disappearing from YouTube , thanks to Constantin Film ( the movie ’s producer and distributor ) and YouTube ’s censorship - friendly automated filtering system , Content I.D. Because the Content I.D. filter permits a copyright owner to disable any video that contains its copyrighted content -- whether or not that video contains other elements that make the use a noninfringing fair use -- a content owner can take down a broad swath of fair uses with the flick of a switch .
It seems that ’s exactly what Constantin Film has chosen to do .
This is hardly the first time that Content I.D. , has led to overbroad takedowns of legal content .
Copyright owners have used the system to take down ( or silence ) everything from home videos of a teenager singing Winter Wonderland and a toddler lip-syncing to Foreigner ’s Juke Box Hero to ( and we ’re not making this up ) a lecture by Prof.
Larry Lessig on the cultural importance of remix creativity .
YouTube users do have options for response ( read our " Guide to YouTube Removals " for details . )
But YouTube 's procedures for " removing " videos have created considerable confusion among users , and it's a fair bet that most YouTube users are n't aware of their ability to " dispute " these removals .
Others may be leery of exercising the dispute option .
While the risks may be low , our broken copyright system leaves users facing the prospect of paying outrageous statutory damages and even attorneys ' fees if they stand up , fight back and , despite overwhelming odds in their favor , lose .
It ’s a gamble many people just are n’t willing to take , even when their works are clear fair uses .
If copyright owners want to block remix creativity , they should have to use a formal DMCA takedown notice ( and be subject to legal punishment if they fail to consider fair use ) , rather than a coarse automated blocking tool .
That is one reason we called on YouTube to fix the Content ID system so that it will not automatically remove videos unless there is a match between the video and audio tracks of a submitted fingerprint and nearly the entirety ( e.g , 90 % or more ) of the challenged content is comprised of a single copyrighted work .
That was over two years ago , and YouTube told us then that they were working on improving the tool .
If YouTube is serious about protecting its users , it is long past time for YouTube to do that work .
UPDATE : Templeton 's video was also targeted ; check out his discussion on his personal blog .
WASHINGTON Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) forcefully criticized the United States ’ drone strikes in Pakistan as inspiring the anti-American sentiments they seek to quell , touching upon a consequence of the policy rarely discussed in the media but well - recognized in the region .
“ I do not support the drone attacks , ” Kucinich told Raw Story , arguing that they are pushing the United States “ into an area of unaccountability that would lead to blowback , where we actually lose friends , where we help inspire anti-American sentiments and fanaticism and radicalism . ”

The missile strikes , carried out by aircraft drones piloted remotely , have wiped out many Islamic militants , including high - level Al - Qaeda operatives , according to Pentagon officials .
But they have also killed civilians , sparking anger in the Islamic nation and fueling dissatisfaction with the United States and PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s pro-American government alike .
Kucinich argued that the strikes are , as a result , counterproductive .
“ Just as an occupation fuels an insurgency , these drones build feelings and resistance against the United States and help gain support for those elements who wish to do America harm , ” he said , alleging that PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s support and cooperation is vital to nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism efforts .
President George W. Bush initiated the policy in 2005 with the intention of wiping out spillover militant activity from the Afghanistan war into western Pakistan .
The attacks have been used with greater frequency under his successor , according to The Associated Press .
The policy ’s unintended consequence of fueling anti-American sentiments is seldom debated , but Pakistani leaders and citizens are acutely aware of the brewing backlash .

“ The Pakistan Government and anti-US elements are condemning the US drone attacks as violation of their sovereignty and innocent tribal people being killed , ” remarked D. Suba Chandran , deputy director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies , in a recent op - ed .
“ They argue that these attacks result in increasing anti-American feelings and the Taliban gaining local support . ”
The Ohio congressman called for a careful re-evaluation of US strategy in the region , urging military officials to “ be careful not to inadvertently create the circumstances that push Pakistan into becoming a failed state . ”
He opposed the five - year $ 7.5 billion aid package the administration recently gave Islamabad to help subdue brewing terrorist activity .
The Obama administration publicly defended the strikes for the first time on March 25 as both legal and necessary for self - defense , but did n’t address the issue of pushback in Pakistan .

State Department Legal Adviser Harold
Koh declared that the drone strikes “ comply with all applicable law , including the laws of war , ” in a speech to the American Society of International Law .
“ A state that is engaged in armed conflict Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ or in legitimate self - defense Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is not required to provide targets or legal process before the state may use lethal force . ”
Although anti-war activists have criticized the unilateral use of missile attacks in the region , the policy enjoys comfortable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if tacit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ support from in Congress .

The congressman voted against the measure last June .

Japan says it is not interested in cutting its whaling program in the Antarctic in return for being allowed to resume commercial whaling in coastal waters .
Under a compromise plan drawn up by the head of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) , Japan would have its annual quota of minke whales in the Antarctic slashed from 935 to 400 .
It would then reduce its catch to 200 over the following five years .
In exchange , Japan would be allowed to resume its commercial hunt for up to 120 minke whales a year in its own waters .
This would mean Japan 's four traditional whaling communities could return to hunting for the first time since 1988 .
But Japan has turned down the deal and Australia and New Zealand oppose it , which means any possible agreement at the IWC meeting in Morocco in June looks highly unlikely .
Environment Minister Peter Garrett says Australia remains opposed to both commercial whaling and Japan 's so - called lethal scientific whaling .
Japan opposes the compromise because it aims to cut their Antarctic catch .
The country 's fisheries minister , Hirotaka Akamatsu , says the plan goes against what Japan has been requesting .
" Japan greatly appreciates the proposal to allow us to resume coastal whaling , " he said .
" But Japan can not accept a cut in its Antarctic whaling ... it 's too drastic . "
Japan wants both a resumption of commercial whaling and a continuation of the Antarctic hunt .
It plans to ratchet up the pressure to push up the proposed quotas as much as possible before the IWC meeting .
So this means that unless one side - Australia or Japan - caves in , then nothing is likely to come out of the Morocco talks .
With an election in Australia this year and the Japanese government shackled to powerful pro-whaling interests and constituencies , the IWC compromise is likely to be the next thing facing the harpoon .

If I walked into a single mother 's house and said I could read her baby 's mind , then started shouting four - letter words , claiming I was simply voicing her offspring 's thoughts , I would expect to be arrested the moment I stepped outside .
And if , during my " psychic reading " , I also speculated about the mother 's sex life , and a potentially abusive relationship with a former boyfriend , claiming her toddler was concerned about " men who want to touch mum 's privates " , and I went on and on in this vein until the mother burst into tears , there in the living room , in front of her child , I 'd expect to be arrested , sectioned , and beaten in the back of the van .
And if I allowed a TV crew to broadcast what I was doing , I 'd expect to be attacked by a mob , who 'd pull me apart and kick my remains around the street , pausing only to spit on any bits of my face that got stuck to their shoes .
But no .
In fact the outcry would be muted at best and Ofcom would turn a blind eye - as it did last week , while clearing Channel 5's unbelievably disgusting Baby Mind Reader of any wrongdoing .
I 've never fully understood the public 's docile acceptance of psychics , or why , when it comes to their supposed abilities , the burden of proof is assumed to lie with the sceptic , as opposed to the sort of shrieking idiot who claims to be able to contact the spirit world ( or in Derek Ogilvie 's case , communicate telepathically with kids too young to talk ) .
I 'm quite hardcore on this .
I think every psychic and medium in this country belongs in prison .
Even the ones demented enough to believe in what they 're doing .
In fact , especially them .
Give them windowless cells and make them crap in buckets .
They can spend the rest of their days sewing mailbags in the dark .
The audiences that psychics prey on are equally infuriating , albeit less deserving of contempt .
They 're just disappointing , like a friend who 's let you down .
Often , they 're simply grieving and desperate .
I mean , if you want to believe in psychics , fine .
You 're a dangerous idiot and I would n't trust you to operate a spoon without putting an eye out ... but fine .
Your choice .
Delude yourself silly .
Your world is probably more fun than the real one .
There 's no death , just an afterlife filled with magic spirits who like to communicate with eerie , ugly , otherwise - unemployable bottom - of - the - barrel " showmen " back on Earth .
But do n't accuse anyone with the temerity to question your sad supernatural fantasies of having a " closed mind " or being " blind to possibilities " .
A closed mind asks no questions , unthinkingly accepting that which it wants to believe .
The blindness is all yours .
( If you want to feel your eyes pop rudely open , swot up on the " cold reading " techniques fake psychics use - a combination of guesswork and sly conversational tics which give the impression that the " psychic " is magically receiving accurate information from the ether .
A fantastic ( albeit pricey ) step - by - step guide is available from Ianrowland.com .
Anyway , back to my psychic prison fantasies .
The problem with trying to jail all the mediums in Britain is they'd a ) see it coming , and escape overseas to somewhere even more gullible , like Narnia , before you 'd passed the legislation , or b ) call on their ghostly friends in the spirit world to whisk them from harm 's reach .
Except they could n't because ghosts - unlike scumbags and conmen - do n't exist .
Pity .
But that 's the real world for you .
Often disappointing .
But real .
At least it 's always real .

Creationism ( requested by Matthew Roberts )
Creationism , simply put , is the heartfelt conviction that man was created by God , using some kind of celestial putty .
This is perhaps the most arrogant belief a human skull can contain without exploding .
After all , God has far better things to do than creating self - important little species such as ours .
He 's got wars , deaths , disasters and diseases to ignore for starters .
And a fair bit of not - exist - ing - at - all to be getting on with .
Creationists reject Darwin's theory of evolution on the grounds that it is " just a theory " .
This is a valid criticism : evolution is indeed merely " a theory " , albeit one with ten billion times more credence than the theory of creationism - although , to be fair , the theory of creationism is more than just a theory .
It 's also a fairy story .
And children love fairy stories , which is presumably why so many creationists are keen to have their whimsical gibberish taught in schools .
In recent years , creationism has been rechristened " Intelligent Design " ( or ID ) , because that sounds more like proper science , which is precisely what it is n't .
ID is largely supported by religious zealots who believe they can best serve God by clashing with school boards and scientists , instead of , say , spreading peace and goodwill or loving their neighbours , neither of are half as much fun .

Corporate nausea
My uncontrollable rant about psychics has left no room for the TV Go Home entry this week .
But there 's just space to squeeze in one more example of puke - inducing corporate babyspeak .
Several of you nominated Hellmann 's mayonnaise , which now has " Once you dig in , keep me cold for three months ... but not too cold - I do n't want to freeze ! " printed on the jar .
It might as well have added " LOL ! " and " You do n't have to be mad to eat me ... BUT IT HELPS !!! "
It 's a rum state of affairs when you feel like punching a jar of mayonnaise in the face .

Next month marks the 50th anniversary of the birth - control pill in the U.S.
The dawn of dependable contraception not only ended the post - war baby boom , it also ignited the sexual revolution and helped millions of women to enter the work force .
Nowadays , women can choose from a bevy of birth - control options , including pills , patches and rings that allow them to have as few periods as they like , even none .
Implants and intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) can prevent pregnancy for years at a time and eliminate the need to refill and remember .
Morning - after pills that can decrease the risk from unprotected sex are available without a prescription even to teenagers .
Women who want to end their fertility permanently can do so in a doctor 's office without undergoing surgery .
Abstinence is still taught in many schools and homes as being 100 % effective if followed diligently .
Yet despite all these options , the rates of unplanned pregnancies remain high : Almost half of all pregnancies in the U.S. — some 3.1 million a year — are unintended , according to the most recent government survey , from 2001 .
One out of every two American women aged 15 to 44 has at least one unplanned pregnancy in her lifetime .
Among unmarried women in their 20s , seven out of 10 pregnancies are unplanned .
An updated version of those numbers from the 2006 National Survey of Family Growth is expected to be released next month .
But population experts do n't anticipate much change ; the rate of unplanned pregnancy was the same in 1994 , and smaller studies have found that even newer birth - control methods have n't made much of a dent .
Why are the numbers so high ?
A third , closely related shadow which the political class has been only too keen to hide away has been the still barely understood extent to which it has handed over the running of our country and the making of our laws to that vast and mysterious new system of government centred on Brussels and Strasbourg .
Nothing better exemplified how our politicians are caught by this system , like flies in a spider 's web , than the shifty means whereby each of the three main parties weaselled its way out of keeping the manifesto promises of the last election that it would give us a referendum on the EU constitution , otherwise known as the Lisbon " reform treaty " .
Here was another great surrender of Parliament 's power to decide how our country is run , and the MPs of all parties were not only happy to agree to it , but treated us all with contempt as they lied about it .
No doubt , Gizmodo has turned the tech news cycle on its head this week with its exclusive on the iPhone 4G .
Everybody from MSNBC to Good Morning America , and even the ladies on The View are talking about what is arguably the biggest leak in consumer technology history .
What has ensued beyond just the basic story of 27 - year - old Apple developer Gray Powell 's now infamous drunken night now has turned to Gizmodo 's culpability in the morass .
Some bloggers have gone as far as to publicly call for Apple to sue the publication , but does n't Cupertino share some of the blame for this mess ?
In the simplest terms , yes .
As a journalist who has covered Apple for much of the last half - decade , I have to say I am absolutely shocked that this would have even happened .
For a company that prides itself on its secrecy -- writing on Apple can be much like walking blindfolded into a maze -- this is a stunning lapse in judgment .
First off , it is beyond comprehension to me that the company would allow a lower - level employee to walk off One Infinite Loop with a prototype in hand on a personal jaunt .
I could understand if he or she was on the clock and out for lunch , but this was purely on Mr. Powell 's personal time .
As somebody who has lost their phone / wallet / keys one too many times after a night out imbibing with the friends , I know unfortunately how easy it is .
As Ian Bettenridge points out , this almost singlehandedly kills any trade secret case that Apple may try to press .
According to US law ( see U.S.C 1839 3 ( a ) ) , in order for it to be prosecutable under trade secret law , " the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret . "
Taking it to a bar using it in a public place where it can be seen no longer keeps it secret .
The case used to hide the thing looks so rough from the pictures that it is almost obvious that there 's something up with it .
All around a poor job by Apple to keep it under wraps .
Second , failing to report the device as stolen with the proper authorities was another mistake .
If the company wants to press a case on stolen property , you can't without a police report .
To my knowledge and research , no such report exists .
I 'd venture to guess that if it was discussed , it was not done because news of the police report would have certainly made it to the press .
( With all due respect to Daring Fireball 's John Gruber who 's been on top of this story like a hawk covering all sides , even if your sources say they considered it stolen , they sure were n't acting like it . )
I 'd argue the primary culpability , if any , sides with the finder from all that I have read in the case law .
The courts have been very reluctant to prosecute the press over confidential leaks in all but the most egregious cases , and this by far seems to not meet that level .
There is just too much to prove on Apple 's part to make any case against Gizmodo worth it .
Apple can take a lot away from this incident -- including reviewing its policies on taking prototype equipment off of Apple premises ( shocked there apparently is one outside of their highest executives ! ) .
But the worst thing it could do is turn around and make this a bigger issue with lawsuits , which are sure to only make the company look bad .
This is n't the ThinkSecret case .
This time , the whole world is watching .

MAG Developer Tips On –
In order to understand the middle class , we first have to draw a line in the economic sand .
Many in our society would like to believe that we live in a classless system but this is n’t true especially when we look at the financial data .
This classless belief has been shattered with the current structure of the banking bailouts that have favored the top 1 percent in our country .
I wanted to update some of the data that I had posted back in December of 2008 .
There is something fascinating about looking at aggregate income data because it tells us a lot about our financial condition .
Yet whenever we hear debates about the middle class , rarely does anyone talk about the specific income cutoff .
Let us first examine the top 35 percent of households :
Source : Census
If a household brings in $ 65,000 or more they have made it into the top 35 percent of affluent households .
Now this may not seem like much to a large number of middle class Americans given the rising cost of goods over the last few decades .
To make it into the top 1 percent a household would need to make more than $ 250,000 per year .
To be in the top 0.1 % a household would need to make more than $ 1.6 million .
This data distribution was from 2007 .
I managed to find more recent Census data from 2008 and put together an updated chart to shed a different perspective of the middle class .
The below chart is more realistic because it goes from 0 to $ 200,000 and since most people fall along this spectrum the information might be more useful and applicable :
38 percent of U.S. households make $ 49,999 or less .
When we talk about the 40 million Americans receiving food assistance this is where we are looking .
If we look at household incomes of less than $ 74,999 we cover 58 percent of all U.S. households .
The actual median household income in 2008 is $ 63,000 according to the American Community Survey done by the Census .
We ’ll have more updated information in September of this year with data for 2009 .
The above chart helps highlight the cutoff points for middle class Americans .
In recent debates , we have seen that those who make $ 100,000 or more have somehow made this seem like the de facto income in America .
Even at this level , only 20 percent of U.S. households make $ 100,000 or more .
This is high relative to what many Americans are working with .
Yet I think many in the media since they fall in this range seem to project their own income situation onto the public discourse .
If they would only look at the above data they would find out that middle class Americans have to get by with much less in today ’s market .
A household that makes more than $ 200,000 is in the top 5 percent of our country .
Yet even that is n’t enough to put them in the top 1 percent that control 42 percent of all financial wealth .
But even within the top 1.5 percent income variation is enormous :
Source : Wikipedia
“ As of 2005 there are approximately 146,000 ( 0.1 % ) households with incomes exceeding $ 1,500,000 , while the top 0.01 % or 11,000 households had incomes exceeding $ 5,500,000 .
The 400 highest tax payers in the nation had gross annual household incomes exceeding $ 87,000,000 .
Household incomes for this group have risen more dramatically than for any other .
As a result the gap between those who make less than one and half million dollars annually ( 99.9 % of households ) and those who make more ( 0.1 % ) has been steadily increasing , prompting The New York Times to proclaim that the “ Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind . ”
Indeed the income disparities within the top 1.5 % are quite drastic .
While households in the top 1.5 % of households had incomes exceeding $ 250,000 , 443 % above the national median , their incomes were still 2200 % lower than those of the top .01 % of households .
One can therefore conclude that almost any household , even those with incomes of $ 250,000 annually are poor when compared to the top .1 % , who in turn are poor compared to the top 0.000267 % , the top 400 taxpaying households . ”
I guess many things are relative when it comes to income .
True wealth is actually measured by net worth .
In 2009 the number of millionaire households jumped to 7.8 million but this is down from the peak of 9.2 million in 2007 .
This recession has destroyed a lot of wealth and the middle class have seen a longer journey ahead if they ever wish to reach financial security .
But this is n’t a new trend and this recession has only brought the issue of economic class to the forefront .

If scientists from Mars were to study the human male 's reproductive system they would probably conclude that he is destined for rapid extinction .
Compared to other mammals , humans produce relatively low numbers of viable sperm – sperm capable of making that long competitive swim to penetrate an unfertilised egg .
As many as one in five healthy young men between the ages of 18 and 25 produce abnormal sperm counts .
Even the sperm they do produce is often of poor quality .
In fact only between 5 and 15 per cent of their sperm is , on average , good enough to be classed as " normal " under strict World Health Organisation rules – and these are young , healthy men .
By contrast , more than 90 per cent of the sperm of a domestic bull or ram , or even laboratory rat , are normal .
Human males also suffer a disproportionately high incidence of reproductive problems , from congenital defects and undescended testes to cancer and impotency .
As these also affect fertility , it 's a minor miracle men are able to sire any children at all .
In fact , an increasing number of men are finding themselves childless .
Among the one in seven couples now classed as infertile , the " male factor " has been found to be the most commonly identified cause .
Next year marks the 20th anniversary of the WHO conference where a Danish scientist first alerted the world to the fact that Western men are suffering an infertility crisis .
Professor Niels Skakkebaek of the University of Copenhagen presented data indicating sperm counts had fallen by about a half over the past 50 years .
Sperm counts in the 1940s were typically well above 100 m sperm cells per millilitre , but Professor Skakkebaek found they have dropped to an average of about 60 m per ml .
Other studies found that between 15 and 20 per cent of young men now find themselves with sperm counts of less than 20 m per ml , which is technically defined as abnormal .
In contrast , a dairy bull has a viable sperm count in the billions .
Experts in human reproductive biology were astonished by the Danish study .
The declining trend seemed to indicate that men were on a path to becoming completely infertile within a few generations ( although recent studies suggest the fall in sperm counts may have bottomed out ) .
Professor Skakkebaek could offer no explanation for the trend other than to suggest that the fall may have something to do with the equally alarming rise in other reproductive disorders , such as cancer of the testes and cryptorchidism , the incomplete descent of the testes into the scrotum .
Experts began to talk of a new phenomenon affecting the human male , a collection of disorders known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome .
They wanted to know what was causing it , because the changes were occurring too quickly to be a result of genetics .
It must have something to with changing lifestyles or the environment of men , and almost everything was suggested , from exposure to chemical pollutants to the modern fashion for tight underpants .
There is now an emerging consensus among some experts that whatever it is that is exacerbating the problems of male infertility , it probably starts in the womb .
It is not the lifestyle of men that is problem , but that of their mothers .
The process of sperm production , called spermatogenesis , starts in adolescence , but the groundwork is laid down in the few months before and immediately after birth .
An increasing number of studies point to a crucial " window " of testicular development that begins in the growing foetus and ends in the first six months of life .
Interfere with this critical developmental period , and a baby boy will suffer the lifetime consequences of being a suboptimally fertile man .
So are we anywhere nearer to finding an explanation for why are so many more men today are suffering from reproductive problems ?
" It 's most likely a reflection of the fact that many environmental and lifestyle changes over the past 50 years are inherently detrimental to sperm production , " says Professor Richard Sharpe , fertility research expert at the Medical Research Council .
" It may be that different factors come together to have a combined effect . "
A number of studies point to a connection between early development in the womb and male reproductive problems in later life , especially low sperm counts .
For example , men whose pregnant mothers were exposed to high levels of toxic dioxins as a result of the 1976 industrial accident in Seveso , Italy have been found to have lower - than - average sperm counts .
But men exposed to dioxins in adulthood showed no such effect .
Another study found women who ate large amounts of beef during pregnancy , a diet rich in potentially damaging chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , had sons with relatively low sperm counts .
But eating beef as an adult man shows no similar impact .
Meanwhile , studies of migrants between Sweden and Finland , showed that a man 's lifetime risk of testicular cancer tends to follow the country he was born in rather than the country where he was brought up .
It was his mother 's environment when she was pregnant with him , rather than his own as a boy or as an adolescent , that seems to have largely determined a man 's risk of testicular cancer .
One of the strongest pieces of evidence in support of this idea comes from studies of people who smoke .
A man who smokes typically reduces his sperm count by a modest 15 per cent or so , which is probably reversible if he quits .
However , a man whose mother smoked during pregnancy has a fairly dramatic decrease in sperm counts of up to 40 per cent – which also tends to be irreversible .
Professor Sharpe said such findings can be explained by understanding how the first cells of the testes form .
Sertoli cells , which in the adult act as guardians for the development of sperm cells , are the very first cells to form from a " genital ridge " of the human male foetus .
The number of sperm that can be produced in an adult man is critically dependent on the number of Sertoli cells that develop in his foetus , so anything that interferes with the formation of Sertoli cells in a mother 's womb will affect sperm production many years later .
" Maternal - lifestyle factors in pregnancy can have quite substantial effects on sperm counts in sons in adulthood , and the most logical mechanism by which this could occur is via reducing the number of Sertoli cells , " Professor Sharpe says .
But the key question now is to identify the relevant lifestyle and environmental factors .
This is proving tricky .
Obesity , for instance , is a growing problem and it has been linked with reproductive problems in both men and women .
One study has also indicated that overweight pregnant women tend to produce sons with poor semen quality .
But is it being fat that is the cause , or the environmental chemicals stored in fat ?
There has been a lot of interest in chemicals in the environment , especially those that can either mimic female sex hormones – oestrogenic chemicals – or block male sex hormones , specifically testosterone which plays a critical role in stimulating the development of Sertoli cells in the womb .
So far , the Seveso study provides the clearest link between human foetal development , low sperm counts and prenatal exposure to an environmental chemical .
But the dioxin concentrations from this industrial accident were exceptionally high .
It is more difficult trying to establish a similar , significant link between male reproductive problems and exposure to low concentrations of the many other environmental chemicals that may have weak oestrogenic or androgen - blocking properties , including substances as wide - ranging as pesticides , traffic fumes , plastics and even soya beans .
Professor Sharpe says that much of the evidence to date is weak or non-existent .
" Public concern about the adverse effects of environmental chemicals on spermatogenesis in adult men are , in general , not supported by the available data for humans .
Where adverse effects of environmental chemicals have been shown , they are usually in an occupational setting rather than applying to the general population , " he says .

It ’s all very well having your Clojure application compiled into a series of class files , but sometimes you just want something that ’s easy to deploy .
Ideally a single jar file with everything ready to go .
There ’s a tool called Leiningen which does just this .
The tool is good , but I had a couple of problems getting it to run under windows , so I thought I ’d document here how I got it working for a simple hello world example .
Leiningen can self - install on other platforms apart from windows .
In the Windows case , you need the lein .
bat script from the Installation section on the github page .
You ’ll need to the 1.1.0 version of Leiningen – the script comments leads you to the 1.0.1 version of Leiningen , but this did n’t work for me .
You ’ll also need a version of Clojure – I used 1.1.0 which I already had on my machine .
You need to point some environment variables at these jar files .
set LEIN_JAR=C:UsersCliveDesktopleinleiningen-1.1.0-standalone.jar
set CLOJURE_JAR=C:/Users/Clive/Desktop/lein/clojure.jar
I set up a directory structure – I made a helloworld directory , and into src/test / hello.clj I put the code
( ns test .
hello
( : gen-class ) )
( defn - main [ & args ]
( println " Hello world ! " ) )
We can now define a project file that specifies our entry point , and the jars that we depend upon .
( defproject test.hello " 1.0 "
: dependencies [ [org.clojure/clojure " 1.1.0 - master-SNAPSHOT
" ] ]
:main test.hello )
Leiningen offers a number of command line arguments .
The first important one is “ compile ” to build the project .
C:UsersCliveDesktopleinhelloworld>..lein.bat compile
[ copy ] Copying 1 file to C:UsersCliveDesktopleinhelloworldlib
Compiling test.hello
We can then run a repl with the compiled code on the class path .
C:UsersCliveDesktopleinhelloworld>..lein.bat repl
Clojure 1.1.0
user= > ( use ‘ test.hello )
nil
user= > ( - main )
Hello world !
nil
But better still , we can build a jar of the project , and we can also build an uberjar that includes the project code and the code for Clojure i.e an easily deployed solution .
C:UsersCliveDesktopleinhelloworld>..lein.bat uberjar
All :namespaces already compiled .
Created C:UsersCliveDesktopleinhelloworld/test.hello.jar

Ever since its arrival in Australia , the poisonous cane toad has been killing native predators such as the northern quoll , a cat - sized marsupial .
Now scientists have found a clever way to save the endangered quoll : training it to detest the taste of toad so it wo n’t get poisoned .
Brought to Queensland state in 1935 to control beetles in sugar cane fields , the cane toad is one of many Old World animals to wreak havoc on Australia ’s native ecosystem .
Unlike most invasive species , however , the cane toad does n’t prey on native life , or compete with it for food .
Instead , this toxic toad poisons the large predators -- such as quolls , crocodiles , snakes and lizards -- that dine on it .
Advertisement
Should a predator survive to eat another meal , it will think twice about dining on cane toad , said study coauthor Richard Shine , an ecologist at the University of Sydney .
But because the toads are large , the quolls -- which are notorious for gobbling anything from small bugs to mammals nearly as big as they are -- usually have no chance to learn to avoid the toad .
To create an aversion to cane toad , Shine and researchers Jonathan Webb and Stephanie O’Donnell at the University of Sydney fed young quolls tiny cane toads laced with a nausea - inducing chemical generally used to deworm cattle and sheep .
The tiny dead toads , which weighed less than a tenth of an ounce , could not kill the quolls .
But Webb , who came up with the idea for the experiment , speculated that the memory of the stomach - churning snack would stick with the marsupials , just as bad experiences with food can stick with humans for years .
Advertisement
His theory panned out .
Scientists released 31 “ toad - smart ” quolls and 31 “ toad - naive ” quolls into the wild , fitted with radio collars designed to fall off within a month ( though several animals died and others disappeared well before then ) .
Overall , the scientists found that the conditioned female quolls survived nearly twice as long as their unconditioned counterparts , and the conditioned male quolls lived five times longer than the clueless ones .
“ Within hours of their release , we saw four toad - naive [ male ] quolls attacking large toads , then convulsing and dying , ” the authors said in their report , which was published online Tuesday in the Journal of Applied Ecology .
Advertisement
“ This is just really unusual , ” said David Patte , assistant regional director of external affairs for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service out of Portland , Ore. , who was not involved in the research .
Patte said he had not encountered a case in which endangered animals had been conditioned to modify their behavior to aid in their own survival .
“ We need as many innovative approaches as possible , so that ’s great , ” he said .
It ’s unclear whether the aversion to cane toad will be passed on to the next generation , Shine said .
His hope is that the no - toad diet will be easily picked up by baby quolls .
Having proved the concept in the lab , Shine said , the next step is to devise an effective way to teach wild quolls -- perhaps by air - dropping nausea - inducing sausages of cane toad meat into what little toad - free territory remains in the quoll ’s habitat .
Eating the sausages would help teach the quolls to avoid the toads before the amphibians move in and become a problem .

The scientists also hope to use the behavior - modification techniques to train crocodiles and other large predators at risk from the cane toad .

Is Turkey Trying to Sink or Save Iran ?
An otherwise predictable Arab League Summit held last weekend in Sirte , Libya , was enlivened by the presence of a special guest .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan took to the podium on the summit ’s opening day to denounce the " madness " of Israeli designs over Jerusalem , referring to the holy city as " the apple of the eye of each and every Muslim . "
Such rhetoric has earned Turkey , currently ruled by the mildly Islamist Justice and Development Party , widespread praise in Arab circles .
But Ankara ’s newfound assertiveness in the Middle East has not been limited to fiery speeches .
In the past two years , the country has launched mediation efforts between Syria and Israel , encouraged Iraq ’s Sunni leaders to participate in the political process , and attempted to bridge sectarian divisions in Lebanon .
There is little doubt that Turkey ’s leaders , and particularly its visionary foreign minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , have a new vision for their country ’s international role .
What is less clear is if Turkey can fulfill its more grandiose ambitions .
At the moment , skeptics argue that Turkey ’s regional influence is little more than talk .
And a nearing collision on Iran sanctions could prove a crucial test of whether Turkey is ready to back up words with action .
Certainly , Turkish officials are enjoying their moment in the limelight .
" People never used to ask us our opinion " at the United Nations , assuming they would toe the Western line , noted Selim Yenel , a deputy undersecretary in Turkey ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
" Now , they ask us . "
But Turkey ’s new independence has provoked more than a little apprehension in the United States and Europe , where some officials look back nostalgically to the country ’s Cold War-era loyalty to the Western bloc .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s recent visit to the country was marred by widening disagreements on a number of fronts , from the issue of Turkey ’s accession to the European Union — which Merkel is trying to scuttle — to Turkey ’s objection to another round of sanctions on Iran .
" We must first try to find a diplomatic solution , " Erdogan argued in a recent interview with Der Spiegel .
With U.S. President Barack Obama now saying that he wants a vote on sanctions within " weeks , " Turkey might find itself forced to choose sides sooner rather than later .
And Turkey might indeed have the ability to broker a diplomatic solution to the problem of Iran and its rogue nuclear program .
Turkey has a unique combination of economic and diplomatic tools at its disposal :
It has a strong economic partnership with the Islamic Republic , with which it conducts approximately $ 10 billion in trade annually ; Erdogan has also cultivated close ties to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whom he refers to as a " friend . "
At the same time , Turkey holds a seat on the U.N. Security Council , where it is a potential swing vote on any upcoming sanctions resolutions .
I recently traveled to Turkey , along with a number of American and Armenian journalists , on a trip sponsored by the economics - oriented think tank TEPAV , which is funded by the Union of Chambers of Turkey , the Turkish equivalent of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
TEPAV organized meetings for us with Turkish officials and businessmen — and in our discussions , it became clear that the Turks are scrambling to defuse a situation that could undermine the country ’s growing international clout , and reverse its recent economic progress .
On our second day in Ankara , we headed to Turkey ’s presidential palace , known as Cankaya Kosku .
From this sprawling 100 - acre campus , rising above Ankara from the south , Ataturk engineered the transformation of the Ottoman Empire into the Turkish Republic .
We were there to meet with its current inhabitant , President Abdullah Gul .
Gul is a mild - mannered politician who has nonetheless earned the ire of the Turkish military , which attempted to thwart his ascension to the presidency in 2007 due to his previous sympathy for Islamist - inspired political movements .
Gul was quick to frame Turkey ’s opening to Iran as a form of realpolitik , necessitated by the country ’s geographic proximity .
Iran is a " real state in the region , different from the other states in the Middle East " whose borders were forged after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire .
What ’s more , its influence in the region is growing — a fact that Turkey has to appreciate .
" All of Iran ’s influence in Iraq is due to the actions of our friends , " he said with a smile , reminding his U.S. guests of their country ’s role in shaping regional realities .
Gul described the primary obstacle in reaching a deal with Iran as the intrinsic lack of fairness in international efforts to pressure the country .
" There is a major confidence crisis on the part of the Iranians that prevents progress , " he noted .
Iran thinks that it is being targeted not because it has violated universally applied principles , but as part of a plot to weaken the Islamic Republic .
This belief causes Iranian leaders to retreat to instinctive anti-Americanism in their public statements .
" In private meetings , Ahmadinejad has a different rhetoric , " Gul asserted .
" He understands this is heading in a dangerous direction . "
However , there is another way forward , announced Gul : " the elimination of all nuclear weapons from the Middle East . "
Yes , of course , he opposes Iran ’s nuclear program — but he also opposes Israel ’s possession of a nuclear arsenal .
The call for a nuclear - free Middle East has emerged as the centerpiece of Turkey ’s Iran policy and the best case study available of Turkey ’s independent course in the region .
Gul assured us this is more than a rhetorical ploy designed to balance criticism of all sides equally .
On the contrary , " the goal here would be to ensure the security of Israel . "
A few short miles northwest of the presidential palace sits the Ministry of Foreign Affairs — off of Ismet Inonu Boulevard , named after Turkey ’s second president and protector of Ataturk ’s legacy — where Turkey ’s energetic diplomats attempt to add substance to this concept .
Feridun Sinirlioglu , the under secretary for foreign affairs , argues that Turkey is bolstering international support for containment efforts by condemning both Iran and Israel equally .
" There is a problem of legitimacy on efforts to contain Iran , " Sinirlioglu said .
" If we tell Iran that the aim is to have a nuclear - free region , it will be easier to mobilize international support . "
Although Turkey ’s rhetoric might discourage those hoping to enlist its aid in isolating Iran , the government might not be as uncompromising as it appears to be .
Most importantly , officials show a quiet appreciation of the risks posed by Iran ’s nuclear program .
" I do believe that their final intention is to have a nuclear weapon , because it is related to their national pride , " Gul stated .
If this comes to pass , Turkey ’s already precarious neighborhood could explode — undermining a decade ’s worth of economic and diplomatic progress .
Iranian leaders " would not use [ nuclear weapons ] , but would start behaving in an irrational manner and would create problems for themselves " argued Gul , citing the dangers of a confrontation with the Gulf regimes in particular .
When it comes to sanctions , there is also likely more latitude to Turkey ’s position than it lets on .
By taking a firm line now , Ankara may hope to prevent a resolution on sanctions from coming to the floor of the U.N. Security Council .
However , if the United States can avoid vetoes from Russia and China , few expect Turkey to stand in the way .
" All options for Turkey are undesirable " on Iran , noted Soli Ozel , a professor at Istanbul ’s Bilgi University and a frequent commentator .
" But if push comes to shove , Turkey will side with its allies . "
This has less to do with principle than Turkey ’s post -Republic orientation toward the West .
Breaking with the United States and Europe over such a crucial issue would represent a fundamental split with the Western alliance , a step few think Turkey is willing to take .
In this sense , Turkey appears less as an assertive , independent actor in the Middle East and more as a developing power caught between two stronger poles .
" We ’re telling both sides that we ’re not doing a favor to you , " Sinirlioglu said .
" We ’re doing this for our benefit , because we ’re in the middle of this . "
That is an eminently logical position — but a far cry from the more grandiose statements made by Turkey ’s boosters .
Turkey ’s diplomatic efforts have achieved their short - term goal of staying on good terms with all sides , but have failed to resolve their long - term goal of lowering tensions between Iran and the West .
It is no secret what it will take to defuse this looming confrontation : an international effort that both coaxes and pressures Iran to agree to international verification of the peaceful use of its nuclear program .
If only there were a newly assertive regional power to lead the way .
With the rushed passage into law of the Digital Economy
Act this month , the fight over copyright enters a new phase .
Previous to this , most copyfighters operated under the rubric that a negotiated peace was possible between the thrashing entertainment giants and civil society .
But now that the BPI and its mates have won themselves the finest law that money can buy – a law that establishes an unprecedented realm of web censorship in Britain , a law that provides for the disconnection of entire families from the net on the say - so of an entertainment giant , a law that shuts down free Wi-Fi hotspots and makes it harder than ever to conduct your normal business on the grounds that you might be damaging theirs – the game has changed .
I came to the copyfight from a pretty parochial place .
As a working artist , I wanted a set of just copyright rules that provided a sound framework for my negotiations with big publishers , film studios , and similar institutions .
I worried that the expansion of copyright – in duration and scope – would harm my ability to freely create .
After all , creators are the most active re-users of copyright , each one of us a remix factory and a one - person archive of inspirational and influential materials .
I also worried that giving the incumbent giants control over the new online distribution system would artificially extend their stranglehold over creators .
This stranglehold means that practically every media giant offers the same awful terms to all of us , and no kinder competitor can get our works into the hands of our audiences .
I still worry about that stuff , of course .
I co-founded a successful business – Boing Boing , the widely - read website – that benefits enormously from not having to pay fealty to a distributor in order to reach its readers ( by contrast , the old print edition of Boing Boing folded when its main distributor went bankrupt while owing it a modest fortune and holding onto thousands of dollars ' worth of printed materials that we never got back ) .
My novels find their way onto the bestseller list by being distributed for free from my website simultaneous with their mainstream bookstore sales through publishers like Macmillan and HarperCollins and Random House .
My whole life revolves around the digital economy : running entrepreneurial businesses that thrive on copying and that exploit the net 's powerful efficiencies to realise a better return on investment .
Parliament has just given two fingers to me ( and every other small / medium digital enterprise ) by agreeing to cripple Britain 's internet in order to give higher profits to the analogue economy represented by the labels and studios .
But today , my bank - balance is the least of my worries .
The entertainment industry 's willingness to use parliament todi impose censorship and arbitrary punishment in the course of chasing a few extra quid is so depraved and terrible that it has me in fear for the very underpinnings of democracy and civil society .
In the US , the MPAA and RIAA ( American equivalents of the MPA and the BPI ) just submitted comments to the American Intellectual Property Czar , Victoria Espinel , laying out their proposal for IP enforcement .
They want us all to install spyware on our computers that deletes material that it identifies as infringing .
They want our networks censored by national firewalls ( U2's Bono also called for this in a New York Times editorial , averring that if the Chinese could control dissident information with censorware , our own governments could deploy similar technology to keep infringement at bay ) .
They want border - searches of laptops , personal media players and thumb - drives .
They want poor countries bullied into diverting GDP from humanitarian causes to enforcing copyright .
And they want their domestic copyright enforcement handled , free of charge , by the Department of Homeland Security .
Elements of this agenda are also on display ( or rather , in hiding ) in the secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , a treaty being drafted between a member 's club of rich nations .
They 've turned their back on the United Nations to negotiate in private , without having to contend with journalists or public interest groups .
By their own admission , they intend to impose this treaty on poor countries as a condition of ongoing trade , and in the US , the Obama administration has announced its intention to pass ACTA without Congressional debate .
I 'm not such a techno - triumphalist that I believe that the free and open internet will solve all our socio-economic problems .
But I am enough of a techno - pessimist to believe that baking surveillance , control and censorship into the very fabric of our networks , devices and laws is the absolute road to dictatorial hell .
Chekhov wrote that a gun on the mantelpiece in act one is sure to go off by act three .
The entertainment industry 's blinkered pursuit of its own narrow goals has the potential to redesign our technology to be the perfect tools and excuses for oppression .

Primark has 138 stores in the UK and 38 in Ireland Clothing chain Primark has withdrawn the sale of its range of padded bikini tops for girls as young as seven following criticism .
The company apologised to customers for " causing offence " and said it would donate profits to a children 's charity .
The Children 's Society criticised Primark for " premature sexualisation and unprincipled advertising " .
Conservative leader David Cameron said it was " disgraceful " but later added he was delighted by the withdrawal .
The £ 4 bikini sets came in candy pink with gold stars and black with white polka dots .
Penny Nicholls , director of children and young people at The Children 's Society , said : " We know from our research that commercial pressures towards premature sexualisation and unprincipled advertising are damaging children 's well - being .
' Better values '
'' The evidence shows that adults feel children are more materialistic than in past generations , while children themselves feel under pressure to keep up with the latest trends .
" We need a significant change at the heart of society where adults stand up for better values . ''
Mr Cameron said : " I 'm delighted that they 've taken the decision to withdraw this product because we do need a more responsible society . "
Justine Roberts , founder of the online forum for parents , Mumsnet , also welcomed Primark 's decision to remove the bikini range , saying it was a shame it was ever on sale .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mumsnet recently launched a Let Girls Be Girls campaign aimed at persuading retailers not to sell products " prematurely sexualising " children .
Ms Roberts said it was " very clear that parents just do n't want to see this stuff on shelves " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown backed her campaign , saying : " There 's something wrong when companies are pushing our kids into acting like little grown - ups when they should be enjoying being children . "
The Liberal Democrat 's spokeswoman for equality , Lynne Featherstone , also welcomed the decision , adding : " How on earth could they have thought that this was a good idea in the first place ? "
Child protection consultant Shy Keenan , of The Phoenix Chief Advocates which helps victims of paedophiles , said : " Primark have made a mistake here , but at least they have listened to their customers and taken real steps to put it right .
We could not have asked for a better outcome . "
Pole - dancing kit Primark , which is well - known for its heavily discounted brands , has 138 UK stores and 38 in Ireland .
It is the latest chain to face criticism over products considered too adult for youngsters .
Asda has been singled out for a push - up bra aimed at young girls , and Tesco withdrew a pole - dancing kit from its toys section .
Last year WHSmith also withdrew its Playboy stationery , but did not say if that was because the products were sold to children .
A Primark spokesman said it has " taken note " of concerns about the product which is said it sold in " relatively small " quantities .
" The company has stopped the sale of this product line with immediate effect , the spokesman said .
" Primark will donate all the profits made from this product line to a children 's charity , and apologises to customers for any offence caused . "

driving home from a photoshoot i had to drag myself to ( i was pretty tired and hungry – but still managed to get a cute photo of the Archer family ) i happened upon this .
i’ve not seen a rainbow like this in some time .
it made my day .
On Dec. 7 , 1941 , an announcement was made during the football game between the hometown Washington Redskins and the Philadelphia Eagles .
All the generals and admirals at Griffith Stadium were instructed to report to their duty stations .
Little did they know their lives would be changed forever and America would be at war , or on war footing , for the next half - century .
Pearl Harbor had been attacked .
America will be in a constant health - care war if ObamaCare is enacted .
Passage would n't end the health - care debate .
Rather , it ...
Laura Ingraham plays concern troll for the rich or the " givers " as she calls them and cries about how overburdened they 're going to be if they have to pay more taxes .
She also attacks recent tax credits given to " middle class " earners as well .
Watch out or the middle class is n't going to pay any taxes either just like those lazy " takers " at the bottom she was referring to .
I know they 've got the teabaggers bamboozled into thinking that the tax cuts for the wealthy are going to benefit them as well , but this segment seemed a bit too obvious even for Fox .
Somehow directly attacking tax cuts for the " middle class " ( which she should have called working class since we really do n't have much of a middle class left ) does n't seem like a winning message even for their audience .
Alfred McCoys important new article ( TomDispatch , posted on Global Research , April 5 , 2010 ) deserves to mobilize Congress for a serious revaluation of Americas ill - considered military venture in Afghanistan .
The answer to the question he poses in his title   Can Anyone Pacify the World ’s Number One Narco - State ?
 is amply shown by his impressive essay to be a resounding  No !  . . . not until there is fundamental change in the goals and strategies both of Washington and of Kabul .
He amply documents that
the Afghan state of Hamid Karzai is a corrupt narco - state , to which Afghans are forced to pay bribes each year $ 2.5 billion , a quarter of the nations economy ;
, to which Afghans are forced to pay bribes each year $ 2.5 billion , a quarter of the nations economy ; the Afghan economy is a narco - economy : in 2007 Afghanistan produced 8,200 tons of opium , a remarkable 53 % of the country ’s GDP and 93 % of global heroin supply .
Map of Afghanistan showing major poppy fields and intensity of conflict 200708
military options for dealing with the problem are at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive : McCoy argues that the best hope lies in reconstructing the Afghan countryside until food crops become a viable alternative to opium , a process that could take ten or fifteen years , or longer .
( I shall argue later for an interim solution : licensing Afghanistan with the International Narcotics Board to sell its opium legally . )
The War Conspiracy : JF ... Peter Dale Scott Best Price : $ 12.05 Buy New null ( as of 12:35 EST - Details )
Perhaps McCoys most telling argument is that in Colombia cocaine at its peak represented only about 3 percent of the national economy , yet both the FARC guerillas and the right - wing death squads , both amply funded by drugs , still continue to flourish in that country .
To simply eradicate drugs , without first preparing for a substitute Afghan agriculture , would impose intolerable strains on an already ravaged rural society whose only significant income flow at this time derives from opium .
One has only to look at the collapse of the Taliban in 2001 , after a draconian Taliban - led reduction in Afghan drug production ( from 4600 tons to 185 tons ) left the country a hollow shell .
On its face , McCoys arguments would appear to be incontrovertible , and should , in a rational society , lead to a serious debate followed by a major change in Americas current military policy .
McCoy has presented his case with considerable tact and diplomacy , to facilitate such a result .
The CIAs Historic Responsibility for Global Drug Trafficking
Unfortunately , there are important reasons why such a positive outcome is unlikely any time soon .
There are many reasons for this , but among them are some unpleasant realities which McCoy has either avoided or downplayed in his otherwise brilliant essay , and which have to be confronted if we will ever begin to implement sensible strategies in Afghanistan .
The first reality is that the extent of CIA involvement in and responsibility for the global drug traffic is a topic off limits for serious questioning in policy circles , electoral campaigns , and the mainstream media .
Those who have challenged this taboo , like the journalist Gary Webb , have often seen their careers destroyed in consequence .
Since Alfred McCoy has done more than anyone else to heighten public awareness of CIA responsibility for drug trafficking in American war zones , I feel awkward about suggesting that he downplays it in his recent essay .
True , he acknowledges that  Opium first emerged as a key force in Afghan politics during the CIA covert war against the Soviets ,  and he adds that  the CIA ’s covert war served as the catalyst that transformed the Afghan - Pakistan borderlands into the world ’s largest heroin producing region . 
The Politics of Heroin ... Alfred W. McCoy Best Price : $ 28.17 Buy New $ 32.95 ( as of 06:35 EST - Details )
But in a very strange sentence , McCoy suggests that the CIA was passively drawn into drug alliances in the course of combating Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the years 1979  88 , whereas in fact the CIA clearly helped create them precisely to fight the Soviets :
In one of history ’s ironic accidents , the southern reach of communist China and the Soviet Union had coincided with Asia ’s opium zone along this same mountain rim , drawing the CIA into ambiguous alliances with the region ’s highland warlords .
There was no such accident in Afghanistan , where the first local drug lords on an international scale  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abu Rasul Sayyaf  were in fact launched internationally as a result of massive and ill - advised assistance from the CIA , in conjunction with the governments of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia .
While other local resistance forces were accorded second - class status , these two clients of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia , precisely because they lacked local support , pioneered the use of opium and heroin to build up their fighting power and financial resources .
Both , moreover , became agents of salafist extremism , attacking the indigenous Sufi- influenced Islam of Afghanistan .
And ultimately both became sponsors of al Qaeda .
CIA involvement in the drug trade hardly began with its involvement in the Soviet - Afghan war .
To a certain degree , the CIAs responsibility for the present dominant role of Afghanistan in the global heroin traffic merely replicated what had happened earlier in Burma , Thailand , and Laos between the late 1940s and the 1970s .
These countries also only became factors in the international drug traffic as a result of CIA assistance ( after the French , in the case of Laos ) to what would otherwise have been only local traffickers .
One cannot talk of ironic accidents  here either .
McCoy himself has shown how , in all of these countries , the CIA not only tolerated but assisted the growth of drug - financed anti-Communist assets , to offset the danger of Communist Chinese penetration into Southeast Asia .
As in Afghanistan today CIA assistance helped turn the Golden Triangle , from the 1940s to the 1970s , into a leading source for the worlds opium .
In this same period the CIA recruited assets along the smuggling routes of the Asian opium traffic as well , in countries such as Turkey , Lebanon , Italy , France , Cuba , Honduras , and Mexico .
These assets have included government officials like Manuel Noriega of Panama or Vladimiro Montesinos of Peru , often senior figures in CIA - assisted police and intelligence services .
But they have also included insurrectionary movements , ranging from the Contras in Nicaragua in the 1980s to ( according to Robert Baer and Seymour Hersh ) the al Qaeda - linked Jundallah , operating today in Iran and Baluchistan .
CIA map tracing opium traffic from Afghanistan to Europe , 1998 .
The CIA cite , updated in 2008 states  Most Southwest Asian heroin flows overland through Iran and Turkey to Europe via the Balkans . 
But in fact drugs also flow through the states of the former Soviet Union , and through Pakistan and Dubai .
The Karzai Government , not the Taliban , Dominate the Afghan Dope Economy
Drugs , Oil , and War : T ... Peter Scott Best Price : $ 7.00 Buy New $ 21.01 ( as of 10:05 EST - Details )
Perhaps the best example of such CIA influence via drug traffickers today is in Afghanistan itself , where those accused of drug trafficking include President Karzais brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai ( an active CIA asset ) , and Abdul Rashid Dostum ( a former CIA asset ) .
The drug corruption of the Afghan government must be attributed at least in part to the U.S. and CIA decision in 2001 to launch an invasion with the support of the Northern Alliance , a movement that Washington knew to be drug - corrupted .
In this way the U.S. consciously recreated in Afghanistan the situation it had created earlier in Vietnam .
There too ( like Ahmed Wali Karzai a half century later ) the presidents brother , Ngo dinh Nhu , used drugs to finance a private network that was used to rig an election for Ngo dinh Diem .
Thomas H. Johnson , coordinator of anthropological research studies at the Naval Postgraduate School , has pointed out the unlikelihood of a counterinsurgency program succeeding when that program is in support of a local government that is flagrantly dysfunctional and corrupt .
Thus I take issue with McCoy when he , echoing the mainstream U.S. media , depicts the Afghan drug economy as one dominated by the Taliban .
( In McCoys words ,  If the insurgents capture that illicit economy , as the Taliban have done , then the task becomes little short of insurmountable .)
The Talibans share of the Afghan opium economy is variously estimated from $ 90 to $ 400 million .
But the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) estimates that the total Afghan annual earnings from opium and heroin are in the order of from $ 2.8 to $ 3.4 billion .
Clearly the Taliban have not captured  this economy , of which the largest share by far is controlled by supporters of the Karzai government .
In 2006 a report to the World Bank argued  that at the top level , around 25 - 30 key traffickers , the majority of them in southern Afghanistan , control major transactions and transfers , working closely with sponsors in top government and political positions .
In 2007 the London Daily Mail reported that " the four largest players in the heroin business are all senior members of the Afghan government . "
The American media have confronted neither this basic fact nor the way in which it has distorted Americas opium and war policies in Afghanistan .
The Obama administration appears to have shifted away from the ill - advised eradication programs of the Bush era , which are certain to lose the hearts and minds of the peasantry .
It has moved instead towards a policy of selective interdiction of the traffic , explicitly limited to attacks on drug traffickers who are supporting the insurgents .
The Strength of the Wo ... Douglas Valentine Best Price : $ 16.57 Buy New $ 107.83 ( as of 07:35 EST - Details )
This policy may or may not be effective in weakening the Taliban .
But to target what constitutes about a tenth of the total traffic will clearly never end Afghanistans current status as the worlds number one narco - state .
Nor will it end the current world post -1980s heroin epidemic , which has created five million addicts in Pakistan , over two million addicts inside Russia , eight hundred thousand addicts in America , over fifteen million addicts in the world , and one million addicts inside Afghanistan itself .
Nor will it end the current world post -1980s heroin epidemic , which has created five million addicts in Pakistan , over two million addicts inside Russia , eight hundred thousand addicts in America , over fifteen million addicts in the world , and one million addicts inside Afghanistan itself .
The Obama governments policy of selective interdiction also helps explain its reluctance to consider the most reasonable and humane solution to the worlds Afghan heroin epidemic .
This is the poppy for medicine initiative of the International Council on Security and Development ( ICOS , formerly known as The Senlis Council ) : to establish a trial licensing scheme , allowing farmers to sell their opium for the production of much - needed essential medicines such as morphine and codeine .
The proposal has received support from the European Parliament and in Canada ; but it has come under heavy attack in the United States , chiefly on the grounds that it might well lead to an increase in opium production .
It would however provide a short - term answer to the heroin epidemic that is devastating Europe and Russia  something not achieved by McCoys long - term alternative of crop substitution over ten or fifteen years , still less by the current Obama administrations program of selective elimination of opium supplies .
An unspoken consequence of the poppy for medicine initiative would be to shrink the illicit drug proceeds that are helping to support the Karzai government .
Whether for this reason , or simply because anything that smacks of legalizing drugs is a tabooed subject in Washington , the poppy for medicine initiative is unlikely to be endorsed by the Obama administration .
Afghan Heroin and the CIAs Global Drug Connection
There is another important paragraph where McCoy , I think misleadingly , focuses attention on Afghanistan , rather than America itself , as the locus of the problem :
At a drug conference in Kabul this month , the head of Russia ’s Federal Narcotics Service estimated the value of Afghanistan ’s current opium crop at $ 65 billion .
Only $ 500 million of that vast sum goes to Afghanistan ’s farmers , $ 300 million to the Taliban guerrillas , and the $ 64 billion balance " to the drug mafia , " leaving ample funds to corrupt the Karzai government in a nation whose total GDP is only $ 10 billion .
What this paragraph omits is the pertinent fact that , according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime , only 5 or 6 percent of that $ 65 billion , or from $ 2.8 to $ 3.4 billion , stays inside Afghanistan itself .
An estimated 80 percent of the earnings from the drug trade are derived from the countries of consumption  in this case , Russia , Europe , and America .
Thus we should not think for a moment that the only government corrupted by the Afghan drug trade is the country of origin .
Everywhere the traffic has become substantial , even if only in transit , it has survived through protection , which in other words means corruption .
There is no evidence to suggest that drug money from the CIAs trafficker assets fattened the financial accounts of the CIA itself , or of its officers .
But the CIA profited indirectly from the drug traffic , and developed over the years a close relationship with it .
The CIAs off - the - books war in Laos was one extreme case where it fought a war , using as its chief assets the Royal Laotian Army of General Ouane Rattikone and the Hmong Army of General Vang Pao , which were , in large part , drug - financed .
The CIAs massive Afghanistan operation in the 1980s was another example of a war that was in part drug - financed .

What 's the modern mom to do when her 11 - year - old asks for grown - up makeup ?
Says the Times , " Mrs. Pometta 's first instinct was to send her daughter to her room , but she reconsidered .
Instead , she took her for a makeover . "

When I asked my friends and coworkers , now adults , about their makeup initiations , the responses were pretty much the same : although parental permissiveness and amounts of makeup varied , most people started to want to wear it around the time puberty hit , in middle - school .
The puberty correlation makes logical sense : no one had told us , before that , that we were supposed to be wearing it , and so we were just as happy to get obsessed , in fourth grade , with sticker - books or Koosh balls ( which actually had to be banned at my school ) or snap - bracelets ( which actually had to be banned across the country . )
Back in the day , we were n't tweens .
We were kids .
And there 's a big difference between kids wearing makeup ( they do n't ) and tweens doing so .
Because tweens are by definition aspiring teens .
And so obviously tweens not only wear mascara and blush and lipstick , but are a key demographic for cosmetics manufacturers .
I 'm not amazed that parents buy their tweens makeup .
What does surprise me continually is that these parents have bought into the marketing concept of " tween " so completely .

Says the New York Times ,
Regular use of certain cosmetics is rising sharply among tween girls , according to a new report from the NPD Group , a consumer research company .
From 2007 to 2009 , the percentage of girls ages 8 to 12 who regularly use mascara and eyeliner nearly doubled - to 18 percent from 10 percent for mascara , and to 15 percent from 9 percent for eyeliner .
The percentage of them using lipstick also rose , to 15 percent from 10 percent .
Meanwhile , women of all other age groups , including teenagers , report using less makeup , according to NPD ... So how is the elementary - school set getting away with it ?
Easy : Mom is the one buying it .
When asked to name their primary influence for acquiring and applying makeup , 66 percent of the 365 tween girls polled by NPD pointed to a family member or adult family friend .

The Reviving Ophelia - style arguments against this early sexualization — or glorification of the aesthetic — are obvious .
But there are , says the article , other concerns , too : " In a study released this month , the Mount Sinai School of Medicine looked at girls younger than 10 with early onset puberty and discovered a high incidence of endocrine disruptors that are found in some nail polishes and other cosmetics .
This is to say nothing of the skin damage that might be caused by the chemicals in makeup , or the possible allergic reactions . "
It does seem curious that a generation of parents increasingly awake to what goes into its chidren 's bodies should splash out on external chemicals — and the piece does n't address whether there 's been a similar upswing in the under - teen sales of Origins , Body Shop or other relatively wholesome beautifiers .
But beyond the philosophical and physical dangers , this seems , ironically , to rob tweens of another rite of passage : relatively harmless rebellion .
Fighting over growing up has always been an integral part of the parent - teen power struggle , and snitching moms ' makeup , doing a quick once - over with drugstore samples ( and hell , we did n't even have Sephora ! ) or using a friend 's contraband eyeliner may be things of the past .
I get the argument for supervised experimentation — especially when peer - pressure is strong - but sometimes the unsupervised kind is necessary - not least because we all need some agonizing photos in the album .
Anna North says , " in retrospect I looked kind of awful — I was really into putting on this really dark purple eyeshadow and then reapplying all the time , unnecessarily . "
And Margaret : " I just assumed my mom would say no to makeup , so I stole her old free samples from the bathroom cabinet and applied them at school .
I probably looked even crazier because I did n't realize makeup could go bad and was using five - year - old dried up concealer . "
This , you do n't learn at the beauty counter with mom .

UFC President Dana
White has made no secret that he hates the idea of 40 - something athletes like Herschel Walker and Jose Canseco going into mixed martial arts after they 're too old to compete in football and baseball .
But UFC announcer Joe Rogan explored the subject with fellow MMA broadcaster Michael Schiavello on The Voice vs. Joe Rogan ( which debuts Friday night on HDNet ) , and Rogan says he thinks MMA should welcome athletes from other sports .
" I do n't think it in any way harms mixed martial arts , " Rogan said .
" I liked watching the Herschel Walker fight .
I thought it was interesting .
I loved the fact that here 's a guy who 's an elite athlete , who 's 47 years old , that just decides that this is something he wanted to pursue for a while , that does it the right way , goes to AKA , trains with a very respectable camp , with some of the best guys in the world , and really puts in the work and does the right thing . "
I attended the Herschel Walker fight in Miami , and I agree with Rogan : Herschel did it the right way , and he should be commended for that .
Canseco , however , does n't want to approach MMA the right way .
He just wants a quick paycheck .
Rogan knows that , but he says that 's OK , too .
" The Jose Canseco thing , you know , was just a guy who needs some money and Japan loves freak shows , " Rogan said .
" I watched it .
I like a freak show every now and then .
It 's not the same as watching a great fight between two really talented fighters and you do n't know what 's going to happen , but I like them .
I do n't think it 's bad .
I do n't think these guys entering into MMA does anything other than give MMA attention .
And if anything , it highlights the very obvious difference between a guy like an Anderson Silva -- you watch Anderson Silva fight and then you watch Herschel Walker fight .
I think it 's good .
I think it 's good for people to see .
As long as there 's more eyes on MMA .
That 's what I think is important . "
Good stuff from Rogan .
His full conversation with Schiavello will definitely be worth watching .

No surprise , since Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer faces a tough primary challenge , but still disappointing : she has just announced her intention to sign SB 1070 .
The soon - to - be law allows Arizona police to challenge anyone they think might be undocumented , and demand immigration papers .
It also allows residents to sue their municipalities if they believe local cops are n't doing enough to target and jail undocumented immigrants .
You better believe that within a year , virtually every town and county in the state will be getting sued by xenophobic teabaggers .
Obama has already promised to monitor the situation closely for violations of civil rights , which are inevitable .
And this new law will create additional impetus for a comprehensive national solution to the problem of undocumented workers in our country .
As for Arizona Republicans , they 're about to learn what California Republicans learned after passage of Prop 187 -- alienating a substantial Latino community is bad for getting elected .
Bit rate over time showing 1 Mbit /s average .
The Cambridge Lab of Toshiba Research Europe today announced a major breakthrough that will allow ultra-secure encryption of sensitive data sent by banks , hospitals and government organisations .
They have succeeded in demonstrating continuous operation of quantum key distribution ( QKD ) with a secure bit rate exceeding 1 Megabit / sec over 50 km of fibre for the first time .
Averaged over a 24 hour period , this is 100 - 1000 times higher than anything reported previously for a 50 km link .
It was achieved using two innovations developed by the Cambridge team : a novel light detector for high bit rates and a feedback system which maintains a high bit rate at all times and requires no manual set - up or adjustment .
The results will be reported in the scientific journal , Applied Physics Letters .
Significantly , the breakthrough will enable the everyday use of “ one - time pad ” encryption , the only known method that is theoretically perfectly secret .
Although ultra-secure , the application of one - time pad encryption has been restricted in the past as it requires the transmission of very long secret keys — the same length as the data itself .
For this reason it has only been used for short messages in situations requiring very high security , for example by the military and security services .
Today 's bit rate breakthrough will extend the application of this ultra-secure communication method for everyday use .
Dr Andrew Shields , who directs this work at Toshiba Research Europe commented , “ Although the feasibility of QKD with megabits per second has been shown in the lab , these experiments lasted only minutes or even seconds at a time and required manual adjustments .
To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that continuous operation has been demonstrated at high bit rates .
Although much development work remains this advance could allow unconditionally secure communication with significant bandwidths . ”
As an example of the new capability afforded by this system , these higher bit rates would allow real time encryption of video using the one - time pad .
This is now possible due to the much higher and continuous bit rates that can be delivered with the new technology .
Previously it had been possible to encrypt continuous voice data , but not video images .
Toshiba now plans to install a QKD technology demonstrator at the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology ( NICT ) in Tokyo .
Co-ordinator of the Tokyo QKD Network , Dr. Masahide Sasaki , commented : “ The secure key rate of 1 Megabit / sec over 50 km has been a milestone for mission critical applications .
The next challenge would be to put this level of technology into metropolitan network operation .
Our Japan - EU collaboration is going to do this within the next few years . ”
Cryptography , the science of information security , is essential to protect electronic business communication and e-commerce , enabling , for example , confidentiality , identification of users and validation of transactions .
All of these applications rely upon digital keys , which are shared between the legitimate users , but must be kept secret from everyone else .
Maintaining the ability to distribute keys securely is thus one of the most important battlefields in the cryptography arms race .
It is essential to be able to distribute keys between users securely .
Furthermore , in order to protect the system from crypto-analysis or key theft it is important to change the keys frequently .
Quantum Key Distribution ( QKD ) is an automated method for distributing secret keys across an optical fibre .
A unique feature of QKD is that its security is derived from the fundamental laws of Quantum Physics and does not therefore rely upon assumptions about the computing power of an eavesdropper .
An added benefit is that the keys distributed by QKD will be secure in the future as well as today .
QKD is based upon sending encoding single photons ( particles of light ) along the fibre .
The laws of Quantum Physics dictate that any attempt by an eavesdropper to intercept and measure the photons alters their encoding .
This means that eavesdropping on quantum keys can be detected .
The Toshiba QKD system is based on one - way optical propagation and the BB84 protocol using decoy pulses .
This protocol has been proven to be unconditionally secure , i.e. satisfying the most stringent security criterion .
Current QKD systems are limited by the semiconductor devices ( avalanche photodiodes ) used to detect the single photons .
One photon triggers an avalanche of millions of electrons in this semiconductor device which can be sensed by electrical circuitry in the QKD system .
The problem in present systems is that some of these avalanche electrons can be trapped in the device and later stimulate a second spurious detection count .
As these noise counts cause errors in the key , current detectors must be operated with long dead times to allow the decay of any trapped electrons .
This has limited the clock rate of current QKD systems to around 10 MHz and thus the average secure key bit rate to a few kbit / sec for a 50 km fibre .
The Toshiba team has devised a method to detect much weaker avalanches .
This strongly reduces the chance for an electron to be trapped , allowing the detector to be operated at much faster rates beyond 2 GHz .
As the detector is based on a compact and rugged semiconductor device , it is suitable for real - world applications .

Large modern tuna boats have revolutionised the industry EU nations have decided to support a ban on international trade in Atlantic bluefin tuna until stocks recover .
The bloc has agreed to back a motion for a ban during next week 's meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) .
The US has already given its support , but Japan - where most bluefin is eaten - may opt out of CITES controls .
The EU is backing exemptions for traditional fishers , and deferring the ban for a year .
Malta was reportedly the only EU member to vote against supporting the ban proposal , which was originally lodged by Monaco last year .
Conservation groups were generally pleased .
We have long argued that this threatened species should be given the protection it urgently needs
Huw Irranca - Davies , UK Marine and Natural Environment Minister " With the two largest holders of bluefin tuna fishing quota on either side of the Atlantic - the US and EU - now supporting the trade ban , other countries should follow suit , " said Sergi Tudela , head of WWF 's Mediterranean fisheries campaign .
" The EU must now push for widespread support of this proposal during the CITES meeting . "
UK Marine and Natural Environment Minister Huw Irranca - Davies also welcomed the move .
" We have long argued that this threatened species should be given the protection it urgently needs , " he said .
Change of heart Last year , scientists reporting to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( Iccat ) - the organisation responsible for managing the fishery - said the bluefin 's decline had been so stark that a trade ban was merited .
They calculated that the stock is now at about 15 % of the level it was in the era before industrial fishing began .
The plight of the bluefin Iccat 's member states , however - which include EU nations with tuna fleets such as Spain , France and Italy - decided to continue fishing , but with lowered quotas .
Initially , those three countries along with Cyprus and Greece had lobbied against a CITES ban , but have now changed their positions .
Compensation packages , as yet unpublicised , have been offered to operators of the EU tuna fleet , which is now dominated by modern , industrial boats .
Conservationists are less happy with three elements of the EU proposition : Implementation would be delayed until 2011 rather than taking effect immediately
If Iccat implements stronger action at its meeting next year , CITES governments could revisit the issue and choose to downgrade protection from a full ban to a system of monitoring and regulation - in CITES jargon , moving from Appendix 1 to Appendix 2 listing
The EU wants exemptions for fishers using traditional methods , without defining what they are .
Dodging the issue EU support alone will not secure approval for the ban within CITES , where motions need a two - thirds majority to pass .
At the last meeting , in 2007 , Japan and other nations opposed to using CITES to regulate commercial fish species blocked measures aimed at safeguarding sharks .
CITES EXPLAINED
Threatened organisms listed on three appendices depending on level of risk Appendix 1 - all international trade banned Appendix 2 - international trade monitored and regulated Appendix 3 - trade bans by individual governments , others asked to assist " Uplisting " - moving organism to a more protective appendix ; " downlisting " - the reverse Conferences of the Parties ( COPs ) held every three years CITES administered by UN Environment Programme ( Unep ) Japan is not opposed to bluefin conservation , but believes such matters should be regulated by regional fisheries bodies such as Iccat .
Japanese officials have blamed European governments for the bluefin 's decline , arguing that governments have allocated unfeasibly large quotas to their fleets and turned a blind eye to illegal fishing .
Most bluefin is sold to Japan for use in sushi and sashimi restaurants .
Under a CITES ban , EU member states would not be allowed to export bluefin caught in their waters , and would not be able to fish in international waters .
CITES rules allow any country to lodge a " reservation " against measures it does not like , thereby opting out .
Japan has indicated it may take this option if the meeting endorses a trade ban on bluefin Conservationists and some EU states are concerned that other Iccat countries around the Mediterranean - the principal fishing ground - could also opt out of a CITES ban .
That would allow those countries to continue fishing and exporting the tuna to Japan .
The CITES meeting , in Qatar , opens this weekend .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE : April 16 , 2010
ARLINGTON , Va. - Showcasing its energy research initiatives for an Earth Day event on April 22 at the Pentagon , the Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) will highlight the microbial fuel cell , a device that could revolutionize naval energy use by converting decomposed marine organisms into electricity .
These fuel cells convert naturally occurring fuels and oxidants in the marine environment into electricity , offering a clean , efficient and reliable alternative to batteries and other environmentally harmful fuels .
The fuel cell can be a viable power source for long - term operation of autonomous underwater unmanned vehicles , in - water sensors , and devices used for surveillance and monitoring the ocean environment .
Named as one of TIME magazine 's " Top 50 Inventions for 2009 , " the fuel cell , with its powerful return of clean energy , may reduce carbon emissions in the environment and change the way we fuel our vehicles and supply power to our homes .
" Microbial fuel cell research is a great example of naval needs propelling advanced technology that also has potential benefit to the public " said Chief of Naval Research , Rear Adm. Nevin Carr .
" The Secretary of the Navy issued five energy goals to the Department of the Navy last October at ONR's Naval Energy Forum and this fuel cell research will help provide part of the solution . "
" Think of it as a battery that runs on mud , " ONR Program Manager Dr. Linda Chrisey said .
" They are sustainable , environmentally friendly and do n't involve hazardous reactants like a regular battery might because they use the natural carbon in the marine environment .
For example , we are working on a 4 - foot long autonomous underwater vehicle that will settle on the seafloor and recharge its batteries using this fuel cell approach .
We are already able to power many types of sensors using microbial fuel cells . "
Dr. Leonard Tender , research chemist in the Center for Bio / Molecular Science and Engineering at the Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) , has been a central figure in the development of the fuel cell .
" We work on the intersection of microbiology and electrochemistry , " Tender said .
" The most fascinating aspect of the program is how these micro-organisms function and the mechanisms by which they take fuel , metabolize it and generate electrical current . "
Working with scientists from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , Tender and his team started to investigate electricity - generating microorganisms .
The most promising , called Geobacter , was discovered in the Potomac River immediately downstream of NRL .
The discovery of the tiny Geobacter microbe by Dr. Derek Lovley of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst holds the key to understanding microbial energy conversion .
Geobacter uses its hair - like extensions , or pili , to generate electricity from mud and wastewater .
Researchers have developed a strain of Geobacter that is eight times more efficient than other strains at producing power .
" Essentially , they could go on for years without any kind of battery replacement , " Chrisey said .
For this reason , Navy researchers at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center ( SPAWAR ) Pacific are using fuel cell - powered devices to track Pacific - endangered green sea turtles .
" The device is light , efficient and environmentally friendly , " said Bart Chadwick , SPAWAR 's Head of Environmental Sciences Branch .
" The technology is helping track sea turtle populations , if they are feeding near Navy shorefront facilities , which informs Navy decision - making on port operations or construction . "
ONR , in collaboration with other industry and academic partners , continues to play an integral role in delivering new energy technologies .
Other ONR energy initiatives include :

[ webkit - dev ] Announcing WebKit2
Hello everyone ,
This is a heads - up that we will shortly start landing patches for a new WebKit framework that we at Apple have been working on for a while .
We currently call this new framework " WebKit2 " .
WebKit2 is designed from the ground up to support a split process model , where the web content ( JavaScript , HTML , layout , etc ) lives in a separate process .
This model is similar to what Google Chrome offers , with the major difference being that we have built the process split model directly into the framework , allowing other clients to use it .
Some high - level documentation is available at http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKit2
Currently WebKit2 is available for Mac and Windows , and we would gladly accept patches to add more ports .
We 're more than happy to answer any questions you might have , and we hope that this will be a topic of discussion at the WebKit Contributors Meeting .
Thanks , Anders Carlsson and Sam Weinig .

White House Says No New Offshore Drilling Until Investigation is Complete Experts say BP incident is likely to slow things down on the legislation front .
April 30 , 2010  --
As some Democratic lawmakers call on President Obama to suspend his plans to expand offshore oil drilling , the White House today said that there will be no new domestic offshore drilling until the investigation into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is complete .
" All he has said is that he 's not going to continue the moratorium on drilling but ... no additional drilling has been authorized and none will until we find out what happened here and whether there was something unique and preventable here , " White House senior adviser David Axelrod said on " Good Morning America " today , defending the administration 's policy .
Axelrod said no new drilling in domestic areas will go forward until " there is an adequate review of what happened here and what is being proposed elsewhere . "
As Gulf Coast residents brace for mounds of slick to hit their shores , the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has seeped into the energy debate in Washington , D.C. , and threatens to disrupt Obama 's policy and the bipartisan energy legislation in the Senate .
Obama last month lifted a longtime ban on offshore drilling and oil and gas exploration , saying it was crucial to U.S. energy security .
In a rare case of bipartisanship , the proposal won broad support from Republicans .
But it angered environmentalists , who argued that offshore drilling wo n't help lower gas prices or reduce the United States ' dependence on foreign oil .
Rather , it will adversely impact marine life and beaches .
The Senate energy and climate bill drafted jointly by Sens. John Kerry , D - Mass. , Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , and Joe Lieberman , a Connecticut independent , also encouraged offshore oil drilling , a move aimed at attracting Republican support .
But now , with environmentalists and some lawmakers pointing to the Gulf of Mexico disaster and arguing that there is no truly safe offshore operation , the Obama administration and senators who drafted the bill could have a tougher time moving forward .
" The problem for the president and for the Congress in general is that they were already facing this very uphill climb because there was this really diverse disagreement about how to shape an effective energy bill or climate bill , " said Amy Myers Jaffe , director of the Baker Institute Energy Forum at Rice University .
" Now it all becomes much more complex . "
The administration was hoping to build a broad coalition for an energy and climate bill , experts say , and this incident only complicates that matter .
" The administration , I think , has moved quite systematically to try to broaden and strengthen that coalition and this really , I think , substantially complicates what was already a very complicated job of building a broad enough coalition so there would be adequate support for climate change legislation , " said Bill Galston , senior fellow at Brookings Institute and a former policy adviser to President Clinton .
" This is sure going to slow things down . "
The Deepwater Horizon exploration well , operated by BP Oil and owned by Transocean Ltd. , exploded and started burning April 20 .
The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that 5,000 barrels a day are leaking from the rig .
Much of the sea life in the region is in danger and the beaches are likely to be heavily polluted as slick washes up to the shore .
Democratic lawmakers already are lining up against Obama 's policy to expand offshore drilling and any bill that includes such measures .
On Thursday , Democratic senators spent more time debating offshore drilling than the financial reform bill .
" I 'm deeply concerned that the current five - year plan recently announced by the administration would allow oil drilling less than 5 miles from Cap May , New Jersey , " said Sen. Bob Menendez , D - N.J .
" It is a wakeup call for all of us . "
Menendez and Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey , also a Democrat , are calling on the president to nix it altogether .
" Big oil has perpetuated a dangerous myth that coastline drilling is a completely safe endeavor , but accidents like this are a sober reminder just how far that is from the truth , " the senators said in a joint statement Thursday .
Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , wants to block Obama 's offshore oil drilling plan while the Deep Water Horizon investigation is ongoing and called on him to ask " tough questions " of big oil companies .
" It 's unclear whether any additional shut - off controls would have made a difference in this case , " Nelson wrote in a letter to Obama Thursday .
" But the questions about the practices of the oil industry raised in the wake of this still - unfolding incident require that you postpone indefinitely plans for expanded offshore oil drilling operations . "
Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill Threatens Obama 's Offshore Oil Drilling Policy
Meanwhile , environmental groups are hoping that the incident will validate their opposition .
" There are grave environmental concerns which this horrific spill has highlighted , " said Bob Deans , spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council , which opposed the policy .
" We need a time out on any action to go forward with new offshore drilling because this has obviously raised a bunch of questions .
We need a full comprehensive independent investigation . "
The White House has said it is too early to tell how the incident would impact the president 's proposal , saying the policy is only the beginning .
" There will be ample opportunity for public input .
There will be ample opportunity for congressional and governor input , " Carol Browner , assistant to the president for energy and climate change , said Thursday .
" That is the beginning of the process , not the end of the process .
...
We need to stay focused on the incident .
We need to learn from the incident . "
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stressed that the president 's decision was " the beginning of a longer process " that will take into account any new developments , including the oil spill from BP 's well .
Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes told reporters Thursday that he believes the fundamental practices of offshore drilling are safe and that this particular incident was highly unusual , but " everything is on the table . "
Brown countered the idea that the spill would jeopardize the debate on the energy and climate bill .
" This will become part of the debate .
That goes without saying , " she said .
" It does n't mean we can't get the kind of energy legislation we need for this country . "
Supporters of offshore oil and gas drilling say one incident does n't mean the United States should completely do away with it altogether .
" We must continue to drill , " Sen .
Mary Landrieu , D- Louisiana , said on the Senate floor Thursday , comparing the disaster in the Gulf to two previous incidents , the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island and also the Challenger space shuttle explosion .
" What we did not do is end the space program .
We did not stop launching .
We did not stop exploring , " she said .
" We have to find a way to make sure it never happens again , strengthen our resolve and ... continue to be the world leader . "
Experts say what will really determine the impact of this incident is whether it was caused by human error or by structural or technological damage .
" Until we know how and why this happened , it is pretty hard to evaluate how serious this is , " Jaffe said .
" The answer to the question of what caused this accident is just critical because all these people who were in favor of [ offshore ] drilling need to know that answer before they can reevaluate their position .
...
We can't have proper national debate until we know the answer . "
High gasoline prices and reliance on foreign oil both encourage support for new drilling , recent polls have shown .
A Pew poll last month found that nearly two - third of Americans , about 63 percent , favored more offshore drilling for oil and gas .
A Fox News poll earlier this month found that 70 percent of registered voters supported an increase in offshore drilling .
But surveys from the time of the last major spill , the Exxon Valdez disaster of March 1989 , show that environmental concerns also take a place at the table .
In April 1989 , the month after the Exxon Valdez spill , the percentage of people who favored " stronger regulations on where and how the oil companies drill for offshore oil and gas " jumped to 62 percent from 49 percent a year ago .
By March 1990 , 70 percent of those polled felt that way .
ABC News ' Z. Byron Wolf and Gary Langer contributed to this report .
” We will not cross the picket line and attend the festival unless the New Yorker leadership agrees to the union ’s demands , ” Ocasio - Cortez and Warren write .
” They should do so immediately . ”
Liberal reformers , who might once have wished to extend the realm of liberty , now wish to restrict it in the name of compulsory political virtue .
There was a perfect recent illustration of this in Britain .
An evangelical Christian couple , the Wilkinsons , ran a bed - and - breakfast business in a place called Cookham .
They refused a middle - aged homosexual couple , Michael Black and John Morgan , accommodation because they believed that homosexuality was wrong ; it is condemned in the Bible .
The spurned couple said that they felt like lepers ; moreover , they felt that their legal rights , enshrined in the Equality Act of 2006 , which makes it illegal to discriminate in the provision of services on the grounds of “ sexual orientation , ” had been infringed , and they complained to the police .
As yet , no prosecution has followed .
But shortly afterward a senior politician , Christopher Grayling , who might be a minister in the next government if David Cameron wins the forthcoming election , said that he thought that the owners of bed - and - breakfasts ought to be allowed to refuse homosexual couples if they so wished .
From the furious denunciation that Grayling ’s remarks attracted , you might have thought that he had advocated medieval punishments for homosexuals .
Instead , he was merely pointing out that the law as it stands is tyrannical , and that in a free society not everyone will make the same moral judgments .
It is a necessary condition of freedom that private citizens should be allowed to treat with , or to refuse to treat with , whomever they choose , on any grounds that they choose , including those that strike others as repellent .
Freedom is freedom , not the means by which everyone comes to precisely the same conclusion and conducts himself in precisely the same way .
The depressing , and perhaps sinister , aspect of the public commentary on the case is how largely it has ignored the question of freedom .
For liberals , it seems , any trampling on freedom or individual conscience is now justified if it conduces to an end of which they approve .
Thus liberalism turns into its opposite , illiberalism .
Messrs .
Black and Morgan , who said they felt like lepers and went to the police as a result , condemned themselves out of their own mouths .
They said that they had been together for decades , and that this was the first time they had ever experienced what they called “ homophobia . ”
Not only does this suggest that the Equality Act was not , even on the false assumptions of liberals , necessary , but it means that anyone more mature than they would simply have found somewhere else to stay for the night .
Moreover , to waste police time on such a matter in a country with the highest crime rate in the Western world is nothing short of scandalous , a manifestation of the worst kind of inflamed egotism .
Dip in Italian taxpayers donating share of income to the church likely as row over paedophile priests takes toll on believers
Vatican officials fear the clerical sex abuse scandal could have a devastating effect on the finances of the Italian church , undermining what until now has been a bastion of the faith .
Italian taxpayers have until the end of July to declare their income for 2009 and , under a system in force in several European countries , they can opt for a proportion of their taxes to be paid to the church .
In Italy , 0.8 % of income tax revenue is divided between state - run aid organisations and recognised denominations and religions according to the preferences expressed by taxpayers on their returns .
" The media always talk of class actions , compensation for the victims of abuse by the clergy and the legal fees which , since 2001 have forced the American dioceses to sell schools , hospitals , convents and universities , " the daily La Stampa quoted a Vatican source as saying .
" But in fact the biggest economic damage is done by the collapse in donations . "
In Italy , among those who expressed a preference , the proportion of taxpayers earmarking a share for the church rose to a peak of 90 % in 2004 .
It fell slightly to 87 % in 2008 .
That percentage was far higher than the proportion attending Mass each Sunday , perhaps because only predominantly middle - class non-wage earners have to fill in a tax declaration .
Last year , they earned the church some € 900 m ( £ 776 m ) from the state .
With many Catholics across Europe saying the scandals have robbed them of their faith , there is a risk that this year 's income could be much lower .
In Germany , where church membership is registered and has a direct impact on church funds , pollsters for Focus magazine this month found that 26 % of Catholics were reconsidering their religious allegiance .

The King County Prosecuting Attorney ’s Office has just announced that 22 - year - old Marcus Combs is now charged with first - degree assault in connection with last Friday ’s stabbing of a 40 - year - old woman who was walking with her 9 - year - old .
Court documents we obtained and reported on Monday said he stabbed her 15 times in the head and body after attacking her and pushing her down along a High Point street .
But as disclosed in a Seattle Housing Authority update on Monday , the victim was doing well enough to leave the hospital over the weekend and is recovering at home .
Combs is scheduled for arraignment on May 12th ; if found guilty on this charge , he could be sentenced to up to 14 years in prison .
The High Point Neighborhood Association is sponsoring a community meeting tomorrow night at HP Neighborhood Center to discuss the incident and other issues , and is also working to find out if there is anything the community can do collectively to help the victim ’s family .
ADDED 3:24 PM : Transcription , from the charging documents , of exactly how it ’s alleged the Friday afternoon attack went down – read on :
( April 23 at approximately 3:34 pm ) ( Victim ) was walking southbound on Lanham Place SW with her 9 - year - old daughter .
to get her other children from day care .
Her daughter told her at least twice that a man was following them , but ( victim ) dismissed it as just another person walking down the street .
Suddenly and without warning the male attacked .
He grabbed ( victim ) from behind , and she turned her head to try and see who was grabbing her .
When she did , she saw a knife coming toward her throat , and she dropped to the ground to avoid being stabbed .
The suspect stood over her holding her scarf in one hand , and stabbing her repeatedly with the other hand .
Multiple times ( she ) saw the knife blade coming toward her thraot , and used her arms , hands and legs to attempt to deflect the knife away from her throat .
During this assault she sustained 15 stabbing and cutting wounds to her head and chest , as well as defensive wounds to her hands and arms .
( She ) was treated at the scene by Seattle Fire , and transported to ( Harborview Medical Center ) for further treatment and evaluation .
At least seven of those wounds required multiple stitches to close .
Her 9 - year - old daughter witnessed the attack from her mother ’s side and was screaming for someone to help her .
Numerous people were in the immediate area yelling at the suspect to stop , but only ( Witness A ) came to her aid .
( Witness A ) was arriving home by car and was just a few houses away , when she heard a woman screaming .
She saw ( victim ) on the ground , and the suspect standing over her .
She initially thought that he was punching and kicking the victim but as she got closer she could see that the suspect had a knife and was stabbing ( her ) repeatedly .
She saw numerous people standing around and yelling at him to stop , but nobody was doing anything to stop him .
She heard someone yell for “ Marcus ” to stop .
She ran to the victim ’s aid and began to yell at the suspect to stop .
When he did not she began striking the suspect on his back with her keys in an attempt to stop his attack .
The suspect turned and looked at her briefly , and then continued his assault on ( the victim ) ( Witness A ) continued to yell at him to stop and for somebody else to help , while continuing to strike him with her keys .
The suspect stopped his attack as suddenly as he had initiated it , and casually walked away eastbound on SW Graham .
( Witness A ) got back in her car and followed the suspect to ( 6300 block 29th SW residence ) where she watched him go inside .
Along the way she called 911 from her cell phone and gave information as to the suspect ’s location .
She also saw several people following the suspect on foot and told them to get in her car so that the suspect could not attack him .
Since several witnesses were watching the suspect ’s house , ( Witness A ) went back to the victim ’s location to see how she was .
She advised Officers at the scene that she witnessed the assault , saw where the suspect went , and could identify him .
She described the suspect as an Afrian American male , 20 to 25 years of age , wearing a black hooded sweatshirt with white lining , white T - shirt , brown sweatpants , and white shoes .
Officers arriving …. were told by several witnesses that the suspect had gone inside this residence and had not come out .
Officers surrounded the address and observed blood on the door handle to his residence .
As officers were surrounding the address , the suspect walked out of the house .
Officers asked the suspect if his name was Marcus and he said yes .
Officers observed blood and small cuts on the suspect ’s hands , and he was wearing a white T - shirt and brown pants .
Officer Emery placed the suspect under arrest and identified him as Marcus Combs … Spontaneously and without any questions from Officer Emery during the arrest , Combs stated aloud , “ The knife ?
It is on the kitchen table . ”
Officers asked if there was anyone else inside the residence , and he said there was a female inside .
Officers made exigent entry to check for potential additional victims of Combs .
They found no other occupants , but did note a bloody knife and a hooded sweatshirt matching the witness description in plain view .
Officer Rees picked ( Witness A ) up at the crime scene and transported her to the arrest scene to conduct a show - up .
Officers brought Combs into view and ( Witness A0 identified him as the suspect in the assault .
She noted that she recognized his face and his clothing except that he was no longer wearing the sweatshirt .
Detective … applied for and was granted a search warrant for the suspect ’s residence .
The SPD CSI Unit executed the warrant and processed the evidence and the crime scene .
They recovered the bloody knife and two sweatshirts from Combs ’ residence .
In addition to ( Witness A ) there were 14 other witnesses to this assault that came forward and identified themselves to officers .

And there is little sign of change among the next generation ; the paper system still thrives among middle and high school teams , where debate is more pastime than passion .
Switching to laptops is n’t as easy as it sounds — for example , organizing thousands of files to adjust strategy midspeech can take some getting used to , despite new software .
And then there is the sheer volume of backfiles that would need to be digitized .
Also , the transition means rule changes , as well as the obligation of familiarizing judges and opponents with your computer system so they can do the requisite examination of ( now digital ) evidence for credibility and accuracy .
Can there be fair competition with such radically different levels of technology used by competitors ?
“ Many people in the community think paperless wastes time , delays debates and gives an unfair advantage to the paperless team , ” according to the Georgia Debate Union at the University of Georgia , whose Web site offers “ Strategies for Success Against Paperless Teams . ”
Debaters , says Edward M. Panetta , a coach at the University of Georgia , “ are creatures of habit . ”
“ Their evidence is like a security blanket to them . ”
And , he worries , “ What happens if the file crashes ? ”
In the hyperprepared world of debate , no team wants to risk the possibility of technological failure .
Ryan Bass , a junior from Liberty University , in Lynchburg , Va. , recalls how he encountered the risks of paperless debating at a tournament in September .
In the middle of a critical argument , his partner ’s laptop flashed what he calls “ the blue screen of death ” and lost power .
By the time it rebooted , Liberty ’s carefully assembled argument had vanished .
“ It was the worst thing that could ever happen in a debate , ” he says .
Worse even “ than if the room had caught fire . ”
Introduction
It 's always good to see how technologies have changed the web .
Javascript framework , flash animation , new HTML and CSS standards and powerful web browsers have been completely changed the way we use the website .
Nowadays , most of the websites encourage user interaction , and due to the advance technologies that has made a lot of impossibilities possible , most of the websites provide greater user friendliness and usability .
Okay , the following is the list of famous websites .
I went to wayback machine and searched for those famous websites and take a screenshot of it in few years ago and also their current website .
Pretty impressive changes and very encouraging as they all are moving forward with all sort of new technologies .
I hope you will enjoy this post :)
Un juez federal de California desestimó este martes la demanda en contra del cineasta mexicano Guillermo del Toro , acusado de violación de derechos de autor por la historia en la que se basó la cinta ganadora del Oscar “ The Shape of Water " .
Familiares del fallecido ganador del premio Pulitzer , Paul Zindel , habían presentado la demanda a unos días de la entrega de los premios Oscar , en febrero pasado , con el argumento de que la cinta había plagiado una historia original del extinto autor .
Según el juez Percy Anderson , " aunque la obra ( de Zindel ) y la película comparten la premisa básica de que un empleado en una instalación científica decide liberar a una criatura sometida a experimentos científicos , ese concepto es demasiado general " .
El magistrado , que analizó aspectos como la trama , el escenario , los temas , el ritmo , los diálogos y los personajes en ambas obras , consideró que " no son sustancialmente similares " .
Asimismo , Anderson determinó que hay diferencias notables entre la película de Del Toro y la obra " Let Me Hear You Whisper " de Zindel , en especial , la relación del personaje principal de la película con la criatura .
" En la obra ( de Zindel ) , Helen no parece desarrollar un vínculo único con el delfín , más bien Helen desaprueba las pruebas con animales , lo que lleva a un deseo de salvar al delfín ” , señaló .
Por el contrario , el vínculo de Elisa , la protagonista de “ The Shape of Water " , con la criatura , " se desarrolla más lentamente , creciendo en afecto personal y luego amor " , comparó el juez .

While there is a dizzying array of technologies that have the “ NoSQL ” label applied to them , I ’m looking for one to replace a MySQL cluster .
This particular cluster has roughly a billion records in it , uses a few TB of disk space , and is growing all the time .
It is currently a MySQL master with several slaves and handles a fairly light query volume .
The reasons we ’d like to change it are :
ALTER TABLE takes an unreasonably long time , so we ca n’t add or removed indexes or columns .
Changes take over a month .
The data footprint is large enough that it requires RAID and we seem to be really good at breaking RAID controllers .
Queries are not very efficient , due partly to the underlying data organization , and due partly to the sheer amount of it compared to the available RAM .
The data really is n’t relational anymore , so a document store is more appropriate .
It ’s just that when it was set up , MySQL was the tool of choice for just about all data storage .
I ’ve spent some time looking around at several options , including MongoDB , CouchDB , and Cassandra .
And I like aspects of all of them .
If I could pick and choose features from all of them , here ’s what it might look like :
The high - level abstractions provided by CouchDB and MongoDB .
Cassandra makes you think more about low - level details and performance ( which can be good ) .
The performance of Cassandra .
By all accounts it is very fast and got faster in the 0.60 release .
A clear understanding of the performance and storage tradeoffs in various schema / indexing designs .
The “ no single point of failure ” and multi-machine replication and sharding features of Cassandra .
They ’re VERY compelling .
CouchDB Lounge is a step in the right direction , but I ’d rather see it as part of the core system .
Map / Reduce support for ad - doc data analysis and queries .
Persistent indexes to speed our most common queries .
Cassandra ’s feels very “ roll your own ” , which is consistent with the lower - level nature of Cassandra .
CouchDB ’s “ all views , all the time ” feels a bit odd too .
MongoDB seems to get this right , providing traditional indexes and support for more ad - hoc operations similar to CouchDB .
The documentation of MongoDB .
CouchDB is pretty good and there are books available .
Cassandra ’s docs require a bit more trial and error on the part of the developer as things change with each release .
A corporate entity that can provide support , consulting , and possibly custom development .
Both CouchDB and MongoDB have this .
Cassandra is more a community project , though the bulk of contributions come from developers employed by tech companies –none of them appear to be in the business of doing Cassandra .
I ’d love to be able to influence the organization of records on disk so that the most common queries will require very few seeks .
I ’d like to cluster around a particular key that may not be the primary key .
I can see ways to do this with Cassandra .
I ’m not sure about the low - level details of MongoDB or CouchDB .
I ’d love native compression for large text fields .
A substantial portion of our data in this cluster is text .
Full - Text indexing would be a nice to have .
We ’re pretty good with Sphinx already , but having reasonable full - text indexing integrated would simplify things .
A good Perl API .
Given all that , what else should I be looking at ?
What misconceptions do I have ?
What ’s your experience been with any or all of them ?

People who are resuscitated from near death often report strange sensory phenomena , such as memories “ flashing before their eyes . ”
Now a rare assessment of brain activity just before death offers clues about why such experiences occur .
Anesthesiologist Lakhmir Chawla of George Washington University Medical Center and his colleagues recently published a retrospective analysis of brain activity in seven sedated , critically ill patients as they were removed from life support .
Using EEG recordings of neural electrical activity , Chawla found a brief but significant spike at or near the time of death — despite a preceding loss of blood pressure and associated drop in brain activity .
“ To our knowledge , this is the first time that this event has been shown to occur , ” Chawla explains .
“ It occurs at a very peculiar time point , when most people would think your brain would physiologically die [ because of ] an absence of blood flow . ”
The jolts lasted 30 to 180 seconds and displayed properties that are normally associated with consciousness , such as extremely fast electrical oscillations known as gamma waves .
Soon after the activity abated , the patients were pronounced dead .
Chawla posits that the predeath spikes are most likely brief , “ last hurrah ” seizures originating in brain areas that were irritable from oxygen starvation .
Living nerve cells constantly maintain an electrical charge gradient , similar to the difference in charge on the poles of a battery .
Keeping up this polarity takes energy — in this case , energy created from oxygen .
As blood flow slows and oxygen runs out , the cells can no longer maintain polarity and they fire , causing a cascade of activity that ripples through the brain .
If these seizures were to occur in memory regions , they could ex­plain the vivid recollections often reported by people who are resuscitated from near death , Chawla says .
Further speculation is difficult because in these patients only the forebrain was monitored , notes Chawla , adding that the end of life is a poorly researched area .
Next he and his colleagues would like to use more sophisticated imaging on a larger patient population to assess the entire brain in greater detail during near - death episodes .
And they say that children can't concentrate any more .
Well , here 's a couple of crushing Bayern Munich goals perfectly reenacted by little Lego men , presumably courtesy of an eight - year - old boy , using just a simple pile of Lego , a Fisher Price film camera , and some very advanced editing equipment .
Well done , son .

That lovely message was joined by a Confederate flag and a license plate reading 14CV88 .
Seems random enough , right ?
Aha , but it 's not .
As commenters on various blogs pointed out , there 's a secret Nazi supremacist message in there .
The 14 stands for the fourteen words of the cutesy old David Lane adage " We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children . "
The CV stands for " Confederate veteran , " because apparently this truck owner is 172 years old .
And the 8s stand for the eighth letter of the alphabet , H. Doubled together they are Heil Hitler .
Yay , everyone !
Anyway , the Council on American - Islamic Relations noticed the secret message and pointed it out to the Virginia DMV , which is now banning the plates .
So , crusty old racist Civil War veteran P. Jackariah Biggsby is now driving around with illegal plates .
Well done , internet .
You made this happen .
Get this patriot off the road .

Oklahoma ’s ridiculous state lawmakers are trying to exempt themselves from federal law , saying their state does n’t need to adhere to the Matthew Shepard Act. States ’ rights !
So let ’s meet 24 - year - old Phillip Nelson , a college student who lives north of Tulsa , and says he was gay bashed while taking out the trash .
“ [… T ] hree men screamed ‘ faggot ’ and ‘ You ’re going to die ! ’ as they beat him while he took the trash out in his apartment complex late last month .
Nelson ’s assailants left him with cuts and bruises on his face and body .
And he said they broke into his apartment a few days later , ransacked it and scrawled ‘ fag ’ across the wall . [… ]
‘ I keep calling them [ the police ] and leaving voice mails but I never hear anything back , ’ Nelson said .
‘ No one ever returns my calls , which has me wondering if they ’re kind of trying to let this thing die out and go away , or if they are going to do anything about it . ' ”
Oklahoma does n’t cover sexual orientation within its own hate crimes laws .
DiA responds :
Andrew Sullivan thinks proponents of torture are motivated by vengeance and are more comfortable with the idea of torturing " them " as opposed to " us " .
There may be some truth to that , but I think if America legalised torture , even if only for specific situations , you would gradually see an erosion of the limits placed on the tactic .
As we said in a 2003 leader , " To legalise is to encourage . "
And , once the taboo is broken , why would n't torture proponents follow their argument to its logical conclusion : the widespread use of torture ?
But the taboo has been broken .
The premise of the broken taboo , moreover , is that the government can and should torture , even while torture is illegal .
This strikes me as far more dangerous .
The constant assertion of the government 's right to torture anyone it deems aware of " active threats " to the US with no acknowledgment that this means the rule of law is over ... carries consequences far greater than legalization and formal withdrawal from Geneva .
It gives the government no limits on what it can do ; it leaves the decisions about whom to torture to men not laws , it discredits the rule of law culturally , and requires massive hypocrisy , euphemism and outright lies as a critical part of our public discourse .
I find this more dangerous than outright legalization .
If we truly believe we have to become barbarians to defeat barbarians - and that is the Cheney view - then we should have the courage of our fascist convictions .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The rogue states are obviously troublesome , as they were during previous administrations .
Obama is hardly pretending that those problems do n't exist .
He mentioned yesterday that stronger economic sanctions against the Iranians ( which he is seeking ) might conceivably dissuade them from pursuing nukes , but , on the other hand , " Sanctions are n't a magic wand .
Unfortunately , nothing in international relations is ... Progress ( on all these issues ) will be halting .
And sometimes we 'll take one step forward and two steps back , and there will be frustrations .
And so it 's not going to run on the typical cable news 24/7 news cycle . "

After the best Hurley - centric episode in LOST ’s six - year run , I think there ’s only one thing we can say .
Dude .
I loved it .
It was all the joy and pain of a Hurley episode , set amidst the most profound depths of the Island enigma .
We got straightforward answers ( the whispers ) , escalating conflict ( Jack and Locke ’s impending monumental meeting ) and Hurley , breaking on through to the other side .
Plus , Desmond ran over Locke with his car .
Loved it .
Let ’s chat .
Alternate Hurley ’s got it all .
The adoration of his community , freedom from his curses and all the fried chicken he can eat .
But even with Pierre Chang – LOST ’s venerable narrator – extolling his virtues to a charity ball , Mrs. Reyes wanted more for her son : a girlfriend .
The donor of museum wings and consumer of chicken wings was without a wind beneath his own .
But his first blind date is a no- show , opening the door for his grand awakening .
He did n’t need a girl .
He neededgirl .
Libby , who drops the bombshell on him that he ( more innocently ) dropped on her in season two : “ I know you from somewhere . ”
But , this time , it ’s Hurley who ’s in the dark .
Though not completely .
While he wants to believe his new friend is a nut - job , he ca n’t quite commit to it .
Even after he sees his old friend Dr. Brooks shuttle her into the Santa Rosa short bus , he still holds out hope .
And when he visits Dr. Brooks and learns she is indeed certifiably insane , he drops $ 100 K to find out for himself .
Why ?
Because somewhere in the depths of his oversized , fast - beating heart , lies a soft - spot that transcends alternate realities ; an empathy for people who believe in themselves , even when they ’re told they ’re crazy .
And given the chance to explain , Libby does .
Her alternate life – plane crash , Island , their relationship and all – and the idea she can’t escape , that she knows him from somewhere .
Crazy as it sounds , he can’t dismiss it , and he asks for a date .
I thought it fitting that Libby served as the link Desmond needed .
Just as she bailed him out with a sailboat in their first interaction , this time , she left the door of “ what if ” cracked open .
And Desmond , the great awakener of souls , was there to pull it open a little further with some encouraging words at the chicken shack .
Libby gives an inch , Desmond takes a mile .
And Hurley takes a chance .
On their date , they kiss , and flashes of a fleeting love from a “ bizarro , alternate universe ” awaken Hurley .
The same hope for love that served as an epiphany for Desmond , Charlie and Faraday illuminates Hurley .
“ I do n’t think you ’re crazy , ” he reassures her , granting her the very same reassurance he so desperately sought himself in his Island life .
What is it about love that opens the gateway into alternate self recognition ?
We ’ve seen four characters experience the epiphany that a different version of themselves exists , and each has come to that realization only after experiencing “ real , consciousness - altering love . ”
Part of me wonders if it harkens back the “ constant ” concept .
Remember , Desmond was only able to ground his time - traveling conscious mind by anchoring it to Penny in two separate time periods .
Perhaps that constancy is what alternate souls also require for recognition , realization and reconciliation .
It is , after all , the most powerful of all emotions – or so my lame girlfriend tells me !
( Kidding , darling ) .
But it actually makes sense , on a not - totally - sappy level .
Love is a unique emotion , one of the few that can alter actual behavior .
We ’ve all had a friend who has been changed by a new love interest .
That ’s what ’s happening to these four gents , but on a much deeper , existential level .
That beach team , Jacob Bless
Them , is the most lost of all parties .
Between Richard ’s crisis of faith , Ilana ’s desperation , Jack ’s forced apathy , Hurley ’s wanderlust and Ben ’s dark cynicism , they ’re running around like chickens with their necks snapped off by John Locke .
Somebody needed to step up , and last night , Hurley wobbled up from his sitting position and took charge .
Dude .
You got some Ilana on you .
The more things change , the more they stay the same .
And any remaining hope that Richard and Ilana had a clue as to what to do got literally blown to pieces last night .
Pieces of Ilana .
Her carcass .
She died .
And rather unceremoniously , I might add .
Did you notice Hurley pick up that little bag from Ilana ’s stash ?
I think that was the bag of ashes Ilana collected from Jacob ’s fiery grave .
It seemed like that find empowered Hurley , imbuing him with a new brand of confidence .
And it showed .
The comic book clown did what nerds can only dream of – he dove into the narrative head - first and did what he wanted to do .
Enough following , enough reading , enough waiting .
Hurley will take it form here .
To establish ownership and dominance , dogs pee on things .
LOST characters , on the other hand , blow shit up .
Locke with his submarine , Jack with his tents , and now Hurley , with the Black Rock .
With the group ’s attention firmly fixed on him , Hurley then initiates his power play : a fake communion with Jacob complete with new instructions .
Even when Richard calls his bluff , Hurley stands his ground .
And the schism is thus formed .
Ben follows Richard , presumably out of habit .
Jack and Sun follow fellow candidate Hurley .
And Lapidus and Miles split up , in order to maintain the necessary “ one snarky guy ” quota required in all LOST sub - groupings .
Quick side note : did you catch that implication again ?
The one so eloquently worded by Widmore a few weeks back and reiterated by Richard tonight ?
When Richard and Widmore warn about the MIB ’s escape , they talk about the world being “ over , ” or “ ceasing to exist . ”
Not , “ everyone dies ” or “ we ’re all in trouble ” – but cease to exist .
I think this semantic subtlety is important .
One way or another , MIB ’s escape wipes out the existence and memories of a given timeline , a given reality .
Perhaps MIB ’s escape erases the storyline we ’ve seen for the past five years , and that ’s what some are trying to prevent .
Some , but not Desmond .
Maybe he ’s trying to circumvent that erasure by uploading everyone ’s minds into their more - perfect - world : alternate reality world .
Hey , it ’s midnight !
Post - schism , I loved the chat between Jack and the Fat Man .
Jack ’s “ fix - it ” fever seems to be breaking .
“ All I ’ve wanted was to fix it .
But I can ’t .
I ca n’t ever fix it ….
I think maybe that ’s the point .
Maybe I ’m supposed to let go . ”
Finally , Jack is learning to sit back and accept his fate .
The physician is healing himself of his worst addiction .
And even when Hurley doubted his own intuition and gave Jack a chance to take the lead , Jack bit his tongue .
He did n’t bite like he did with Ben ’s offer to “ fix ” the situation by reuniting the Oceanic Six .
He shut his trap , sat back and trusted Hurley .
Perhaps this is the revelation , the acceptance , that Jacob has been waiting for Jack to realize .
Maybe new humble Jack is ready to do what Jacob needs .
About damn time .
Hurley ’s right to hate Michael Dawson for killing his woman .
But last night , Michael attempted to atone .
Visiting in ghost form , Michael attempted to guide Hurley in his new quest for leadership .
And I think he served as an important “ anchor ” or “ touchstone ” for Hurley .
Just as Libby burst into Hurley ’s alternate life , she was also carefully woven into his Island story , thanks to Michael ’s continued ghostly presence .
If my earlier “ constant ” theory is to be believed , Michael helped Hurley establish Libby as a necessary facet of his Island life , a touchstone he needed in order to “ break through ” in his alternate life .
And Michael also did us the favor of confirming the nature of the “ whispers , ” one of LOST ’s oldest mysteries .
They belong to people who are trapped on the Island , who “ ca n’t move on ” because of the horrible things they ’ve done .
For Michael , that crime was murdering Libby and Ana Lucia .
But back up .
Did n’t Christian Shephard appear to Michael just before the Kahana exploded and tell him he “ could go now ” ?
( Yes , he did . )
Why would Christian tell Michael he was absolved , or freed to move on , if the Island was just going to ensnare him for eternity ?
Also , what a cruel punishment to relegate Michael to merely whispering “ Waaaaalt , ” thus denying the other whisper - prisoners an eternity of hearing that young man ’s named yelled gratingly at the top of his lungs .
For shame .
Sorry , I digressed .
But what ’s with Christian , Michael and the Whisperers ?
Perhaps Christian is one of them – their leader , perhaps – and he manipulated Michael into death in order to recruit him to his team .
Why though ?
What purpose do these people serve ?
Quick theory : they ’re held in Island purgatory , made to guide the Island ’s inhabitants down a righteous path , and if they succeed , they ’re free .
Christian Shephard .
I know we ’re not done with him .
I hope that whatever they use to explain him also explains this new legion of whisper spirits .
The more I think about them , the more intrigued I become .
Flocke began the night by giving his own version of Jack ’s Season One sermon on the beach .
Only this time , it ’s Leave Together , Die Alone .
He explains that they must leave in the same way they entered – together .
The other candidates are needed in order to complete his escape .
But that ’ll have to wait for another day , because Flocke has bigger fish to fry , brother .
Sayid shows his package to Locke .
Wait , let me rephrase that .
Sayid brings “ the package ” ( Desmond ) to Locke .
And like a checkers player that just got kinged , Flocke licks his chops at the possibilities of his new weapon .
But Desmond , still aloof , proves enigmatic and unafraid .
So Flocke continues the great trend of Season Six .
“ Let me show you something , ” he says to the man who has a whole flight manifest of people he , himself , needs to show something in an alternate universe .
( I just reread that sentence .
The hell ? ) .
If anything upset me about last night , it was the realization that we have n’t had enough Desmond - Locke scenes .
Man , they ’re great together .
And by escalator , I mean Island .
En route to the well , we see another vision of ( presumably ) the same kid that showed himself to Sawyer and Flocke earlier in the season .
But holy crap , this kid ages faster than Walt !
Waaaaalt !
I like this kid .
I like his knowing smile , the way he just seems to take pleasure in throwing Flocke off his game .
When Desmond asked who the kid was , Flocke bristled and insisted they moved on .
The kid smiled widely , as if everything is going according to plan .
As if he took joy in inciting anger within Flocke .
And who likes making Flocke angry ?
Jacob .
I want to believe that kid is an apparition of younger Jacob .
I also want to believe he ’s the aging apparition of some higher entity – a boss or a referee in Jacob and MIB ’s cosmic chess match .
And I go back and forth on these things .
But hear this – had the boy ’s only appearance been the one earlier this season , I could ’ve written him off .
But last night marked his second appearance , and I therefore deem him “ probably important , ” which is one of the highest honors I can bestow on a character .
Flocke ’s speech to Desmond at the well is an instant classic .
I loved Desmond 's pacifist aloofness throughout the episode , and he brought it to a boil at the well .
Flocke tried to scare him by showing how deep the well was , and Desmond did n’t flinch .
He tried to impress him wiht the history of the well , and Desmond laughed him off .
He tried to badmouth Widmore and pit Desmond against him , to no avail .
He even tried to freak him out by hinting at a Swan - like electromagnetic anomaly beneath the well , but quickly saw that nothing was getting through .
“ Why are n’t you afraid ? ” Flocke finally asks Desmond .
He needed to know , because fear is the easiest emotion for Flocke to exploit .
The MIB probably knows how special Desmond is , and knows that if he can get him on his side , he ’s got the upper hand .
But Desmond is n’t flinching .
He ’s not giving him anything to exploit .
At every turn , Desmond shuts the door .
And Flocke wants to know why , and how , Desmond can do that .
“ Why are n’t you afraid ( damn it ! ) ?
” “ What ’s the point in being afraid ? ” asks Desmond .
Flustered Flocke flings Desmond down the well and walks off .
( “ That ’s the point , you arrogant , time - traveling bastard ! ” ) .
So why was n’t Desmond afraid ?
I think it ’s because he just does n’t care .
Let me put it this way .
If you knew that there was a version of you , somewhere , that was being put through torturous paces , caught in the middle of an age - old pissing match between entities you did n’t comprehend , and you knew that every attempt at betterment you made was futile , would you care if he was thrown down a well ?
I would n’t .
Not if I was simultaneously , consciously aware of an alternate existence where I was rich , powerful , well - liked and had just met the girl of my dreams .
I think that ’s the explanation of Desmond ’s uncaring attitude .
He ’s willing to sacrifice his Island self , because he ’s making his alternate self into the Desmond Hume he wants to be .
One flaw in this logic : baby Charlie .
He does n’t exist in the alternate timeline ; so Desmond would then be betting that he could “ recreate ” ( giggity ) his son with Penny in his new , alternate life .
We ’ll see what becomes of Desmond in that well , but I do n’t think it ’s going anywhere good .
The good news is , I do n’t think it matters .
Because in the world that matters to Desmond , revenge is already his .
I loved Hurley leading his group to “ talk ” with Flocke .
I love it and believe in it more than Hurley does , actually .
And I thought the convergence of these two camps was , in a way , a metaphor for the way our two realities are beginning to converge .
Finally , the show that ca n’t keep all its characters in the same time / place / space / universe is putting all the cards ( characters ) on the table ( campsite ) .
At the end of the scene , Locke muttered , “ Hello , Jack , ” with the same inflection and casualness he did in Season One .
But this time around , the meeting ’s going to be a lot uglier .
Jack and Locke , reunited , for one last battle between faith and science .
That ’ll be a good one .
Then Desmond hit Locke with his car .
So that happened .
Desmond , violating Megan ’s law to the disgust of Dr. Linus , watches John Locke wheel his way around the grounds of the middle school .
He guns it and plows into poor , helpless alternate Locke .
And we left “ Everybody Loves Hugo ” with almost the identical shot that opened John Locke ’s first episode , Walkabout , in which it was revealed he was paralyzed .
A glorious ending to a glorious scene , but why did that just happen ?
My answer to that assumes that Desmond is consciously experiencing both realities , at the same time .
Get that ?
He ’s aware of what ’s happening to him on the Island , and just as aware of his conversation with Hurley at Mr. Clucks .
Desmond told the MIB last night that he believed him to be John Locke .
“ Of course I know you who you are . ” I do n’t think that was a bluff .
I do n’t think Desmond knew who he was dealing with .
But after Flocke ’s desperate attempts at fear - mongering and his violent Scot - Toss , Desmond knew he was not a good guy .
So what the Island Desmond learned , the Alternate Desmond also learned .
And Alternate Desmond knew he had to even the score by taking out Alternate Locke .
So he hit him with his car .
But he did n’t kill him .
Probably .
At the very least , he did n’t seem to care if Locke was killed or maimed .
He just wanted to hurt him .
And that ’s where this gets tricky .
If Desmond had killed Locke , I would ’ve assumed that he did it in order to prevent MIB from “ escaping ” into Alternate Locke ’s body or using it for some sinister purpose .
But he did n’t kill him , he just messed him up real bad .
Why ?
Well here ’s a stab at it .
Most people in the Alternate World have it better than their Island counterpart .
Yeah , they ’ve got some shortcomings , but mostly they ’re better off .
So most of our characters would gladly ditch their Island selves in favor of their Alternate selves , right ?
Right .
But some of the Island souls are “ claimed . ” Locke , Sayid , Claire .
If I ’m Desmond , I do n’t want these claimed souls making their way into my Alternate Universe Utopia .
So perhaps Desmond – in addition to awakening good souls like Hurley – is on a mission to maim and disparage the vessels of those whose souls have been claimed on the Island .
Desmond learned that Locke was evil on the Island , so he went after him , aiming to create an undesirable vessel into which Island Locke could escape .
By that logic , he ’d need to also “ mess with ” Alternate Sayid and Alternate Claire ( d’oh !
If only he ’d known that when he saw her in the airport ) .
Yeah , it ’s a long - shot , I realize it .
But I ’ve been up for 20 straight hours and flew halfway across the country today , so you ’ll read it and like it .
And if you think you can do better , I ’d like to hear you try .
No , seriously .
I was n’t being a sarcastic jerk .
Click on “ comments ” and let ’s discuss what Desmond ’s rundown of Locke meant to his overall mission , and any other thoughts you had on the episode .
In the meantime , I ’m gonna hit the hay .
Namaste .
Charlie
Every iteration of the iPhone ’s mockups showed the time as 9:42 .
The iPad showed it as 9:41 .
It ’s slightly peculiar –the times are grouped tightly enough to be intentional , but why those numbers ?
Why not 9:00 ?
Network World investigated .
Turns out Apple ‘s keynote organizers think about this stuff right down to the tiniest detail–and this is certainly one of the tinier details .
They rehearse the presentation with Steve Jobs , Phil Schiller , and whoever else will be speaking , and time it so the big announcement comes 40 minutes in .
They add a couple minutes to be on the safe side .
That means that when Apple puts that most important slide up , the one introducing the new hardware , the time on the static image of the device will be damned close to the time the packed room of journalists sees it for the first time .
It ’s just one more example of how carefully Apple prepares everything –that ’s a detail we did n’t know about until a couple days ago , and they ’ve been doing it for years , with no fanfare .
Very cool , right ?
Since 2007 , every new U.S. passport has been outfitted with a computer chip .
Embedded in the back cover of the passport , the " e- passport " contains biometric data , electronic fingerprints and pictures of the holder , and a wireless radio frequency identification ( RFID ) transmitter .
Although the system was designed to operate at close range , hackers were able to access it from afar -- until research by Prof.
Avishai Wool of Tel Aviv University 's School of Electrical Engineering helped ensure that the computer chip in American e-passports could be read only when the passport is opened .
The research has been cited by organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Now , a new study from Prof .
Wool finds serious security drawbacks in similar chips that are being embedded in credit , debit and " smart " cards .
The vulnerabilities of this electronic approach -- and the vulnerability of the private information contained in the chips -- are becoming more acute .
Using simple devices constructed from $ 20 disposable cameras and copper cooking - gas pipes , Prof .
Wool and his students Yossi Oren and Dvir Schirman have demonstrated how easily the cards ' radio frequency ( RF ) signals can be disrupted .
The work will be presented at the IEEE RFID conference in Orlando , FL , this month .
More than one way to hack a chip
Prof .
Wool 's most recent research centers on the new " e- voting " technology being implemented in Israel .
" We show how the Israeli government 's new system based on the RFID chip is a very risky approach for security reasons .
It allows hackers who are not much more than amateurs to break the system , " Prof .
Wool explains .
" One way to catch hackers , criminals and terrorists is by thinking like one . "
In his lab , Prof .
Wool constructed an attack mechanism -- an RFID " zapper " -- from a disposable camera .
Replacing the camera 's bulb with an RFID antenna , he showed how the EMP ( electro - magnetic pulse ) signal produced by the camera could destroy the data on nearby RFID chips such as ballots , credit cards or passports .
" In a voting system , this would be the equivalent of burning ballots -- but without the fire and smoke , " he says .
Another attack involves jamming the radio frequencies that read the card .
Though the card 's transmissions are designed to be read by antennae no more than two feet distant , Prof .
Wool and his students demonstrated how the transmissions can be jammed by a battery - powered transmitter 20 yards away .
This means that an attacker can disable an entire voting station from across the street .
Similarly , a terror group could " jam " passport systems at U.S. border controls relatively easily , he suggests .
The most insidious type of attack is the " relay attack . "
In this scenario , the voting station assumes it is communicating with an RFID ballot near it &#mdash ; but it 's easy for a hacker or terrorist to make equipment that can trick it .
Such an attack can be used to transfer votes from party to party and nullify votes to undesired parties , Prof .
Wool demonstrates .
A relay attack may also be used to allow a terrorist to cross a border using someone else 's e-passport .
How to make " smart cards " smarter
" All the new technologies we have now seem really cool .
But when anything like this first comes onto the market , it will be fraught with security holes , " Prof .
Wool warns .
" In America the Federal government poured a lot of money into e-voting , only to discover later that the deployed systems were vulnerable .
Over the last few years we 've seen a trend back towards systems with paper trails as a result . "
But there are some small steps that can be taken to make smart cards smarter , says Prof.
Wool .
The easiest one is to shield the card with something as simple as aluminium foil to insulate the e-transmission .
In the case of e-voting , a ballot box could be made of conductive materials .
The State Department has already taken Prof .
Wool 's advice : since 2007 , they 've also added conductive fibres to the back of every American passport .

I REMEMBER WELL A SUMMER MORNING in about 1950 when my father sent a hired man with a McCormick High Gear No. 9 mowing machine and a team of mules to the field I was mowing with our nearly new Farmall A .
That memory is a landmark in my mind and my history .
I had been born into the way of farming represented by the mule team , and I loved it .
I knew irresistibly that the mules were good ones .
They were stepping along beautifully at a rate of speed in fact only a little slower than mine .
But now I saw them suddenly from the vantage point of the tractor , and I remember how fiercely I resented their slowness .
I saw them as “ in my way . ”
This is not an exceptional or a remarkably dramatic bit of history .
I recite it to confirm that the industrialization of agriculture is a part of my familiar experience .
I do n’t have the privilege of looking at it as an outsider .
We were mowing that morning , the teamster with his mules and I with the tractor , in the field behind the barn on my father ’s home place , where he and before him his father had been born , and where his father had died in February of 1946 .
The old way of farming was intact in my grandfather ’s mind until the day he died at eighty - two .
He had worked mules all his life , understood them thoroughly , and loved the good ones passionately .
He knew tractors only from a distance , he had seen only a few of them , and he rejected them out of hand because he thought , correctly , that they compacted the soil .
Even so , four years after his death his grandson ’s sudden resentment of the “ slow ” mule team foretold what history would bear out : the tractor would stay and the mules would go .
Year after year , agriculture would be adapted more and more to the technology and the processes of industry and to the rule of industrial economics .
This transformation occurred with astonishing speed because , by the measures it set for itself , it was wonderfully successful .
It “ saved labor , ” it conferred the prestige of modernity , and it was highly productive .
During the fourteen years after 1950 I was much away from home , though I never entirely departed from farming or at least from thoughts of farming , and my affection for my homeland remained strong .
In 1964 my family and I returned to Kentucky and settled on a hillside farm in my native community , where we have continued to live .
Perhaps because I was a returned traveler intending to stay , I now saw the place more clearly than before .
I saw it critically , too , for it was evident at once that the human life of the place , the life of the farms and the farming community , was in decline .
The old self - sufficient way of farming was passing away .
The economic prosperity that had visited the farmers briefly during World War II and for a few years afterward had ended .
The little towns that once had been social and economic centers , thronged with country people on Saturdays and Saturday nights , were losing out to the bigger towns and the cities .
The rural neighborhoods , once held together by common memories , common work , and the sharing of help , had begun to dissolve .
There were no longer local markets for chickens or eggs or cream .
The spring lamb industry , once a staple of the region , was gone .
The tractors and other mechanical devices certainly were saving the labor of the farmers and farmhands who had moved away , but those who had stayed were working harder and longer than ever .
THE EFFECTS OF THE PROCESS OF INDUSTRIALIZATION have become so apparent , so numerous , so favorable to the agribusiness corporations , and so unfavorable to everything else , that by now the questions troubling me and a few others in the ’60s and ’ 70s are being asked everywhere .
It has become increasingly clear that the way we farm affects the local community , and that the economy of the local community affects the way we farm ; that the way we farm affects the health and integrity of the local ecosystem , and that the farm is intricately dependent , even economically , upon the health of the local ecosystem .
We can no longer pretend that agriculture is a sort of economic machine with interchangeable parts , the same everywhere , determined by “ market forces ” and independent of everything else .
We are not farming in a specialist capsule or a professionalist department ; we are farming in the world , in a webwork of dependences and influences probably more intricate than we will ever understand .
It has become clear , in short , that we have been running our fundamental economic enterprise by the wrong rules .
We were wrong to assume that agriculture could be adequately defined by reductionist science and determinist economics .
It is no longer possible to deny that context exists and is an issue .
If you can keep the context narrow enough ( and the accounting period short enough ) , then the industrial criteria of labor saving and high productivity seem to work well .
But the old rules of ecological coherence and of community life have remained in effect .
The costs of ignoring them have accumulated , until now the boundaries of our reductive and mechanical explanations have collapsed .
Their collapse reveals , plainly enough for all to see , the ecological and social damages they were meant to conceal .
It will seem paradoxical to some that the national and global corporate economies have narrowed the context for thinking about agriculture , but it is merely the truth .
Those large economies , in their understanding and in their accounting , have excluded any concern for the land and the people .
Now , in the midst of so much unnecessary human and ecological destruction , we are facing the necessity of a new start in agriculture .
THE TRACTOR ’S ARRIVAL HAD SIGNALED , among other things , agriculture ’s shift from an almost exclusive dependence on free solar energy to a total dependence on costly fossil fuel .
But in 1950 , like most people at that time , I was years away from the first inkling of the limits of the supply of cheap fuel .
We had entered an era of limitlessness , or the illusion thereof , and this in itself is a sort of wonder .
My grandfather lived a life of limits , both suffered and strictly observed , in a world of limits .
I learned much of that world from him and others , and then I changed ; I entered the world of labor - saving machines and of limitless cheap fossil fuel .
It would take me years of reading , thought , and experience to learn again that in this world limits are not only inescapable but indispensable .
Mechanical farming makes it easy to think mechanically about the land and its creatures .
It makes it easy to think mechanically even about oneself , and the tirelessness of tractors brought a new depth of weariness into human experience , at a cost to health and family life that has not been fully accounted .
Once one ’s farm and one ’s thoughts have been sufficiently mechanized , industrial agriculture ’s focus on production , as opposed to maintenance or stewardship , becomes merely logical .
And here the trouble completes itself .
The almost exclusive emphasis on production permits the way of working to be determined not by the nature and character of the farm in its ecosystem and in its human community , but rather by the national or the global economy and the available or affordable technology .
The farm and all concerns not immediately associated with production have in effect disappeared from sight .
The farmer too in effect has vanished .
He is no longer working as an independent and loyal agent of his place , his family , and his community , but instead as the agent of an economy that is fundamentally adverse to him and to all that he ought to stand for .
THE WORD “ HUSBANDRY ” IS THE NAME of a connection .
In its original sense , it is the name of the work of a domestic man , a man who has accepted a bondage to the household .
To husband is to use with care , to keep , to save , to make last , to conserve .
Old usage tells us that there is a husbandry also of the land , of the soil , of the domestic plants and animals — obviously because of the importance of these things to the household .
And there have been times , one of which is now , when some people have tried to practice a proper human husbandry of the nondomestic creatures , in recognition of the dependence of our households and domestic life upon the wild world .
Husbandry is the name of all the practices that sustain life by connecting us conservingly to our places and our world ; it is the art of keeping tied all the strands in the living network that sustains us .
Most and perhaps all of industrial agriculture ’s manifest failures appear to be the result of an attempt to make the land produce without husbandry .
The attempt to remake agriculture as a science and an industry has excluded from it the age - old husbandry which was central and essential to it .
This effort had its initial and probably its most radical success in separating farming from the economy of subsistence .
Through World War II , farm life in my region ( and , I think , nearly everywhere ) rested solidly upon the garden , dairy , poultry flock , and meat animals that fed the farm ’s family .
Especially in hard times farm families , and their farms , survived by means of their subsistence economy .
The industrial program , on the contrary , suggested that it was “ uneconomic ” for a farm family to produce its own food ; the effort and the land would be better applied to commercial production .
The result is utterly strange in human experience : farm families that buy everything they eat at the store .
An intention to replace husbandry with science was made explicit in the renaming of disciplines in the colleges of agriculture .
“ Soil husbandry ” became “ soil science , ” and “ animal husbandry ” became “ animal science . ”
This change is worth lingering over because of what it tells us about our susceptibility to poppycock .
Purporting to increase the sophistication of the humble art of farming , this change in fact brutally oversimplifies it .
“ Soil science , ” as practiced by soil scientists , and even more as it has been handed down to farmers , has tended to treat the soil as a lifeless matrix in which “ soil chemistry ” takes place and “ nutrients ” are “ made available . ”
And this , in turn , has made farming increasingly shallow — literally so — in its understanding of the soil .
The modern farm is understood as a surface on which various mechanical operations are performed , and to which various chemicals are applied .
The undersurface reality of organisms and roots is mostly ignored .
“ Soil husbandry ” is a different kind of study , involving a different kind of mind .
Soil husbandry leads , in the words of Sir Albert Howard , to understanding “ health in soil , plant , animal , and man as one great subject . ”
We apply the word “ health ” only to living creatures , and to soil husbandry a healthy soil is a wilderness , mostly unstudied and unknown , but teemingly alive .
The soil is at once a living community of creatures and their habitat .
The farm ’s husband , its family , its crops and animals , all are members of the soil community ; all belong to the character and identity of the place .
To rate the farm family merely as “ labor ” and its domestic plants and animals merely as “ production ” is thus an oversimplification , both radical and destructive .
“ Science ” is too simple a word to name the complex of relationships and connections that compose a healthy farm — a farm that is a full membership of the soil community .
The husbandry of mere humans , of course , cannot be complex enough either .
But husbandry always has understood that what is husbanded is ultimately a mystery .
A farmer , as one of his farmer correspondents once wrote to Liberty Hyde Bailey , is “ a dispenser of the ‘ Mysteries of God . ' ”
The mothering instinct of animals , for example , is a mystery that husbandry must use and trust mostly without understanding .
The husband , unlike the “ manager ” or the would - be objective scientist , belongs inherently to the complexity and the mystery that is to be husbanded , and so the husbanding mind is both careful and humble .
Husbandry originates precautionary sayings like “ Do n ’t put all your eggs into one basket ” and “ Do n’t count your chickens before they hatch . ”
It does not boast of technological feats that will “ feed the world . ”
Husbandry , which is not replaceable by science , nevertheless uses science , and corrects it too .
It is the more comprehensive discipline .
To reduce husbandry to science , in practice , is to transform agricultural “ wastes ” into pollutants , and to subtract perennials and grazing animals from the rotation of crops .
Without husbandry , the agriculture of science and industry has served too well the purpose of the industrial economy in reducing the number of landowners and the self - employed .
It has transformed the United States from a country of many owners to a country of many employees .
Without husbandry , “ soil science ” too easily ignores the community of creatures that live in and from , that make and are made by , the soil .
Similarly , “ animal science ” without husbandry forgets , almost as a requirement , the sympathy by which we recognize ourselves as fellow creatures of the animals .
It forgets that animals are so called because we once believed them to be endowed with souls .
Animal science has led us away from that belief or any such belief in the sanctity of animals .
It has led us instead to the animal factory which , like the concentration camp , is a vision of Hell .
Animal husbandry , on the contrary , comes from and again leads to the psalmist ’s vision of good grass , good water , and the husbandry of God .
Agriculture must mediate between nature and the human community , with ties and obligations in both directions .
To farm well requires an elaborate courtesy toward all creatures , animate and inanimate .
It is sympathy that most appropriately enlarges the context of human work .
Contexts become wrong by being too smallâ€ ” too small , that is , to contain the scientist or the farmer or the farm family or the local ecosystem or the local communityâ€ ” and this is crucial .
“ Out of context , ” as Wes Jackson has said , “ the best minds do the worst damage . ”
OUR RECENT FOCUS UPON PRODUCTIVITY , genetic and technological uniformity , and global trade — all supported by supposedly limitless supplies of fuel , water , and soil — has obscured the necessity for local adaptation .
But our circumstances are changing rapidly now , and this requirement will be forced upon us again by terrorism and other kinds of political violence , by chemical pollution , by increasing energy costs , by depleted soils , aquifers , and streams , and by the spread of exotic weeds , pests , and diseases .
We are going to have to return to the old questions about local nature , local carrying capacities , and local needs .
And we are going to have to resume the breeding of plants and animals to fit the region and the farm .
The same obsessions and extravagances that have caused us to ignore the issue of local adaptation have caused us to ignore the issue of form .
These two issues are so closely related that it is difficult to talk about one without talking about the other .
During the half century and more of our neglect of local adaptation , we have subjected our farms to a radical oversimplification of form .
The diversified and reasonably self - sufficient farms of my region and of many other regions have been conglomerated into larger farms with larger fields , increasingly specialized , and subjected increasingly to the strict , unnatural linearity of the production line .
But the first requirement of a form is that it must be comprehensive ; it must not leave out something that essentially belongs within it .
The form of the farm must answer to the farmer ’s feeling for the place , its creatures , and its work .
It is a never - ending effort of fitting together many diverse things .
It must incorporate the lifecycle and the fertility cycles of animals .
It must bring crops and livestock into balance and mutual support .
It must be a pattern on the ground and in the mind .
It must be at once ecological , agricultural , economic , familial , and neighborly .
Soon the majority of the world ’s people will be living in cities .
We are now obliged to think of so many people demanding the means of life from the land , to which they will no longer have a practical connection , and of which they will have little knowledge .
We are obliged also to think of the consequences of any attempt to meet this demand by large - scale , expensive , petroleum - dependent technological schemes that will ignore local conditions and local needs .
The problem of renewing husbandry , and the need to promote a general awareness of everybody ’s agricultural responsibilities , thus becomes urgent .
How can we restore a competent husbandry to the minds of the world ’s producers and consumers ?
This effort is already in progress on many farms and in many urban consumer groups scattered across our country and the world .
But we must recognize too that this effort needs an authorizing focus and force that would grant it a new legitimacy , intellectual rigor , scientific respectability , and responsible teaching .
There are many reasons to hope that this might be supplied by our colleges of agriculture .
The effort of husbandry is partly scientific but it is entirely cultural ; and a cultural initiative can exist only by becoming personal .
It will become increasingly clear , I believe , that agricultural scientists will need to work as indwelling members of agricultural communities or of consumer communities .
It is not irrational to propose that a significant number of these scientists should be farmers , and so subject their scientific work , and that of their colleagues , to the influence of a farmer ’s practical circumstances .
Along with the rest of us , they will need to accept all the imperatives of husbandry as the context of their work .
We cannot keep things from falling apart in our society if they do not cohere in our minds and in our lives .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The United States should consider raising taxes to help bring deficits under control and may need to consider a European - style value - added tax , White House adviser Paul Volcker said on Tuesday .
Volcker , answering a question from the audience at a New York Historical Society event , said the value - added tax “ was not as toxic an idea ” as it has been in the past and also said a carbon or other energy - related tax may become necessary .
Though he acknowledged that both were still unpopular ideas , he said getting entitlement costs and the U.S. budget deficit under control may require such moves .
“ If at the end of the day we need to raise taxes , we should raise taxes , ” he said .
Record numbers of alleged mass murderers and torturers have found safe haven in the UK , making this country one of the war criminal capitals of the world , it is claimed today .
Among the war crimes suspects living in Britain are senior officials from the regime of Saddam Hussein , a member of the Criminal Investigations Department in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe , and a Congolese police chief who confessed to a crime during a media interview .
But although the Home Office has handed the names of 51 suspects to the Metropolitan Police , not a single case has been prosecuted in the UK courts .
A further 500 suspects uncovered in the past five years have been refused residency or immigration and refugee status because of government concerns over their involvement in war crimes .
The new figures , obtained by the Aegis Trust , a human rights group which campaigns against genocide , after a question from the Tory MP Stephen Crabb , a member of the House of Commons International Development Committee , paints a picture of Britain fast becoming the destination of choice for war criminals on the run .
They suggest that despite laws brought in to tackle war criminals living in the UK , little has been done to bring perpetrators to justice .
Nick Donovan , head of campaigns at the Aegis Trust , last night compared the profile of war crimes prosecutions to that of white - collar crime .
He said : " The time has now come to enforce the law .
It 's like white - collar crime such as insider trading in shares .
You need arrests to prove that the law is a credible deterrent .
We urge the Home Office to resource these investigations properly and consider resurrecting the specialist war crimes unit at Scotland Yard . "
The Metropolitan Police 's specialist war crimes unit was shut in 1999 after cases were closed into the prosecution of the few surviving Nazi suspects living in the UK .
But genocide and war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia , Rwanda , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Somalia and Darfur have reignited fears that war criminals escape justice by fleeing to the UK .
Although there have been recent examples of suspected war criminals being arrested in the UK , these all relate to extradition hearings following warrants for arrests being issued by other countries and will end in prosecutions abroad .
The Government enacted new war crimes legislation nine years ago which gave the courts the power to try suspects accused of committing war crimes overseas .
To date only one British soldier has been convicted under this legislation .
In 2004 only three war crimes cases were referred to Scotland Yard for further investigation by the UK Border Agency ( UKBA ) out of a total of 47 files .
By last year the number of the suspects referred to the police had risen to 18 amid a total of 143 suspicious cases .
By the end of February this year the UKBA had passed on a further eight names .
Among the most controversial cases to be considered are four Rwandans – Vincent Bajinya , Celestin Ugirashebuja , Charles Munyaneza and Emmanuel Nteziryayo – arrested in 2006 at their homes across Britain on suspicion of playing key roles in the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 .
All four denied wrongdoing .
Mr Ugirashebuja was detained after he was traced by The Independent to Walton - on - the - Naze in Essex , where had been living since 2000 and finding employment as a care worker .
A decision by the then Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , to allow them to be extradited was thrown out by the High Court in April last year after judges ruled there was " a real risk they would suffer a flagrant denial of justice " if returned to Rwanda .
That ruling sparked calls for urgent reform after critics said it confirmed Britain 's status as a " safe haven " from justice because suspects could neither be sent home to face trial nor face prosecution in the UK for any offence pre-dating 2001 .
Today the 2001 bar to prosecutions will be lifted allowing suspects to be brought to trial for alleged war crimes dating back to 1991 .
Mr Donovan said : " These laws must be enforced .
If not , Britain will remain a safe haven .
In the 1980s and 1990s big efforts were make by the US , Canada , the UK and France and we have slowly realised that there are suspects living here from Rwanda , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Afghanistan .
But it has taken those Western countries a long time to wake up these issues . "
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said : " The Metropolitan Police Service has a group of officers who are the first point of contact for allegations of war crimes received .
Information is dealt with appropriately on a case by case basis when accessing allegations of offences to secure corroboration evidence available in this country to meet the threshold for a charge to be brought . "
A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said last night : " The changes to the law will allow offences committed since 1991 to be considered by the CPS after the police have investigated the suspected crime and passed a file of evidence to us .
We have agreed a protocol with the Metropolitan Police on how to deal with cases of suspected war crimes . "
Living in the UK : Wanted abroad
Celestin Ugirashebuja
Care worker , 56 , from Walton - on - the - Naze , Essex .
Faces accusations of having been a bourgmestre , or local mayor , in the rural commune of Kigoma .
In 1994 , he allegedly chaired meetings in which he exhorted the killing of Tutsis .
At one village he is accused of using his authority to persuade Tutsi residents to return home , after which they were all slaughtered .
He denies any wrongdoing .
Emmanuel Nteziryayo
Jobless father of five children , who lives in Manchester .
Now 51 , he is accused of handing out weapons and overseeing roadblocks in Mudasomwa commune , where he was mayor .
Prosecution files claim he once drove Tutsis to a police station to be killed .
He claimed asylum when he arrived in Britain and was granted leave to remain .
He denies any wrongdoing .
Vincent Bajinya
At 48 , Bajinya is the most senior of the alleged Rwandan " genocidaires " and is rated as a " category one " offender by the Kigali authorities .
A medical doctor , he came to Britain and began working for a charity in London helping victims of torture .
After he gained British citizenship , Bajinya changed his name to Vincent Brown .
He denies any wrongdoing .
Charles Munyaneza
A 51 - year - old cleaner from Bedford accused of organising the training of Interahamwe militias in his commune in southern Rwanda .

Being able to communicate effectively with clients is easily one of the most important aspects of being a web designer .
The communication process starts immediately as you ’ll need to learn what the client wants and expects from you , and as you get to know more about their business .
The need for communication will continue through every phase of the design process as you and the client work together to create a site that will be effective for the business .
After the design is completed , it ’s likely that you ’ll provide some customer support at least occasionally , so the need for good communication will always exist .
In this article we ’ll take a detailed look at the topic of communicating with clients .
Many of the tips that are mentioned can apply to communication in general , but the article comes specifically from the perspective of a designer / client relationship .
1. Start with a Solid Foundation
Communication is of critical importance during the early stages of the client process .
At this time you will need to get to know the client ’s business as well as possible .
You ’ll want to understand the products and services that they offer , their corporate culture , and what makes them unique to their customers .
Additionally , you should get a solid understanding of their customers and what they will be looking for when they arrive at the website .
It ’s also important to understand the client ’s specific goals for the website , what they wish to improve ( if it ’s a re-design ) and what they need to get out of the site .
By taking the time up front to communicate with the client and to build this solid foundation for the project you can save time and avoid miscommunication later .
It ’s a good idea to have some sort of intake process that you go through with clients to get through this stage , it can help to make sure that you do n’t miss out on any important points .
Some clients may be hesitant to dedicate much time before the project begins for this type of communication .
When that is the case it can be helpful to explain that all of this is important in order for you to give them a website that will truly work for their business and for their customers .
Emphasize that taking this time up front can help to make the process smoother and quicker , and to avoid costly mistakes .
2. Have a Method or a System
In the previous point I mentioned that it is a good idea to have a standard process for client intake .
In addition , it ’s also helpful to have a method or system for client communication beyond that point .
If you are just responding to emails or phone calls as they come in with no records or organization , chances are you could benefit from putting a system in place .
If you ’re working with several clients at one time it can be very challenging to remember exactly what was said by which client and what was done at different points .
There is no right or wrong method , but you could consider using a resource that is intended for customer service ( see our post 12 CRM Options for Freelancers ) , or you could develop your own system and processes to keep track of communication .
At a very minimum you should have folders in your email to keep track of messages from and to specific clients .
Without a system you will probably find yourself scrambling to find out what was said about different aspects of the project .
Having a record is always good because it will avoid the need to go back to the client when it ’s not necessary and it will also help to protect you in case there is some type of dispute down the road .
3. Do More Listening Than Talking
The client ’s website is all about them , their business , and their customers .
For this reason it is important to emphasize the need to listen and let them provide you with the information that will help you to do the best job possible .
Of course there will be plenty of times where the clients should be doing the listening , but especially during the initial stages when you are just getting to know about their business , be sure to place the most value in listening to what they have to say .
4. Do n’t Be Afraid to Ask Questions
Misunderstandings will always lead to wasted time , so do n’t be afraid to ask the client questions that will help you to get on the same page and to design something that will work for them .
Your customers are busy , just like you are , so they may be in a hurry when you are talking to them , but do n’t let that discourage you from getting the information that will help you to do your job for them .
Many clients wo n’t give a lot of information to you about their business or their customers unless you ask because they may not see the need for you to fully understand their business .
Those clients who do n’t have a good understanding of what is involved in creating a successful website will often think that a skilled designer can just pick up a new project and create something special without really taking the customer ’s specific situation into consideration .
In most cases they just do n’t stop to think about all of the communication that is needed , so you may have to be proactive and ask a number of questions .
5. Be Patient with Your Explanations
The typical client does not have a great understanding of websites or design , and that is why they are hiring you .
As you are explaining things to them throughout the process , be patient and remember that this is probably not an aspect of their business that they are very comfortable with .
Clients appreciate designers who show patience and a willingness to explain things in a way that they can understand , without putting them down .
6. Explain Your Reasons and Thought Processes
As you give your opinions throughout the process it is important that you also explain to the client why you are giving that advice .
Clients will often want you to do something that you do n’t think is a good idea .
When those situations arise , rather than just doing it the way they want or doing it your way with no explanation , take the time to demonstrate to them why you think it is important and what the potential impacts can be .
Clients will typically see things as they appear on the surface , but from your experience you may know that there is more to be considered in the situation .
When this is the case you need to explain to the client the other factors that are involved and why you feel a certain way .
7. Give Advice When Needed
Designers really are consultants to clients as well .
Clients ( at least most of them ) know that you have more expertise in the area than they do and they ’ll trust that you are interested in doing what is best for them and their business .
There will be situations where you will need to be willing to give them advice on a particular decision that needs to be made , or situations where you should add some of your own ideas for making the project better .
Some clients know what they want and as a designer it can be easy to get caught up in giving them what they want , without giving much thought to ways that it could be improved .
Do n’t be afraid to advise clients based on your professional experience .
Most clients will respect your opinions and appreciate that you are looking out for their best interests .
8. Avoid Jargon
One of the biggest frustrations for clients is when designers talk to them with terms and phrases that they do n’t understand .
Although you are working online all the time and you probably communicate with other designers and developers a lot , keep in mind that your clients will not have the same experience , so you should avoid using terms that they are unlikely to understand ( or at least explain what they mean ) .
As you work with clients you will get a better understanding for how tech savvy they are , and you can adjust your communication accordingly .
Some clients will have a very good understanding and will be able to communicate without the need to explain everything , and others will have very little knowledge or experience related to the internet and web design .
9. Avoid Assumptions
Assuming that the client understands certain things or that they want something a particular way can lead to miscommuniation .
If you ’re unsure about something , take a minute and ask the client rather than assuming and causing a lot of work that needs to be re-done later .
10 . Use Examples When Possible
One thing that can really help your communication , particularly when you are explaining things to clients or giving them choices , is to use real - world examples .
Explaining options over the phone or through email can be challenging , and at times ineffective .
By using examples to help , you can make things more clear for clients and get more accurate response and avoid misunderstanding .
An example of this would be if you are talking to a client about the type of navigation menu they would like to use on their site .
Rather than trying to explain the differences you could provide them with URLs of a few sites with various styles so they could see it in a real - world situation .
11 . Make Your Communication Count
Because your clients are busy , most of them will not want to be constantly receiving emails or phone calls about the project .
One of the lessons I ’ve learned from my experience is to make the communication count .
Try to put your questions together in one email rather than sending 4 different emails in one morning with one question each .
Additionally , make an effort to be as clear as possible when you communicate so there is no need to go back and forth several times just to understand the issue at hand .
Because clients value their own time , they will appreciate if you maximize the time that you have in communication and if it requires them to respond to less emails or take less phone calls .
This also goes back to the need for good organization and having a system to keep tabs on the communication .
If you forget what a client told you , you can either go back through your records to find out yourself or you can contact them to ask again .
Of course , it ’s preferable to not have to go back to the client when it ’s not necessary .
12 . Put it in Writing
One of the reasons that email communication is effective is because it gives you and the client a record of what has been said .
There may be times where it is necessary for customer service or for legal purposes to have a record of what was said , by whom , and when .
Aside from email , other types of CRM tools can also help for record keeping .
For situations where you are talking to clients on the phone , it ’s a good practice to type notes after you get off the phone to summarize what was discussed , and of course you will want to include the date and the names of the specific people that you spoke to .
While you may not be able to prove that what is in your notes was actually discussed , it is still better than not having record at all , and it can be just as effective when you need to go back through the records for your own purposes .
Another option is to send a summary of the conversation to your clients by email .
This may be overkill for short calls just to discuss one point , but it could be helpful with longer , more detailed calls , and it could also help clients to have an account of the conversation for themselves .
13 . Keep it Professional
While you are communicating with clients , whether it be face - to - face , telephone , or email , always stay professional .
Clients are paying for your services and they will expect you to conduct your business in a professional manner , so avoid things that could cause them to see you differently .
That ’s not to say that you ca n’t get to know your clients on a more personal level , but remember that what you say and write can impact you designer / client relationship .

Spitzer 's Orion
Credit : NASA , JPL - Caltech , J. Stauffer ( SSC / Caltech )
Explanation : Few cosmic vistas excite the imagination like the Orion Nebula , an immense stellar nursery some 1,500 light - years away .
Spanning about 40 light - years across the region , this new infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope was constructed from data intended to monitor the brightness of the nebula 's young stars , many still surrounded by dusty , planet - forming disks .
Orion 's young stars are only about 1 million years old , compared to the Sun 's age of 4.6 billion years .
The region 's hottest stars are found in the Trapezium Cluster , the brightest cluster near picture center .
Spitzer 's liquid helium coolant ran out in May 2009 , so this false color view is from two channels that still remain sensitive to infrared light at warmer operating temperatures .
To reduce your risk of all types of cancer , it 's vital that you regularly eat foods that are rich in antioxidants .
Antioxidants work throughout your body to neutralize free radicals .
Free radicals are reactive elements that want to steal electrons from compounds that they come into contact with .
When free radicals are successful in stealing electrons from genetic material in your cells , injury to your DNA can eventually pave the way to cancer .
The vast majority of free radicals that exist in your body at any given moment can be traced back to one of the following sources :
Everyday metabolic pathways that occur in your body to produce energy .
Environmental toxins , such as industrial pollutants , household chemicals , and cigarette smoke .
Physical stressors such as unhealthy oils , nitrites , artificial sweeteners , and MSG .
Emotional stress .
Antioxidants found in fresh , minimally processed foods are helpful in preventing cancer because they are able to provide the electrons that free radicals want .
Once free radicals are neutralized by antioxidants , they become harmless , and are eventually eliminated from your body .
It 's always best to get your antioxidants from whole foods and / or supplements made with whole foods .
When you take in antioxidants like vitamin C , vitamin E , beta - carotene , and lycopene from fruits , vegetables , legumes , nuts , and seeds , you also benefit from other nutrients found in plant foods that have their own powerful , anti-cancer effects - these cancer - fighting compounds are generally classified into one of the following five groups :
Indols
Phenols
Flavones
Cumines
Isothiocyanates
While all colorful vegetables , fruits , legumes , and other plant foods provide one or more of the cancer - fighting compounds listed above , the most powerful cancer - fighting foods appear to belong in the cruciferous vegetable family , the most common of which are :
Broccoli
Cabbage
Brussels sprouts
Mustard greens
Kale
Cauliflower
If you do n't enjoy any of these cruciferous vegetables , no worries , as you can still obtain a wide range of cancer - fighting nutrients from other vegetables and plant foods .
For significant protection against cancer , a reasonable goal to shoot for is to include at least two antioxidant - rich foods with each meal .
For breakfast , you could include any variety of fruits and nuts with your meal - most go nicely with any type of cereal .
Examples of antioxidant - rich fruits include blueberries , strawberries , blackberries , goji berries , mulberries , grapes , and figs .
Walnuts , pecans , cashews , and almonds are excellent choices from the nut category .
For lunch , aim to eat at least half a head of romaine lettuce , or the equivalent in field greens .
Generally , dark green vegetables provide a different group of cancer - fighting phytonutrients than fruits , so relying on greens during some of your meals for the bulk of your antioxidants helps diversify your intake and gives you a broader range of protection .
For dinner , you can strive to eat at least two antioxidant - rich vegetables that are cooked .
Steaming and boiling in soups are cooking methods that do n't tend to generate harmful chemicals , and are able to improve your access to nutrients within the vegetables by softening plant fibers .
Of course , you should always rely on your appetite and what 's available to mix and match brightly colored vegetables , fruits , and legumes .
Sometimes , you may want to blend up a large handful of kale or romaine lettuce with ripe mangoes or peaches for a refreshing smoothie .
An excellent option at any time is a freshly pressed vegetable juice .
You 'll want to use a large base of green vegetables like lettuce or spinach , and add smaller amounts of sweeter plants like carrots , red beets , and apples - do n't forget to juice the apples with their antioxidant - rich skins on so that you save and ingest at least some of those valuable phytonutrients .
Freshly pressed vegetable juices are at the highest level of any program of healthy eating and living - I contend that no other food and food form better excel at delivering massive amounts of nutrition with virtually no potential to do harm .
If freshly pressed vegetable juices are not a part of your lifestyle , I encourage you to consider giving them a try .
I trust that the message here is clear :
If you want to lower your risk of virtually all types of cancer in a significant way , it makes all the sense in the world to regularly eat fresh vegetables , fruits , legumes , and other plant foods that are rich in antioxidants and other phytonutrients .
These foods should form the centerpieces of your diet - if you consistently make them the bulk of what you eat , you can likely fill in the edges of your plate with most other foods without suffering negative consequences to your health .
Please stay tuned for more posts on things you can do to prevent and address cancer .

The Oxburgh “ Report ” states that the eleven CRU publications that they examined are “ representative ” , “ were selected on the advice of the Royal Society ” and that CRU agreed that they are a “ fair sample ” of CRU ’s work .
The eleven representative publications that the Panel considered in detail are listed in Appendix B .
The papers cover a period of more than twenty years and were selected on the advice of the Royal Society .
All had been published in international scientific journals and had been through a process of peer review .
CRU agreed that they were a fair sample of the work of the Unit .
A “ fair sample ” ?
To the extent that Climate Audit posts are a yardstick for CRU articles / documents that are at issue , the Oxburgh “ fair sample ” is almost mutually exclusive of the CRU articles discussed here .
Nor were the Oxburgh articles at issue in , for example , my submission to the Parliamentary Committee and the Muir Russell “ Team ” .
Aside from CRU activities at IPCC ( the sections in AR3 , AR4 and AR4 Review Comments ) , the most prominent CRU articles criticized here are the following nine : Briffa et al 1992 ( the Tornetrask chronology and “ Briffa bodge ” ) ; Briffa et al 1995 ( Polar Urals ) , Briffa 2000 ( passim introduction of Yamal , Taimyr ) ; Briffa et al 2002 ( the famous cargo cult “ assumption ” ) ; Mann and Jones 2003 ; Jones and Mann 2004 ; Osborn and Briffa 200 5 6 ; Rutherford et al 2005 ; Jones et al ( 1990 ) on UHI .
[ Oct 27 : also obviously Jones et al 1998 ] .
The Oxburgh Eleven includes five tree ring articles ( Briffa et al , Nature , 1998 ; Briffa et al , Roy Soc Lond 1998 ; Briffa 2000 ; Briffa et al 2001 ; Briffa et al 2008 ) .
Four of these articles were noted relatively favorably in my May 2005 post in which I first drew attention to the “ trick ” A Strange Truncation of the Briffa MXD Series ( see image below ) .
I had no complaint with the original Briffa articles – it was the IPCC spaghetti graph with its false rhetorical effect that bothered me .
Even for veteran watchers of peas under thimbles , it ’s pretty amazing that four CRU articles – that not only had had not been the subject of criticism , but had been used to locate the trick – were chosen as somehow “ representative ” of the CRU corpus , while the articles that had actually been criticized here were for the most part excluded .
Every CRU hockey stick article ( Jones et al 1998 ; Mann and Jones 2003 ; Osborn and Briffa 2006 ) was excluded .
So , in addition to not taking any evidence from CRU critics or targets , the terms of reference for the execrable Oxburgh “ inquiry ” diverted its attention away from articles that actually were at issue to other articles that had actually been used as source material to identify the trick in the first place .
Excerpt from IPCC 2001 “ trick ” spaghetti graph .
This raises a few obvious questions .
The Oxburgh Report states that the eleven articles were “ selected on the advice of the Royal Society ” .
However , they did not provide any information on how the Royal Society determined that these eleven publications were “ representative ” .
Nor did they mention who at the Royal Society actually made the selection .
The report says that UEA agreed that the Royal Society selection was a “ fair sample ” .
I wonder who at UEA actually agreed that the selection was a “ fair sample ” and what their criteria were .
One of the recommendations of every inquiry so far is that methodologies be properly disclosed .
Oxburgh did n’t disclose how they selected their supposedly “ representative ” and “ fair sample ” .
“ Fair sample ” and “ representative ” are statistical terms – terms were used in a report coauthored by a very senior professional statistician in a context where statistics are very much at issue .
So I presume that the Royal Society took some care to ensure that the eleven publications actually were “ representative ” and a “ fair sample ” – and not ones that were pre-selected by UEA , rather than the Royal Society .
I ’ve written to both UEA and the Royal Society seeking clarification on the selection process and will keep readers posted .
Update Apr 16 : Here is my request to the UEA under the Environmental Information Regulations :
Dear Mr Palmer , Pursuant to the Environmental Information Regulations , I hereby request correspondence between the University of East Anglia and / or its officers and the Royal Society between December 1 , 2009 and April 12 , 2010 concerning the selection of publications considered in the Oxburgh “ report ” .
Thank you for your attention .
Regards , Stephen McIntyre
I received acknowledgment of this request this morning .
I sent the following inquiry to the Royal Society yesterday :
The Oxburgh Report lists 11 CRU papers in Appendix B stating : “ The eleven representative publications that the Panel considered in detail are listed in Appendix B .
The papers cover a period of more than twenty years and were selected on the advice of the Royal Society . ”
Can you tell me who at the Royal Society was responsible for providing this advice and what their criteria were for selecting these particular 11 papers ?
I have not yet received an acknowledgment .

( CNN ) --
The remains of a woman who disappeared 22 years ago in northern California have been found after the son of the woman 's purported killer guided police to the site where her body was dumped , investigators announced Thursday .
The alleged killer 's son told authorities that he watched his father kill 27 - year - old Lysandra Marie Turpin in 1988 and that his dad forced him to help dispose of the body , the Humboldt County , California , Sheriff 's Office announced .
Ernest Samuel Christie III , who was 16 at the time , told authorities that his now - dead father , Ernest Samuel Christie Jr. , made him help dump Turpin 's body in a ditch near their home in Fieldbrook , California , about 80 miles south of the Oregon border .
Christie said his father forced him to help cover the body with tires , douse it in gasoline and set it on fire , Humboldt County Sheriff Gary Philp said in a statement Thursday .
Christie 's dad had held and abused Turpin at his house for several weeks before killing her , Christie told the sheriff 's office .
She had been reported missing to Humboldt County law enforcement on April 8 , 1988 .
After Christie supplied the sheriff 's office with a map of where the body had been dumped , a team of detectives , evidence technicians , and sheriff 's deputies found teeth , clothing and charred bones .
A forensic odontologist positively identified the remains as Lysandra Turpin on Wednesday , according to Philp .
Ernest Samuel Christie Jr. died in 2006 , according to the sheriff 's office .
His son , now 38 and living in North Carolina , contacted the sheriff 's office in February .
He is not facing criminal charges , Philp said .
Christie told authorities that his father had abused other women , once holding a woman prisoner in a hollowed - out redwood tree stump .
The woman escaped and declined to report the incident to law enforcement , the sheriff 's office said .
Using a description provided by Christie , sheriff 's personnel located the stump and found a carpet , plastic jugs , a hypodermic syringe and clothing there , Philp said Thursday .
Christie related other instances of his father -- who he said frequently used methamphetamine -- terrorizing women , Philp said .
Christie told authorities that his dad once took a woman on his fishing boat , tied her up and told her he was going to kill her .
The woman managed to escape , and detectives were recently able to find her and corroborate Christie 's account , Philp said .

Palestinian journalists who last week met with their Israeli colleagues and an IDF spokesman in Tel Aviv have come under fire from both Hamas and Fatah .
The trip was arranged by the non-profit Israel advocacy group The Israel Project , whose Web site described the group as “ an international non-profit organization devoted to educating the press and the public about Israel while promoting security , freedom and peace .
” The journalists met with Maj .
Avichai Edri , head of the Arabic - language branch of the IDF Spokesman ’s Office .
Three of the journalists – Lana Shaheen , Mueen al - Hilu and Abdel Salam Abu Askar – are from the Gaza Strip , while another two are from the West Bank .
They now face expulsion from the Fatah - controlled Palestinian Journalists Syndicate on charges of promoting normalization with Israel .
The syndicate decided to establish a committee to question the journalists who went to Tel Aviv about their motives and the identity of the party behind the invitation .
The syndicate is also planning to hold an emergency meeting next week to discuss punitive measures against Palestinian journalists who defy a ban on normalization of relations with Israel .
Hamas has also condemned the Palestinian journalists as “ collaborators . ”
Hamas officials claimed that some of the journalists were known as supporters of Mohammed Dahlan , a former Fatah security commander in the Gaza Strip .
Several Hamas - affiliated groups said that the journalists who visited Israel would be put on a “ black list ” – a sign that they would be boycotted by their colleagues and the government institutions .
One of the groups , the Democratic Press Association , called on the journalists to “ repent ” and express publicly apologize for visiting the “ Zionist entity and meeting with Zionist reporters .
” It described the journalists ’ visit to Tel Aviv as a “ despicable and harmful ” act , saying it came at a time when the “ Zionist occupation army was killing Palestinians .
This visit does not represent the positions and morals of Palestinian journalists .
” Wisam Afifeh , editor - in - chief of Hamas ’ snewspaper , saidthat condemnations were not enough .
He called on all Palestinianjournalists to “ disown ” and “ distance ” themselves from the journalistswho were invited to Tel Aviv .
Ahmed Daloul , a Palestinian journalist from the Gaza Strip , alsolaunched a scathing attack on the same journalists , accusing them ofembarking on an “ adventure ” aimed at normalizing ties with Israel .
“ These journalists did not leave the besieged Gaza Strip to receiveeducation or medical treatment or to defend their cause , but to tourTel Aviv and meet with Zionist journalists , ” he said .
“ The climax oftheir visit was a meeting with an Israeli army spokesman . ” Daloul added : “ It ’s really a tragedy that these people call themselves Palestinian journalists .
By getting involved in normalization [ withIsrael ] , they dealt a blow to their people and colleagues , whose imagehas now been tarnished . ”

Adilson Kindlemann 's plane crashes into the Swan River during a training session ahead of the Red Bull Air Race in Perth this weekend .

I ’ve had X - rays and medicals and fortunately I ’m 100 percent , " he said .
" The people who rescued me from the water are unbelievable .
The water ( rescue ) training we had on Monday really prepared me for this . "
All race pilots completed underwater emergency training yesterday .
The crash happened about 11.50 am midway across the river , around the area in front of Wesley College .
Adilson Kindlemann .
Credit : Getty Images Bystander Steve McIntosh told WAtoday.com.au that he watched the plane go through three pylons close to South Perth , before it headed towards the city .
" It all happened in the blink of an eye , " he said .
" It looked like it knife - edged and ' bang ' it was in . "
Brian Hutchinson , visiting with his wife from Scotland , said Kindlemann was taken from the rescue boat and placed on a stretcher " slowly and carefully " , before being loaded into the ambulance .
There 's not much left of the plane , it just looks like a wing .
Mr Hutchinson was watching the plane before briefly turning his back .
" We just heard a kind of ' whoomp ' type noise and the engine stopped , " he said .
Two boats immediately raced to the scene .
A witness , who works at the Boatshed Cafe at South Perth , said that an Air Race speedboat had arrived at the crash site " within 20 seconds " and immediately pulled the pilot from the water , before speeding off to the city side of the river .
Another witness told WAtoday.com.au that the impact was " not massive " .
The plane was not going quickly " and just slowed up and fell down " .
" Normally you would think it would nosedive or something , but it just fell down , " the witness said .
Brett Cornford told WAtoday.com .au he saw the plane go " wing first " into the water .
" There 's not much left of the plane , it just looks like a wing . "
Today was a training day for this weekend 's race , with the crash happening in the first morning training session .
Police spokeswoman Ros Weatherall said police were " working closely " with organisers and aviation authorities to investigate the cause of the crash .
The Swan River Trust is also investigating due to a possible pollution risk .
Air race chief executive Bernd Loidl said emergency response teams were on the scene " in minutes " .
It was the first crash in the Red Bull Air Race ’s seven - year history .
A local aerobatic pilot who witnessed the crash , but did not want to be named , said it appeared Kindlemann ’s port wing stalled as he rounded the last chicane on the course and was hit by a gust of wind .
The stall caused the wing to drop and clip the water , with the plane then cartwheeling and tumbling into the river , the pilot said .
Squally conditions most likely contributed to the crash .
" There were 20 knot ( 37 k mh ) gusts out there when he was practicing , and all it takes is one of those gusts to change the relative airflow and the wing would have stalled , " he said .
" He must have hit pretty hard , because it made an almighty bang as it hit the water .
There was a lot of damage to the plane . "
Kindlemann ’s MXS -R race plane was later towed to the South Perth foreshore , where a crane was used to salvage it .
He is the first South American to compete in the Red Bull Air Race .
On his website , Kindlemann yesterday expressed his frustration with Perth 's wintry weather not allowing as much time for practice as he would like .
" It was very important to fly with this weather changing so much , " Kindlemann said .
" Flights were different from each other , since the second one was windy .
But this type of training is essential for us to face different situations and to be prepared on the race day . "
Kindlemann has clocked up more than 11,000 flight hours , and about 700 hours of aerobatics , according to the race 's official website .

He has 18 years of aerobatics experience , has performed more than 300 shows in Brazil , and is a three - time Brazilian aerobatics champion .

2 ) SCALING THE HEIGHTS
Unless you suit up and make the climb up the Sydney Harbour Bridge , the best spot to catch the sunset may be the top of the Rocks , the historic district where young merchant princes and professionals like to pub crawl from the Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel ( 19 Kent Street ; 61-2-9251-4044 ; lordnelsonbrewery.com ) , one of the city ’s oldest continuously operating bars and now also a hotel and microbrewery , to the Hero of Waterloo ( 81 Lower Fort Street ; 61-2-9252-4553 ; heroofwaterloo.com.au ) , with stone cellars hiding tunnels once used for smuggling .
Another hot spot is the plaza outside the MoS Cafe ( 37 Phillips Street ; 61-2-9241-3636 ; moscafe.com.au ) at the spiffy Museum of Sydney , faintly perfumed by the Royal Botanic Gardens .

New York ( CNN ) --
Protesters rallied in downtown New York City Thursday to voice their anger over what they perceive as the roles Wall Street and big banks played in America 's economic crisis .
Marching from City Hall to Wall Street , the protesters chanted " good jobs for all , " and held signs with messages including " Hold banks accountable , " " Make Wall Street Pay , " and " Reclaim America . "
The AFL - CIO organized the rally , and union President Richard Trumka addressed the crowd , saying , " How long will we allow the spirit of greed to continue to drive us into economic holes ? "
The National People 's Action , a group that was involved in organizing the protest , said in a news release that demonstrators represented unemployed workers , foreclosure victims and community activists .
Protester Gerard Pettine said he just wants Wall Street to be held accountable for its involvement in the economic collapse .
" They need to have some integrity and some honor and do the right thing , " Pettine told CNN .
Protester Elizabeth Soto , who came with her brother to the rally , was concerned about the lack of job creation .
" We are here to say Wall Street 's got to help Main Street , " she said .
" We supported the stimulus bill , which bailed out Wall Street , but we expected the jobs to come back to Main Street . "
The New York Police Department estimated that 6,000 people participated in the rally .
Earlier Thursday , as part of a larger " day of action " against Wall Street , protesters descended upon the headquarters of two New York City banks -- JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo -- leaving letters for the banks ' chief executive officers .
The letters , according to the news release from the National People 's Action , said that the banks have an opportunity " to step up to the plate and be leaders in rebuilding the American economy . "
JP Morgan spokesperson Mike Fusco declined to comment on the letter , but said that there were a " couple dozen " protesters who were in the building for less than a half hour .
Fran Durst of Wells Fargo said that about 100 protesters flooded their building 's lobby and tried to deliver their letter to the bank 's CEO .
Durst said the event did n't cause a major disruption to the bank .
Other protests were scheduled in San Francisco , California ; Kansas City , Missouri ; and Charlotte , North Carolina , according to the National People 's Action news release .
CNN 's Mary Snow , Jennifer Rizzo , Cassie Spodak , and Kristen Hamill contributed to this report .
The KWin Button Applet March 24 , 2010
I like to save screen estate , and in the latest iteration of my workspace layout , I have eliminated another 20 px vertical space .
I noticed that I ’m mostly working in maximized windows .
Their titlebar is nearly empty due to my wide notebook screen .
What a waste !
Solution :
Move the panel to the top and make it cover the titlebar of the maximized window .
Problem :
The panel is bigger than the titlebar , and therefore covering the toolbar .
Solution :
Make the titlebar bigger ( Oxygen windeco allows to make the buttons bigger ) , then make the panel size match the titlebar size .
Next problem :
There are buttons in the titlebar which I might need .
Immediate solution : Resize the panel to not cover these buttons .
But that does not work because I ’m regularly changing my screen resolution when wiring up my notebook to a projector .
Slightly harder solution : Implement the titlebar buttons as a Plasma applet .
( Sounds harder than it is , thanks to libtaskmanager from kdebase - workspace . )
Because this is something others might find useful , I ’ve shared these 200 lines of code .
Updates :
Aaron Seigo points out that plasma - netbook comes with a quite similar applet called “ Current Application Control ” , which combines all buttons into one , together with the title of the current application .
Christian adds that KWin has built - in support for removing the decoration from maximized windows automatically , although this option is not presented in the GUI .
To activate this option , set “ BorderlessMaximizedWindows=true ” in the “ [ Windows ] ” section of your kwinrc ( usually found at .kde/share/config/ kwinrc or . kde4 / share / config/ kwinrc in your home directory ) .
Then fire up KRunner and run “ kwin – replace ” to restart KWin .
Luboš Luňák announces the immediate availability of an openSUSE build service package for the kwinbuttonapplet .
I have added this information to the kde - look page .
Thanks to all commenters !
Gardai are targeting key terror figures , including a former Provisional IRA " army executive " member , responsible for masterminding this week 's car bomb blast outside the Northern HQ of the British intelligence agency , MI5 .
The campaign , which will be matched by similar operations in the North , will include increased surveillance and intelligence gathering on the targeted figures .
A senior anti-terrorist officer said last night : " Apart from the value of these operations in the short term in disrupting their activities and plans to cause mayhem , they will also be of immense importance in the longer term in building up dossiers on these people . "
Members of the Garda Special Branch and the Emergency Response Unit are already involved in the intelligence drive against the top dissidents .
But it is expected that the Criminal Assets Bureau will also be deployed in the coming weeks in a concerted attack against the targets .
The former senior Provisional , who is from Louth , is currently the leader of the most active faction of the renegade Real IRA .
He resigned from the Provisionals ' 12 - person " army executive " along with Michael McKevitt after a stormy meeting in Falcarragh , Co Donegal , in October 1997 , over a decision to accept the peace process , and shortly afterwards the two men became founder members of the Real IRA .
After a security summit in Belfast yesterday , Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy emphasised the importance of a multi-agency approach in tackling terrorism and said the two recent bomb blasts in Holywood , Co Down , and in Newry , had strengthened the resolve of his force and the PSNI to work side by side in confronting the dissident threat .
Police forensic experts on both sides of the Border are also carrying out a detailed analysis on the two bomb blasts -- the first bombs to be detonated in the North in almost a decade .
Responsible
They are trying to establish the identity of those responsible for manufacturing the bombs by comparing them to explosive devices used during the Troubles to determine if former Provisional " engineers " are involved .
Detailed briefings on the dissident threat were provided by Mr Murphy and PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggot during the summit , which lasted 90 minutes at Stormont and was described later as symbolic .
The summit provided an opportunity for Justice Minister Dermot Ahern to meet with his new Northern counterpart , David Ford for the first time since the latter was elected to the post .
Mr Ahern said later the two police chiefs had left them in no doubt that co-operation between their forces existed at an extremely high level .
Mr Ford said he wanted to work closely with Mr Ahern to look at ways in which they could co-operate across the criminal justice system to make Ireland , north and south , a better and safer place .
Irish Independent
The release of yet another crippled Internet appliance by Apple , Inc. ordinarily would n’t be worthy of mention on these hallowed pages — but there ’s been such a deluge of hipsteria about it over the weekend that I wanted to make sure that you caught the important stuff .
So let ’s get to it !
The Emperor ’s New Clothes :
From the “ picture is worth a thousand words ” department , here ’s the iPad ’s inner workings , as revealed on reddit .
It ’s obviously a Photoshop but makes its point rather well , I think .
Thinking outside the triangle :
Back in the early days of our design process , Jonny Ive came in to see me and we spent a long time trying to decide where on Mazlow ’s triangle this product would sit .
Because we knew if we could n’t be way up above the very top of that pyramid , floating above it , totally outside the needs it describes , then this would n’t be a product we wanted to make .
Fake Steve Jobs describes how the iPad came to be .
I ’ll freely admit that the reference to Mazlow ’s hierarchy of needs went right over my head , so I linked to it just in case you find yourself in the same boat .
Inspiring words :
Then there ’s the device itself : clearly there ’s a lot of thoughtfulness and smarts that went into the design .
But there ’s also a palpable contempt for the owner .
I believe — really believe — in the stirring words of the Maker Manifesto : if you ca n’t open it , you do n’t own it .
That last sentence inspired the new tagline for this site : “ If it wo n’t open , it ’s broken . ”
The quote is from none other than Cory Doctorow channeling some Jonathan Zittrain in rightfully damning the iPad as a non-generative device .
It did n’t take long for Gizmodo — firmly in the Apple fanboy camp since the first - gen iPhone launched in 2007 — to issue their rebuttal .
Funny thing is , the arguments in that piece are pretty much destroyed with the first comment .
Sticks Calhoun , you are new my new hero — whoever you are .
Oh , and speaking of Jonathan Zittrain , he ’s written up a nice piece of his own for today ’s Financial Times .
Here ’s a quote from that :
If Apple is the gatekeeper to a device ’s uses , the governments of the world need knock on the door of only one office in Cupertino , California – Apple ’s headquarters – to demand changes to code or content .
Users no longer own or control the apps they run – they merely rent them minute by minute .
At this point if you ’re not giving serious second thought to your unabashed iPad lust you must be itching to counter all of this with something about the superior Apple user experience , which products from other manufacturers simply cannot match .
I hope you ’re sitting comfortably …
Nailed it :
Do you like a linear approach for doing things ?
If so , the iPad is perfect for you .
Everything about the iPad interface is linear .
Every desired final action is accomplished through a series of taps .
Want to read a book ?
Cool .
Tap the home button .
Tap the iBook app .
Tap the library view .
Tap the book you want to read .
Hopefully , you ’re getting the point .
Some will call this brilliant .
I call it rudimentary and lacking …
Adam Kmiec seems to accomplish the impossible here — to quantify the Apple user experience that no Apple fan has been able to articulate — at least to me .
I could ( and probably will at some point ) devote an entire post to how Apple ’s ease of use actually obfuscates basic machine / human interaction .
But for now , I ’m interested what you make of all this …
A convicted cocaine smuggler has been arrested for running what US authorities say appears to be a bestiality farm in Washington State in which visitors could engage in all sorts of twisted sex acts with animals .
Douglas Spink was arrested at his ramshackle , heavily wooded compound near the Canadian border along with a 51 - year - old tourist from Great Britain who is accused of having sex with three dogs .
Dozens of dogs , horses and pet mice were seized , along with what investigators described as thousands of images of bestiality and apparent child pornography .
The mice were euthanised , said Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo , whose office assisted federal agents in the case .
" This stuff is just truly bizarre , " he said .
" These were mice that had their tails cut off , they were smothered in Vaseline and they had string tied around them . "
It was n't immediately clear whether other zoophilic tourists had been to Spink 's farm , but Assistant US Attorney Susan Roe said on Friday , " I expect there may have been other people visiting the property " .
Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first to climb Everest A plan to scatter some of the ashes of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary at the peak of Mount Everest has been called off .
Buddhist lamas had warned it would bring bad luck , so the Sherpas behind the plan said the ashes instead would be kept at a monastery near Everest .
The world 's highest mountain is considered sacred to the Buddhist Sherpas who live in the region .
Sir Edmund climbed Everest in 1953 and after his death in 2008 most of his ashes were spread in Auckland harbour .
The rest were given to the Sherpa community .
Possible precedent Apa Sherpa , who has scaled Everest a record 19 times - and is planning a 20th attempt - had wanted to honour the New Zealander by spreading his ashes at the summit .
The organisers of Apa 's expedition said they decided against the plan after a committee of Sherpas , including Buddhist lamas , advised against it .
Apa Sherpa has climbed Everest more times than anyone else " The old lamas said that it would be inauspicious to take the ashes to a holy place , " said expedition organiser Dawa Steven Sherpa .
" There were also concerns that placing Hillary 's ashes on the summit could set a precedent , with other people wanting their ashes also to be scattered there , " he told AFP news agency .
Sir Edmund 's ashes will remain at a monastery near Everest where they have been kept since being transferred to Nepal .
There are plans to scatter them in a park that is being built to commemorate the mountaineer .
He and the Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were the first to reach the the 8,847 m ( 29,028 ft ) peak of Everest and the New Zealander kept strong ties with the Sherpa community .
He opened a charitable foundation to help the people in the Solukhumbu region at the base of the mountain .
Apa , 50 , said he had met Sir Edmund many times and would pray for him at the summit .
" Without him we would have no clinics and we would have no schools , " he said .

Indoor tanning among U.S. college students is linked to addiction , anxiety and substance use , according to a study released today .
Researchers polled more than 400 undergraduates ages 18 to 25 in the northeastern U.S , almost half of whom said they used tanning beds .
The researchers , using language similar to screening quizzes for alcohol and substance abuse , asked the respondents about their indoor tanning as well as their use of alcohol and other substances .
They found that people who tanned also tended to use alcohol and marijuana ; they were also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety .
The authors noted that " repeated exposure to UV light ” may have results similar to those often cited by substance abusers : relaxation , increased socialization and improved moods .
They suggested more study of a short anxiety and depression screening for those who participate in indoor tanning .
“ Treating an underlying mood disorder may be a necessary step in reducing skin cancer risk among those who frequently tan indoors , " the authors wrote .
Dr. Darrell Rigel , past president of the American Academy of Dermatology and now clinical professor of dermatology at New York University , agreed .
“ We have n't convinced people in theory that 100 percent of people should be wearing sunscreen and 0 percent of people should be going to tanning beds .
… Maybe the reason our current strategy is not working is because tanning is an addictive behavior .
If that 's true , then we have to attack the public 's perception of this just like we would attack alcoholism and drug use .
We have to bring in behavioral scientists who are addiction experts to come up with a better plan to deal with this issue . ”

At first glance , it is hard to imagine how innovations from poor countries could provide much help in solving the cost and quality problems plaguing health - care delivery in rich countries like the United States .
While it is easy to understand why a poor man would want what a rich man has , why would a rich man benefit from a solution created originally for a poor man ?
India ’s Aravind Eye Care System demonstrates why rich countries should take such reverse innovation seriously .
Aravind ’s operations include a chain of five eye hospitals , a manufacturing facility for producing intraocular lenses and other consumables needed for cataract and other eye surgeries , a training center for imparting training to other eye hospitals in India and other countries , and a network of outreach centers .
Aravind hospitals conducted 269,577 eye surgeries in 2008 - 09 , of which nearly 50 % were performed for free for poor patients .
The charges for the remaining 50 % were at or below market rates — i.e. , there were no cross subsidies .
Of the facilities ’ 2.46 million outpatients during that time , 50 % were treated for free , and the fee for most of the others was a nominal $ 0.50 .
Aravind takes no donations or charity and yet not only makes a profit but enough to fund a new hospital every three years !
All these new hospitals and expansions have been internally funded .
Aravind has been doing this for more than two decades .
The $ 64,000 question is : How ?
The answer lies in the elements that make up Aravind :
1. Extraordinary productivity .
Aravind doctors average about 25 cataract surgeries per day ( actually , over six hours ) , whereas other eye - care hospitals do six to eight surgeries per doctor .
Aravind achieves this by having a highly streamlined , innovative , and efficient system and a highly trained paramedical staff .
2. Exploiting economies of scale .
This allows its in - house manufacturing facility , Aurolab , to produce intraocular lenses ( IOLs ) at $ 5 ; global prices are about $ 80 .
Aravind is the lowest - cost producer of IOLs in the world .
Its scale of production enables , or rather , compels it to export almost 50 % of its production to other eye - care hospitals , both in India and abroad .
3. Borrowing best practices from other sectors .
Aravind has borrowed concepts like economies of scale and assembly lines from the industrial sector and applied them in health care to bring down costs without sacrificing quality .
Volume is critical to this mode of operation .
Aravind generates volume through its outreach programs and eye camps , which are even conducted in interior villages .
Now , it is setting up satellite centers that are staffed only with technicians but are equipped with webcams that allow the base hospitals to help make diagnoses remotely .
High volume not only lowers costs but more importantly , it leads to better quality since doctors build world - class competencies as they do more surgeries .
4. Investing in critical activities but saving on frills .
Aravind lowers its cost position by reducing bells and whistles without compromising on the quality of its equipment or medicines or the competence of doctors and nurses .
5. Aravind ’s ideological foundations .
Its founder , the late Dr. Govindappa Venkataswamy ( “ Dr. V ” ) , stated his mission simply as “ eradication of needless blindness ” when he founded the hospital in 1976 .
This mission has continued to this day .
All staffers — from doctors and nurses right down to attendants and sweepers — are imbued with this mission .
Every patient , however poor he or she may be , must be treated with respect .
Commitment is vital .
Every action Aravind undertakes is tested against the criterion of whether it will help achieve this mission .
Thus , a new research facility has just been constructed with the objective of devising better methods of overcoming the blindness problem .
Aravind ’s training facilities impart training at very low rates to doctors and nurses from other hospitals in conducting surgeries in the “ Aravind Way . ”
Its outreach programs include diabetes and refraction checking to preempt later complications .
Today , cataracts are gradually being overtaken as the dominant cause of blindness in India by other causes , such as diabetes - related diseases and refraction problems .
Consequently , Aravind is slowly placing greater emphasis on these areas .
Aravind charges about $ 100 for a cataract surgery with ordinary IOLs — an amount that includes a two - day stay in the lowest - category room .
Even with the highest room rates and with phacoemulsification surgery with modern , three - piece , foldable IOLs , the charges are still only about $ 300 .
In contrast , a cataract surgery typically costs between $ 2,500 to $ 3,500 in the U.S. Aravind ’s morbidity rates are benchmarked against and consistently exceed those of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in the U.K .
Aravind is a perfect example of how astonishing the results can be when produced through a congruence of vision , values , purposeful implementation , and a high degree of efficiency .
Its mission and vision statements are not pieces of paper on display ; they come alive in each of the organization ’s activities .
There is nothing in this model that cannot be replicated in any country — developing or developed .
The keys are simple : pay close attention to operational efficiency , work on separating the core from the frills , maximize the productivity of the costliest resources ( doctors and equipment ) , and utilize the sheer power of volume .
Here are some questions for reflection and debate :
How might Aravind expand its reach inside India , in other emerging markets , and in developed countries ?
How can we systematically identify all the breakthrough innovations in health - care delivery in poor countries that might be applied in the U.S. and other developed countries ?
Jim Yong Kim , president of Dartmouth College , has stressed the need to incorporate health - care - delivery science in undergraduate education .

BEIJING - China 's Information Office of the State Council published a report titled " The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2009 " here Friday .
Following is the full text :
The State Department of the United States released its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2009 on March 11 , 2010 , posing as " the world judge of human rights " again .
As in previous years , the reports are full of accusations of the human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions including China , but turn a blind eye to , or dodge and even cover up rampant human rights abuses on its own territory .
The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2009 is prepared to help people around the world understand the real situation of human rights in the United States .
I. On Life , Property and Personal Security
Widespread violent crimes in the United States posed threats to the lives , properties and personal security of its people .
In 2008 , US residents experienced 4.9 million violent crimes , 16.3 million property crimes and 137,000 personal thefts , and the violent crime rate was 19.3 victimizations per 1,000 persons aged 12 or over , according to a report published by the US Department of Justice in September 2009 ( Criminal Victimization 2008 , US Department of Justice , http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov).
In 2008 , over 14 million arrests occurred for all offenses ( except traffic violations ) in the country , and the arrest rate for violent crime was 198.2 per 100,000 inhabitants ( Crime in the United States , 2008 , http://www.fbi.gov).
In 2009 , a total of 35 domestic homicides occurred in Philadelphia , a 67 percent increase from 2008 ( The New York Times , December 30 , 2009 ) .
In New York City , 461 murders were reported in 2009 , and the crime rate was 1,151 cases per 100,000 people .
San Antonio in Texas was deemed as the most dangerous among 25 US large cities with 2,538 crimes recorded per 100,000 people ( The China Press , December 30 , 2009 ) .
The murder rate rose 5.5 percent in towns with a population of 10,000 or fewer in 2008 ( http://www.usatoday.com, June 1 , 2009 ) .
Most of the United States ' 15,000 annual murders occur in cities where they are concentrated in poorer neighborhoods ( http://www.reuters.com, October 7 , 2009 ) .
The United States ranks first in the world in terms of the number of privately - owned guns .
According to the data from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , American gun owners , out of 309 million in total population , have more than 250 million guns , while a substantial proportion of US gun owners had more than one weapon .
Americans usually buy 7 billion rounds of ammunition a year , but in 2008 the figure jumped to about 9 billion ( The China Press , September 25 , 2009 ) .
In the United States , airline passengers are allowed to take unloaded weapons after declaration .
In the United States , about 30,000 people die from gun-related incidents each year ( The China Press , April 6 , 2009 ) .
According to a FBI report , there had been 14,180 murder victims in 2008 ( USA Today , September 15 , 2009 ) .
Firearms were used in 66.9 percent of murders , 43.5 percent of robberies and 21.4 percent of aggravated assaults ( http://www.thefreelibrary.com).
USA Today reported that a man named Michael McLendon killed 10 people in two rural towns of Alabama before turning a gun on himself on March 11 , 2009 .
On March 29 , a man named Robert Stewart shot and killed eight people and injured three others in a nursing home in North Carolina ( USA Today , March 11 , 2009 ) .
On April 3 , an immigrant called Jiverly Wong shot 13 people dead and wounded four others in an immigration services center in downtown Binghamton , New York ( The New York Times , April 4 , 2009 ) .
In the year 2009 , a string of attacks on police shocked the country .
On March 21 , a 26 - year - old jobless man shot and killed four police officers in Oakland , California , before he was killed by police gunfire ( http://cbs5.com).
On April 4 , a man called Richard Poplawski shot three police officers to death in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
On November 29 , an ex-convict named Maurice Clemmons shot four police officers to death inside a coffee shop in Parkland , Washington ( The New York Times , December 1 , 2 and 3 , 2009 ) .
Campuses became an area worst hit by violent crimes as shootings spread there and kept escalating .
The US Heritage Foundation reported that 11.3 percent of high school students in Washington D.C. reported being " threatened or injured " with a weapon while on school property during the 2007 - 2008 school year .
In the same period , police responded to more than 900 calls to 911 reporting violent incidents at the addresses of Washington D.C. public schools ( A Report of The Heritage Center for Data Analysis , School Safety in Washington , D.C. : New Data for the 2007 - 2008 School Year , http://www.heritage.org).
In New Jersey public schools , a total of 17,666 violent incidents were reported in 2007 - 2008 ( Annual Report on Violence , Vandalism and Substance Abuse in New Jersey Public Schools by New Jersey Department of Education , October 2009 , http://www.state.nj.us).
In the City University of New York , a total of 107 major crimes occurred in five of its campuses during 2006 and 2007 ( The New York Post , September 22 , 2009 ) .
The $ 1bn ( £ 650 m ) fraud prosecution of Goldman Sachs has given a fillip to the White House , which is hoping that fresh anti-Wall Street sentiment will push an overhaul in financial regulation through a deeply divided Senate this week .
Harry Reid , the Democratic leader in the Senate , hopes to hold a vote tomorrow to end debate on the Obama administration 's reforms , which include a government levy on big banks , the introduction of the " Volcker rule " banning risky proprietary trading , and the creation of a consumer financial protection agency .
The Republican leadership argues that the reforms will do more harm than good , but the White House is seeking to win over the single opposition senator needed to turn the Democrats ' 59 - 41 margin into a filibuster - proof 60 - 40 majority .
Once over this barrier , the reforms will need only a simple majority and could clear Congress within a few weeks .
Political analysts say that the fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) against Goldman came at a crucial time .
Ethan Siegel of the Washington Exchange , which monitors Capitol Hill for institutional investors , says : " The SEC 's announcement reminded the country of what it was so upset about with regard to the economic downturn - which was the egregiousness of the behaviour of big financial institutions . "
Conservatives view Obama 's reforms as an extension of " big government " .
A $ 50bn resolution fund , intended to pay for winding down any future failed banking behemoth , has been branded a " bailout fund " by Republicans .
Aware that they are fighting an unpopular corner , Republicans are deeply suspicious about the convenient political timing of the Goldman prosecution .
The SEC's own board was split over it , with two Republican appointees voting not to proceed .
Darrell Issa , a senior Republican senator , claimed the lawsuit had raised serious questions about the SEC 's independence and impartiality .
Obama has said there was no political intervention - the president insists he knew nothing of the impending case until it was reported on television .

The Tea Party has been billed as an organic grassroots operation , but a newly uncovered document obtained by Politico suggests the movement has been successfully co-opted as a Republican fundraising ploy .
GOP political consultant Joe Wierzbicki floated the proposal a year ago today to create the Tea Party Express , a nationwide bus tour to “ give a boost to our PAC and position us as a growing force / leading force as the 2010 elections come into focus . ”
His idea eventually became one of the best known brands in the Tea Party movement .
ADVERTISEMENT
The document cautioned planners to be careful when discussing the ruse to use Tea Parties for political gain .
“ We have to be very , very careful about discussing amongst ourselves anyone we include ‘ outside of the family ’ because quite frankly , we are not only not part of the political establishment or conservative establishment , but we are also sadly not currently a part of the ‘ tea party ’ establishment , ” Wierzbicki wrote .
Wierzbicki , who works for the Sacramento firm Russo Marsh +
Rogers , went on to outline how conservative media including Fox News could be leveraged to hype the Tea Party Express .
He recommended using “ mentions and possibly even promotion from conservative / pro-tea party bloggers , talk radio hosts , Fox News commentators , etc … ”
Citing Michigan as an example , he noted that one of the plan ’s primary goals would be to elect Republican candidates .
“ It is also worth considering making a return run to Michigan .
Former Republican Michigan governor , John Engler , has recently stated that he believes the Republican Party will do quite well in Michigan , ” he continued .
But the primary goal was fundraising for the founding firm ’s PAC .
Despite quadrupling their take in March they told Politico , “ We ’re hardly making any money at all . ”
Ken Vogel , who broke the story , discussed it on MSNBC ’s Countdown With Keith Olbermann Wednesday .

“ The firm , Russo Marsh , and its operatives have really pushed back hard against this idea that they ’re making a lot of money off of it .
They say , yes , we received $ 1.9 million in payments from this PAC , which is now the Tea Party Express , but a lot of that was for overhead , ” Vogel told Olbermann .
He said there ’s “ no doubt ” the plan “ has been a wild success beyond the sort of most ambitious expectations of these operatives . ”
The GOP has successfully “ tapped the Tea Party for a sustainable revenue stream , ” he added .

If you follow the news even vaguely , then you 've heard about Google 's announcement that it may exit the Chinese market in response to hacker attacks originating in China that sought to access the private information of human rights advocates .
I 've argued that whether Google stays or not , such attacks are n't likely to stop .
So I do n't really see what Google expects to gain from leaving now , as opposed to months or years ago .
But today a new wrinkle emerges : the attacks occurred as a result of an unknown flaw in Microsoft Internet Explorer .
Here 's the news blurb , via PCWorld :
Microsoft Security Response Center director Mike Reavey said in an e-mailed statement " This afternoon , Microsoft issued Security Advisory 979352 to help customers mitigate a Remote Code Execution ( RCE ) vulnerability in Internet Explorer .
The company has determined that Internet Explorer was one of the vectors used in targeted and sophisticated attacks targeted against Google and other corporate networks . "
Am I the only one that finds this an interesting plot twist ?
Microsoft provided the window through which the Chinese hackers crawled through .
A few thoughts about this :
First , what is Google doing using Internet Explorer ?
Should n't it be running its own Google Chrome browser instead ?
Or at least Mozilla Firefox ?
Maybe the excuse here is that it 's impossible for a software company like Google to entirely avoid using Internet Explorer .
After all , if it wants to produce browser - agnostic software , then it needs to test its systems in all varieties .
So it probably can't avoid IE altogether , but I wonder if it 's planning to use it even less now , particularly for its external Internet usage unreleated to product testing .
Second , this story is another blow for Internet Explorer .
The Google - China spat is big news right now , and this thrusts Microsoft in the center of it .
As I mentioned a few months ago , IE is already beginning to give up small chunks of its market share each month to other browsers like Firefox and Chrome .
Could this push firms affected by the Chinese attack to also begin exploring other browser alternatives ?
Will the rest of the Internet - using public take notice ?
If Google really wants to live its " do n't be evil " mantra , then it might consider starting an antivirus unit of its own , and / or developing its Chrome browser to be virus proof .
In my opinion , other than physical violence , there are few things more evil than computer viruses .
They plague unsuspecting Internet users and lead to stolen identities , invasions of privacy , stolen property and incredible inconvenience .
I consider computer viruses technological weapons of mass destruction , and the hackers who create them terrorists .
As these foreign - based attacks continue to become more common , the U.S. might want to consider putting more of its defense budget towards preventing them .
I do n't begin to doubt that millions of dollars are lost each year because of virus attacks .
Eventually that tally will reach the billions , if it has n't already .

Police claim the sedative would help them deal with people suffering from Excited Delirium Syndrome
They claim this would help them deal with people suffering from Excited Delirium Syndrome , a condition said to give victims very high levels of strength and aggression .
Allowing paramedics to sedate such people could reduce deaths in custody , the Police Federation believes .
Only doctors or other medics can currently decide who is given drugs and officers cannot restrain anyone while a sedative is administered .
Helen Shaw from Inquest , a group for families who have lost loved ones in custody - related deaths , said : “ These proposals are dangerous , particularly if the medication triggers a bad reaction . ”

We know we 're in for some unpleasant medicine after the election , but exactly how bad will it be ?
That 's the question none of the politicians really want to answer .
But you can get some interesting clues by looking across the Irish Sea .
There you find a small country that has been going through something colossal : not just the steepest recession of any developed country since the war , but one of the most ambitious programmes of budget cuts as well .
UK Treasury officials have been over in Dublin in recent weeks , looking for some lessons in how to cut spending here in the UK .
That gave me an added reason to take a look myself .
In two days this week , I learned plenty about the practical realities of cutting borrowing , some of it highly relevant to the situation here .
You could hear some of my interview with the finance minister , Brian Lenihan , on the Today programme this morning .
He 's gained a lot of admiration in Ireland for carrying on with this Herculean task , even after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer late last year .

If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content .
Two interesting nuggets from that interview : he thinks the UK is probably expecting too much from the fall in the pound , and he thinks that whoever wins the next election will almost certainly have to cut popular benefits .
I also learned something about what it means to be a small country on the periphery of the eurozone , dependent on foreign investors for cash .
Like Greece and the rest , Ireland still has some difficult adjustments in its future .
But unlike them , it has bought itself a lot of credit in the markets with the drastic actions the government has taken in the past year .
If there 's an " I " in that infamous acronym , Pigs , investors no longer seem to think it stands for Ireland .
What kind of adjustments ?
Well , you remember the Conservatives have promised to have an emergency Budget if they win office ?
Ireland 's had five in less than two years .
All told , Mr Lenihan announced spending cuts and tax rises for 2009 worth 5 % of GDP .
For perspective , if you undertook that kind of tightening in the UK you'd be taking £ 65 bn out of the economy , in a single year .
That 's roughly what the chancellor has said he will do by 2015 - 16 .
Mr Lenihan unveiled further cuts in December , of 2 % of GDP in 2010 .
Where 's the money come from ?
The short answer is it has come from ( almost ) everyone .
But public - sector workers have probably had it worst : many of them have seen a 20 % cut in their net income .
There 's a new pension levy on public - sector earnings , worth an average of 7 % of pay - in effect a new tax , to pay for the cost of their generous pensions .
I 'm told the UK officials were looking especially hard at that .
On top of that , public salaries were frozen - and then cut : by 5 % for people earning less than 50,000 euros , 10 % for salaries over that .
The taoiseach ( prime minister ) has had his pay cut by 20 % .
Let me highlight some big lessons , plus a few smaller ones .
Doubtless , the main parties here will each see something in Ireland 's experience to support their point of view .
Labour and the Liberal Democrats will say it shows the importance of growth .
Ireland 's national income has shrunk by more than 20 % since 2007 - and it's not growing yet .
Economists agree that the recession has been made longer - and deeper - by the savagery of these cuts .
And the weakness of the economy , in turn , has meant that , to some extent , the government is cutting to stand still .
The deficit was just over 11 % of GDP last year , and even after all those cuts , it 's going to be just over 11 % of GDP in 2010 as well .
That 's because the economy is shrinking even faster than the budget .
Whatever you think of the main parties ' respective positions , we can probably all agree with Labour that that this is a situation it 's better not to get into .
That ''s why Mr Lenihan told me he would have liked to increase spending this time a year ago - when the G20 government were all talking about emergency stimulus .
But the scale of the crisis in the public finances did n't give him a choice : any benefit from extra borrowing would have been more than wiped out by the loss of credibility in the markets .
In this kind of situation , there 's a real risk of a deflationary spiral , with falling prices pushing up the real value of personal and public debts , and choking off the economy .
The IMF raised this as a risk for Ireland last summer .
Prices did fall , economy - wide , last year - by more than 4 % .
And public debt has risen from 27 % of GDP in 20006 , to 78 % now .
But Mr Lenihan is adamant the risk has passed .
Looking at the numbers , I 'm less convinced , but bond traders who have more money riding on the judgement seem to agree with Mr Lenihan .
The spread between German and Irish bond yields is a fraction of what it is in Greece .
Of course , that is where the Conservatives would come in : they 'd say Ireland shows the importance of acting quickly to get on top of borrowing , before the markets force you to do things you do n't want to do .
The Conservatives think the UK is almost at that point right now .
For the record , Mr Lenihan told me he thought the UK still had some room for manoeuvre , though it was shrinking .
So much for the big lessons .
But there are some other interesting pointers for Britain today :
One was it helps to educate people about the nature of the challenge , before you wield the knife .
Not an approach we seem to have adopted here .
This time last year , the Irish government released all its budget papers for 2010 in advance - showing the kind of savings it needed to find .
It then gave an independent commission to lead a national debate about what those cuts should be .
It was asked to find two billion euros in savings .
In the end it came up with more than double that amount , and the population knew what was coming before it was formally announced in December .
Ireland 's experience also confirms that you need to spread the pain , with benefits a large part of the mix .
Again , Mr Lenihan was quite clear on this point for the UK .
He cut all benefits by 4 % in his December budget , including child benefit and unemployment benefit .
This , in a country where unemployment has risen from 4 % to 13 % in less than three years .
There is one group that even Mr Lenihan had to spare : pensioners .
That is probably another lesson for the UK .
In all this , the only measure Mr Lenihan 's been forced to backtrack on was a measure which would have raised medical costs for pensioners .
Finally , Mr Lenihan thought we were taking false comfort from the fall in the pound .
He would say that , you might think - they are one of the big losers from the UK 's decision not to join the euro , and Irish companies have been hit by competition from across the border following the massive fall in the value of the pound .
But he has absolutely no regrets about joining the euro .
We talk a lot about the dark tortured road that these countries on the periphery of the eurozone now have to walk .
In Ireland 's case it 's not been pretty at all : prices are falling , but wages are falling faster .
That 's raising competitiveness the only way a country in the eurozone can .
It 's not much fun .
As Ireland shows , the debt dynamics of having that kind of collapse in national income can force a rise in national debt , as a share of the economy , which not every country could afford .
But Ireland has the benefit of coming into this with a much smaller current account deficit than many of its " Club Med " friends .
It might actually pull it off .
Small countries can do things that countries the size of Britain cannot do .
But Ireland has bet the house on shock therapy to fix both their competitiveness problem - and their fiscal one .
By comparison , here in the UK , even the Conservatives are looking at a more gradualist approach on the budget , and we 're expecting a big depreciation to deliver growth .
Short term , Ireland 's has been far more painful - for the economy and the Irish people .
But it will be interesting to return to the comparison in a a few years ' time .
In the meantime , expect at least some of that Irish medicine to be making an appearance here .
Today it was revealed that servers at Apache.org and Atlassian were successfully attacked , leading to thousands of stolen passwords .
The attack on apache.org 's servers was via JIRA , and since the attack on Atlassian came from the same source , it probably was also through JIRA .
I 'm sure that JIRA 's programmers feel embarrassed enough about all of this -- I do n't want to berate them , or insult them .
Everybody makes mistakes ; almost all software has some pretty bad security vulnerabilities at at times .
Overall , the JIRA guys seem to do good work , and seem to be generally nice people .
And on top of all of that , I understand how they feel !
Whenever there 's a reported security issue in Bugzilla , I freak out .
Thankfully there has n't been an attack on Bugzilla like this JIRA one in recent memory .
But if there was an attack like this , I 'd be absolutely mortified , and the last thing I 'd need would be somebody trying to insult or attack me for simply having made a mistake .
Instead , I want to use this opportunity as a reminder to all web application developers for why web application security is so important , and talk about some of the things that we do in Bugzilla that would have prevented or mitigated an attack like this one , and that web applications should probably all do as standard practice :
Lock down the on - disk permissions of files and directories .
When you install Bugzilla , the actual installation script makes sure that the permissions on Bugzilla 's files and directories are as secure as possible .
That way , even if there is a security compromise in Bugzilla , the attackers can't upload programs and run them , modify existing scripts , or generally do anything nasty to the machine .
It 's particularly important that web applications never allow anything to be uploaded into a location where the web server could execute it .
This is actually something that I rarely see web applications stress , in any of their documentation .
Some web applications recommend that system administrators fix permissions themselves , but the chance is that the vast majority of people installing your software are going to skip the optional security recommendations , and just go for whatever 's easiest .
The only way to guarantee that security happens right on every installation is to have the actual installer do the setting of the permissions .
The attackers configured the Apache JIRA to allow uploads into a location where the webserver would execute files , which is what let them compromise Apache 's servers and steal the passwords of every JIRA user who logged in to the system .
If , like Bugzilla , it was impossible to configure JIRA in that way , that part of the attack would have been impossible .
When you install Bugzilla , the actual installation script makes sure that the permissions on Bugzilla 's files and directories are as secure as possible .
That way , even if there is a security compromise in Bugzilla , the attackers can't upload programs and run them , modify existing scripts , or generally do anything nasty to the machine .
It 's particularly important that web applications allow anything to be uploaded into a location where the web server could execute it .

This is one of the simplest and most effective protections you can make in a web application .
Seriously - - for Bugzilla , it was just a few lines of code , and eliminated a whole set of possible attacks .
All you have to do is to set an extra attribute on cookies when you send them , and you gain a lot of security .
If Javascript must read some of your cookie data , that 's fine , just do n't let it read the login cookie .
If Httponly had been set on the Apache JIRA session cookie , then the cross - site scripting attack that the attackers used could not have stolen administrators ' login privileges .

Okay , look , I know that that 's not practical or possible for everybody .
But I will tell you , a lot of the security bugs that are found in Bugzilla are found by people we 've never met who just happened to be reading the code .
These users find all our security issues before they 're ever exploited , and so we can release fixes before systems are harmed .
In particular , I do n't think there has ever been a successful Cross - site scripting attack performed on a Bugzilla - - at least not any publicly discussed in the six years I 've been working on Bugzilla .
The " many eyes make all bugs shallow " maxim may not always be true , but for security issues , in my experience , it has absolutely held up .
If the cross -site scripting vulnerability in JIRA had been found by an outside user before it was exploited , the Apache JIRA administrators would have been safe from it .

Have automated tests scan your code for potential security issues .
There are lots of ways to do this .
In Bugzilla , we have an automated test that makes sure that we properly " filter " any data that we got from the user or the database before displaying it on a web page , so that people can't inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into our system .
The automated tests do n't always catch our security issues , but the number of times that I 've fixed a security issue in my code thanks to the tests is uncountable -- probably in the thousands , at this point .
And those are fixes that happen before the code even gets checked in , so that 's a security vulnerability that gets fixed before it even becomes a part of the product .
There are lots of other ways to do automated security testing of code , these days .
Static code analysis , Fuzz testing , and automated security scanners seem to be the most popular , from what I 've seen .

Lock out users who fail to guess their password too many times .
There are lots of approaches to account security , but this is one of the simplest and most failsafe .
If an attacker can only guess five passwords every 30 minutes , and then they get locked out , the statistical probability that they will ever guess anybody 's password is pretty slim .
Starting with Bugzilla 3.6 , we implement exactly that policy , and we even notify the Bugzilla administrators whenever somebody gets locked out , so that if there 's a large brute - force password attack , the admins will know immediately .
Some people say that the answer to password security is to have people change their passwords every three months .
This is probably sensible on some systems , but on a web application , it 's mostly pretty ridiculous .
If you only change your password every three months , then that gives an attacker three months to guess your password .
I can promise you that almost any normal user password could be guessed in that time , particularly if the system does n't prevent brute force attacks .
Then once the user has your password , they can usually do everything damaging that they want to do within a few minutes .
So , almost any forced - rotation period is pretty silly , in a pure web application .
( In other systems it can make sense -- it all depends on the context . )
Other people suggest that passwords need to be a certain level of complexity or a certain length , and up to a point , that 's true .
If your password is one of the 100 most - common passwords , then even with a sensible lockout policy , the attacker will eventually guess it , if they keep up over a few days .
( Of course , in Bugzilla , the system administrators would see all of these lockout notices and probably stop the attack pretty quickly .
Still , it 's better to be safe than sorry . )
So your application should probably enforce a level of password complexity that 's sufficient to make it impossible to guess passwords when combined with your lockout policy .
If the Apache JIRA had had brute - force password - guessing protection like Bugzilla 's lockout method , the attackers would not have been able to discover administrators ' passwords using that method .
( My understanding is that newer versions of JIRA do have this protection . )

Store passwords securely .
If you 're going to store a password in the database or anywhere , store it using some standard , secure method .
Do n't just hash the password -- you have to at least salt them .
Preferably , do n't even invent your own password - storage scheme -- just use some library that already exists .
Never store passwords as plain text .
You might be saying to yourself , " Oh , nobody will ever break into the system and steal them . "
That sounds pretty good until somebody does break in and steal them , and then you 'll really be wishing that you stored them properly .
If the Apache JIRA had been storing passwords properly , then Apache.org 's users would be at far less risk of the attackers now knowing all the passwords in JIRA .
And finally , on top of all those points , if you 're a system administrator , upgrade your software regularly .
Some of the security issues that let the Apache JIRA be compromised were supposedly fixed in newer versions of JIRA , before the attack ever happened .
Almost every time I hear of an attack like this , it uses old , known problems to compromise the system .
Nobody likes getting attacked .
Everybody feels bad about it , when it happens -- system administrators , programmers , and most especially users .
So let 's just design secure applications to start with , and never have any of our system administrators or users have to bear the burden of compromised systems and stolen data .

Uncommon Sense - or " Welcome to paragon tier , sucker "
ORLANDO , Fla . ( PAI ) – The Democratic Obama administration is giving only verbal support , and nothing more , for the Employee Free Choice Act , a top legislative priority of organized labor – the movement that played a big part in propelling the president into the Oval Office in 2008 .
That conclusion comes from the response on March 3 to a press conference question to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis , who addressed the AFL - CIO executive council meeting here that day .
She barely mentioned EFCA in her address .
Solis , President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden all have said they support the law , and Obama promises to sign it once it reaches his desk .
But EFCA has n’t even come up in the Senate , where the majority Democrats can’t come up with the 60 votes to stop a planned GOP filibuster – a talkathon which needs just 41 supporting senators and which is backed by a multimillion - dollar big business campaign .
Asked bluntly what she , Biden and Obama would do to pass the law , former Los Angeles Congresswoman Solis replied : “ I ’m not going to tell you I have any ability to persuade members of the House and Senate ” about passing the law .
Solis was then silent about what Biden and Obama would do , instead repeating a story she heard from a Machinist union member the night before about how efforts of workers to organize and better themselves on the job were halted by a vicious employer – showing the need for the Employee Free Choice Act ’s passage .
“ We have a lot of education to do , even when enforcing current laws , ” Solis added in her answer to the press conference question .
And Solis told the council that “ I ’m frustrated , too ” by the slow overall pace of change .
“ It ’s like moving a battleship . ”
The Employee Free Choice
Act would help level the playing field between workers and bosses in organizing drives and in negotiating first contracts .
It would do so by writing majority sign - up , also called card - check recognition , into labor law .
Majority sign - up , part of original labor law , has been recognized by National Labor Relations Board rulings since 1962 .
EFCA ’s version says that when the union gets an NLRB - verified majority of election authorization cards at a worksite , the workers , not the bosses , get to choose between immediate mandated recognition or a board - run election .
EFCA would also sharply increase penalties for labor law - breaking , make it easier to get court orders against violators , and mandate binding arbitration between the union and management over a first contract if the two sides can’t reach agreement on their own within 120 days .
Solis ’ response to the Employee Free Choice
Act question did not surprise Communications Workers President Larry Cohen , chair of the federation ’s organizing committee and an outspokenly vehement backer of the bill .
“ There is no current path to passage ” for it in the Senate , Cohen told Press Associates Union News Service .
House approval of EFCA is taken for granted .
“ The keys to the future are five things we talked about ” to enhance organizing “ and to keep the foundation strong , ” Cohen added .
The “ five things ” include but are not limited to new organizing strategies through Jobs With Justice , publicity about employer law - breaking via American Rights at Work , the federation ’s own Voice at Work drive , and marshaling community and religious allies such as the NAACP .
Legislatively , Cohen said there are “ longer - term ways ” to enact EFCA .
They include changing Senate rules to shut down filibusters , or using reconciliation to pass EFCA .
Reconciliation is a special procedure , usually reserved for spending and tax bills , that bans such talkathons .
Bills need only a simple Senate majority , 51 , to pass .
“ But the most - promising path is to get a functioning NLRB , ” Cohen said , alluding to the fact that the five - member NLRB has had three vacancies since Dec. 31 , 2007 .
Vacancies delay and deny justice to workers : the NLRB rules on labor law - breaking cases and often decides which workers even have the right to union representation .
In her speech to the council , Solis said that even while waiting for EFCA , other remedies could help workers .
“ It does n’t mean we give up ” on the legislation , she said of the Democrats ’ loss of their 60th Senate seat in a special election in Massachusetts earlier this year .
“ It means we need to strategize and work on making things different within our agencies ” at the Labor Department , she added .
Solis spent much of her speech asking for union leaders ’ and members ’ help on Obama administration causes .
One is the health care overhaul , threatened again by a filibuster .
That overhaul includes a 40 percent excise tax , starting in 2018 , on the value of health insurance plans above a minimum of $ 27,500 – a tax Obama forced top union leaders to accept and which upset many council members and rank - and - file unionists .
Others included comprehensive immigration reform , influencing Department of Labor proposals to make final rules more worker - friendly , and more relief – including another jobs bill – for the unemployed .
And Solis touted Labor Department reversals of anti-worker GOP Bush regime rules and policies in areas such as lost pay and overtime and job safety and health .

BISHKEK ( Reuters ) - Kyrgyzstan ’s self - proclaimed new leadership said on Thursday that Russia had helped to oust President Kurmanbek Bakiyev , and that they aimed to close a U.S. airbase that has irritated Moscow .
Their comments set Wednesday ’s overthrow of Bakiyev , who fled the capital Bishkek as crowds stormed government buildings , firmly in the context of superpower rivalry in central Asia .
No sooner had presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev signed an arms reduction pact in Prague as part of an effort to “ reset ” strained relations than a senior official in Medvedev ’s delegation urged Kyrgyzstan ’s new rulers to shut the base .
The official , who declined to be named , noted that Bakiyev had not fulfilled a promise to shut the Manas airbase , which the United States uses to supply NATO troops in Afghanistan .
He said there should be only one base in Kyrgyzstan -- a Russian one .
Omurbek Tekebayev , a former Kyrgyz opposition leader who took charge of constitutional matters in the new government , said that “ Russia played its role in ousting Bakiyev . ”
“ You ’ve seen the level of Russia ’s joy when they saw Bakiyev gone , ” he told Reuters .
“ So now there is a high probability that the duration of the U.S. air base ’s presence in Kyrgyzstan will be shortened . ”
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin denied that Moscow had played a part in the turmoil in the former Soviet republic , which Russia openly regards as part of its own back yard .
But he was the first foreign leader to recognize opposition figure Roza Otunbayeva as leader of Kyrgyzstan , and rang her soon after she said she was in charge .
The United States said it had not yet decided whether to recognize Otunbayeva ’s government , and did not say who it believed was in control .
Russia ’s top general said 150 paratroopers had been sent to Russia ’s own Kant base in Kyrgyzstan , and Medvedev ’s office said they would protect Russian citizens at its embassy and other diplomatic facilities .
Otunbayeva , who once served as Bakiyev ’s foreign minister , said the interim government controlled the whole country except for Bakiyev ’s power base of Osh and Jalalabad in the south , and had the backing of the armed forces and border guards .
She said the situation in Kyrgyzstan ’s economy was “ fairly alarming ” and it would need foreign aid .
She said Putin had asked how Russia could help .
FLYING TO MOSCOW
“ We agreed that my first deputy and the republic ’s former prime minister , Almaz Atambayev , would fly to Moscow and formulate our needs , ” she told Russian Ekho Moskvy radio .
Putin did not promise a specific sum , she said .
“ But the fact that he called , spoke nicely , went into detail , asked about details -- generally , I was moved by that .
It is a signal . ”
Otunbayeva said Bakiyev was holed up in Jalalabad .
“ What we did yesterday was our answer to the repression and tyranny against the people by the Bakiyev regime , ” she told reporters .
Kyrgyzstan , a country of 5.3 million people , has few natural resources but has made the most of its position at the intersection of Russian , U.S. and Chinese spheres of influence .

Washington has used Manas to supply U.S. - led NATO forces fighting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan since losing similar facilities in Uzbekistan , apparently after pressure from Moscow .
Bakiyev announced the Manas base would close during a visit to Moscow last year at which he secured $ 2 billion in crisis aid , only to agree later to keep it open at a higher rent .
The U.S. charge d’affaires in Bishkek met Otunbayeva , while in Washington a top U.S. diplomat received Bakiyev ’s foreign minister , Kadyrbek Sarbayev .
“ Our message to both is the same , ” State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told a news briefing .
“ We will continue to urge them to resolve this in a peaceful way . ”
Slideshow ( 24 images )
Michael McFaul , a senior White House adviser on Russia told reporters in Prague : “ This is not some anti-American coup .
That we know for sure , and this is not a sponsored - by - the - Russians coup . ”
He said Medvedev and Obama had not discussed the base .
A U.S. official said they had considered making a joint statement on Kyrgyzstan , but none was issued .
AIRBASE STILL OPERATING
The Pentagon said limited operations were continuing at Manas , and support to Afghanistan had not been seriously harmed .
Pentagon officials say Manas has been central to the war effort , allowing around - the - clock combat airlifts and airdrops , medical evacuation and aerial refueling , and that alternative solutions would be less efficient and more expensive .
Bakiyev , himself brought to power by a “ people power ” revolution in 2005 , told Reuters by telephone that he had no plans to step down , but offered to talk to the opposition leaders who have claimed control of Kyrgyzstan .
“ I ca n’t say that Russia is behind this , ” he said .
“ I do n’t want to say that -- I just do n’t want to believe it . ”
Speaking to Russia ’s Ekho Moskvy radio , he acknowledged that he had little control over events in the capital .
With rioters roaming the streets and widespread looting after a day in which dozens were killed in clashes between protesters and police , the self - proclaimed new interior minister ordered security forces to fire on looters .
Bishkek awoke to blazing cars and burned - out shops on Thursday after a day in which at least 75 people were killed .
Smoke billowed from the seven - storey White House , the main seat of government , as crowds rampaged through it .
Looting was widespread and shots could still be heard on Thursday night .
The uprising was sparked by discontent over corruption , nepotism and rising utility prices .
A third of the population live below the poverty line .
Remittances from the 800,000 Kyrgyz working in Russia make up about 40 percent of Kyrgyzstan ’s GDP .
Another 10 percent or so comes from the giant Kumtor gold mine , operated by Canada ’s Centerra Gold .
Centerra said operations were unaffected by the turmoil , but its shares were down around 5 percent on the day , following an 11 percent fall on Wednesday . [ n N08121726 ]
New revelations of child molestation by Catholic priests , and the Pope 's indifference , have his critics and defenders locked in a holy war of words .
Some anticipate his downfall .
Others see a secularist smear campaign .
Here 's your guide to the controversy .
It 's been a rough month for Pope Benedict XVI .
First , his letter to Irish Catholics apologizing for past abuses by priests there did n't go over well .
Then the Times printed documents showing that while Benedict headed the Church 's office charged with defrocking priests , he ignored reports of a bishop who molested 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin .
And before that , as archbishop of Munich , he allowed a known pedophile to continue leading a parish .
Finally , this weekend the Pope had enough .
He struck back against the media during his Palm Sunday address , saying he wo n't be " intimidated by petty gossip , " and that he does n't appreciate the " ignoble attempts " to tarnish his good name .
Yesterday , the Times ran an article that says as archbishop of Munich , the Pope , then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , " expended more energy pursuing theological dissidents than sexual predators , " and that he was n't much concerned with the day - to - day managerial side of being archbishop .
Like the annoying amount of paperwork that probably goes along with prosecuting a kiddie - toucher ?
Instead , he focused on more important things , like disciplining a priest for leading a mass at a peace rally in 1981 .
That priest eventually left the Church , disillusioned .
In an editorial on Friday , the National Catholic Reporter said , " the Holy Father needs to directly answer questions , in a credible forum , about his role [ … ] in the mismanagement of the clergy sex abuse crisis . "
Andrew Sullivan thinks the Pope's " cult of total authority " stands in the way of owning up to any personal culpability , and diminishes the authority of the Catholic Church .
" It 's obvious he should resign .
It 's also obvious he cannot .
That 's why this crisis is so grave , " Sullivan writes .
Even Sinead O'Connor jumped in , railing against Benedict in a Sunday Washington Post op -ed .
The Guardian polled its readers over the weekend :
But the Vatican is fighting back .
It started Twitter pages in six different languages on March 20 .
The first tweet was a link to Benedict 's letter to Irish Catholics .
And the Pope even has a fan club !
They have a website called the The Benedict Blog , and lately it has been busy countering the Pope 's critics in the nasty , secular press .
The Telegraph 's Blogs Editor , Damian Thompson , goes after " liberal Catholics " for Pope - bashing , and for trying to " sabotage " Benedict 's " liturgical reforms . "
New York 's Archbishop Timothy Dolan rushed to the Pope 's defense and compared his plight to the persecution of Jesus , saying " Palm Sunday mass is surely a fitting place for us to express our love for and solidarity for our earthly shepherd now suffering from the same unjust accusation and shouts of the mob as Jesus did . "
The Times ' religion reporter , Laurie Goodstein , has really pissed off the Vatican .
She blew open the story of Reverend Lawrence Murphy , the kiddie - touching Milwaukee priest with a thing for deaf children .
Goodstein writes :
Top Vatican officials - including the future Pope Benedict XVI - did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys , even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the church , according to church files newly unearthed as part of a lawsuit .
The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , the future pope , shows that while church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed , their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal .
The documents emerge as Pope Benedict is facing other accusations that he and direct subordinates often did not alert civilian authorities or discipline priests involved in sexual abuse when he served as an archbishop in Germany and as the Vatican 's chief doctrinal enforcer . "
The documents can be seen here .
Then there 's Rev. Peter Hullerman .
He molested boys at his parish in Germany , was sent to therapy for pedophilia , and days later returned to work with children .
He was convicted of molesting boys at another parish that Benedict helped transfer him to .
But supporters of the Pope are trying to lay the blame on his right hand man , Rev. Gerhard Gruber .
There 's some really bizarre stuff out there , too , like this YouTube video .
In a " parody " of the 2004 movie Downfall , Adolf Hitler learns of Benedict 's popularity among " the youth " and loses his mind .
One of Hitler 's aides in the bunker tells him : " But at least we got the secular media against [ Benedict ] . "
Are they equating critics of the Pope with Nazis ?
No , of course not .
It 's a parody !
Ha !
Kind of like posting the picture below of Benedict , then Herr Joseph Ratzinger , as a totally unenthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth .
Funny stuff !
So there 's your 2010 papal scandal as of today .
The chorus of prominent Catholics demanding his resignation is growing , but if the Pope 's latest comments are any indicator , old Ratzinger is not going down without a fight .

Happy Birthday , Gordie Howe " Mr. Hockey , " who reigned for 30 years as the NHL's all - time leading scorer , turned 82 Wednesday .
Howe is spending the day with his sons , Mark and Marty , his former teammates with the WHA 's Houston Aeros and Hartford Whalers , at his home in Detroit .
" I 've got the boys here and we 're going through boxes and drawers , looking at pictures and trophies , having fun , " Howe said .
" I have n't seen some of these in several years .
Mark says it 's about 20 years since we went through some of this stuff .
" Think of the treasure trove in those boxes .
Howe helped lead the Detroit Red Wings to four Stanley Cups from 1950 - 55 as a member of the famed " Production Line " with Ted Lindsay and Sid Abel , and later Alex Delvecchio Howe , who played from 1947 - 80 , left the NHL with 1,850 points on 801 goals and 1,049 assists in 1,767 games , and still ranks No. 3 behind Wayne Gretzky ( 2,857 points ) and Mark Messier ( 1,887 ) .
A model of consistency , Howe finished in the top five in NHL scoring for 20 consecutive seasons .
His teams played for the championship in 15 of his 32 professional seasons .
Howe was selected to 21 NHL All - Star squads , 12 times to the First Team .
Six times he led the NHL in scoring to capture the Art Ross Trophy , and six times he won the Hart Trophy as the League 's most valuable player .
He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972 .
Howe said turning 82 is better thanturning 82 but he can't believe " how old I am .
I remember when Mel Hill turned 70 and I thought that was old . " " Sudden Death " Hill , the star of the 1939 Stanley Cup , turned 70 in 1984 .
Hill 's three sudden - death overtime goals in the 1939 semifinal against the New York Rangers helped the Boston Bruins to the championship .
They defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games .
Howe was told he still has a way to go to catch up to Hill 's old Boston Bruins teammate Milt Schmidt , who turned 92 on March 5 .
" Shows you what drinking only good beer will do for you , " Howe quipped .
It seemed like he met almost everyone in Canada during his years of summer tours on behalf of Eaton 's Department Stores .
He 's got a great memory for names and faces and he's as likely to give you a noogie or muss your hair as hand out a compliment .
Everyone comes away feeling better after talking to Gordie Howe

By pushing a cluster of just 60 ions with a tiny electric field , researchers have measured the most minuscule force ever .
The result , measuring mere yoctonewtons ( 10 ^ - 24 newtons ) , beats previous record lows by several orders of magnitude .
The group behind the measurements , based at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , Colorado , hopes that the technique can eventually lead to new tools for measuring the minuscule features of materials ' surfaces .
Tiny force measurements are crucial for imaging atomic surfaces and detecting nuclear spins , but they are difficult to make because of the tiny dimensions involved .
To date , researchers have successfully measured around an attonewton ( 10 ^ - 18 N ) of force by giving small pushes to microscopic paddles or wires and then watching them vibrate .
These systems work well , but are limited by factors such as their relatively large size .
The new technique eschews the paddle - type systems in favor of just 60 beryllium - 9 ions .
The group flattened the ions into a tiny " pancake " and suspended this in mid-air using magnetic fields .
They then fired a laser at the ions , lead author Michael Biercuk , now at the University of Sydney in Australia , writes in a paper on the physics preprint server arXiv.org .
By carefully tuning the laser , they extracted energy from the atomic pancake until it reached a temperature of just 0.5 millikelvins .
The team then nudged their pancake with a small electric field .
The nudge shook the ions and caused a discernible change in the reflected laser light .
On the basis of the size of the change , the team estimates that it has measured a force as small as 174 yoctonewtons -- about a thousand times smaller than previous measurements .
Tiny force shunts tiny mass
" What makes it work is that the system is so light , " says Chris Monroe , a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the research .
Newton 's second law of motion states that force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration , so a tiny mass is sensitive to a tiny force .
Weighing in at around 0.1 yoctokilograms , 60 beryllium - 9 ions make one of the lightest force probes possible .
There is nothing particularly new about the technique , Monroe adds .
Clusters of ultracold atoms are already the focus of many studies in their own right .
The team 's insight was that the ultracold ions would make for supersensitive force detectors .
In their paper , the researchers say that even more sensitive detections might be possible with fewer ions .
Monroe says that he agrees in principle , but notes that as the number of ions shrinks , so will the laser signal crucial to the measurement .
The team behind the work says that a single ion could detect an even smaller force .
True enough , says Monroe , assuming the ion itself can be accurately measured .
Ultimately , the team hopes that beryllium ions could be used as tiny force detectors in all sorts of measurement .
" In principle , you could try to use this for fundamental force measurements , " says Konrad Lehnert , a researcher at JILA in Boulder , who held the previous measurement record for work using a vibrating wire .
In particular , it might be possible to test gravity and quantum effects at ultra-short scales .
But Monroe cautions that the technique should not be oversold .
The ions must be kept isolated in a vacuum chamber in order to work , he notes , making actual applications tricky .
" It 's not going to be used to find oil tomorrow or anything , " he says .
But he adds that it may well be possible to develop the atomic pancakes into something more practical .
Scope out the store .
This may seem like overkill , but trust me , it will make your life easier in the long run .
Take some time to note the organization of the stores you go to .
If the aisles are numbered , jot down what is offered in each aisle .
When you make your list , you will organize everything using this information .*
Make a list of what you already have .
Before you even think about what you need to buy , go through your cupboards , fridge , and freezer and write down everything you already have .
This will take a while the first time , but after that it will be quick to update the list , crossing off things you 've used and adding things you 've purchased ( you can even post your completed shopping list on the fridge door as a record of what you 've got ) .
If items are running low ( rice , sugar , flour , etc. ) , add them to your shopping list .
Now when you go shopping , you can be confident you 're not buying yet another can of tuna or jar of capers , and you 're much less likely to end up tossing half the things in your fridge simply because you forgot you had them and they 've gone bad .
Plan some meals for the week using what you have
Gather your list of what 's on hand and some recipe books and magazines , log onto bonappetit.com and put together a rough meal plan for a week .
Add the ingredients you will need to buy to your shopping list .
Organize your list
& get on the phone
Using the intel you gathered in step one , divide your list by store and then by aisles within each store .
You should be able to start at the top and get everything without crisscrossing the store trying to find the right aisle .
Callthe store ahead of time and order your meat and fish so they 'll beready to pick - up when you get to the market .
Or , if you 're not thatorganized , go to the meat and fish counter first and order what youneed , then shop for the rest of your groceries and pick up your meat orfish when it 's time to check out .
Buy fragile items last
Most grocery storesencourage you to start in the produce aisle , but resist this urge .
Ifyou leave produce for last , you can ensure that your delicate lettuceswo n't end up squashed by cans of tomatoes
** 6 . Bring a pencil
Thisseems so obvious , and yet it 's so easy to forget :
Put a check next toeach item as you add it to your basket .
Do n't forget to addspur - of - the - moment items to the list so you have a record of whatyou 're taking home with you .
We live in the golden age of ubiquitous computing .
Many elements of Weiser ’s bold vision are today commonplace in the lives of billions of people .
Without even thinking about it , we today routinely search the web , reach out to people with our mobile internet devices , and find places and things with positioning technologies .
Together the myriad devices and services that make up the internet form an unprecedented ubicomp platform of simply tremendous possibilities .
We have seen many wonderful ubicomp systems , and research shows us that more are heading our way .
The bad news is , greater failures are heading our way , too .
Each new generation of systems brings added functionality , which inevitably means added complexity somewhere in the systems .
This , in turn , creates numerous new failure modes with each generation .
Moreover , increasing connectivity brings novel ways to propagate the failures into other systems .
We see around us major shortcomings in terms of usability , interoperability , and security , and worse can be expected , should your cup be half empty .
This talk will explore some of the factors that shape the ubicomp field – breakneck speeds of innovation , unstoppable technology development , maturing of services and information economies , among others – and discuss why such developments may have undesirable consequences .
On a positive note , this talk will also identify other promising factors that may ultimately render our cup more than half full .
As of last week , there is now a U.S. Government national security agency called the Biometrics Identity Management Agency ( BIMA ) .
It supersedes a Biometrics Task Force that was established in 2000 .
Though nominally a component of the Army , the biometrics agency has Defense Department - wide responsibilities .
“ The Biometrics Identity Management Agency leads Department of Defense activities to prioritize , integrate , and synchronize biometrics technologies and capabilities and to manage the Department of Defense ’s authoritative biometrics database to support the National Security Strategy , ” according to a March 23 Order ( pdf ) issued by Army Secretary John M. McHugh that redesignated the previous Biometrics Task Force as the BIMA .
Biometrics is generally defined as “ a measurable biological ( anatomical and physiological ) [ or ] behavioral characteristic that can be used for automated recognition . ”
“ Biometric data [ are ] normally unclassified , ” according to a 2008 DoD directive ( pdf ) .
“ However , elements of the contextual data , information associated with biometric collection , and / or associated intelligence analysis may be classified . ”
“ Biometrics - enabled Intelligence [ refers to ] intelligence information associated with and or derived from biometrics data that matches a specific person or unknown identity to a place , activity , device , component , or weapon that supports terrorist / insurgent network and related pattern analysis , facilitates high value individual targeting , reveals movement patterns , and confirms claimed identity . ”
“ Biometrics is an important enabler that shall be fully integrated into the conduct of DoD activities to support the full range of military operations , ” the 2008 directive stated .
“ Every day thousands of [ biometric ] records are collected and sent to the Department of Defense ( DOD ) Automated Biometric Identification System ( ABIS ) to store and compare against existing records , ” a 2009 DoD report ( pdf ) said .
“ The technology is improving such that a submission from theater [ e.g. , in Afghanistan ] can be searched in the DOD ABIS and a response sent back to theater in less than two minutes . ”
“ Realtime positive identification of persons of interest enables Coalition forces to target , track , and prosecute known or potential adversaries , ” the DoD report said .
College athletics makes up a significant part of not only your college experience but of the national sports obsession .
Coaches are paid millions of dollars and receive hefty bonuses for performing well in national championships and bringing major attention and funding to their schools .
And while the players still have to go to class make certain grades , they 're often viewed as rock stars on campus and by the general public , not to mention professional sports teams and recruiters .
With all of this attention comes a lot of temptation , too .
Keep reading for the top 10 coaching ( and player ) scandals in college history .
Mike Leach , Texas Tech : Former Texas
Tech head football coach Mike Leach has a famous temper , but when he was suspended just before the Valero Alamo Bowl in January 2010 , Leach enemies and friends were appalled .
The school investigated Leach after a player , Adam James — also son of ESPN college football commentator Craig James — claimed that Leach banished him to a dark closet - like room for three hours after he suffered a concussion .
According to ESPN 's website , " a source told The Associated Press that James said Leach told him if he came out , he would be kicked off the team . "
Leach maintained that he had a doctor examine James and then put him in an equipment room to recover .
Other rumors about James ' disrespect and false sense of entitlement towards his status on the team , his teammates and Leach culminated when he told his father about the concussion treatment .
Since Leach was let go just before the game , Texas Tech was not required to award him his $ 75,000 bonus for participating in a BCS bowl , or the $ 250,000 bonus if they 'd won .
Rick Pitino , University of Louisville : University of Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino admitted in 2009 to having had sex with a woman who was not his wife in 2003 .
He issued a public apology after the woman tried to extort money from him .
Despite a claim that Pitino took advantage of her — and may have raped her — the police only charged the woman with extortion , and the University of Louisville president James Ramsey stuck by Pitino .
In a twist reported by ESPN , however , the woman and her parents denied ever having made any extortion requests , and believe that Pitino made it all up .
Mike Price , University of Alabama : Hard partying Alabama football coach did little to help the image of the powerhouse sports school that also had a reputation for heavy boozing .
The school welcomed a new president , Robert Witt , in March 2003 , who gave Price a warning to clean up his public drinking .
But two months later , Price was fired after he spent around $ 1,200 on tips at a strip club , drinks , and room service during a night of revelry in Pensacola , FL .
Baylor University basketball scandal : Conservative Baylor University was hit with a shocking scandal in 2002 and 2003 that resulted in the mysterious death of a promising athlete and serious allegations of violating NCAA regulations .
Two Baylor basketball players , Patrick Dennehy and Carlton Dotson bought weapons after reporting threats made to them by other players , and shortly after , they disappeared .
Dennehy 's car was found in Virginia Beach a few weeks later , and police eventually arrested Dotson for the boy 's murder , and he pled guilty in 2005 .
In addition to the murder , Baylor University President Robert B. Sloan created an investigative panel to research any alleged NCAA violations involving Dennehy 's involvement with the team .
They found that head coach David Bliss had ignored drug abuse by team members and was guilty of recruiting violations .
Bliss resigned in 2002 , and the NCAA imposed sanctions on Baylor 's basketball program .
Clem Haskins , University of Minnesota : Minnesota Public Radio reports that this scandal was deemed by the NCAA as being " among the most serious cases of academic fraud in 20 years . "
In 1999 , reporters discovered that University of Minnesota basketball tutor and office manager Jan Gangelhoff had apparently forged homework assignments for players over five years .
Apparently head coach Clem Haskins was also involved , as well as academic adviser Alonzo Newby .
The University of Minnesota returned 90 % of money awarded to them from three NCAA tournaments , a move which saved them from severe NCAA sanctions .
John Calipari , UMass and Memphis : Men 's basketball coach John Calipari has been praised for bringing teams to national championships , but was also named " the sleaziest coach " by Slate.com for two separate scandals he was involved in at two separate schools .
While Calipari was at University of Massachusetts , he took his team to the Final Four , which they won in 1996 .
The NCAA took away the honor in 1997 after it was discovered that Calipari and player Marcus Camby had accepted jewelry , expensive cars and hookers from agents and other insiders .
Calipari moved on to coach Memphis , which he brought to the championships in 2008 .
In 2009 , however , the NCAA took away those honors and even made the school pay back tournament revenues .
This time , it was because of his participation in a scandal involving SAT fraud .
University of Colorado at Boulder football scandal :
This famous scandal was a big story in 2004 , and everyone from the school to the National Organization for Women became involved .
Ten women submitted claims that they were raped and / or sexually assaulted by University of Colorado at Boulder football players at off - campus parties .
CU coach Gary Barnett was suspended , but in the spring of that year , some students and members of the community believed that the women were unsure of the real meaning of rape or sexual assault and may have made false allegations against the players .
Pokey Chatman , LSU : LSU women 's basketball coach Pokey Chatman had to resign in March 2007 , after a story was publicized about her sexual affair with one of her female players .
Chatman announced her resignation quietly and did not mention the affair at first .
She was allowed to coach the team during the NCAA tournament , but when the real story came out , she opted out of the tournament .
University of Colorado recruitment scandal : Another scandal involving the University of Colorado focuses on unethical recruitment practices .
Beginning in December 1997 , USA Today reports that rape , sexual assault , underage drinking , providing minors with alcohol , strippers , and sexual harassment were a regular part of football recruitment season .
Recruits harassed CU athletes and students and high school students , and some scholarships were revoked .
Head football coach Gary Burnett was put on administrative leave in February 2002 .
William & Mary Scandal of 1951 : Even before WWII , The College of William & Mary was on its way to becoming an NCAA powerhouse .
Head football coach Rube McCray earned a higher salary than any professor at the school , and students with suffering scores and grades were given nearly all of the school 's allotted scholarship money if they were solid athletes .
The athletic department , under the direction of McCray , started adjusting high school transcripts and college grades .
The school enjoyed the best athletic records in its history until 1951 , when the scandal was uncovered .
McCray and men's basketball coach resigned .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev promised to shut the reactor
Russia has shut down its last weapons - grade plutonium reactor .
The move came after a pledge this week from Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a 47 - nation nuclear security summit in Washington .
Plant bosses pressed the red " stop " button to commence decommissioning process at 0400 , the official Russian news agency reported .
The ADE - 2 reactor opened in 1964 in Zheleznogorsk , then a secret city known as Krasnoyarsk - 26 .
Some 2,500 miles east of Moscow , the military production complex was founded in 1950 on the orders of Joseph Stalin .
Two other reactors there were closed in 1992 , said Yelena Golovinkina , spokeswoman for the Mining - Chemical Complex , which houses the reactor .
Russia 's defence ministry stopped using the plutonium for military needs in 1995 , and the plant was used mainly to heat the city of Zheleznogorsk , she added .
' Important step '
The closure of the reactor came after Mr Obama and Mr Medvedev signed a nuclear disarmament treaty , described by both sides as a major step towards improving strained US - Russian relations .
The powers pledged to dispose of 34 tons of excess weapons - grade plutonium each , enough to make 17,000 weapons .
The cost of disposing of the Russian plutonium would be $ 2.5bn , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov estimated .
The US will contribute $ 400 m to the Russian disposal .
The US president hailed the move by his Russian counterpart after Tuesday 's summit .
" This important step forward continues to demonstrate Russia 's leadership on nuclear security issues , and will add momentum to our shared global effort , " Mr Obama said .
Three people have been taken to hospital after they were attacked by a rogue goat at a nursing home in Melbourne ’s outer east this morning .
The animal escaped from a property in Donvale and set upon an elderly volunteer gardener at the On Luck Chinese Nursing Home just before 11 am .

The gardener had attempted to shoo the goat , named Billy , away with a bunch of weeds when it started butting him repeatedly .
The Cincinnati Tea Party was a little too free market on Tax Day for Fox News , which scrubbed conservative commentator Sean Hannity 's planned appearance at its rally .
Fox News said the Hannity appearance was canceled over admission fees charged by organizers , and the conservative host returned to New York instead of taping his television show at the rally .
" Fox News never agreed to allow the Cincinnati Tea Party organizers to use Sean Hannity 's television program to profit from broadcasting his show from the event , " Bill Shine , Fox News executive vice president for programming , said in a statement .
Tea party organizers announced to the crowd Thursday evening that Hannity had a " personal emergency . "
Cincinnati Tea Party spokesman Justin Binik - Thomas later said organizers were getting conflicting information on the reason .
He said admission fees that started at $ 5 were meant to cover the event 's costs and the party would n't even break even .
At least 7,500 tickets were sold , including some 2,000 at $ 20 each for seats near Hannity as he did interviews for his show .
One of the remaining stars was Samuel " Joe the Plumber " Wurzelbacher , a Toledo - area man who became nationally known for questioning Barack Obama about his tax plan during the 2008 presidential campaign .
Wurzelbacher and Oscar - winning actor Jon Voight were scheduled to be Hannity 's guests ; Wurzelbacher stayed and spoke to the rally .
He drew an ovation with a talk emphasizing patriotism , taking responsibility and getting involved .
" We need to get behind real Americans , " he said , warning the crowd not to let " a bunch of liberal pansies " take away their rights .
" Illegal immigration ? " he said .
" Put a fence up and start shooting . "
People began arriving hours before the rally at the University of Cincinnati basketball arena , many lining up for a planned book signing by Hannity .
Workers took down the names and addresses of those in line with Hannity 's " Conservative Victory " book and said signature plates signed by Hannity would be sent to them .
Workers also handed out tiny red , white and blue footballs with Hannity 's name on them .
Despite disappointment over Hannity 's absence , the crowd showed that the tea party was connecting with people opposed to bigger government and politicians who do n't keep their promises , organizer Mike Wilson said .
" The people who are passionate about this movement are sick of being lied to by elected officials , " Wilson said .
Terris Mullenix , 42 , said he was attending his first tea party event .
He had a book for Hannity to sign but said he wanted to come to the rally anyway because he agrees that the government is getting too big , intrusive and taxing too much .
" I support it in every way , " he said .
Some had such signs as " Will Work for Liberty , " and tables were set up to sell tea party T - shirts , bumper stickers and magnets .
One vendor sold " Obama Express " fake credit cards , supposedly meant for " spreading the wealth . "
Elsewhere in Ohio , the Columbus Tea Party was expecting some 5,000 people for its evening rally at the Statehouse .
ProgressOhio , a liberal policy group , said in a Tax Day statement that Obama 's policies have given tax breaks to most working Ohioans and helped the state with stimulus funds
( Health.com ) -- Elaine Murszewski is a self - proclaimed coffee addict .
" I have been a coffee drinker for more years than I can remember , " she says .
" My coffeemaker must have an auto - start feature so that when I wake up , it 's ready . "
The 53 - year - old former software company representative from Aurora , Colorado , never uses cream or milk because they just " spoil the taste . "
She prefers coffee over alcohol -- even at a bar .
Murszewski has a lot of company .
More than half of adults in the U.S. , or 54 percent , are habitual coffee drinkers , according to the National Coffee Association .
In fact , 146 billion cups are consumed in the U.S. each year , nearly three times more than tea .
But for years , coffee had a bad reputation .
Linked in many people 's minds with smoking , coffee is associated with over - caffeination and insomnia .
The caffeine found in coffee can stay in your system for up to 12 hours , making it more difficult to fall asleep , and it affects your quality of sleep as well .
Caffeine is also a diuretic , meaning that it increases urine output , which can lead to dehydration .
Health.com : 12 surprising sources of caffeine
The general consensus used to be that tea was the better bet in terms of health benefits .
But recent research suggests that despite the downsides of coffee , the " devil 's brew " does have an upside : Coffee drinkers may be at lower risk of liver and colon cancer , type 2 diabetes , and Parkinson 's disease .
Health.com :
The many perks of coffee
And in 2009 , two coffee studies suggested additional benefits : Coffee - drinking men seemed to have a lower risk of advanced or lethal prostate cancer than other men , and middle - aged people who drank moderate amounts of coffee -- three to five cups a day -- had the lowest risk for dementia and Alzheimer 's disease later in life compared to less ( or more ) frequent drinkers .
Can drinking coffee even help you live longer ?
Maybe .
A 2008 study found that women who drank coffee regularly -- up to six cups a day -- were less likely to die of various causes during the study than their non-coffee - drinking counterparts .
Because consumption of decaf coffee showed similar results , researchers do n't think caffeine is at work .
Coffee contains antioxidants
While coffee drinkers may have other lifestyle habits that could explain the potential health benefits , researchers are also looking for compounds in coffee that explain the results .
One possibility ?
Antioxidants , those healthy compounds most often associated with fruits and vegetables .
While the amount of antioxidants per serving is indeed much higher in things like berries , beans , and pecans , these foods are consumed less frequently than coffee .
In fact , a 2005 study found that Americans get more antioxidants from coffee than anywhere else .
More than half of adults drink coffee daily , and the average coffee drinker downs about three cups each day .
" Most people drink it for the caffeine , " says Joe A. Vinson , Ph.D. , a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton who led the 2005 study and has studied coffee extensively .
" [ But ] it 's the Number 1 source of antioxidants in the U.S. diet . "
Polyphenols or flavonoids , the type of antioxidants found in coffee , are also found in other foods and drinks , like tea , red wine , and chocolate .
All three have been proven to moderately help brain function , a benefit that can't be chalked up to caffeine , says Vinson , who has received speaking fees from the National Coffee Association .
Caffeine , the most commonly used drug in the U.S. , says Vinson , does affect alertness , but has n't been found to offer much in the way of health benefits .
Health.com :
The healing power of tea
Polyphenols are the " the good guys in coffee , " says Vinson .
" If you 're not interested in keeping alert , then it seems decaf coffee would be your best bet . "
Researchers have investigated other compounds in coffee , such as chlorogenic acid , which also gives eggplant its bitter flavor .
In fact , there are potentially hundreds of biologically active compounds in coffee .
" One of the detriments of working with foods and beverages is they 're mixtures , " says Vinson .
" There 's no magic bullet compound ; it 's the mix . "
The beneficial effects could be due to natural agents that discourage the growth of harmful bacteria , or those that encourage the growth of helpful bacteria , called probiotics .
Coffee may also alter levels of gut peptides , the hormones naturally released to control things like hunger or fullness .
Coffee may even have a hormone - like effect in the body , says Clinton Allred , an assistant professor in the department of nutrition and food science at Texas A&M University .
A compound known as trigonelline " can act like estrogen , " he says .
" People did n't know coffee would carry such activity . "
Because it acts as a hormone , trigonelline may be dangerous in women who have breast cancer , but it may also protect against colon cancer .
" Estrogen is preventative of tumor formation for colon cancer , we believe , " says Allred .
" But it 's just way too early for us to know [ all ] this particular compound could do . "
Coffee drinkers may have healthier lifestyles
Another obstacle in pinpointing the benefits of coffee is that it 's difficult to isolate the effects of coffee from other healthy habits or lifestyles associated with coffee drinking .
A 1999 study of coffee and tea consumption in Scotland , for instance , found that coffee drinkers were younger , had higher incomes , and were healthier in general than tea drinkers .
Coffee drinkers in the U.S. seem to fit a similar profile .
Seventy percent of Americans with an annual household income of $ 150,000 or more drink coffee , compared with 54 percent of Americans in a household making less than $ 25,000 a year , according to consumer market research firm Experian Simmons .
Research has shown for decades that poorer people are more likely to die from virtually any cause than people with a higher socioeconomic status .
Wealthier people are more likely to be physically active and eat healthier , and less likely to smoke -- behaviors that could prevent some of the conditions assumed to be affected by coffee .
" That 's the problem [ with most of the studies done on coffee ] , " says Vinson .
" There 's no perfect study out there because they can't control all the variables .
The problem with a human study is everybody 's different . "
To isolate the benefits of the coffee in particular , newer studies have focused on filtering out the effects of less - than - healthy behaviors , like smoking , that coffee drinkers are likely to engage in .
In a 2008 study , Esther Lopez - Garcia , a researcher in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the Autonomous University of Madrid , in Spain , found that coffee drinkers had a slightly lower risk of death from all causes than people who did n't drink coffee .
Although the participants in her study were all nurses and health professionals , she says the results are probably applicable to people with similar education and socioeconomic status .
" However , " she warns , " [ generalizing the results ] has to be made with precaution , because it 's clear that socioeconomic status influences mortality . "
Of course , coffee is n't a quick fix , and may even cause problems in some people .
It can worsen existing heart conditions , and caffeine could cause sleeping problems , as well as a racing heartbeat and anxiety .
Plus , many coffee drinkers are only adding calories and fat to their diet by mixing in heavy cream and too much sugar .

More research needs to be completed before doctors can recommend coffee to their patients , experts say .
" It is always difficult to give dietary recommendations based on studies that lasted only several months , because they cannot investigate long - term effects , " says Christian Herder , a diabetes researcher at Heinrich Heine University , in Dusseldorf , Germany .
In a 2010 study , for instance , Herder found that changes in coffee - drinking habits had no adverse effects on diabetes risk factors .
But because the study lasted only three months , he says , it did n't provide enough evidence to directly recommend -- or prohibit -- drinking coffee .
" There seems to be no reason to discourage middle - aged men and women from drinking coffee , " Herder adds .
However , says Lopez - Garcia , " anyone with health problems that can be worsened by coffee -- insomnia , anxiety , hypertension , or heart problems -- should ask the doctor about his specific risk . "
A better understanding of the risks and benefits of coffee might not come anytime soon .
" Studies are few and far between , " says Vinson .
Plus , he says , many of the studies that have been done entailed " super - high consumptions " ( 12 cups a day , for example ) and may not apply to the normal amount Americans typically drink .
So far , evidence of coffee 's health benefits is limited .
" I want to be convinced , but I have n't been .
It 's not cause and effect ; it 's just a hint , " says Vinson . " [ But ] there are a lot of wonderful hints . "
In the meantime , coffee drinkers can still dare to hope their precious brew is also good for them .
Murszewski says she has noticed benefits from her java habit .
" I have not asked my doctor about the benefits of coffee , although I have noticed that when suffering from a migraine , coffee helps , " she says .
" It 's not full - blown with drinking coffee . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Atrazine , one of the most commonly used and controversial weedkillers , can turn male frogs into females , researchers reported on Monday .

Berkeley / Tyrone Hayes
The experiment is the first to show such complete effects of atrazine , which had been known to disrupt hormones and which is one of the chief suspects in the decline of amphibians such as frogs around the world .
“ Atrazine - exposed males were both demasculinized ( chemically castrated ) and completely feminized as adults , ” Tyrone Hayes of the University of California Berkeley and colleagues wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The chemical had been shown to disrupt development and make frogs develop both male and female features -- termed hermaphroditism .
This study of 40 male frogs shows the process can go even further , Hayes said .
“ Before , we knew we got fewer males than we should have , and we got hermaphrodites .
Now , we have clearly shown that many of these animals are sex- reversed males , ” Hayes said in a statement .
“ Atrazine has caused a hormonal imbalance that has made them develop into the wrong sex , in terms of their genetic constitution . ”
SIMILAR EFFECTS ON HUMANS ?
Whether the effects translate to humans is far from clear .
Frogs have thin skin that can absorb chemicals easily and they literally bathe in the polluted water .
The European Union banned atrazine in 2004 .
The finding may add pressure to the United States to more closely regulate the chemical , used widely in agriculture .
“ Approximately 80 million pounds ( 36,287 tonnes ) are applied annually in the United States alone , and atrazine is the most common pesticide contaminant of ground and surface water , ” the researchers wrote .
“ Atrazine can be transported more than 1,000 km ( 621 miles ) from the point of application via rainfall and , as a result , contaminates otherwise pristine habitats , even in remote areas where it is not used , ” they added , citing other researchers .
“ In fact , more than a half million pounds ( 227 tonnes ) of atrazine are precipitated in rainfall each year in the United States . ”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in October it was reviewing the health impacts of atrazine .
Syngenta AG , one of several companies that makes atrazine , has long defended its safety .
The company says it is one of the best - studied herbicides available and pointed to prior safety reviews from the EPA and World Health Organization , among others .
Hayes and colleagues studied 40 African clawed frogs , keeping them in water contaminated with 2.5 ppb ( parts per billion ) of atrazine .
The EPA ’s current drinking water standard is 3 ppb .
“ Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs , ” the researchers wrote .
“ Regardless of the mechanism , the impacts of atrazine on amphibians and on wildlife in general are potentially devastating , ” they wrote .
“ The negative impacts on wild amphibians is especially concerning given that the dose examined here ( 2.5 ppb ) is in the range that animals experience year - round in areas where atrazine is used as well within levels found in rainfall , in which levels can exceed 100 ppb in the Midwestern United States , ” they added .

I ’ve been meaning to put together an article on Git for quite a while but I ’ve always ended up postponing it for various reasons , one of which being that there is already so much material describing Git inside and out that I was n’t quite sure I could add anything to the subject .
After thinking about this a bit more , I decided to go ahead anyway but to give this article a slightly different spin than what you might have read elsewhere .
For this reason , you wo n’t find in this post any elaborate discussion of Git ’s branching model , command line switches or graphical tools .
I do include at the end of this article a list of references that covers all the technical aspects of Git that I ’m glossing over today .
This article is meant for people who are interested in Git , either personally or as a corporation , but wondering what making the jump will really mean and what to expect .
What you wo n’t find in this post :
Fanboy opinions ( “ Git is so good that it cured my asthma ” ) .
Hater opinions ( “ Git ’s command line syntax is so arcane that it will make your brain leak through your ears ” ) .
What you will find in this post is the perspective of someone who :
… was forced to switch to Git
… has become reasonably comfortable with it ( although by no means an expert )
… but still remembers the pain it took to get there .
State of the union
It ’s hard to argue with the fact that Git has gained a lot of momentum these past years and that it ’s slowly eclipsing other more popular Version Control Systems ( VCS ) , such as Subversion or Perforce .
Just a few days ago , the Subversion team released their roadmap which promptly generated discussions wondering whether Subversion was n’t dying ( I think it ’s a bit exaggerated and the Subversion team is making the right decision by focusing on the non distributed aspect of their VCS ) .
What to expect
Switching to Git can be very easy or absolutely traumatizing , depending on how you approach it .
Individual users will usually have a pleasant experience since they can start small and expand their knowledge from there , but corporations have to take a big jump , retrain entire teams of developers , adjust their tools and their expectations and be ready to give up on a few benefits that they do n’t think they can live without .
As a user
This is undoubtedly the best way to start with Git .
Start by picking a hosting service , which can be either remote ( e.g. Github ) or local ( your own machine ) , and from that point on , you can pretty much get by with just a few commands :
git add [ file ] to tell Git to track a new file .
to tell Git to track a new file .
git commit - a -m " Commit message " to commit the changes you have made to your local repository .
to commit the changes you have made to your local repository .
git push to push your changes to the “ server ” .
to push your changes to the “ server ” .
Additionally , you will probably want to learn about git clone or git pull to download a repository to your machine .
You can go very far with these simple commands , which mimic almost exactly the work flow of a non-distributed VCS .
This is the best way to get comfortable with Git until you get bored , at which point you can start exploring some of its advanced features .
As a team
Switching an entire team or organization from a regular VCS to Git is a complex project that will require managing not just the technical complexity but also the users ’ expectations .
I could write a lot of pages on this topic alone , but for now , I ’ll just give you a few quick tips :
The transition will work much better if several of your employees are already familiar with Git and can help you evangelize the idea and provide support to reticent users .
Be very clear on the features that they will have to learn to live without ( e.g. monotony , see below ) and emphasize the personal benefits ( e.g. branch juggling , see below as well ) .
You wo n’t get a lot of credit by telling them that they can inspect each other ’s repositories , but they will most likely appreciate the fact that moving between several lines of code is trivial .
Distribution
You will find plenty of definitions for what a “ Distributed ” Version Control System is , but let me just sum it up for you and share a dirty little secret at the same time :
A DVCS does n’t have a central server .
I bet that most people using a DVCS are still using a central server .
Confused yet ?
Let me rephrase this : I think the DVCS aspect of Git is not its main strength , but it does provide a lot of benefits which are really what get people hooked to Git .
The one thing you need to know when you are using a DVCS such as Git is that whenever you work on a depot on your computer , you are carrying the entire repository with you .
I ’m simplifying this a little bit , but it ’s the general idea .
In contrast , centralized VCS will usually allow you to create “ views ” or “ clients ” on your local machine , but the only place where the full repository is stored is on the server ( and hopefully , its backups ) .
Carrying a full repository on your machines sounds like a crazy idea but it comes with a lot of benefits ( “ cheap branching ” and “ easy offline work ” are two benefits that developers will immediately appreciate ) and , more importantly , it works , mostly because Git is extremely efficient in the way it stores the representation of that repository ( the fact that hard drives are cheap does n’t hurt , of course ) .
Since every user carries a full repository on their machine , everyone is a potential server , which means it ’s very easy for developer A to “ pull ” a change from developer B in order to inspect it and then discard it or merge it in their own repository .
This sounds very useful , but in practice , I think that most regular Git users will not take advantage of that feature , preferring to push to and pull from a central server .
And by “ regular Git user ” , I mean “ everyone except the Linux kernel team ” .
Taming the beast
Git ’s user interface is probably its greatest weakness .
It ’s inconsistent , counter - intuitive and it often reappropriates verbs and nouns that have a clear meaning in the VCS world and it makes them mean something else .
I ’ve been trying to come up with a lot of ways to rationalize this bizarre and arcane user interface , but in the end , all I can tell you is : “ Deal with it ” .
I know , it ’s sad , but there is really no other way .
Here is an analogy that might help , though : to me , learning Git is very similar to learning a foreign language .
Natural languages are notoriously hard to learn for adults because their organic growth has resulted in all kinds of inconsistencies and oddities .
At the end of the day , the only way to learn a foreign language is to memorize , memorize and memorize .
As years go by , practice make memory regurgitation more automatic and the use of that language requires less and less conscious effort , but the learning curve is something that just ca n’t be avoided .
Git is very similar in this respect .
Do n’t try to understand why checkout suddenly means something completely different from what you were used to or to explain the various switches of the reset command : memorize the recipes and just apply them .
And do n’t be shy about asking seasoned Git users , they are used to getting these questions and they will give you instant answers that will save you a lot of time hunting down the documentation .
However , there is hope for those of us who want to do more than regurgitating Git recipes : if you are serious about becoming comfortable with Git , you should definitely spend some time trying to understand its internals .
I ’m referring to the graphs , objects , commits , heads and branches that form the backbone of Git .
As opposed to its ugly user interface , Git ’s underlying infrastructure is very solid and extremely well designed .
On top of that , it ’s actually not that hard to understand , and once you do , a whole new world will open up .
Once you understand these internals , you will be able to solve problems conceptually by simply visualizing the operations that need to be done on that underlying structure ( moving the head there , branching here , rebasing this , merging that , etc… ) .
Once you have solved that problem conceptually , applying the awkward Git user interface to actually do the work will look much easier , albeit still not very natural .
The end of monotony
Centralized VCS such as Subversion and Perforce offer a very popular feature : monotonic revisions .
Whenever a new change list is committed to the main repository , it receives a unique number that ’s guaranteed to be greater than the previous submission .
This makes it very easy to compare files and commits chronologically and to determine which one is the most recent .
Unfortunately , you will have to give up this feature with a DVCS .
Because of its distributed nature , it ’s not possible ( or rather , “ practical ” / ” easy ” ) to offer such a monotonic number .
There is no denying that this feels like a huge step backward , especially for large teams .
However , the absence of such a feature reflects the more fundamental reality that these numbers are not always accurate , and that the bigger and more active and branched out a project is , the more meaningless they become .
When branch 2.1 receives commit # 720 and branch 2.0.4 has # 742 , what do these numbers actually tell you about these change lists ?
The good news is that there are ways to make up for the absence of monotony , and the main difference is that the tagging will be performed by humans , which is what a lot of VCS - based organizations are already doing anyway .
Branch juggling
When you are trying to make the case for Git in front of a skeptical crowd , it ’s important to provide anecdotes that developers can relate to .
I promised that this post would avoid content that can be easily found elsewhere , but I have to talk a little bit about branching because for me , understanding this was the first time that I actually acknowledged a very tangible advantage of Git over other source control systems .
The daily routine of a software developer typically involves a lot of multitasking .
As much as you want to focus your work on “ feature A ” and you do n’t want to be interrupted , there are many reasons why you might be forced to put your work on hold and start working on “ bug B ” or “ feature C ” before being able to resume work on “ feature A ” .
Switching back and forth between tasks has always been painful with regular VCS but Git makes it very smooth .
That ’s all I ’m going to say about this topic , but if you want to find out more , most of the links that I supply at the end of this article will show you how to achieve this goal very early on in the tutorial .
Gerrit
I ’d like to conclude this little overview by saying a few words about a tool that we , the Android team , are using a lot for our Git work : Gerrit .
Gerrit is a web based application that allows you to perform code reviews for Git repositories .
It ’s basically a server that acts as a gatekeeper : developers push their Git changes to it , other developers review them and when these changes are approved , Gerrit pushes them to the main repository on behalf of the original submitter .
If you ’re curious to see Gerrit in action , here is the Android open source Gerrit .
The reason I mention Gerrit ( besides the fact that I contribute to it in my 20 % ) is that it represents an interesting compromise where a DVCS is used as a centralized VCS .
You might wonder if using a DVCS with a central server is not a bit paradoxical , and I ca n’t argue that it is in a certain way , but I see this as having the best of both worlds .
The Gerrit server acts as a canonical repository from where developers can clone their own repositories but all the facilities offered by a DVCS ( direct push / pull between developers ) are still possible and fully compatible with this model .
For example , you could pull a change from a fellow developer , makes a few additional changes and then push that change to Gerrit so it will be committed to the canonical repository .
After that , both developers can pull and merge in order to reconcile their local repository with the central one .
Wrapping up
First of all , I ’d like to apologize for the amorphous nature of this post .
I tried to structure it in a way that would show some linearity and consistency , but this is basically a big brain dump of points that have been twirling in my head for a while .
Looking back , it took me a while to warm up to Git ( quite a while ) , but now that I ’m here , I really enjoy using it .
As I hinted throughout this essay , the benefit will probably not be very apparent for very small teams that mostly commit and push ( although you will probably find value in branch juggling even if you ’re the only one on your project ) , but as the team and the number of committers and releases grows , you will find that Git provides an undeniable increase in productivity .

The last papal visit to the UK was in May 1982 A petition protesting against Pope Benedict XVI 's visit to Britain later this year is to be handed in to Downing Street by the National Secular Society .
It calls on the prime minister to exempt taxpayers from funding the visit .
It will be the first papal visit to the UK since John Paul II in 1982 .
He is expected to visit Birmingham - as part of the planned beatification of Cardinal John Newman - and Scotland .
Dates for the trip have not been set .
The Pope was formally invited to visit the UK by Prime Minister Gordon Brown last February .
Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy also invited him to visit Scotland Sceptical public
The petition states : " We the undersigned , petition the Prime Minister to ask the Catholic Church to pay for the proposed visit of the Pope to the UK and relieve the taxpayer of the estimated £ 20 million cost .
" We accept the right of the Pope to visit his followers in Britain , but public money would be better spent on hard - pressed schools , hospitals and social services which are facing cuts . "
The National Secular Society says that 28,000 people have now signed their petition .
BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said Roman Catholics were trying to improve the way they get the Church 's message across to an increasingly sceptical public in preparation for the visit .
Articulate Catholics are being trained as spokesmen and women to answer some of the awkward questions about contraception and Aids , homosexuality , and the meaning of sainthood in the 21st Century that his visit is likely to prompt .
He said they know the visit represented a great opportunity , but also something of a danger .
Focus attention Pope Benedict is a relatively conservative figure who has not been afraid to reinforce the Church 's traditional teaching on controversial issues such as abortion , equality for gay people and research on stem cells .
Our correspondent said : " So secularists have also spotted an opportunity .
They can see the potential for creating a coalition of people unhappy with the traditionalist Christian message in a variety of limited fields .
" The Pope might not exactly be a stick with which to beat religion , but his visit will focus attention on areas which the National Secular Society suspects will inspire scepticism as much as faith . "
No official itinerary has yet been drawn up for the visit , but officials at the Vatican and in the UK told the BBC the visit was likely to take place in September .
Further details are expected early in March , a spokesman for the Catholic Communications Network said .

William Yslas Vélez , a mathematician , University of Arizona Distinguished Professor and former president of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science , spoke at MIT on Monday about how to make his field more representative of the United States as a whole .
Vélez ’s talk had two main strands .
One was a defense of homegrown applicants to graduate programs in mathematics , whether minority or not .
The other was an examination of how to encourage minorities to study math .
In the late 1970s , Vélez explained , about 75 percent of PhDs in mathematics awarded by U.S. universities went to U.S. citizens and permanent residents .
Now , he said , that figure is below 50 percent .
“ I happen to think that we should always have large numbers of international students in our graduate programs , ” Vélez said .
“ But 50 percent , I think , represents a system that is out of balance . ”
Part of the reason for that imbalance , Vélez argued , is that U.S. universities encourage a broad liberal - arts education at the undergraduate level , while many international universities allow students to focus almost exclusively on technical disciplines .
“ If you ’re an undergraduate math major in Mexico , that means that you took four years of math .
That ’s all you took , ” Vélez said .
“ By the time you get your bachelor ’s degree , you look like you had a master ’s degree . ”
But the University of Arizona , Vélez said , prohibits students from taking more than one - third of their courses in any one department .
“ This is the system of education that we ’ve created for them , ” Vélez said .
But “ graduate programs ridicule them for not being as well prepared as international students . ”
Moreover , Vélez said , extensive undergraduate coursework is no guarantee of mathematical creativity .
He pointed to a study by Oakland University mathematician Jerry Grossman , who got his PhD from MIT in 1974 , which concluded that 43 percent of math PhDs publish only one paper during their professional careers , and 75 percent publish fewer than five .
“ If we had focused on domestic students , would this data be worse ? ” Vélez asked .
“ I ca n’t imagine . ”
Finally , Vélez argued , as important as generating original research may be , educating the citizenry is the chief responsibility of a nation ’s universities , and universities that grant more than half of their math PhDs to foreign students are not meeting that responsibility .
The morning after the talk , in a temporary office in the math building , Vélez expanded on this idea .
“ Suppose you go out to public forums and tell people , ‘ We want you to pay taxes into our university system so that we can bring international students in — at your expense — and educate them really well , give them the best credentials in this country so that they can outcompete your children , ’ ” Vélez said .
“ Sell that argument to the public . ”
If it ’s true that universities should work harder to interest minorities in math , how exactly should they do this ?
During his talk , Vélez returned several times to the idea that , as he put it , “ Earning a living , in the minority community , is very important .
And there ’s a narrow view of where a good living is to be made . ”
Because university math departments tend to be so focused on research , he argued , they treat undergraduate math degrees simply as portals to graduate work .
That leaves undergraduates with the idea that outside of academia , math degrees afford no way to earn a living .
But “ the job market for bachelor ’s degrees in mathematics is actually wonderful , ” Vélez said .
“ Everybody is looking for mathematics majors .
But academics have n’t quite figured that out . ”
One way to impress undergraduates with the practicality of a math degree , Vélez explained , was to help them get internships where their math skills would be valued .
He gave the example of a student at the University of Arizona who had grown up in a tough border town and was majoring in engineering .
When he enrolled in a third - semester calculus class , he was summoned to Vélez ’s office .
“ You should be taking linear algebra , ” Vélez said .
The student groaned .
“ If you take linear algebra , ” Velez said , “ I will get you an internship this summer . ”
Then he showed the student a flyer for a summer internship program that prominently featured the figure “ $ 3,250 . ”
“ And he said , ‘ I ca n’t pay $ 3,000 , ’ ” Vélez said .
“ I said , ‘ They ’re paying you .
Plus your airfare .
Plus your living expenses . ’
Okay , so he ’ll take linear algebra . ”
But supplying students with such opportunities requires cultivating relationships with prospective employers , Vélez said .
“ Go to the national meeting of the American Mathematical Society , ” Vélez said .
“ Go down to the exhibit booth .
Who ’s there ?
Booksellers .
Who ’s there to hire you ?
Only the National Security Agency .
What ’s the impression ?
Mathematics is good for teaching .
IBM should be there .
Raytheon should be there .
Google should be there .
Microsoft … has a math department , right ?
They should be there . ”
If math departments can persuade minority students that math degrees are practical , Vélez argued , increased minority enrollment in graduate math programs will be inevitable .
And that , in turn , will provide future generations of minority students with role models and mentors .
As Vélez put it the morning after his talk , “ It should be the mathematics that you should find so exciting that it should encourage you to go on .
This is a pattern that I see over and over again . ”
You are looking at the cover from a March 1984 issue of TIME magazine that helped to ignite the low - fat diet craze in America .
The article inside began with the headline : Sorry , It ’s True .
Cholesterol Really Is A Killer .
I remember reading that article .
At the time , I found it convincing .
( Cut me some slack ; I was only 25 and had n’t yet nurtured my inner skeptic .
I still believed researchers were objective and journalists who wrote for major media outlets were critical thinkers . )
So , like millions of other Americans , I began trying to live on a low - fat diet .
I stopped buying meat and butter at the grocery store and started eating pasta , Egg Beaters and margarine .
You know how much good that did me .
I ’m 51 now , and my inner skeptic is fully developed .
Re-reading the article 26 years later , I ’m surprised it convinced anyone , especially doctors , who should ’ve seen through the nonsense .
You can read the full version online , but we ’ll deal with bits of it here , starting with the sub - headline :
Cholesterol is proved deadly , and our diet may never be the same
The writer got it half right .
Our diets were never the same .
Within a couple of years , grocery stores looked as if they ’d been the scene of a tagging contest between two gangs named LOW - FAT and CHOLESTEROL FREE .
As for cholesterol being proved deadly , we ’ll get to that .
This year began with the announcement by the Federal Government of the results of the broadest and most expensive research project in medical history .
Its subject was cholesterol , the vital yet dangerous yellowish substance whose level in the bloodstream is directly affected by the richness of the diet .
Yup , that ’s how stupid Mother Nature is … she designed the body to require all kinds of substances that happen to be deadly .
Anybody who takes the results seriously may never be able to look at an egg or a steak the same way again .
Well , that ’s the problem : we took the results seriously .
I remember reading a funny column by Bill Granger , a Chicago Tribune writer whose work I enjoyed .
He described living on his new low - fat diet , and how his wife kept taking away his bacon and eggs and making him eat cereal so his heart would n’t get fat .
Granger suffered a debilitating stroke in 2000 at the age of 59 .
Maybe it would ’ve happened anyway … but the guy could ’ve been enjoying bacon and eggs the whole time .
For what the study found , after ten years of research costing $ 150 million , promises to have a profound impact on how Americans eat and watch their health .
Among the conclusions :
Heart disease is directly linked to the level of cholesterol in the blood .
Lowering cholesterol levels markedly reduces the incidence of fatal heart attacks .
Basil Rifkind , project director of the study , believes that research “ strongly indicates that the more you lower cholesterol and fat in your diet , the more you reduce your risk of heart disease . ”
Lock that quote about the diet in your brain .
You ’ll see why in a moment .
But first , notice the “ Ornish logic ” in this paragraph :
Everybody knows George Ford .
Or somebody like George Ford .
There he was , 52 , the energetic president of a small Ohio electronics firm who “ would n’t eat an egg unless it was fried in bacon grease ”
His lunches were executive size .
He matched his business cronies drink for drink .
He smoked “ pretty heavily ” and exercised with a knife and fork .
In the winter of 1981 doctors informed Ford that his cholesterol levels were dangerously high ; by April he required a quadruple coronary bypass operation .
He emerged from the hospital determined to revise his ways radically .
Today he does not smoke , he exercises four or five days a week , and he sticks scrupulously to a diet high in fiber and low in cholesterol and fat .
“ I have n’t had a slice of bacon in three years , ” he says .
He is proud and relieved that his cholesterol level is normal .
Okay , so we ’ve got a guy who smoked , drank heavily , never exercised and , by the way , ate bacon and eggs .
Now he does n’t smoke , exercises , probably drinks a lot less , and lives on a low - fat diet .
So if his health is better now , it therefore proves — drum roll , please — low - fat diets are good for you !
Brilliant .
Tell ya what :
Give me a heavy - smoking , hard - drinking , fat - gobbling couch potato and let me convince him to stop smoking , stop drinking , start exercising , and take up chewing tobacco .
When his health improves — and it would — I will therefore conclude that chewing tobacco prevents heart disease .
For decades , researchers have been trying to prove conclusively that cholesterol is a major villain in this epidemic .
It has not been easy .
No kidding it was n’t easy .
That ’s because all the previous attempts to lower heart disease through low - fat diets failed .
So did the major clinical trial conducted in the 1970s to test the first big cholesterol - lowering drug , clofibrate .
The subjects who took clofibrate ended up with lower cholesterol , all right … but they had a 47 % higher death rate than the placebo group .
Whoops .
In 1913 , Russian Pathologist Nikolai Anitschkow showed that he could produce similar deposits , or plaques , in the arteries of rabbits just by feeding them a diet rich in cholesterol .
Well , there ’s a reason for that : rabbits do n’t eat eggs .
They also they do n’t form packs of vicious hunter - rabbits to run down pigs and devour them .
If you force a lion to live on carrots , by the way , it will get sick and die , thus proving that carrots are deadly .
Subsequent research further supported the connection between diet and cardio - vascular disease .
Epidemiologist Ancel Keys conducted a landmark study in seven nations beginning in 1947 .
He discovered direct correlations between a country ’s incidence of heart disease , the level of cholesterol in the blood and the amount of animal fat in the national diet .
If you ’ve seen Fat Head , you know how honest Ancel Keys was .
He cherry - picked seven countries out of 22 .
As Uffe Ravnskov demonstrated in his books , you could cherry - pick seven other countries from the same 22 and show an inverse correlation between fat and heart disease ; the more fat , the less heart disease .
The experts were still not quite able to pin the blame on cholesterol , however .
Explains Fred Mattson , a leading researcher at the University of California at San Diego , “ We were missing a key piece of evidence : no one had ever shown that reducing the level of cholesterol in the blood did any good . ”
You speak the truth , Dr. Mattson — but it was n’t for a lack of trying .
Cholesterol was successfully lowered in research studies several times .
It just did n’t do any good .
Now , remember when I said to lock that quote from Dr. Rifkind about fatty diets into your brain ?
This is the study that prompted the TIME article :
The elaborate , ten - year program recruited 3,806 men between the ages of 35 and 59 , all of whom had cholesterol levels above 265 mg per deciliter of blood ( the average for U.S. adults is 215 to 220 ) .
Half the men were put on daily doses of cholestyramine , an unpleasant , cholesterol - lowering drug that was mixed with orange juice and taken six times a day .
One participant likened taking it to swallowing “ orange - flavored sand . ”
Among its side effects : constipation , bloating , nausea and gas .
The other half received a similarly gritty placebo .
Researchers had decided to use a drug rather than diet to lower cholesterol , because it would have been virtually impossible to control or measure the diet of so many men over so long a period .
By the end of the study , the cholestyramine group had achieved an average cholesterol level 8.5 % lower than that of the control group and had suffered 19 % fewer heart attacks .
Their cardiac death rate was a remarkable 24 % lower than that of the placebo group .
So , let ’s think this one through : a group of study subjects who took a cholesterol - lowering drug ended up with a slightly lower rate of heart attacks , and therefore … THIS FINALLY PROVES THAT A FATTY DIET WILL GIVE YOU HEART DISEASE !
Here ’s the proper response to that leap in logic : ARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHH !!!!!
I can’t believe I did n’t recognize this load of bologna for what it was even at the tender age of 25 .
First off , that “ remarkable ” reduction in the cardiac death rate was n’t so remarkable if you look at the actual numbers — which , in my defense , did n’t appear in TIME .
Remember , we ’re talking about 3,806 men with abnormally high cholesterol .
With that in mind , here are the study results :
Placebo
Heart Attacks : 158 Heart - Attack Deaths : 38 Total Deaths : 71
Cholestyramine
Heart Attacks : 130 Heart - Attack Deaths : 30 Total Deaths : 68
With a little Excel magic , I determined that 30 deaths versus 38 is a 24 % lower death rate if you put 1940 men in the drug group and 1866 in the placebo group , which in turn gave me the actual heart - attack death rates as a percentage in each group :
Placebo : 2.04 %
Cholestyramine : 1.55 %
Compare those figures using the magic of division , and you ’ll get a 24 % reduction in the rate : ( 2.04 - 1.55 ) /2.04 = . 24 .
This is exactly what the statin - makers do with their data today .
They use division to get impressive - sounding reductions .
But to calculate the actual difference , you use simple subtraction : 2.04 % – 1.55 % — which means the difference in the rate of heart - attack deaths between the two groups was ( wait for it ) … 0.49 % .
That ’s right , less than one half of one percent .
Put two hundred men on this drug , and you would in theory prevent ( almost ) one heart - attack death .
So from this miniscule difference , Rafkind came up with an astounding conclusion :
Since fatty foods raise cholesterol levels in some people , and since a cholesterol lowering - drug produced a very slight drop in the heart - disease rate , fat and cholesterol in the diet must cause heart disease .
Or as he put it , “ The more you lower cholesterol and fat in your diet , the more you reduce your risk of heart disease . ”
Dr. Malcolm Kendrick has a lovely explanation of this type of logic in his book The Great Cholesterol Con .
Researchers even gave it a fancy - sounding name to make it sound legitimate : teleoanalysis .
Basically , the idea is this :
We ca n’t prove ( despite years of trying ) that A causes C . But if we can prove A is linked to B , and B is linked to C , then we can conclude that A causes C , despite the lack of any actual evidence .
If that sounds like decent logic to you , try applying it elsewhere .
Here , I ’ll get you started : Drinking a lot of water causes frequent urination .
Frequent urination is linked to diabetes .
Therefore , drinking too much water can lead to diabetes .
Or for a more relevant example : Adopting a low - fat diet reduces cholesterol in some people .
In the clofibrate trial , the group that took a cholesterol - lowering drug had a 47 % higher death rate .
Therefore , low - fat diets cause premature death .
That makes just as much sense as Rifkind ’s logic .
All we can actually conclude about bacon and eggs from his study is that you can put them on a plate and make a reasonable facsimile of an unhappy face .
But that ’s not how TIME , or most doctors , or most of the scientific world saw it .
At least there were few skeptics :
Other doctors are not so sure , and urge a stricter interpretation of the study .
Says Dr. Edward Ahrens , a veteran cholesterol researcher at Rockefeller University : “ Since this was basically a drug study , we can conclude nothing about diet ; such extrapolation is unwarranted , unscientific and wishful thinking . ”
Spot-on , Dr. Ahrens .
Unfortunately , wishful thinking became confused with settled science .
The American Heart Association has been urging people for years to take this preventive approach .
Specifically , A.H.A. experts recommend that American men limit themselves to 300 mg of cholesterol a day , and women to 225 mg , roughly the amount in a single egg .
They insist that fat should make up no more than 30 % ( rather than its current 40 % ) of the diet , and no more than one - third of this should be saturated .
Yup , I really should trade my eggs for a nice , big bowl of Cocoa Puffs .
The AHA says so , and they ’re staffed by experts .
Because atherosclerosis develops slowly throughout life , Gotto believes that children should be started on a low - fat and low - cholesterol regimen at about the age of two .
Definitely .
That way they can be taking drugs for ADD by the age of eight .
Many Americans have already heeded the A.H.A. gospel .
Over the past 20 years , the nation ’s consumption of butter has dropped 30 % , egg consumption has declined 14 % , and the average intake of animal fat has plummeted 60 % .
I guess that explains the remarkable improvements in the nation ’s health we ’ve seen since 1984 .
Over the same two decades , deaths from heart disease have declined 30 % .
For Pete ’s sake , lady !
Smoking dropped by nearly 50 % over the same period !
Think maybe those two are related in some way ?
Even so , not everyone agrees with the A.H.A. on dietary reform .
The drop in mortality , some scientists point out , is partly due to better treatment for heart disease and to a decline in smoking among middle - aged men .
Sorry .
My bad .
“ I have an aversion to this cholesterolphobia , ” scoffs Purdue Cardiologist Story .
“ Why treat everybody ?
We do n’t give everybody insulin out of fear of diabetes . ”
According to Rockefeller University ’s Ahrens , who has spent nearly 40 years studying cholesterol metabolism , individuals differ greatly in their response to dietary fat and cholesterol .
“ To deny everyone red meat could mean taking away the joy of life unnecessarily , ” he says .
“ And as an inexpensive source of good nutrition , there is nothing more glorious than the egg . ”
Thank you , Dr. Story .
I wish more people had listened to your scoffing .
The food manufacturers who oppose the Heart Association ’s dietary recommendations have come in for widespread criticism .
“ Instead of making excuses , they ought to be adopting the long - range goal of making better products , ” says Dr. John LaRosa , an internist at George Washington University Medical School .
Do n’t worry , Dr. LaRosa , they heard you .
They stopped making excuses and started making Snackwells , which became a $ 490 million business by the early 1990s .
Eat all the sugary treats you want — they ’re fat - free !
Saturated fat , usually in the form of coconut oil , lurks in most commercially baked breads and cakes , in nondairy creamers , on the oiled surface of frozen French fries , and even in wholesome granola .
Coconut oil : lurking in our food .
Granola : wholesome .
American Heart Association : experts , giving us the gospel .
People who do n’t agree with the AHA : scoffers , coming in for widespread criticism .
Man , it ’s inspiring to watch an unbiased journalist at work .
At least the good folks at CSPI managed to get all that lurking coconut oil replaced with hydrogenated soybean oil .
The trends of the past two decades give cause for optimism .
Medical researchers generally believe that Americans will become increasingly willing to change to a healthier diet and a more sensible lifestyle .
By the year 2000 , they say , heart disease could cease to be the leading cause of death in America .
Yeah , I ’d say that ’s about how it all worked out .
As most readers already know , Nokia ’s Maemo operating system for handheld devices and Intel ’s Moblin for netbooks are merging into MeeGo .
I ’ve already covered the introduction to MeeGo and what I think it means for the future of mobile devices , so it ’s time to delve into what ’s going on to make that future happen .
There are numerous aspects to cover , but I ’ll highlight a few big ones .
Stronger than Gossip !
maemo.org has had a healthy Talk forum , in one incarnation or another , since soon after the Nokia 770 was released .
Originally a refuge for bleeding - edge device enthusiasts , Linux hackers and the highly curious , the scope steadily grew to accomodate thousands of interested parties from all directions and levels .
The Maemo platform ’s open - source - meets - consumer magnetism has been a true cross-spectrum draw .
Current discourse around the move to MeeGo.com is n’t over the need for a forum there , but whether we start fresh or bring the talk .
maemo.org legacy across .
There are pros and cons to either approach and I lean toward starting new but keeping the existing forum open for some time .
Forum founder Reggie Suplido is spearheading the testing and development and I can think of no one better suited .
For those interested , information is available at http://wiki.meego.com/Forum_/_Talk.
FUD Dispersal
Nokia representative Quim Gil has started tackling the Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt monster beginning with this thread at talk .maemo.org .
Amazingly , the usual naysayer resistance was almost nonexistant and for the most part the thread has been extremely productive .
New maemo.org community member Mandor stepped up and started a wiki page with the goal of collecting and getting answered the many questions that have contributed to confusion .
Intel rep Imad Sousou along with his Technical Steering Group counterpart from Nokia , Valtteri Halla , are using their MeeGo blogs to do the same .
Both have been very forthright and responsive in clearing the air , although there are certainly more questions ( like the stubborn “ will there be a consumer version of MeeGo for the Nokia N900 ? ” ) desperate for answers .
Passing the Test
Another problematic aspect of the Maemo experience has been in application testing .
A skimpy process combined with little true oversight led to a frustrating situation where immature apps escaped into the wild while stable but less glamorous ones found themselves stuck in Quality Assurance limbo .
Thankfully , maemo.org council chariman Valerio ( VDVsx ) and a handful of leaders have seized control of this hydra and started us down a path toward a strong and effectively - managed process .
This sets the stage for a best practice we can bring over to MeeGo and thus avoid repeating that experience .
Bug Spray
Bugzilla is of course a hot topic .
Intel employee Michael Shaver has assembled a small , diverse team to brainstorm and test a preliminary deployment for MeeGo.com .
Although concern has been expressed that this first phase was not fully public , Mike has explained that he thought it best to work with a small but knowledgeable group to get the ball rolling and I can’t fault his reasoning .
Hopefully the process can be opened soon .
So far I have n’t been able to help much here other than to offer some suggestions , such as benchmarking against Nokia ’s Pilots Bugzilla , but at the same time I ’m working this subject from another angle .
I ’ve put together what I call the MeeGo ( formerly Maemo ) User Experience Framework with the goal of getting user feedback mechanisms onto the devices themselves and in more helpful contexts .
As of this writing the presentation is still in draft form and contributions of all kinds are welcome .
This is also being discussed on the Maemo and MeeGo email lists and I ’m looking for someone to help me with setting up a working group on the MeeGo wiki ( I ca n’t find a way to add new pages ) .
Standards
The email lists were initially aflame with the RPM - vs - Deb application packaging battle , but that controversy has since settled into a mostly civil discussion– albeit with some discomfort still poking the pro-Deb crowd who felt there should have been more open dialog prior to this packaging mode being settled .
More recently , needs like these have been highlighted :
public git tree with nokia development kernel available ( Marcin Juszkiewicz )
code , obviously .
Mainly policy though ( Carsten Munk )

and too many more to list
Standards are crucial to facilitating fruitful efforts of this magnitude and it ’s good to see that recognized this early on in the new venture .
Etc
If there ’s been one truism about community - based development , it ’s that task vacuums form quickly and fill slowly .
More often than not , the biggest hurdle is the common hesitancy of a champion to step forward and drive the effort .
Community input is necessary for robust solutions to nearly any problem , but they can be hard to achieve without a single person or small group managing that input and channeling it into such solutions .
Fortunately we seem to have crossed a threshold in that regard and see that many have emerged to make things happen .
As noted here at MeeGo.com , there are numerous needs looking for fulfillment .
Talk is good for starting things off , but we ’re already into the Get Stuff Done phase and it ’s time to roll some sleeves up and make MeeGo happen !
When we put questions to the parties ahead of the European elections last year , the Green party performed miserably , attracting considerable criticism for a range of policies from banning GM research to pushing alternative medicine for the treatment of cancer .
Since then , and in direct response to our criticism , more rational elements in the party have made an effort to reform policy in a number of areas to ensure that it has a scientific basis .
Have their efforts paid off ?
The Green party manifesto is considerably more polished than last year 's , with a focus on radical left policies centred on community , " fairness " and of course the environment .
Radical action on climate change is promised , with the party pushing for reductions in CO 2 emissions of 10 % a year , achieved mostly through punitive measures against businesses such as heavy taxation on water consumption and air travel .
In fact , reading their policies on climate is like being faced with a sort of " anti- Ukip " , and in many ways – while well - intentioned – equally unrealistic .
On a more positive note , the Greens are excellent on drugs policy , and it is refreshing to see a party highlighting the issue of managing Britain 's water supplies , a problem that is likely to loom much larger in the future .
So how do they score on our questions ?
Brian Cox : Science funding
Do you plan to maintain Britain 's science budget below the European average ?
The Greens admit , refreshingly , that they do n't yet know what they would spend on scientific research , and focus instead on a " radical commitment " to jobs in high - tech manufacturing and research as part of their wider , ambitious plans to reshape the economy into a nicer , greener form .
This is n't an analysis of economic policy , which I suspect is a good thing for the Greens , but certainly they appear to understand the importance of science and technology to Britain 's future prosperity .
Alternative medicine
If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo , should it be supported by the NHS ?
In a welcome U - turn since last year , Redding states that , " Our policy is that any medicine or treatment available on the NHS should be backed up by scientific evidence . "
Their manifesto uses rather more compromising language , likely reflecting the internal debates in the party over this policy over the past year , pledging to , " make available on the NHS complementary medicines that are cost - effective and have been shown to work . "
Which is pretty much none of them .
Interestingly , they also seek to reform the labelling of medicines , with a pledge to make sure they carry an accurate list of all ingredients .
Presumably homeopathic remedies would carry a blank label .
Simon Singh : Libel reform
What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science ?
Currently there is no statutory public interest defence , so scientists risk running the gauntlet of London 's High Court if they publish material they believe to be in the public interest , but that a major corporation or litigious charlatan believes to be libellous .
Party leader Caroline Lucas is herself a signatory to the Libel Reform Campaign pledge , so no problems here .
Climate change / Energy
Should nuclear power be part of our country 's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions ?
How soon can we bring new plants online ?
The Greens energy policy is noble , and I would love to believe that it could happen , but the idea of making a 65 % cut in CO 2 emissions by 2020 through energy efficiency and renewable energy projects alone seems far - fetched .
Unlike the Liberal Democrats , the Greens ' dislike for nuclear energy is ideological , but both parties would benefit from presenting a clearer , realistic analysis of how such ambitious targets would be achieved .
David Nutt : Drugs policy
To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence ?
What evidence , if any , would you require to declassify a drug ?
Drug policy is the highlight of the Green manifesto , and by far their strongest policy area .
Their approach is based on the recognition that drug harm is ultimately a public health problem , not a criminal issue .
The Greens also understand that prohibition itself can cause harm , which logically leads to an evidence - based policy of weighing up " any possible health risks from a particular substance against the social harm of criminalising , for example , millions of cannabis users " .
Campaigners have noted that the Greens , and the Lib Dems , have slightly watered down some of their views on drug policy for their manifestos .
They should trust the public and be bold .
Animal testing
Is animal testing necessary ?
Are the ethical concerns outweighed by the benefits ?
How would you like to see regulations on animal testing change under your government , if at all ?
The same can't be said for their policies on animal testing , which remain an unmitigated disaster .
While we 're all entitled to our ethical opinions , the party continues to make statements that are about as grounded in reality as Narnia , from the baseless assertion that animal testing somehow increases the risk of adverse reactions in medicine , to the persistent myth that researchers are not interested in better , cheaper alternatives .
There 's also a worrying failure to understand that animal research is not simply used for drug testing , but is the foundation of basic biomedical research .
Immunology would barely exist as a research discipline without a ready supply of lab mice .
As blogger Gimpy puts it : " They have no understanding of scientific research or medicine . "
Incidentally , the " independent patient safety organisation " referred to in the Greens ' answer – the Safer Medicines Trust – lists Green party leader Caroline Lucas MEP among its patrons .
Independent ?
Petra Boynton : Public health
How will your party ensure public health / education campaigns are underpinned by evidence , and how will you evaluate their success ?
PR companies are increasingly influential in directing both the content and delivery of public campaigns , frequently at the expense of expertise from scientists , healthcare providers and academics .
" Campaigns should be piloted and evaluated , using comparative before - and - after surveys or other means of measuring public awareness , and rolled out to wider populations only if shown to be effective . "
With this statement , the Greens join a rapidly emerging cross-party consensus on evidence - based public health campaigns .
Genetic engineering / Stem cell research
Should Britain be at the forefront of research in these areas ?
What benefits do you believe such research will bring for society ?
Happy with stem cell research , the Greens maintain an ideological objection to GM crops .
To be fair , they have made some progress since last year in distinguishing between GM crops and wider GM research , which they are happy to let continue .
But as with animal testing , the party seems to be in thrall to scientifically illiterate activists .
There are of course some genuine concerns over the behaviour of companies like Monsanto , and there will always be a need to scrutinise claims made for new technologies , but increasingly elements of the Green movement – notably Greenpeace – have adopted a hysterical and unscientific tone on GM food that misinforms the public and prevents sensible debate .
The party would do well to step back and engage with independent scientists to improve its understanding of current research .
Ben Goldacre : Pharmaceutical regulation
Do you believe pharmaceutical companies should be forced to publish all the research data they have on the potential benefits and harms of drugs they manufacture ?
The Greens go further , and state that all scientific research institutions should publish all relevant research data – a nice idea in theory , although see the caveats I mentioned in my response to Ukip earlier in the week .
The declaration that in order to open up drug production in poorer nations " [ drug design ] information should be regarded as public property not commercial data " needs considerable clarification .
Drug development may cost hundreds of millions of dollars , and Greens should aim to work with pharmaceutical companies to come up with something fair to all parties , rather than simply demanding that they hand over expensive commercial data to competitors .
Conclusion
Their policy in some areas is excellent , and it 's tempting to be generous to the Greens .
As a party they 're well intentioned and admit that they are in the midst of a process of reform :
" We have recently completed a radical overhaul of our health policies which was extremely encouraging .
This saw us adopt far stronger policies in areas like complementary therapies and stem cell research and we 're intending to approach the science and technology chapters of our policies in the same constructive fashion . "
Unfortunately that reform has n't come quickly enough for this election , and it remains to be seen how entrenched the bad science in areas such as animal testing and GM really is .
A lot of work still needs to be done to make the Green party electable on science issues , and it needs to engage with the scientific community to get a much more realistic and balanced understanding of modern science .
Progress has been made , and party members like Redding deserve respect for their achievements so far , but they have a long way to go .
If there is one thing that we have learned from television and movies it's that the Zombipocalypse is inevitable .
There will soon come a day that we will be holding up in a mall , fighting off the incoming horde of brain - seeking zombies .
With modern entertainment , zombies went from a niche sci- fi creation to a pop culture phenomenon .
Zombies have quickly become a staple of modern horror .
They scare us with their faces of gore and detached limbs , they make us laugh with their clumsy shuffling and simplistic one - task - oriented view of the world they have been re-animated into .
Originating in ancient voodoo rituals in Haiti and Africa , zombies worked their way into the American culture through film as early as 1932 with White Zombie starring Bela Lugosi .
From there , zombies showed up in Plan 9 From Outer Space in the form of a shuffling Tor Johnson then finally in George A. Romero 's 1968 Night of the Living Dead .
This film changed the landscape of zombie - centric movie making , though it would n't be until the 2004 remake of his 1978 classic Dawn of the Dead that zombies really sky rocketed into the pop culture mentality , not to mention stopped shuffling and started running .
That same year brought us Shaun of the Dead and then , zombies got funny .
But this is n't a post about the history of zombies in movies .
This is about the the only major disparity in zombie portrayal in movies and videogames .
Some shuffle while others run at a clip that could n't be maintained by most marathon runners .
So which is it ?
Which one instills a greater sense of fear deep in the cockles of your heart ?
The shuffling zombie or the hyper - speed zombie ?
Dragging Their Feet for Brains — — — — — — — — ——
The inherent fear that the shuffling , slow zombie brings to the discussion is that you have longer to fear for your life .
There is nothing quick about the slow - moving zombie that drags one foot across the ground as it makes its way toward you .
This , in relation to movies and videogames , gives the viewer more time to focus on the zombie and notice all the sick little details .
The disfigured face , the rotting flesh bits hanging off exposed bone and of course the wide open maw , dripping with blood and other disturbing fluids like pus and Crystal Pepsi .
Take the videogame Dead Rising for example .
In it , the zombies are what I call " classic zombies . "
They move slow .
This gives your character time to participate in the highly entertaining activity of killing zombies in creative ways .
This translates well into real life , as if you had to fight off an incoming horde of zombies , you 'd like to have as much time to reload your gun as humanly possible .
With a slow - moving classic zombie , this is possible .
Zombies moving with no haste create a particular tension and suspense , something that was captured perfectly in those old George A. Romero films .
Not to mention that when they do get you , they tear apart your skull and munch on your brains as if enjoying a vintage glass of brandy , in zombie terms .
The downside to a slow - moving zombie is the pack mentality that exists with zombies .
They all want brains , and they all want it from you .
At the same time .
They are more patient and will hang around and scratch at the door long after you 've run out of bullets .
This will give more time for additional zombies to gather and scratch at the door .
Eventually , you 've run out of ammo , there are a thousand zombies outside and you 've nowhere to run .
Another point that must be brought up is the decay of the flesh , and at what point does it render a zombie incapable of movement ?
I 've always wondered about this , and no movie that I 've seen ever seems to address it .
Clearly there is something supernatural at work that enables the zombies to rise from the dead , or like in 28 Days Later a virus , but either way , the flesh is in a constant state of decay .
Based on the loss of limbs and chunks of meat falling off of them at random intervals , one would have to assume that decay continues after the zombie has risen .
Therefore , slow zombies might very well decay to nothing but bones by the time they get to you .
I can't see insects not feeding on and laying their eggs in zombies .
Unless they have a living - dead immune system too .
To sum up , slow zombies will eventually get you – it'll just take them longer .
At least we 'll have highway warnings .
Super Human Strength , Maggots for a Jaw — — — — — — — — — — — ——
With the 2004 release of Dawn of the Dead zombies got a serious upgrade .
Instead of the slow - moving living dead , they became super fast and super strong .
Which created a whole new depth of fear and terror .
At least , that 's what they were supposed to do .
Suddenly , when a zombie was after you , you only had moments to react .
Sadly for many , screaming was the only reaction .
The fast zombie , as we 'll refer to them , also possessed strange superhuman strength .
They are able to smash through doors and windows , and could take quite a beating before going down .
The zombies in all the Romero films that followed Dawn of the Dead in the last six years or so all were super - fast zombies .
The zombies we encounter in the awesome Left 4 Dead videogame series are resilient and strong ( albeit , weird as well . )
These fast zombies made it easier to create a quick jump from the audience , as you were less likely to see them coming .
There were more jump - out - of - your - seat moments , more surprises .
Translating into real life , for when the Zombiepocalypse comes , these are n't the zombies you want to be dealing with .
They are just raw , feral creatures out for blood .
They are violent and will not stand outside the barn clawing away at the boarded up windows , they will hurl themselves at the boards until they break through .
There is a stronger sense of urgency to deal with them , but less time to do so .
The tendency will be to empty a clip in a hurried fashion , as their speed quickly takes them from downrange to in your face faster than a Prius .
The rate of decay has to be taken into consideration with the fast zombies as well .
Since they are moving quicker , they will most likely achieve their goal before decay makes it impossible .
However , with the excess movement such as bashing in plate glass windows with their foreheads , they might accelerate the rate of just plain falling apart .
Except they do n't seem to .
Which is very puzzling when it comes to the walking dead .
The fast ones seem to be nearly indestructible when it comes to self harm .
With that holding true , that makes the fast zombies that much more dangerous .
To sum up , fast zombies will be on you quicker than you can put a round in the chamber , tearing you apart like a pack of wolverines on a bunny rabbit .
So Which is it ?
Slow or Fast ? — — — — — — — ——
–
While fast zombies are just as entertaining to watch as their foot - dragging counterparts , if I was going up against a horde of zombies I would rather be facing the slow ones .
That does n't mean that they are better in the way of entertainment , I 'd have to give that win to the fast zombies .
Much more engaging and suspenseful to watch in movies than the slow ones .
So the tie breaker would have to be which ones I 'd rather fight in a videogame , and that would be the inverse of the ones I 'd rather fight in real life .
The fast ones are much more thrilling and violently exciting to go up against in videogames .
Otherwise , it 's just a crap shoot with the slow pokes .
So there you have it .
Zombie speed analysis .
Agree ?
Do n't agree ?
Think the zombie threat is n't real ?

In the same SEC filing that revealed that Activision was in a conflict with two senior Infinity Ward employees over charges of insubordination , Activision - Blizzard also stated that Blizzard is currently working on multiple sequels in the Diablo franchise .
“ Blizzard is currently developing new games , including a new expansion pack to the World of Warcraft franchise , Cataclysm , StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty , which will be released with the new and improved Battle.net , and sequels to the Diablo franchise . ”
Little more information is available at this time .
Blizzard has stated in the past that it is aiming to release games in their core - franchises , including Warcraft , Starcraft and Diablo , on a more regular basis .
The highly anticipated Starcraft 2 has been split into three separate instalments , of which the first instalment is slated for a release later this year .
It is unclear if Diablo III will suffer a similar fate .
ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - The Novartis diabetes drug Starlix failed to reduce progression to the disease or cut down on serious heart problems in patients at high risk for both diabetes and heart disease , according to a large study released on Sunday .
The 9,306 - patient study tested Starlix , known chemically as nateglinide , and the big- selling Novartis blood pressure medicine Diovan .
Diovan , known chemically as valsartan , reduced progression to diabetes by 14 percent compared to a placebo but failed to reduce the risk of serious heart problems , such as heart attack and stroke , according to researchers who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Atlanta .
The failure of Starlix to provide benefit to these patients and lack of heart impact by Diovan came as a surprise to researchers .
“ Most experts believed that nateglinide would prevent diabetes and that valsartan would reduce cardiovascular events in this population , ” said Dr. Robert Califf , the study ’s lead investigator .
“ Interestingly , with respect to nateglinide , we found the opposite , ” Cardiff said .
Starlix works by minimizing spikes in blood sugar after meals by stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin , leading researchers to believe it might slow progression to diabetes by restoring a more normal insulin response .
In addition to the drugs or placebo , all patients in the Novartis - sponsored study were required to take part in a lifestyle program with a goal of maintaining a 5 percent weight loss , increasing physical activity to an average of 30 minutes five days a week , and follow a low - fat diet .
Patients were followed for an average of five years for development of diabetes and 6.5 years for heart disease .
Impact on heart risk was measured by a combination of death from cardiovascular causes , nonfatal heart attacks , nonfatal stroke , hospitalization for heart failure , unstable chest pain and the need for artery - clearing procedures .
Researchers speculated that the negative results seen with the two drugs may have been related to success of the diet and exercise program in reducing progression to diabetes and heart risk .
They also said other medicines many patients were taking , such as cholesterol - lowering drugs , may have lowered the overall risk .
Analysts did not believe the study would materially impact Diovan sales as the drug is set to go off patent in 2012 .
By Steven Goddard
Yesterday WUWT reported on the inaccurate # 1 environmental story at Guardian .
The Guardian article originally read :
The volcanic eruption has released carbon dioxide , but the amount is dwarfed by
the savings .
Based on readings taken by scientists during the first phase of
Eyjafjallajokull activity last month , the website Information is Beautiful
calculated the volcano has emitted about 15,000 tonnes of CO2 each day .
After their article was written , more accurate information spread across the web – The Guardian numbers were off by more than an order of magnitude :
Experts said on Monday that the volcano in Iceland is emitting 150,000 to 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) per day , a figure comparable to emissions released from a small industrial nation .
The Guardian responded by updating their article with better numbers , but failed to update their conclusions :
The volcanic eruption has released carbon dioxide , but the amount is dwarfed by the savings .
Based on readings taken by scientists during the first phase of Eyjafjallajokull activity last month , the website Information is Beautiful calculated the volcano has emitted about 150,000 tonnes of CO2 each day .
Worldwide , the US Geological Survey says volcanoes produce about 200m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year .
• This article was changed on 21 April .
It originally said the volcano has emitted about 15,000 tonnes of CO2 each day .
Information is Beautiful has since corrected this figure to 150,000 ; we have updated our article to reflect this .
So what is wrong with their correction ?
Lots of things .
Their source of information now claims that the numbers are 206,465 tons saved vs. 150,000 tons emitted by the volcano .
Those two numbers are well within the margin of error of the volcano estimates , and are the very low end of what scientists are claiming .
If we use the average scientific estimate of 225,000 – the volcano was actually producing more CO2 per day than the savings from grounded aircraft .
Yet the Guardian story still claims that emissions are dwarfed by the savings .
The Guardian story claims that there have been 2.8 million tons of savings , and the math does n’t work out .
At the time the story was written there had been six days of grounded flights .
206,465 tons / day X 6 days = 1.2 million tons , not 2.8 million tons .
The Guardian failed to research the actual volcano estimates , and again published the very low end numbers from an apparently unreliable source .
They failed to consider that the eruption has been going on for more than a month , while the flight ban has lasted only six days .
Total volcano emissions actually dwarf the savings from the aircraft .
They failed to consider Anthony ’s point that people stranded by grounded aircraft seek other means of transportation , including cars , trains and battleships , etc .
The BBC estimated that these other modes of transport generate as much CO2 as the planes would have .
They failed to consider that the airlines will eventually run extra flights in order to catch up .
The evidence indicates that the net balance from the volcano is a large increase in CO2 emissions .
The Guardian article was just Plane Stupid .
Furthermore , we know that plants , soil and the oceans generate 30 times as much CO2 as all fossil fuel burning combined .
That is 200,000,000,000 tons of CO2 per year from natural sources , compared with The Guardian ’s inaccurate claim of 2,800,000 tons in savings from aircraft grounded .
In other words , even their exaggerated claimed savings are less than 0.0014 % of all natural emissions of CO2 .

I 'm writing this review from the future .
I 'm writing it from a magical device , filled with wonder and the promise of better things still to come .
Or alternately , I could just be writing this from an evolutionary dead end , equipped with a gimpy ARM chip , a little bit of RAM , and some flash memory hooked up to a 10 - inch LCD screen .
Whether it's a harbinger of a closed , innovation - dead world haunted by locked - down computing or the gateway to a better world of computing , where applications never crash and the world is just a finger - swipe away is hard to say .
What I can tell you today is that , love it or hate it , the iPad is going to change things .
Because the iPad really needs no introduction , I 'm going to take advantage of my bully pulpit to talk about what Tested 's reviews are really about .
When we first started talking about Tested , there were two things I wanted to change about tech sites .
First , I wanted to avoid the cynicism about technology that pervades so much tech coverage -- we 're living in the midst of the biggest technological revolution the world has ever seen , and goddamnit , that 's exciting !
I also wanted to break free of speeds and feeds - based reporting around products .
It does n't matter if product X is 12.8 % faster than product Y unless product Y is slower than I 'd like it to be .
While this seems to conflict with my Maximum PC , speed - at - all - costs roots , I do n't think it does .
It just marks the transition from a time when most computers were slow and shitty to today 's world where a $ 500 PC is fast enough for most people .
Performance has become a binary criteria -- products are either fast enough or not fast enough .
In the post - performance oriented world , the questions I 'm interested in are simple :
Does this product do something I need or want ?
Is it better than the stuff I already have ?
So , with that in mind , here 's the official Tested iPad review .
( If all you want to know is whether to bust out the credit card , I 'll give you the TLDR version up front :
You should wait , but probably just for the 3G version . )
After a couple of weeks of nearly constant iPad use , my feelings about the device remain mixed .
Now that the new 's worn off of Apple 's tablet , it 's a little heavier than I 'd like when I 'm holding it in one hand , but it 's a much more comfortable way to use the Internet on the couch than my laptop or netbook .
It does n't get hot or warm when I use it .
I have n't had to think or worry about its battery life .
It 's very clearly not a PC , and in some ways , it 's incredibly limited .
Managing files and sharing them between apps is , frankly , a nightmare .
It famously does n't support Adobe Flash .
And , for some inexplicable reason , you need to connect it to an iTunes - enabled computer before it will do anything .
But , by harnessing cloud apps , like Dropbox , Gmail , and Google Calendar , all the data that 's most important to me is effortlessly available on my iPad .
And , the iPad might be the ultimate media consumption device -- you can decide for yourself whether that 's a good thing or a bad thing .
Performance
The iPad is the perfect example of why speeds and feeds are becoming less relevant .
By all rights , this device should feel painfully slow and be outperformed by the least capable of $ 299 netbooks .
However , because Apple used the stripped down iPhone OS on the iPad instead of a heavier desktop OS , the iPad feels stupendously fast , especially compared to other ARM - based devices -- smartphones like the iPhone 3Gs , Nexus One , and Palm Pre Plus .
The integrated apps all feel significantly faster than their iPhone counterparts do on a 3Gs .
That 's not to say that the iPad is fast , simply that the things you do most -- scroll , zoom in and out , and flip pages -- all feel fast .
In particular , I found Apple 's Pages app , the stripped - down word processor , positively pokey .
While I could n't type faster than the app could handle , there was visible lag when typing or scrolling the page .
It was n't slow enough to make the app difficult to use , but it was definitely noticeable .
The slowdowns were n't limited to Pages either , we had slowdowns in several third - party apps , including games and productivity apps .
We also found that the more complex applications , specifically the photo editors and retouch programs could be very sluggish -- and definitely pushed the limits of the iPad 's hardware .
We also experienced framerate issues in multiple games , including Sam & Max and Plants vs. Zombies .
Despite a few sluggish apps , the iPad feels significantly faster than a comparably priced netbook running Windows .
The OS gets out of the user 's way , so I never felt like i was waiting on the machine .
Initial boot takes about 20 seconds , but after that , waking the iPad from sleep is essentially instantaneous .
The Experience
The iPad is very clearly a device that 's supposed to be held while using , on the couch , on a plane , in a chair reclining , whether it 's resting in your lap or on your knee .
While you can easily use it in any orientation -- it switches from portrait to landscape very quickly - - I find myself using it most often one of two ways .
Either Commander Data - style tucked into the crook of my left arm , tapping the screen with my right hand or resting on my lap or chest when I 'm in a sitting or reclining position .
While you could use it at desk or table , you either need to prop it up on something or it rests flat , which forces you to hunch over it in a decidedly uncomfortable way .
It 's a little heavy to hold one - handed while reading -- something that 's not a problem when using a traditional eBook reader , like the Kindle - - and it can be awkward to prop up for movie or TV watching , unless you ponied up for a case with a stand .
I managed to watch a few movies in bed using Netflix and AirVideo by propping it up against some pillows , but this was not a great solution .
And , you 'll be able to watch more than a few movies on a single charge .
We were able to play almost 16 hours of standard - definition , mostly black - and - white videos from the Prelinger archives .
During our less formal testing , the only way we were able to run the battery down before the end of the day on the Wi-Fi model down was by playing 3D games for hours , non-stop .
Streaming movies from Netflix ate less than 10 % of the reported battery per film .
The iPad 's screen looks fabulous .
It 's bright , clear , and crisper than a 1024x768 screen has any right to be .
The bezel , which looked overlarge in photos is actually a little too small to allow easy one - handed operation , when reading a book or watching a movie .
I find that I accidentally turn pages in iBooks or the Kindle app more often than I 'd like when my finger moves into the page - turning area of those apps .
And , although I was very concerned about eyestrain using the backlit LCD , it has n't been a problem so far .
I 've read a couple of books on the iPad so far , a ton of comic books , and a bunch of web articles .
Late at night , I simply turn the brightness on the display as low as it will go .
Gorgeous though it might be , the screen is incredibly susceptible to fingerprints -- you do n't notice them as you 're using it , but after a few minutes it looks absolutely disgusting , even if you have clean hands .
If you 're going to buy an iPad , make sure you also grab a couple of microfiber wiping cloths .
You 'll need them .
As for actually using the device ?
Touching the screen to browse the web , interact with pages , and launch and use apps feels incredibly natural and works beautifully with the iPhone OS 's user interface .
While some of the native apps do n't make particularly good use of the additional screen real estate -- most notably the Home screen -- the majority do , thanks to two new user interface additions : split view and popovers .
Split view is roughly analogous to a traditional two - pane email app .
A sidebar includes navigation elements or content selection , while the other half displays the aforementioned content .
Popovers are simply small popups that display relevant context - sensitive info inside your app 's window .
In the shot below , you can see how Mail uses both split view and popovers to display much more information per pixel than you 'll see on the iPhone or iPod Touch .
Mail uses both split view and the new popover at the same time .
Popovers are great for context - sensitive info , while split view lets you see data and organizational views at the same time .
Typing , on the other hand , sucks .
While I 've gotten to a passable level after about two weeks , I do n't see myself getting much faster or more accurate .
The keys are too far apart to use with my thumbs when I hold the iPad by the lower corners in portrait orientation , and I have to rest the iPad on my lap or a table to type in landscape .
And while you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard to the iPad , you 'll need to use that in conjunction with a case -- one that integrates a stand -- or the Dock accessory .
I found it virtually impossible to manage the keyboard and the screen on your lap separately .
First - Party Software
The iPad ships with relatively few apps : Mobile Safari , Contacts , Calendar , Mail , YouTube , iPod , Videos , Notes , Photos , and Maps .
There are a few notable iPhone stalwarts missing -- Clock , Calculator , Weather , Voice Recorder , and Compass , to name a few .
However , the alarm clock functionality of the Clock app is the only thing that 's not easily replaced with a better app from the App Store .
Each of the first - party apps that made the cut was redesigned for the iPad .
They 're all very slick , easy to use , and make the iPhone versions of the same apps feel instantly old and busted .
I 'll touch on each of the first - party apps briefly , and take you on a quick look into the App Store and iTunes store , but for the most part , the first - party apps are n't the reason you 'd want an iPad .
While they 're useful , the many thousands of apps already available in the App Store are the iPad 's secret sauce .
Mobile Safari
Unlike the iPhone , where I only use the browser as the last resort for information that I can't get using an app or RSS feed that is more appropriate for the small screen , I found myself using Mobile Safari frequently .
The browser lives somewhere between a fully - featured desktop browser and the limited mobile browsers typically found on phones .
Mobile Safari is far from perfect , but it's a significant step up from the iPhone version of the browser .
The iPad 's screen is more than large enough to handle rendering the real web , but many sites force the iPad to the mobile version of the site , and some others just plain do n't work , and we have n't even touched on Flash yet .
The upshot on Mobile Safari is that it lives in a no-mans land , between the mobile and desktop world .
The lack of Flash is an annoyance , but I 'm more concerned by the fact that there 's no extension architecture and overall performance with Javascript is bad .
And , some Javascript simply does n't work .
While basic Javascript seems to work OK , it 's inconsistent , and fails when you visit more complex pages .
The performance hit is especially evident when you load a lightbox popup image or try to type in a WYSIWYG HTML editor .
Using the SunSpider Javascript benchmark , which is representative of real - world Javascript - heavy tasks , we found the iPad to be roughly an order of magnitude slower than a two - year - old MacBook Pro running Firefox 3.6 .
The MacBook Pro took 657 ms running Safari 4 , 1,224ms running Firefox , and 10,641ms on the iPad 's version of Mobile Safari and 14,572ms for the iPhone 3Gs .
I said earlier that speeds and feeds are n't important , but this poor Javascript performance will limit how you use the device , locking out Javascript heavy sites , like Gmail and Google Docs , and even preventing you from using dynamic elements of simpler sites -- such as our comment form and lightbox image popups on websites .
It 's also disappointing that there 's no option for extensibility whatsoever in the browser , you can't save downloaded files , aside from photos , and the browser is missing the ability to sync bookmarks over the air .
While Mobile Safari is perfectly acceptable for browsing the web , it 's not particularly good for interacting with it .
Even with all those problems , the benefits of the platform -- an instant - on device that never gets too warm for your lap and weighs just 1.5 pounds -- make the iPad great for browsing the web .
If the iPad was paired with a world - class browser , like Chrome , Firefox , or full - strength Safari , it could become a truly revolutionary piece of technology .
Calendar , Contacts , and Notes
Despite the fact that the iPad is a decidedly post - paper device -- given one , a place to charge at night , and your schedule and contact data stored in the cloud - - you 'll never miss your Rolodex .
The Calendar and Contacts apps both use traditional paper metaphors for your data , which is especially funny to me , since I have n't carried paper versions of either since I bought a Palm III more than a decade ago .
Despite the anachronism , they both work well , syncing with MobileMe , Exchange , or Gmail .
Notes also mimics paper , this time a simple notepad .
However , the Notes app only allows text input using the keyboard , you can't actually write or draw on the screen using your finger .
Note also lacks an easy mechanism to sync the notes you take on the device to the Internet .
The only way to get text out of Notes ?
Email the files to yourself or sync the iPad with your primary computer -- Notes do n't even sync across MobileMe .
Mail
The iPad 's Mail client is a high point .
The device is especially well suited to email reading and management -- although the keyboard issues make writing long emails a hassle .
The instant - on nature of the iPad makes it easy to pick up and check email , just like the iPhone .
Unlike the iPhone however , the larger screen makes it easy to simultaneously view your inbox and individual messages at the same time .
The Maps app on the iPad is exactly like the one on the iPhone - - it 's just faster , bigger , and better in almost every way .
The updated maps app adds Street View and a terrain layer to the traditional street , satellite , and hybrid views .
While you'd think that the biggest problem with Maps is the Wi-Fi iPad 's lack of a GPS tranceiver , it does a very good job geolocating you using a combination of your IP address and the location of any Wi-Fi access points in your vicinity .
The big problem is that Maps requires an online connection in order to work .
Without a constant connection to Google Maps , you get no mapping mojo .
While that limitation will prevent you from using Maps on the go , it 's still handy to have for reference when you 're connected to the net .
YouTube
Like the iPhone 's app , the iPad YouTube app gives an optimized front - end for convenient viewing of the best pet videos on the Internet .
However , because YouTube 's touch - screen site gives native access to iPhone OS - compatible videos , i do n't really see the need for the limited app version anymore .
i Pod and Videos
It did n't really make sense to us , but for some reason , Apple split the video playback functionality and the music playback functionality into two separate apps : Video and iPod .
The iPod app closely mimics the iTunes interface , allowing you to navigate your collection and view and manipulate playlists at the same time .
While this would be really convenient if you loaded the iPad with thousands of songs , we did n't find the iPad to be a particularly convenient MP3 player .
It 's just physically too big , and it seems to me that you'd be better off using the iPad 's capacity for movies and apps -- and listening to music on a pocket - sized dedicated device .
Videos is a much simpler app , with basic menus for TV shows and movies , which can either be files you 've ripped yourself , digital copies you 've gotten with Blu-rays or DVDs , or content you 've purchased from the iTunes store .
It displays meta -data , cover images , and all the other stuff you 'd expect .
As with the iPod software , the only way to get content onto the iPad is to either download it directly from the iTunes store or sync with your computer .
There 's no camera on the iPad , but it makes a decent , if very expensive photo frame .
You can sync photos using iPhoto on the Mac or iTunes on Windows , download them from the web , or use a third - party app to pull them from another online photo service .
The process works much better using iPhoto on the Mac - - syncing metadata on people and events .
Third - Party Apps
The true power of the iPad becomes apparent when you visit the App Store and start downloading .
There are already thousands of apps that let you use the iPad with damn near anything .
You can stream movies from Netflix , download comics from Marvel , stream music from Pandora or Last.fm , buy books from Apple or Amazon , connect to social networks , or simply play a game .
And , if you can't find an iPad-native app that does what you want , odds are good that there 's an iPhone app that will work -- although the iPhone apps look particularly unsavory on the iPad 's screen -- whether you run them at native resolution or enable the pixel doubling option .
Of course , third - party apps are hobbled until iPhone OS 4.0 comes out for the iPad this autumn .
Without multi-tasking APIs , utilities like Last.fm and AIM are much less useful .
I found the pop up push notifications to be much more intrusive on the iPad than they are on the iPhone , simply because I 'm typically doing something that 's more involved on the tablet .
The one place that a third - party app is truly competitive with Apple 's first - party apps is the eBook .
The Kindle app is superior to iBooks in nearly every way .
With several different color schemes including a sepia tone paper that 's much easier on the eyes that pure white and the ability to turn off the precious page - turn animations that are de rigeur in the iBooks app , we 'll continue to buy our books in the Kindle store , at least until a DRM - free alternative is available .
Speaking of DRM - free books , that 's the only way that the iBooks app is superior to the Kindle app - - it supports DRM - free ePub books -- which you can find all over the Internet .
We 've already spoken about a whole host of iPad apps on the site , but here are a few of my favorites .
How Does It Make You Feel ?
This sounds glib , but the iPad really makes me want to buy stuff .
When it 's in my hand , I can purchase virtually any kind of media -- movies , TV shows , magazines , music , audiobooks , traditional books , comic books , and anything else that can be digitized and transmitted over Wi-Fi .
While I do n't typically buy movies from the iTunes store due to the DRM that Apple uses , the experience was just as easy as buying apps from the App Store .
That said , there 's very little content creation to be done on this device , at least until the apps start flowing in earnest .
It 's also worth talking about the distraction factor .
When I 'm reading a book on the iPad , whether I 'm using Amazon 's Kindle app or iBooks , I frequently find myself checking in on other apps -- whether it's an ongoing Words With Friends game , what 's happening on Twitter , or just to take a peek at my email inbox .
Of course , these things are so distracting because they 're so easy .
You 're really just a couple of taps away from THE WHOLE INTERNET .
It 's also worth reiterating what the iPad does exquisitely well .
In addition to putting all the content you 've purchased at your fingertips , the iPad also does a great job of making all of your data accessible .
Whether it 's email , contacts , and calendar or your Twitter feed , Facebook profile and Foursquare " Spam Your Friends " button , it 's all a mere second or two away .
Having a computer , however limited , that 's instant - on and always around transforms " checking in on the Internet " from a a structured activity that takes 20 or 30 minutes to something that can happen whenever you have a free moment .
I 'll let you decide whether that 's a good thing or a bad thing .
The Weird and the Bad
As we said before , the iPad 's certainly not perfect .
I 'm not going to talk about the covered - to - death lack of Flash and the hefty weight for a device you should be able to use one - handed .
I am going to talk about the general weirdness the iPad inherits due to its place in the no-mans - land between cell phone and real computer .
Take the initial out - of - box experience , for example .
The first thing you do with a new PC or Mac is fire it up and create your user account .
The first thing you do with the iPad is sync it with a real PC .
While there are hints in OS 4 that this may not be necessary -- the 4.0 beta includes the ability to enter your Apple ID sans iTunes - - it 's janky today .
And , despite the fact that the device has oodles of battery and an always - on wireless connection , you still can't sync media wirelessly , nor can you schedule automatic downloads of podcasts or other free content .
The weirdness keeps getting weirder .
Just like the iPhone , you can only sync the iPad with a single iTunes install .
If you sync your iPad with a desktop computer at home -- you know , the computer that you own that 's most likely to have the most storage -- that 's the only place you can sync apps , books , movies , or music onto the iPad .
While you can transfer files to individual apps from any iTunes - equipped PC , it 's not easy .
You do it by dragging and dropping them into the app menu in iTunes , but the process is confusing and perilous .
If you try to sync your iPad with another iTunes library , it will nuke everything on the device and replace it with whatever you have locally .
What if you want to work on the same file using two different apps ?
That 's impossible , without that same external iTunes connection .
Because of the weird way that the iPhone OS partitions the phone 's storage , two apps can't share access to the same files , unless the two apps are designed to work together or toss data from the tablet to the web and back again .
That limitation alone is a deal breaker for the iPad as a serious content creation device .
Can you imagine having to connect your PC to a second computer in order to open a document you created in Word using Acrobat ?
That 's the way the iPad works .
They only ways to get files onto the device involve either using iTunes , downloading them directly from the Internet , or receiving them as email .
And what if the iPad 's OS does n't know what to do with a particular filetype ?
Tough luck , you simply can't download it .
The other major gotcha is backwards compatibility .
While I was able to run every iPhone app that I tried on the iPad , it 's not a good experience .
You can choose to run the app either at native resolution , which centers it in the middle of the iPad 's screen , or pixel - doubled , which stretches it to fill most of the screen .
This effectively gives you a choice between apps that look tiny or awful .
On top of that , emulated apps use the old - school iPhone - style keyboard for data entry , which is very difficult to use on the larger device , no matter which mode you use .
I was able to play a few lo - fi games and apps that do n't require much data entry , like Canabalt and Dropbox , but for the most part , backwards compatibility is a gimmick that you 'll rarely use .
The larger , yet more ethereal problem I have with all of the iPhone OS devices is that the software you 're allowed to install on devices you 've purchased is controlled by Apple , specifically the capricious App Store approval team .
This small group of people inside Apple decide what 's appropriate or is not appropriate for the App Store , using an unpublished , seemingly Meese - ian " I know it when I see it " set of guidelines .
The approval team follows a set of nebulous , private rules to determine what 's acceptable and rejects any app that it feels is n't up to snuff .
This means Apple has an iron lock over their platform , and the ability to stifle ... well , anything it wants to .
Of course , it 's possible to jailbreak your iPad and run whatever you want , bypassing the App Store 's Walled Garden , but should we have to do that for a device that costs as much as $ 900 ?
There are a host of other minor issues with the iPad .
It lacks any kind of haptic feedback , so you 'll never see rumble in games or touch - based feedback for typing , ala Android .
It 's extremely finicky about charging from USB ports -- the only surefire way to charge it is to use the 10W power brick that Apple included with the device .
The included USB cable is much too short for this type of device -- it wo n't reach from the floor to a nightstand or table .
These are minor complaints , but annoying nonetheless .
Is Now the Right Time to Buy an iPad ?
Here 's the thing .
The iPad is one of a near infinite number of potential futures for computing .
It will inevitably spawn a number of similar tablet -y products over the next few years , and many of them will address the problems with the iPad - - the walled garden and Apple 's iron lock on the platform .
In fact , it 's entirely possible that the iPad is an evolutionary dead end .
Right now , it does n't fill any existing niches , and it has n't convinced me that I need a third screen .
It 's an incredibly sexy device , it 's undeniably neat , and it 's much easier to use than my iPhone or Nexus One .
However , its size also makes it much less convenient to tote around than a smartphone , and the ingrained limitations make it much less useful than a computer .
But , when I balance the limitations of the iPad against the convenience of an always - on , Internet connected device with a real - screen , the convenience of hundreds of thousands of apps , and the ability to buy and view almost any type of media I might be interested in , the scales move closer to balanced .
After using the iPad for two weeks , I 'm less concerned by its lack of Flash than I am by its janky filesystem and lack of multitasking .
The multitasking problem will be improved in OS 4 , but the filesystem looks to be a continuing problem .
I still worry that the iPad is just the latest reincarnation of the thin client fad that seems to pop up every ten years or so , but it 's more capable than thin clients have ever been before .
Over the last two weeks , I 've frequently left my five pound laptop at the office , something I have n't done in half a decade .
Instead , I 'm toting about two pounds of iPad and keyboard back and forth .
While the iPad is n't a great solution for large - scale projects -- I switched to a laptop and Google Documents about halfway through this review -- I can definitely see myself carrying it sans laptop on personal and business trips and as a laptop companion on expeditions to trade shows .
Even though the iPad is heavy for a single - handed device , it 's positively svelte by netbook and laptop standards , even with a Bluetooth keyboard in tow .
And then , there 's the media consumption aspect .
On no other portable device can I watch movies I 've ripped , TV shows I 've purchased , stream films from Netflix , read comic and books , and listen to music or podcasts as conveniently and slickly as I can on the iPad .
This is really the ultimate consumption device .
Sure , much of the media you can purchase is encumbered by crappy DRM , but it 's entirely within Apple 's rules to rip your own content and put it on the iPad , and it excels at that .
Ultimately , for me , it boils down to size .
My smartphone fits in my jeans pocket .
My laptop and netbook requires a man purse , messenger bag , European carry - all , or satchel .
So does the iPad .
But the difference is that my laptop weighs six pounds and my netbook weighs three .
Even though the iPad does n't really replace a real PC , it 's a capable stand - in and it weighs less than two pounds with keyboard and charger .
Still , you do n't need an iPad , but it is a convenient , useful device for using the Internet and consuming content .
And , the big screen makes it much more flexible than the iPhone .
Yes , the iPad is a big iPod Touch - - that pretty much sums up everything that 's good and bad with the platform .
And , whether I 'm at home or away , the iPad is undoubtedly the ultimate bathroom computer .
Which iPad to Buy ?
First off , you should know that Apple is almost certainly going to release a second - generation iPad within the next 18 months , and most likely within the next twelve .
So , if you 're going to be upset that your iPad is obsolete in twelve months , you probably should n't buy one .
Disclaimers aside , if you decide you want an iPad , I 'm recommending that you wait for the 3G models .
I have n't tested the 3G iPad yet , but for a device that 's not upgradeable , it makes sense to buy the most fully - featured option available at the time you make the purchase .
After all , the ability to turn the 3G iPad 's data plan on and off on a month - to - month basis is very compelling if you do n't travel enough to make a MiFi or similar device worth a monthly charge .
But honestly , I 'm more interested in having a GPS locator in the iPad than cellular data -- the Wi-Fi version just feels limited without it .
As for capacity , the 32 GB model seems like the sweet spot , if you like to watch movies .
With some apps consuming almost 2GB of storage , the 16GB model looks too small .
On the same note , the 64GB model seems bigger than necessary -- the 32 GB model I tested for this review was more than sufficient to hold a half dozen movies , as well as a few gigs of TV and music , with plenty of space left over for apps .
I guess that makes the short , short , short version of a very long review , " If you 're going to buy an iPad this year , get the 32 GB 3G model " .
It 's really that simple .

There are insufficient vowels in the English language to describe the damage sportswear has wrought on our national identity .
That it is considered acceptable for a full - grown man to wear Lycra in public , the ghoulish outline of his inner sanctum served up for all to see , demonstrates the depths of sartorial chaos we have plunged to .
And in Great Britain , a relatively benign landmass that enjoys a pleasant climate , humans currently jaunt about their business sporting fleece , polyester and scientific materials designed to withstand the extreme rigours of Himalayan peaks and Arctic tundras .
To spend 15 minutes around Bloomsbury , you would think you were closer to the North Shore of Oahu than the British Museum 's intriguing numismatic collection of medieval currency .

Cif commenter Unexceptional , in one of the finest exemplars of British knitwear , dared to raise his head slowly to the sky and humbly ask : " Whither the well - dressed gent ? "
Whither indeed .
He has been hunted to the point of extinction .
A legend .
Ancient lore .
Society is all the more impoverished .
Not only have we lost the gentleman 's cheerful and pleasingly unproductive outlook on life .
Of more concern , his coat of arms has been tossed on to the cultural compost heap .
Tweed , linen and corduroy ( the aromatic , manure - coloured variety ) , the holy trinity of British style , are nowadays considered the fabrics of the fuddy - duddy , the village historian who uses an ear trumpet and partakes in brass rubbing .
Small children , with tattoos on their eyeballs , dressed head to toe in American aberrations throw stones at him , make wholly inappropriate hand gestures and taunt him mercilessly .
" Look at that knob in tweed !

To add poorly dressed insult to injury , just as fringe political parties flourish in constituencies where the main three fear to tread , trendy buffoons have usurped the mantle of British panache and are busy subverting it to their own nefarious ends .
Scylla and Charybdis travel the nation 's highways , convince retired primary - school teachers and landscape gardeners to pose in the buff , subject the poor blighters , who have the innocent temerity to not dress like vacuous cretins , to abject humiliation , and then stitch them up like oversized children .
Is there anyway to rekindle the flame of British élan ?
There are those who suggest we could learn a thing or two from the French or Italians .
Caveat emptor .
The antics of continental Europe should not be adopted lightly .
Certain practices and customs can feel entirely natural in the luxurious warmth of the Dordogne ( badminton and wearing shorts spring to mind ) , but take on far more sinister dimensions if adopted at home .
Gallic flair , while mildly impressive , is at cross-purposes with British majesty .
There is too much emphasis placed on silk , too much attention drawn to the erogenous zones and too much use of eau de toilette .
No thank you , Sir .
And the fashion escapades of Italians , who , it must be admitted , produce outstanding ice - cream , border on the ridiculous .
More 's the pity that not one of our prime ministerial candidates appears to own anything other than dull , drab , navy suits – the sort of ensemble that 's supposed to imply " Are n't I awfully dynamic ?
Watch me achieve . "
Achieve what exactly ?
Gordon Brown looks like an Easter Island statue made up to look like a mannequin , Cameron the creepiest prefect at school , all smiles for the teacher before trying to initiate you into a secret society with a marrow and a rubber ducky .
And Nick Clegg looks like he manages an Iceland .
Have none of these twerps read Shelley ?
When the time comes for you to canoe across the Styx , far better to bequeath a gloriously soiled pair of moleskin chap - pants to the family minors , than some ill - considered treaty .

For the time being , however , let us simply hang our heads in collective shame .
WARSAW / SMOLENSK , Russia ( Reuters ) - Poles were in deep mourning on Sunday after President Lech Kaczynski and many of the country ’s ruling elite were killed in a plane crash .
The aging Tupolev plane crashed in thick fog near Smolensk in western Russia on Saturday , killing all 97 people on board .
Kaczynski had been planning to mark the 70th anniversary of the massacre of Polish officers by Soviet forces in a nearby forest .
Tens of thousands of mourners thronged the streets of central Warsaw through the night into Sunday , turning the avenue in front of Kaczynski ’s palace into a sea of flowers and candles .
In this staunchly Roman Catholic country , many sang hymns and prayed .
Church doors stayed open for worshippers .
The chief of Poland ’s armed forces , the head of its navy , its central bank governor , opposition lawmakers and Kaczynski ’s wife Maria were among those killed in the crash .
“ Today in the face of such a drama our nation stays united .
There is no division into left and right , differences of views do n’t matter .
We are together in the face of this tragedy , ” the parliamentary speaker , now Poland ’s acting president , Bronislaw Komorowski said in a televised address to the nation .
Komorowski declared a week of national mourning .
Poles will observe two minutes of silence on Sunday at noon ( 4 a.m. EDT ) .
Despite Poles ’ deep sense of loss , analysts said the crash should not pose any serious threat to the political and economic stability of Poland , a staunch NATO ally of the United States and a member of the European Union .
RUSSIAN SOLIDARITY
World leaders expressed shock and sorrow .
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of Russia , Poland ’s historic foe , told Poles : “ This is a tragedy for us too .
We feel your pain . ”
President Barack Obama praised Kaczynski’s role in the pro-democracy Solidarity movement that overthrew communism in 1989 .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said : “ Germany will miss Lech Kaczynski . ”
Komorowski said he would set the date of a presidential election which had been due in October after holding talks with Poland ’s political parties .
Under the constitution the election must now be held by late June .
The mustachioed , bespectacled Komorowski , 58 , is the presidential candidate of Prime Minister Donald Tusk ’s ruling pro-business , pro-euro Civic Platform ( PO ) .
Opinion polls suggest he would have defeated Kaczynski in the election .
Tusk flew to the crash site late on Saturday , where he and Putin laid flowers together .

Kaczynski’s twin brother Jaroslaw , leader of Poland ’s main opposition Law and Justice Party ( PiS ) , also flew to the site to help identify the bodies .
The pilot of Kaczynski ’s plane ignored several orders not to land from air traffic control , the deputy chief of the Russian Air Force ’s general staff , Alexander Alyoshin , was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency .
Kaczynski , a combative nationalist often at odds with Tusk ’s centrist government and the EU , was a staunch critic of Putin ’s Russia .
Putin had invited Tusk , not Kaczynski , to ceremonies last Wednesday marking the Katyn massacre anniversary .

Poles noted the irony of a crash that claimed the lives of so many members of Poland ’s elite near the spot where Josef Stalin ’s NKVD secret police shot dead some 22,000 Polish officers and intellectuals in 1940 , wiping out much of the country ’s wartime leadership .
Putin and Tusk had pledged at their Katyn commemoration last week to work to overcome such painful historic memories .
In a further gesture of Russian solidarity , President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to the Polish nation on Saturday evening in an unprecedented television address .
Russia has declared April 12 a day of mourning for the crash .
Russian television showed the smoldering fuselage and fragments of the plane scattered in a forest .
A Reuters reporter saw a broken wing some distance from the rest of the aircraft .
The plane was one of two Tu-154s in the government fleet , both about 20 years old .
Government officials had complained about the age of Poland ’s official fleet .
Poland and Russia both said they planned investigations into the causes of the crash .
CENTRAL BANK CONTINUITY
The conservative , nationalist - minded Kaczynski twins had spearheaded opposition to Tusk ’s pro-market economic policies and push for swift adoption of the euro .
Analysts said they expected an upsurge of sympathy for PiS now but said it was too early to predict whether this would translate into votes .
Kaczynski was a one - time ally of Solidarity hero Lech Walesa and a co-founder of the right - wing PiS with his brother .
He resigned from the party when he became president in 2005 but continued to support it .
While the president ’s role is largely symbolic , he can veto government laws .
Kaczynski had infuriated Tusk ’s government several times by blocking health , media and pensions reforms .
Analysts said Polish markets would not be severely jolted .
“ Although tragic , we do not believe that this event threatens political and financial stability in Poland in any fundamental way , ” Goldman Sachs said in a research note .
Apple 's decision to alter its iPhone developer licensing agreement yesterday to apparently exclude such offerings as Adobe 's forthcoming Packager function of Flash Professional CS5 that would allow developers to export Flash content into the native iPhone format has continued to rumble throughout the industry today , with voices weighing in from all over about the impact of the decision and Apple 's motivation for making the change .
Lee Brimelow , a " platform evangelist " for Adobe , shares his thoughts ( via TiPb ) on his semi-official TheFlashBlog , referring to Apple 's decision as a slap in the face to developers .
What they are saying is that they wo n't allow applications onto their marketplace solely because of what language was originally used to create them .
This is a frightening move that has no rational defense other than wanting tyrannical control over developers and more importantly , wanting to use developers as pawns in their crusade against Adobe .
An additional claim that " Apple has timed this purposely to hurt sales of CS5 " has been redacted from Brimelow 's blog entry at the request of Adobe , but not before it was captured by TiPb .
Adobe 's Creative Suite 5 , of which Flash Professional CS5 will be a part , is scheduled for introduction next Monday .
Brimelow notes that he has decided to boycott Apple products " until there is a leadership change over there " and states in no uncertain terms how he feels about the situation .
Now let me put aside my role as an official representative of Adobe for a moment as I would look to make it clear what is going through my mind at the moment .
Go screw yourself Apple .
But whether Apple 's move is solely a shot directed at Adobe as Brimelow and others have contended appears to be up for debate , as AppleInsider notes that it may have more to do with the multitasking features being deployed in iPhone OS 4 .
The primary reason for the change , say sources familiar with Apple 's plans , is to support sophisticated new multitasking APIs in iPhone 4.0 .
The system will now be evaluating apps as they run in order to implement smart multitasking .
It ca n't do this if apps are running within a runtime or are cross compiled with a foreign structure that does n't behave identically to a native C/C++/ Obj -C app .
" [ The operating system ] can't swap out resources , it can't pause some threads while allowing others to run , it can't selectively notify , etc .
Apple needs full access to a properly - compiled app to do the pull off the tricks they are with this new OS , " wrote one reader under the name Ktappe .
Whatever the reason for Apple 's adjustment of its licensing terms , tempers are certainly flaring in the protracted dispute between the two companies .
A fungus widely used in folk medicine in Taiwan - Taiwanofungus camphoratus - has been proven to contain an anti-inflammatory compound whether it grows in the wild or is cultivated , a local research team said Monday .
David Sheng - Yang Wang , an associate professor in National Chung Hsing University 's Department of Forestry and the head of the team , unveiled the results of the study at a news conference that was also attended by university president Shaw Jei-fu .
The study was also recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
Though T. camphoratus contains some 100 components , the team was able to prove that the fungus , which can only be found in the wild growing on the inner bark of a local camphor tree called Cinnamomum kanehirai , has anti-inflammatory properties through its bioactive compound antrocamphin A .
The study also found that the same amount of antrocamphin A can be derived from T. camphoratus after being cultivated for nine months , Wang said .
In isolating the antrocamphin A compound , the study only solidified the medical credentials of the fungus , which currently sells for up to NT $ 500,000 per kilo when found in the wild .
It has long been prized in folk medicine for treating liver cancer , food and drug intoxications , abdominal pains and hypertension , but Wang cautioned that because there are no standards used to verify the quality of the fungus sold in Taiwan , big discrepancies exist in the price and quality available .
In the team 's study , a lypopolysaccharides ( LPS ) - challenged acute inflammatory mouse was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the special fungus .
Pro-inflammatory molecule release in the liver of the mouse was suppressed by antrocamphin A , demonstrating its anti-inflammatory activity , according to Wang .
This attitude gave Collingwood an uncommon sympathy with religious ritual and practice , and a much more realistic understanding of its ongoing place in human life .
He also enables us to see why the majority of people , including those like myself who have no religious attachments , are nevertheless embarrassed at the dogmatic contempt poured on religious practice by our more militant atheists .
Every sane person recognizes at some level that dance , music , poetry , and ritual may be just what you need as you prepare to face a battle , or desolation , failure , grief , or death .
Most contemporary philosophers think of their subject in an entirely unhistorical way .
They conceive of themselves as investigating things such as the nature of thought , or truth , or reason , or meaning .
They wonder what a language , or a mind , or a world is that thought and reason and the rest are possible .
This conception of the investigation is entirely “ a priori ” : the problem would be the same as it perplexes us and as it perplexed Plato or Descartes .
For Collingwood , this is all self - deception .
What we may think of as a priori and timeless will be no such thing .
It will be simply an application of the “ absolute presuppositions ” of our own period of thought .
Those are the presuppositions that lie so far underneath the edifices we build that we cannot dig down to them .
They remain invisible , if only because they would be at work determining the shape our digging would take , or what we could notice as we conducted it .
We can never step on our own shadow .
The only power that can reveal these presuppositions is that of time : later generations will see them , but we cannot .
Myself , I find nothing shocking or surprising in this claim .
The hiddenness of a presupposition is like the peculiarity of a fashion , obvious to subsequent generations but necessarily invisible to those whose fashion it is .
When Hans van Meegeren forged paintings of Vermeer , he could deceive most of his contemporaries in the 1930s , but what he produced now look like 1930s paintings , even to an amateur eye .
When Sir Arthur Evans meticulously and diligently reconstructed the Minoan palace at Knossos , it looked like a contemporary Hollywood film set , a fantasy of what Knossos might have looked like .
Collingwood hated the dominant philosophy of his time because of its unhistorical nature .
It is not possible even to do science , in his view , without presupposing history , since it is only through their records and their results that scientists can pick up and profit from the labors of their colleagues .
But in principle , at least , it is possible to be a good scientist , at the cutting edge of a field , with little historical sense .
Philosophy , by contrast , is concerned with thought -- and as we have seen , Collingwood held that you cannot identify a thought unless you know to what question it was supposed to be an answer .
The history of philosophy is therefore not a somewhat down - market curriculum option of no great interest to contemporary practitioners , just as the history of physics might exist alongside physics as something for retirement or bedtime .
Instead Collingwood sees thought as something that is historically embodied : the idea of a worthwhile philosophy with no reflection on its own historical situation would be a contradiction .
We can understand where we are only by understanding where we have been : how we got there , and the thoughts of those who would wish us to have got somewhere else .
If Collingwood is as acute and interesting as I have suggested , how does it happen that he is largely a minority interest ?
He has his devotees , certainly ; but I doubt if he is more than a ghost in the footnotes to syllabi across the Western world .
The comparison to Wittgenstein might help .
It is difficult to pick up a page of Wittgenstein without being seduced : whether you understand it or not , the sense is overwhelming that something of the highest importance is being addressed with a rare detachment and intelligence .
With Collingwood , there is assertion and bravado instead of seduction .
Wittgenstein shows that he is a wonderfully and originally reflective thinker ; Collingwood cannot help telling you that he is .
Wittgenstein is silent about his being capable of other things as well ; Collingwood boasts of it .
You can read all of Wittgenstein without knowing of his genuine heroism during World War I .
One cannot help feeling that had Collingwood done anything like that , it would have cropped up on every other page .
All this is off - putting , and Collingwood ’s readers have to learn to shake their heads with a smile rather than toss the whole thing into the bin .
Unfortunately Android does n’t yet have flash support on its phones by OS default , but we ’ve been assured over and over again that it is coming .
While Apple disregards Flash on the iPad in favor of HTML5 ( and to spite Adobe ) , the jury is still out – and will be for some time – on which is more efficient for rendering animation .
Michael Chaize highlighted a test designed to determine which is currently faster on Android – Flash or HTML5 – by running some simple benchmarking animations on his Nexus One :
At about 2 minutes and 20 seconds in , you can clearly see that Flash is the victor , rendering animated balls with shadows MUCH more quickly and smoothly than HTML5 with both running on the Nexus One .
Furthermore , when testing the animation with Flash 10.1 on the Nexus One he gets 20 fps , while Safari only runs the animation at 1 - 2 fps on the iPhone 3GS with HTML5 .
A disclosure we should make : Michael Chaize is a Platform Evangelist for Adobe Flash .
The original article where this was posted – TheManInBlue.com – came to this conclusion :
Flash still wins , but browsers are catching up .
But this is n’t battle whose outcome will be decided any time soon – if ever .

The first edition of Vampire : The Masquerade was published in 1991 , introducing the concept of " Storytelling " to the rpg world .
Storytelling is roleplaying using streamlined rules that strip out most of the loot and adventuring of games like D&D and then using those simpler rules to resolve pretentious arguments about who is in charge of vampires in Milwaukee .
Vampire should also be credited with mainstreaming gays in roleplaying games .
Even elves in games like D&D were macho men , but in Vampire even the macho men wear leather daddy gear and carry around braces of twinks on leashes .
To call Vampire 's art overwrought is to miss the entire point of the game .
There 's no such thing as " too wrought " in Vampire .
Zack :
Here we go .
Everyone 's favorite .
Steve : Bro , I am going to stick up for Vampire all through this one .
I played the crap out of this and Werewolf back in the day .
Zack : Speaking of back in the day , we focused specifically on early and mid-1990s Vampire products for this article .
That would be 1st and 2nd edition Vampire .
Steve : I do n't know what edition is what , but you have gotta admit they pretty much nailed it with that cover .
Rose on marble .
You know what you 're in for .
Zack :
Steve :
You know what my two favorite things were about Vampire ?
Zack : I 'm just going to guess the two absolute worst things , which would be all the horrible music quotes littered through the books and the huge chunks of terrible fiction .
Steve : Nah , I was gonna say all the babes dressed with taped nipples and the cool powers like that one where you can boil a dude 's blood .
Zack :
What , no love for opening a chapter of a vampire book with a quote from Bauhaus referencing a vampire book ?
Steve :
What 's a Bauhaus ?
Zack :
There 's some hope for you yet .
Nearly 500 years after Juan Sebastián Elcano completed the first circumnavigation of the globe using nothing but renewable power , Swiss engineer Raphael Domjan and French sailor Gerard D'Abouville are preparing to repeat Elcano 's journey in an all - electric boat powered by the energy gathered by 470 square meters of solar panels .
Unveiled for the first time in a ceremony at a shipyard in Kiel , Germany , last week , their vessel is a catamaran made entirely out of the same kind of carbon - fiber composites that make modern airplane wings strong yet light .
On its 40,000 - kilometer journey , the 30 - meter long and 15.2 - meter wide boat , known as PlanetSolar , will have to withstand high winds , stormy seas and days without sunshine .
On board , the world 's largest lithium - ion battery , a 13 - tonne monster capable of storing 1,300 kilowatt - hours of energy when fully charged , will allow the boat to slice through the water at an average speed of 13 kilometers per hour for three days straight in complete darkness before its charge is completely exhausted .
The ship can fully recharge its battery in the span of a little more than two days of full sunshine if it's not drawing power at the same time , such as when it 's docked in a marina , according to Domjan , a paramedic turned engineer who is the visionary behind PlanetSolar as well as its co-captain .
The ship is designed , however , to operate at sea indefinitely , and under normal conditions its 38,000 solar cells average enough power production to muster the 20 kilowatts of power needed to keep the boat cruising along at its average speed .
The maximum electrical output of all the cells together on a sunny day is about 100 kilowatts .
On a solar boat , where the amount of energy available is much lower than on a traditional fossil - fuel–powered vessel , efficiency is of the utmost importance , says Jeff Morehouse , head of the Solar Splash intercollegiate solar boat competition and professor of mechanical engineering at University of South Carolina in Columbia .
In addition to its double - hulled design , which means the boat has much less drag when it moves through the water compared with a single - hulled boat of similar size , PlanetSolar has a number of innovations to make it as efficient as possible .
One of these innovations is PlanetSolar 's propeller design — both propellers sit at the water line , half in the water and half out .
This kind of prop , known as a " surface - piercing " propeller , can be much more efficient than traditional propellers , because it prevents the blades of the propeller from interfering with one another as they push through the water , Morehouse says .
The blades of a surface - piercing propeller also experience almost no drag during the time spent out of the water .
PlanetSolar also uses the highest efficiency mass - produced solar cells .
Manufactured by SunPower Corp. for installation on the rooftops of homes and commercial buildings , these cells can convert 22 percent of the sun 's energy into electricity , says Joern Juergens , director of components at SunPower .
After installation on the ship , however , the cells ' efficiency is reduced to 19 percent , because they must be covered in layers of plastic and transparent composites in order to make them immune to the corrosive effects of seawater and variable temperatures .
The solar cells powering PlanetSolar are at the high end of what 's available for home installation , but overall , the technology being used is " very straightforward , " Morehouse says .
The solar power component of this project is " purely a matter of being rugged enough to withstand ocean travel , " he adds .
Using standard , widely available technology is exactly the point of PlanetSolar , Domjan says .
" What we want to show with this project is that today we have the technology — you could buy this technology for your home , " he adds .
PlanetSolar will be tested in the water for the first time later this month , and by early 2011 its captains hope to be on their way , with stops including Hamburg , London , Paris , New York , San Francisco , Singapore and Abu Dhabi .
At each stop , the focus will be education .
" Our main goal is to be optimistic and to spread optimism , " Domjan says , " because almost everybody on this planet knows we have to change , but they think we can not change .
What we'd like to say to the world is , 'look , it will work — we can keep our level of life and if we use technology , it can be sustainable . ' "
Settlers from Yitzhar beat and lightly wounded a solider Tuesday evening .
The IDF said the settlers also hurled stones and slashed the tires of a military vehicle .
The incident took place after a military force issued a closed military zone order to keep the settlers from entering the Palestinian village of Madma , south of Nablus .
An altercation broke out , during which the settlers attacked the soldiers .
The IDF Spokesperson 's Unit said , " Violence towards soldiers is crossing the line in an intolerable manner , particularly on Israel 's holiday , Independence Day .
This intolerable and deviant conduct will be handled according to the law with the necessary resolve . "
A spokesperson for the Judea and Samaria District Police said one youth was arrested after he was seen slashing the tires of a military vehicle during the clashes in Yitzhar .
He was transferred to the police station for questioning .
Vandalized Palestinian vehicle in Gilad Farm
Sources from the settlement claimed that the IDF and police report was distorted .
They claimed that the soldiers expelled a group of travelers visiting the area for no reason .
They also claimed that one of the soldiers opened fire without being in any danger .
" We do not understand why the Samaria brigade commander insists on igniting the area by forbidding entrance to areas where there is no reason not to enter .
We hope that the IDF goes back to dealing with matters it is trained in , the main matter being defending the security of the lives of Jews in Israel . "
Earlier Tuesday another violent incident was reported in the West Bank , this time in the Gilad Farm , where a Palestinian vehicle was vandalized .
A young Palestinian couple who accidentally entered the community 's northern gate , had their tires slashed and their windshield broken by settlers .
The settlers spotted the Palestinian man outside of his car and suspected he was trying to steal horses .
The community 's security officer alerted soldiers , who separated between the parties and allowed the Palestinians to leave the area unharmed .
Following the incidents , the Rabbis for Human Rights organization warned against settler attempts to claim " price tags " in response .
The organization demanded the military give immediate protection to the Palestinian villages .
Goodbye The Silver Lining .
Our culture is formed by the sharing of ideas .
Throughout history , for millennia , every piece of art , music , literature and entertainment has been the result of a worldwide collaboration .
It ’s been an astonishing act of creative evolution , the most vibrant and extraordinary gene pool of imagination and inspiration , from which all were free to draw and create .
It has been exceptional , and in the last 50 to 100 years it has come to an end .
The tragedy of the abuse and misuse of intellectual property and copyright cannot be counted .
After centuries of sharing , we have allowed a “ MINE ! ” tag to be affixed to every thought , string of notes , doodle on a page , or merest whim .
We have committed a grotesque cultural suicide .
And the extent to which this has reached should be a parody .
We have now allowed ourselves to be in the situation where art museums ban sketching – something that should surely make anyone whose understanding of art history goes beyond yesterday scream in fear .
And it exists in our world of gaming in a similarly berserk form .
And so it is that Activision has closed down work on not - for - profit fan creation The Silver Lining .
Sierra ( also known as Sierra Online and Vivendi at various points in their existence ) were famed for shutting down any fan projects based on their IP .
Along with LucasArts , they have fired out many a cease & desist letter to many a just - for - fun fan project , in the name of defending their intellectual property ( IP ) .
The rationale behind this is two part .
First , due to the magical ways our sharing - preventing system works , if you are not seen to be actively defending your trademarks , you lose the exclusivity of the name .
Secondly , it is believed by these companies that if outsiders use their IP then they are being stolen from .
Zak McKracken , for instance , has n’t been used by LucasArts since 1988 . 22 years .
But if anyone tries to create a game featuring him they will likely be hearing from their lawyers .
LucasArts may want to sell the right to use Zak Mak to Telltale , for instance .
If he ’s let into the public domain this would be a revenue stream they ’ve lost .
There ’s an elegant solution .
You create a deal with the fans , allowing them the rights to use your IP but with some strict conditions :
They may not profit from your work , they may not identify the characters as their own , and so on .
The creators are still in control , but they allow the fans to celebrate the work with original productions .
It ’s a compromise , and it ’s a very acceptable one in the face of a larger sad situation .
Good sense tells you that fan appreciation is an advantage .
If someone claims to have created Zak McKraken and is selling the game to fund their badger baiting , then it is understandable that a corporation would wish to put a stop to this – in their view this is money that should be theirs being given to someone else .
But if you ’ve a fan base who love your games , and that base wants to endorse your game through their own not - for - profit creations , that ’s advertising .
It ’s people promoting your product for free .
If your product ’s for sale , it will introduce more people to your original game , and create a larger desire for more of the same .
In fact , it ’s something publishers are paying for .
Consider how much EA must be spending on the Dragon Age Journeys Flash games – they ’re essentially the same , just not made by fans .
A free - to - play tribute to the full game , played in an embedded web form , created purely as advertising .
That ’s the madness : these publishers know how valuable such things are .
Sierra / Vivendi made a deal with Phoenix Online Studios to allow them to make their King ’s Quest tribute game , The Silver Lining .
The studio asked that they not use the title “ King ’s Quest IX … ” , since it ’s not impossible that they ’d make their own ninth game at some point , but gave them the go - ahead .
Of course , not straight away .
Originally they received the traditional C&D letter from Vivendi , once the project was noticed .
Four years into development .
Their mistake was to release a trailer .
This was followed by a swell of support from fans of the project , sending over a thousand emails to complain about the actions of the publisher , and encouraging an agreement with the fan developers to allow them to continue .
And impressively , this worked .
In late 2005 they were permitted to continue .
After a recent decision to manage the project by dividing it into chapters , the first release was due soon this year .
It is no more .
Because now Activision – current owners of Sierra / Vivendi IP – have issued a new Cease & Desist to the amateur developers , shutting the project down completely .
And it ’s a brutal act .
Not just eight years of work immediately wiped out and all signs of the game removed from the internet , but Activision are even forcing them to close down their forums , deleting a decade ’s discussions between the community .
Something has gone so horribly wrong .
What did Activision possibly think they were going to lose from a property gained by buying Blizzard , that has n’t released a new game in twelve years ?
I am unable to think of a way maintaining or updating the Vivendi agreement could have harmed the giant corporation .
It does n’t threaten their options to continue the series , and nor is their any recognisable argument that it would reduce sales .
In fact , it may have quite the opposite effect .
Charles Cecil ’s Revolution has found that allowing fan projects may have even helped their sales .
( Declaration of interest here : I ’ve done work for Revolution on the DS / Wii version of Broken Sword ) .
Not only has Revolution released their earliest games , Lure of the Temptress and Beneath A Steel Sky as freeware , but they even went so far as to help the ScummVM team to make the games work on their emulator .
Further , the company has encouraged a German fan project with Broken Sword 2.5 , that tells a story between the events of the second and third Broken Sword games .
This is a game that not only uses the game title , but even artwork and assets from Cecil ’s originals .
So why does Cecil allow this ?
Is he not afraid of the same things that must be worrying publishers like Activision ?
“ I am aware that our approach is quite different to that of many other brand holders , ” Cecil explains , making no comment specifically about the Activision situation , but speaking about his own experience .
“ In the short term it is easy to understand why rights are so closely guarded , but I have no doubt that Revolution has benefitted in the long term by our more open approach . ”
He still wants limitations in place .
For Broken Sword 2.5 “ Uncle Charles ” Cecil was aware that there was a line that could n’t be crossed in terms of what they did with the game .
“ When we were approached by MindFactory who wanted to write Broken Sword 2.5 , I was happy to support the project but on the proviso that it was n’t sold . ”
He says this was because it crossed a line where it appeared the game was endorsed by Revolution , rather than being something inspired by them but created entirely separately as a tribute .
Cecil adds , “ Broken Sword 2.5 was a fun game , and was particularly impressive when you consider that it was created by enthusiasts . ”
So what about earlier games ?
Why did he allow his earliest IP to be available to ScummVM ?
“ Lure of the Temptress and Beneath a Steel Sky were written for MS - DOS – and when Windows stopped supporting DOS in the late ‘ 90s the games could no longer be played on then - current operating systems .
So when ScummVM approached us to port the games , I saw no reason not to allow them to do so and we offered the games for free . ”
It ’s Cecil ’s nonchalance about this , that to him it ’s obviously what makes sense , that strikes the strongest contrast between his attitude and those experienced elsewhere .
But did this do him any harm ?
Giving things away for free only a short time before it was realised that these old properties could be reinvented for the mobile market ?
It seems not , says Cecil .
“ In hindsight it was a smart move .
It kept the brands vibrant and , being free , they were played by a very wide audience . ”
And this , Cecil believes , offered advantages when it came to the iPhone release of Beneath A Steel Sky .
“ The iPhone with its touch interface offered the ideal platform to re-invent Beneath a Steel Sky – although , interestingly , a couple of people moaned that we were charging for the application .
Plenty of people responded to point out how ludicrous that argument was .
So the advantage of releasing the game through ScummVM was that it was kept the brand alive – the disadvantage was that some people then expected it to be permanently free . ”
There does seem to be strong logic to suggest that keeping old brands alive and in the public consciousness is advantageous to owners of IP , especially when they have n’t been used or even sold for as much as decades .
It seems counter - intuitive to stifle creativity inspired by a publisher ’s products , and it ’s certainly counter to the foundations of all culture .
We approached Activision for a comment , asking what their reasons were for closing down The Silver Lining , and whether they would ever allow a non-commercial license for a fan - made game based on their IP .
Unfortunately after twenty four hours we were finally told , “ No comment . ”
The Bill , which has caused ripples across the technology world , most notably because of its proposals regarding the suspension of repeat filesharers ’ internet connections and also the measures ( which were reintroduced by the Government last week ) that would allow politicians to block pirate websites without primary legislation , will now go through its committee , report and third reading stages this evening .
This is a procedure which usually takes several weeks or months , but as the Bill is now being pushed through into law in the wash - up process , which takes place between an election being called and Parliament being dissolved .

Tyler Cowen called on bloggers to list the books that most influenced them .
As soon as I started looking at other lists I got worried that I would n’t be able to come up with anything respectable .
Yes , I am familiar with A Theory of Justice , The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , Guns Germs and Steel , The Bell Curve , The Road to Serfdom , etc , etc .
But have I read them ?
Well , 30 years ago I read The Road to Serfdom , but I really do n’t remember the book at all .
Perhaps you saw the movie Metropolitan .
There is a scene where a young man is debating the merits of Jane Austin with a young woman at a New York cocktail party .
Finally in exasperation she asks the guy “ Which Jane Austin books have you actually read ? ”
He replied “ I do n’t actually read novels , I read literary criticism . ”
I ’m kind of like that asshole .
I have n’t read a lot of the intellectual classics , but can spend 30 minutes telling you what is wrong with each of them .
Yes , I ’m quite aware of how unfair this is ; I know that when you boil an argument down to its essentials the work can lose much of its persuasive power .
But I did read Pride and Prejudice .
( Update : Not only am I not well read , but I ca n’t spell either .
A commenter pointed out it is Jane Austen . )
The other point I ’d make is that even when I have read great books , they have n’t necessarily shaped my general worldview , but often crystallized ideas that I already had begun forming .
A good example is Fukuyama ’s The End of History .
I had already reached the conclusion that free markets and democracy were the wave of the future ( and still think so ) , but Fukuyama provided more of the historical , psychological and philosophical support for the hypothesis .
Sometimes I wonder whether it was inevitable that I would eventually end up with my current philosophical orientation .
Instead of a list of great books , here are some “ texts ” and writers that may have shaped my views , and a few observations on how they shaped my 35 year journey from dogmatic libertarianism to pragmatic libertarianism .
I believe the postmodernists say that almost anything counts as a text .
So I include films , old newspapers , magazines , etc. Consider this an intellectual biography .
Philosophy : I suppose my major influences have been McCloskey and Rorty .
If I ’m not mistaken there is a sort of official track of philosophy from Plato through Kant , and then another strand that has been skeptical of the entire enterprise .
I guess this latter group runs from the Sophists through Hume , Wittgenstein and Rorty .
At this point in my life I ’m not too interested in reading philosophy except as literature .
Hopefully when I retire I ’ll have time to read Hume , Schopenhauer , Nietzsche and others whose ideas I find intriguing .
I ’ve only read one book by Nietzsche , ( The Genealogy of Morals ) but he seems like the most interesting philosopher from a literary perspective .
( I do n’t care at all for his politics . )
In other posts I ’ve already talked about how McCloskey and Rorty pushed me toward pragmatism , and away from grand systems for getting at Objective Truth .
As I get older I become increasing skeptical of all knowledge claims , including my own .
At the same time , my pragmatism leads me to conclude that we need to proceed as if certain well - established propositions are true .
Micro :
My views of micro were shaped by all of the readings for the Chicago core ; textbooks by Stigler , Becker , Friedman , etc , as well as packets of practice exams .
This education convinced me of how useful the competitive market model is , even in markets that are n’t perfectly competitive ( which is almost all markets . )
It taught me that people are far more responsive to incentives than common sense would suggest .
That public policy trying to fix problems is much more likely to have unforeseen negative side effects than common sense would suggest .
It taught me that the world works in very , very counterintuitive ways .
Here ’s one way of thinking about the Chicago influence .
When I read Matt Yglesias ’ blog I see someone who seems to have basically the same values as I have .
I do n’t know if he ’s a utilitarian , but he justifies his conclusions with broadly consequentialist arguments .
And it also seems like he is smarter than me .
So why do I disagree on so many public policy questions ?
I think it is mostly because of my Chicago education .
I think I understand how the economic system works better than he does .
I ’d be the first to admit I may be wrong , as it is not easy to prove anything in economics .
But my hunch is that government fixes work much less effectively than most progressives believe .
At the same time Yglesias has a recent post defending Wal - mart ’s practice of giving payday loans and another suggesting that easy money is preferable to China bashing .
That ’s good .
To me , Yglesias seems much more interested in finding what works than someone like Krugman , who gives the impression of being uninterested in talking about anything but examples that confirm his current prejudice against free markets .
It ’s something one must fight against everyday .
I understand that I ’m biased , that I ’d much rather defend the free market .
But in the end I ’ve concluded that the world was n’t set up the confirm Scott Sumner ’s intellectual prejudices .
It is what it is .
If income redistribution and forced saving and central banking and carbon taxes makes the world a better place in utilitarian terms , then so be it .
But I still insist that people who have never been exposed to the full blast of a Chicago - style education do n’t know how much they are missing .
I recall being taught by incredibly smart people like Becker , Lucas , Stigler , McCloskey , etc .
I think these people are underestimated by progressives .
There must be dozens of Krugman and DeLong posts that suggest free market economists are n’t just wrong , but dumb .
When I read younger bloggers like Bryan Caplan I realize how much my brain has been dulled in the 30 years since I left Chicago , how much of my ( microeconomic ) analytical skills I ’ve lost that younger guys like him still have .
I suppose being at GMU keeps one on one ’s toes .
BTW , in case anyone thinks the Chicago education I describe was brainwashing , if a student answered a question with “ the free market works best ” they were torn to shreds by the professor .
There were a lot of diverse political views at Chicago , the Republican / Democratic vote split among the faculty was certainly much closer to 50 - 50 than at Wisconsin , where I was an undergrad .
Macro :
My biggest influences were Fisher and Friedman .
I read many books by Fisher , such as The Purchasing Power of Money , The Money Illusion , and Stable Money : A History of the Movement .
From the interwar period I was also greatly influenced by Cassel , Hawtry , Keynes ( the Tract , not the General Theory ) and Warren and Pearson .
From the post - war period Friedman was my biggest influence .
Mostly the Monetary History he wrote with Anna Schwartz .
I read it at Wisconsin , and immediately understood that the ( hydraulic ) Keynesian model that I was being taught was worthless , as I think even new Keynesians would now admit .
In general I like Friedman ’s critiques of Keynesianism much more than his defenses of monetarism .
I was also influenced by Mundell , Hall , Lucas and especially McCallum from the post - war period .
Lucas and McCallum taught me why rational expectations were so important , and why they are so misunderstood .
I picked up bits of supply - side from Laffer and Wanniski .
I enjoyed How the World Works , although I do n’t completely buy the supply - side argument .
Politics : I once read a modern US history by Michael Barone called Our Country .
( Actually I listened while driving . )
I recall that the book changed my mind on politics .
I used to think that the American people made the right choice when they picked the guy I favored .
Barone convinced my that there were usually good reasons for whomever was elected , even if ex post it turned out to be the wrong choice .
I developed a greater appreciation for democracy .
It ’s interesting that when I read Barone now he seems like a quite hard - core Republican .
That ’s not the impression I got from the book .
Did I misunderstand the message of the book ?
Did Barone misunderstand the message of his own book ?
Did his views change ?
It seems like the entire country got much more polarized over the past 12 years .
History : I once read all the New York Times from 1928 - 38 .
History seems really different when it is actually happening .
The people back then seemed just as smart as we are .
Of course we have a bit more history to learn from , so we did a bit better with monetary policy this time around .
But we still made many of the same mistakes , just to a lesser degree .
The class distinctions back then seemed bigger –which surprised me .
I knew that was the case for African - Americans , but I did n’t realize that class divisions among whites were also much greater , and that the upper class was so uninterested in the suffering of average farmers and workers .
Or how much wealth was concentrated in New York City at that time .
I also developed a much greater respect for the stock , bond , and commodity markets ’ ability to forecast the economy .
They reacted to lots of things that seemed very important at the time , and that I think actually were very important , which are totally ignored by historians .
A good example is the gold panic of early 1937 and the dollar panic of late 1937 .
The Neoliberal Revolution : The Economist magazine , which I ’ve read for 35 years , was my guide to the neoliberal revolution .
By the end of the 1980s I understood that it was a global phenomenon and that it was bi-partisan .
This inoculated me against Krugman ’s conspiracy theories that the Reagan revolution was all a right - wing Republican plot to grab Southern whites by playing the race card .
Even if true of the US , it does n’t explain why the same policy trends occurred in 200 out of 204 countries .
And then there is Krugman ’s argument that economies often did not do better after the free market reforms .
From The Economist I learned that you have to look at things cross-sectionally .
Almost everywhere in the world economic growth slowed after 1973 .
The important point is that growth slowed much more in countries that did little reform , and much less in the more free market economies .
It does n’t matter whether Chile grew faster or slower after 1973 , what matters is that after 1973 Chile became the most successful economy in Latin America .
Tactics :
The film Gates of Heavenly Peace convinced me that reform is usually better than revolution .
Culture and economics : I got a better understanding of culture by reading travel books and novels by V.S. Naipaul and his brother Shiva .
Thomas Sowell ’s books convinced me that culture was very important in explaining economic inequality .
And yet , I still find cultural theories of economic development to be unsatisfactory .
When Asia was far behind the West you could point to cultural differences .
When Asian started doing well you could point to the high IQs scores in some Asian countries .
When Ireland was poorer than Britain you could point to the conservative Catholic culture .
But then it suddenly got richer .
The poor performance of Latin America was due to the Spanish influence .
But then Spain started growing much faster than Italy .
No problem ; now people could point to all the Italians in Argentina .
The theories seem disturbing ad hoc ( and perhaps offensive as well . )
I still think culture matters , but I ’m just not sure how .
Communism : I ’m old enough that my ideas of economics were formed with the backdrop of communism .
We were right - wing because we were anti-communist .
( It ’s very revealing that when someone on the left described someone as an anti-communist back then , it was meant to be derogatory . )
I still recall when lots of progressives thought Mao was a great guy .
Communism is to modern liberalism roughly what racism is to modern conservatism .
Conservatives claim to be free of racism and progressives claim to oppose communism , but both groups have a lot of skeletons in their closets .
The book that had the greatest influence here was Harvest of Sorrow , which described the Russian / Ukrainian famine of 1932 - 33 .
Although the book was written by Robert Conquest , what I remember best are the quotations from Vassily Grossman — I suppose he ’s the person people should read .
I learned that starvation is perhaps the worst way a person can die , and hence that the Chinese Great Leap Forward was probably the worst thing that ever happened .
( Maybe not the worst crime , I suppose it was mass manslaughter , as compared to the Holocaust ’s mass murder . )
This also got me thinking about similar horrors , such as the treatment of Native Americans and the African slave trade .
Here ’s a few views that came out of this soul searching :
1 . The worst thing that ever happened ( the GLF ) , was partly motivated by one of the best of all human motivations , sharing .
That is , the same motivation that makes family life possible .
This led me to conclude that extreme egalitarianism and extreme selfishness are both among the most nightmarish scenarios .
We need to think long and hard about how to make egalitarian policies work effectively .
2 . If the GLF was a failure of communism , then the slave trade and death of millions of native Americans show the dangers of my favorite ideology , classical liberalism .
Yes , it was the classical liberals who were among the first to call for the abolition of slavery , and to organize anti-slavery movements .
But that ’s only part of the story .
Samuel Johnson asked “ how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes ? ”
And here ’s what worries me even more .
I believe that classical liberal ideas made Europe richer and more powerful than the rest of the world between 1400 and 1800 .
This allowed Europe to dominate the entire world in a way that was very costly to others ( even if some of the harm , such as smallpox was unintentional . )
Europe was gradually getting more ethical , but it was getting more powerful at a much faster rate .
What does this mean for today ?
Even though I favor classical liberal ideas like free markets , sometimes I wonder whether the experts in fields like biotech really know what they are doing .
Are they getting smarter and more powerful faster than they are getting wiser ?
Is there a danger that they could produce a pandemic for which they have no cure ?
Who knows .
But after watching our “ experts ” handle the financial crisis , I do n’t have much confidence .
I came of age during the 1970s , which made me a hard money guy .
Then I studied the 1930s and learned that it was people like me , hard money guys , who caused the Great Depression .
We need to be very careful when we are given a chance to run things .
Progressives face the same risks .
Obama ’s fans are frustrated that he is n’t able to do everything he wants .
But that may be a blessing in disguise .
In his heart he ’d probably prefer something like the Swedish model .
But in my view any attempt to impose that model on the US would lead to an economic disaster .
We are a very different country .
Optimism :
This may seem to conflict with what I just discussed , but I also think that we often worry too much .
The Population Bomb influenced me greatly , in two different ways .
I first read it as a teenager , and found it completely convincing .
Later I came to realize that the arguments were bogus , and I turned toward the sunny optimists like Julian Simon .
Even today this makes me a bit less concerned about global warming than someone like Al Gore , despite the fact that I agree the Earth is getting warmer due to greenhouse gases .
The things that scare me are the things were are n’t prepared for , like a pandemic .
I do think it ’s wise to have a carbon tax , for lots of reasons .
But I do n’t lose sleep over global warming , and expect something else will prove to be the biggest challenge of the 21st century .
I also read a book by Herman Kahn called The Year 2000 .
It ’s so long ago that I do n’t recall whether the book was any good .
But it did impress upon me the power of compound growth rates .
I suppose that ’s why sometime in the 1980s I realized that China was going to become a really big economy .
I just looked at three factors :
1. China was abandoning communism .
2 . Other market economies with similar cultures grew really fast in the 1960s - 1980s .
3. China had over a billion people .
That ’s one prediction I still feel pretty good about .
Literary influences : Under Western Eyes and Heart of Darkness are some of my favorite political novels .
I think Conrad ’s skeptical take on utopian ideologies holds up pretty well .
Both books seem prophetic , as does The Secret Agent .
But I tend to steer away from literature about society , or about politics , as I am kind of an anti-social personality .
I tend to like novels about loners , about nature , or about philosophical ideas .
I suppose my blogging style was influenced by the essays of people like Borges and Chesterton , who loved to play around with paradoxes .
They liked to start by saying something to the effect ; “ everyone believes X , but perhaps the exact opposite is true . ”
( Obviously I do n’t share Chesterton ’s political views . )
Many years ago I read a lot of the essayists that right wing intellectuals typically read ; Mencken , Tom Wolfe , Camille Paglia , PJ O’Rourke .
It seems like ages since I read Republican Party Reptile .
Was there really a time when it was cool to be a Republican ?
Did the Republicans change , or did I change ?
I also think that reading literature can open one ’s mind to alternative ways of looking at the world .
Donald Richie ’s books on Japan made me recognize that our way of life is n’t the only possibility , even for a fully developed country .
Post - modern European novels probably made me more receptive to the philosophical ideas of people like Rorty .
And literature in general also makes one empathize with the suffering of others , especially people who differ from us .
I suppose this makes people more liberal - minded , defining ‘ liberal ’ not as left - leaning , but more broadly as something like secular consequentialist .
Recently , my biggest influence has been other bloggers .

We must discover the power of love , the power , the redemptive power of love .
And when we discover that we will be able to make of this old world a new world .
We will be able to make men better .
Love is the only way .
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere .
We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality , tied in a single garment of destiny .
Whatever affects one directly , affects all indirectly .
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ( 15 January 1929 – 4 April 1968 ) was an American Baptist minister , doctor , civil rights activist , and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize of 1964 .
He was the husband of Coretta Scott King , and father of Yolanda King and Martin Luther King III .

Quotes
We are reaching out for the daybreak of freedom and justice and equality
1950s
True peace is not merely the absence of tension : it is the presence of justice
Men often hate each other because they fear each other ; they fear each other because they do n't know each other ; they do n't know each other because they cannot communicate ; they cannot communicate because they are separated .
Justice is love correcting that which revolts against love .
It is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world ; it 's nonviolence or nonexistence .
The absence of freedom is the presence of death .
Any nation or government that deprives an individual of freedom is in that moment committing an act of moral and spiritual murder .
Any individual who is not concerned about his freedom commits an act of moral and spiritual suicide .
There are often multiple sources for some famous statements by King ; as a professional speaker and minister he used some significant phrases with only slight variation many times in his essays , books , and his speeches to different audiences .
You know my friends , there comes a time when people get tired of being trampled by the iron feet of oppression .
There comes a time my friends , when people get tired of being plunged across the abyss of humiliation , where they experience the bleakness of nagging despair .
There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glittering sunlight of life 's July and left standing amid the piercing chill of an alpine November .
There comes a time .
Montgomery Bus Boycott speech , at Holt Street Baptist Church ( 5 December 1955 )
We , the disinherited of this land , we who have been oppressed so long , are tired of going through the long night of captivity .
And now we are reaching out for the daybreak of freedom and justice and equality .
Montgomery Bus Boycott speech , at Holt Street Baptist Church ( 5 December 1955 )
We are here , we are here this evening because we 're tired now .
And I want to say that we are not here advocating violence .
We have never done that .
I want it to be known throughout Montgomery and throughout this nation that we are Christian people .
We believe in the Christian religion .
We believe in the teachings of Jesus .
The only weapon that we have in our hands this evening is the weapon of protest .
That 's all .
Montgomery Bus Boycott speech , at Holt Street Baptist Church ( 5 December 1955 )
Whatever we do , we must keep God in the forefront .
Let us be Christian in all of our actions .
But I want to tell you this evening that it is not enough for us to talk about love , love is one of the pivotal points of the Christian face , faith .
There is another side called justice .
And justice is really love in calculation .
Justice is love correcting that which revolts against love .
Montgomery Bus Boycott speech , at Holt Street Baptist Church ( 5 December 1955 )
True peace is not merely the absence of tension : it is the presence of justice .
In a 1955 response to an accusation that he was " disturbing the peace " by his activism during the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Montgomery , Alabama , as quoted in Let the Trumpet Sound : A Life of Martin Luther King , Jr ( 1982 ) by Stephen B. Oates
If you have weapons , take them home ; if you do not have them , please do not seek to get them .
We cannot solve this problem through retaliatory violence .
We must meet violence with nonviolence .
Remember the words of Jesus : " He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword . "
We must love our white brothers , no matter what they do to us .
We must make them know that we love them .
Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries : " Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; pray for them that despitefully use you . "
This is what we must live by .
We must meet hate with love .
Remember , if I am stopped , this movement will not stop , because God is with the movement .
Go home with this glowing faith and this radiant assurance .
King 's words after a bomb was thrown into his house in Alabama , on 30 January 1956 , in Stride Toward Freedom ( 1958 )

Remember the words of Jesus : " He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword . "
We must love our white brothers , no matter what they do to us .
We must make them know that we love them .
Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries : " Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; pray for them that despitefully use you . "

The apparent apathy of the Negro ministers presented a special problem .
A faithful few had always shown a deep concern for social problems , but too many had remained aloof from the area of social responsibility .
Much of this indifference , it is true , stemmed from a sincere feeling that ministers were not supposed to get mixed up in such earthly , temporal matters as social and economic improvement ; they were to " preach the gospel " and keep men's minds centered on " the heavenly . "
But however sincere , this view of religion , I felt , was too confined .
Certainly , otherworldly concerns have a deep and significant place in all religions worthy of the name .
Any religion that is completely earthbound sells its birthright for a mess of naturalistic pottage .
Religion at its best , deals not only with man 's preliminary concerns but with his inescapable ultimate concern .
When religion overlooks this basic fact it is reduced to a mere ethical system in which eternity is absorbed into time and God is relegated to a sort of meaningless figment of the human imagination .
But a religion true to its nature must also be concerned about man 's social conditions .
Religion deals with both earth and heaven , both time and eternity .
Religion operates not only on the vertical plane but also on the horizontal .
It seeks not only to integrate men with God but to integrate men with men and each man with himself .
This means , at bottom , that the Christian Gospel is a two - way road .
On the one hand , it seeks to change the souls of men , and thereby unite them with God ; on the other hand , it seek to change the environmental conditions of men so that soul will have a chance after it is changed .
Any religion that professes to be concerned with the souls of men and is not concerned with the slums that damn them , the economic conditions that strangle them , and the social conditions that cripple them is a dry - as - dust religion .
Such a religion is the kind the Marxists like to see — an opiate of the people .

We believe firmly in the revelation of God in Jesus Christ .
I can see no conflict between our devotion to Jesus Christ and our present action .
In fact , I can see a necessary relationship .
If one is truly devoted to the religion of Jesus he will seek to rid the earth of social evils .
The gospel is social as well as personal .
Stride Toward Freedom ( 1958 )
The decision which we must make now is whther we will give our allegiance to outmoded an unjust customs we owe our ultimate allegiance to God and His will , rather than to man and his folkways Stride Toward Freedom ( 1958 )
“ We too know the Jesus that the minister referred to .
We have had an experience with him and we believe firmly in the revelation of God in Jesus Christ .
I can see no conflict between our devotion to Jesus Christ and our present action .
In fact , I can see a necessary relationship .
If one is truly devoted to the religion of Jesus he will seek to rid the earth of social evils .

The decision we must make now is whether we will give our allegiance to outmoded and unjust customs or to the ethical demands of the universe .
As Christians we owe our allegiance to God and His will , rather than to man and his folkways " Stride Toward Freedom ( 1958 )
I feel that segregation is totally unchristian , and that it is against everything the Christian religion stands for .

Speech delivered in Finney Chapel at Oberlin College ( 7 February 1957 ) , as reported in " When MLK came to Oberlin " by Cindy Leise ( The Chronicle - Telegram ; January 21 , 2008 )
Your problem is not at all an uncommon one .
However , it does require careful attention .
The type of feeling that you have toward boys is probably not an innate tendency , but something that has been culturally acquired .
Your reasons for adopting this habit have now been consciously suppressed or unconsciously repressed .
Therefore , it is necessary to deal with this problem by getting back to some of the experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit .
In order to do this I would suggest that you see a good psychiatrist who can assist you in bringing to the forefront of conscience all of those experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit .
You are already on the right road toward a solution , since you honestly recognize the problem and have a desire to solve it .
" Advice For Living " ( January 1958 )
Although the Montgomery council never had a large membership , it played an important role .
As the only truly interracial group in Montgomery , it served to keep the desperately needed channels of communication open between the races .
Men often hate each other because they fear each other ; they fear each other because they do n't know each other ; they do n't know each other because they can not communicate ; they can not communicate because they are separated .
In providing an avenue of communication , the council was fulfilling a necessary condition for better race relations in the South .
In reference to the Alabama Council on Human Relations , an organization which was joined by King , whose church 's meeting room was used to hold monthly meetings for the Montgomery chapter the council .
Stride Toward Freedom : The Montgomery Story ( 1958 )
In providing an avenue of communication , the council was fulfilling a necessary condition for better race relations in the South .
Man is man because he is free to operate within the framework of his destiny .
He is free to deliberate , to make decisions , and to choose between alternatives .
He is distinguished from animals by his freedom to do evil or to do good and to walk the high road of beauty or tread the low road of ugly degeneracy .
The Measures of Man ( 1959 )
Tolstoy , the Russian writer , said in War and Peace : “ I can not conceive of a man not being free unless he is dead . ”
While this statement sounds a bit exaggerated , it gets at a basic truth .
What Tolstoy is saying in substance is that the absence of freedom is the presence of death .
Any nation or government that deprives an individual of freedom is in that moment committing an act of moral and spiritual murder .
Any individual who is not concerned about his freedom commits an act of moral and spiritual suicide .

Rediscovering Lost Values ( 1954 )
The great problem facing modern man is that , that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live .
The real problem is that through our scientific genius we 've made of the world a neighborhood , but through our moral and spiritual genius we 've failed to make of it a brotherhood
We 've got to rediscover these precious values that we 've left behind .
Some things are right and some things are wrong .
…
Eternally so , absolutely so .
The thing that we need in the world today is a group of men and women who will stand up for right and to be opposed to wrong , wherever it is .
It is not enough to know that two and two makes four , but we 've got to know somehow that it 's right to be honest and just with our brothers .
It 's not enough to know all about our philosophical and mathematical disciplines , but we 've got to know the simple disciplines of being honest and loving and just with all humanity .
If we do n't learn it , we will destroy ourselves by the misuse of our own powers .
It 's possible to affirm the existence of God with your lips and deny his existence with your life .
The most dangerous type of atheism is not theoretical atheism , but practical atheism …
And the world , even the church , is filled up with people who pay lip service to God and not life service .
We have so many conveniences and luxuries and all of that , there is the danger that we will unconsciously forget about God .
I 'm not saying that these things are n't important ; we need them , we need cars , we need money ; all of that 's important to live .
But whenever they become substitutes for God , they become injurious .
There is something wrong with our world , something fundamentally and basically wrong .
I do n't think we have to look too far to see that .
I 'm sure that most of you would agree with me in making that assertion .
And when we stop to analyze the cause of our world 's ills , many things come to mind .
We begin to wonder if it is due to the fact that we do n't know enough .
But it can't be that .
Because in terms of accumulated knowledge we know more today than men have known in any period of human history .
We have the facts at our disposal .
We know more about mathematics , about science , about social science , and philosophy than we 've ever known in any period of the world 's history .
So it can't be because we do n't know enough .
And then we wonder if it is due to the fact that our scientific genius lags behind .
That is , if we have not made enough progress scientifically .
Well then , it can't be that .
For our scientific progress over the past years has been amazing .
Man through his scientific genius has been able to dwarf distance and place time in chains , so that today it 's possible to eat breakfast in New York City and supper in London , England .
Back in about 1753 it took a letter three days to go from New York City to Washington , and today you can go from here to China in less time than that .
It ca n't be because man is stagnant in his scientific progress .
Man 's scientific genius has been amazing .
I think we have to look much deeper than that if we are to find the real cause of man 's problems and the real cause of the world 's ills today .
If we are to really find it I think we will have to look in the hearts and souls of men .
The trouble is n't so much that we do n't know enough , but it 's as if we are n't good enough .
The trouble is n't so much that our scientific genius lags behind , but our moral genius lags behind .
The great problem facing modern man is that , that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live .
So we find ourselves caught in a messed - up world .
The problem is with man himself and man 's soul .
We have n't learned how to be just and honest and kind and true and loving .
And that is the basis of our problem .
The real problem is that through our scientific genius we 've made of the world a neighborhood , but through our moral and spiritual genius we 've failed to make of it a brotherhood .
And the great danger facing us today is not so much the atomic bomb that was created by physical science .
Not so much that atomic bomb that you can put in an aeroplane and drop on the heads of hundreds and thousands of people — as dangerous as that is .
But the real danger confronting civilization today is that atomic bomb which lies in the hearts and souls of men , capable of exploding into the vilest of hate and into the most damaging selfishness — that 's the atomic bomb that we 've got to fear today .
Problem is with the men .
Within the heart and the souls of men .
That is the real basis of our problem .
My friends , all I 'm trying to say is that if we are to go forward today , we 've got to go back and rediscover some mighty precious values that we 've left behind .
That 's the only way that we would be able to make of our world a better world , and to make of this world what God wants it to be and the real purpose and meaning of it .
Sometimes , you know , it 's necessary to go backward in order to go forward .
That 's an analogy of life .
I remember the other day I was driving out of New York City into Boston , and I stopped off in Bridgeport , Connecticut , to visit some friends .
And I went out of New York on a highway that ’s known as the Merritt Parkway , it leads into Boston , a very fine parkway .
And I stopped in Bridgeport , and after being there for two or three hours I decided to go on to Boston , and I wanted to get back on the Merritt Parkway .
And I went out thinking that I was going toward the Merritt Parkway .
I started out , and I rode , and I kept riding , and I looked up and I saw a sign saying two miles to a little town that I knew I was to bypass — I was n't to pass through that particular town .
So I thought I was on the wrong road .
I stopped and I asked a gentleman on the road which way would I get to the Merritt Parkway .
And he said , " The Merritt Parkway is about twelve or fifteen miles back that way .
You 've got to turn around and go back to the Merritt Parkway ; you are out of the way now . "
In other words , before I could go forward to Boston , I had to go back about twelve or fifteen miles to get to the Merritt Parkway .
May it not be that modern man has gotten on the wrong parkway ?
And if he is to go forward to the city of salvation , he 's got to go back and get on the right parkway . [...]
Now that 's what we 've got to do in our world today .
We 've left a lot of precious values behind ; we 've lost a lot of precious values .
And if we are to go forward , if we are to make this a better world in which to live , we 've got to go back .
We 've got to rediscover these precious values that we 've left behind .
The first principle of value that we need to rediscover is this : that all reality hinges on moral foundations .
In other words , that this is a moral universe , and that there are moral laws of the universe just as abiding as the physical laws .
I 'm not so sure we all believe that .
We have adopted in the modern world a sort of a relativistic ethic …
Most people can't stand up for their convictions , because the majority of people might not be doing it .
See , everybody 's not doing it , so it must be wrong .
And since everybody is doing it , it must be right .
So a sort of numerical interpretation of what 's right .
But I 'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong .
Eternally so , absolutely so .
It 's wrong to hate .
It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong .
It 's wrong in America , it 's wrong in Germany , it 's wrong in Russia , it 's wrong in China .
It was wrong in 2000 B.C. , and it 's wrong in 1954 A.D.
It always has been wrong , and it always will be wrong .
It 's wrong to throw our lives away in riotous living .
No matter if everybody in Detroit is doing it , it 's wrong .
It always will be wrong , and it always has been wrong .
It 's wrong in every age and it 's wrong in every nation .
Some things are right and some things are wrong , no matter if everybody is doing the contrary .
Some things in this universe are absolute .
The God of the universe has made it so .
And so long as we adopt this relative attitude toward right and wrong , we 're revolting against the very laws of God himself .
Now that is n't the only thing that convinces me that we 've strayed away from this attitude , this principle .
The other thing is that we have adopted a sort of a pragmatic test for right and wrong — whatever works is right .
If it works , it 's all right .
Nothing is wrong but that which does not work .
If you do n't get caught , it 's right . …
That 's the attitude , is n't it ?
It 's all right to disobey the Ten Commandments , but just do n't disobey the eleventh , " Thou shall not get caught . " …
That 's the attitude .
That 's the prevailing attitude in our culture .
No matter what you do , just do it with a bit of finesse .
You know , a sort of attitude of the survival of the slickest .
Not the Darwinian survival of the fittest , but the survival of the slickest — whoever can be the slickest is the one who right .
It 's all right to lie , but lie with dignity . …
It 's all right to steal and to rob and extort , but do it with a bit of finesse .
It 's even all right to hate , but just dress your hate up in the garments of love and make it appear that you are loving when you are actually hating .
Just get by !
That 's the thing that 's right according to this new ethic .
My friends , that attitude is destroying the soul of our culture !
It 's destroying our nation !
The thing that we need in the world today is a group of men and women who will stand up for right and to be opposed to wrong , wherever it is .
All I 'm trying to say to you is that our world hinges on moral foundations .
God has made it so .
God has made the universe to be based on a moral law .
So long as man disobeys it he is revolting against God .
That 's what we need in the world today : people who will stand for right and goodness .
It 's not enough to know the intricacies of zoology and biology , but we must know the intricacies of law .
It is not enough to know that two and two makes four , but we 've got to know somehow that it 's right to be honest and just with our brothers .
It 's not enough to know all about our philosophical and mathematical disciplines , but we 've got to know the simple disciplines of being honest and loving and just with all humanity .
If we do n't learn it , we will destroy ourselves by the misuse of our own powers .
There is something in this universe that justifies the biblical writer in saying , " You shall reap what you sow . "
This is a law - abiding universe .
This is a moral universe .
It hinges on moral foundations .
If we are to make of this a better world , we 've got to go back and rediscover that precious value that we 've left behind .
We must remember that it 's possible to affirm the existence of God with your lips and deny his existence with your life .
The most dangerous type of atheism is not theoretical atheism , but practical atheism … that ’s the most dangerous type .
And the world , even the church , is filled up with people who pay lip service to God and not life service .
And there is always a danger that we will make it appear externally that we believe in God when internally we do n't .
We say with our mouths that we believe in him , but we live with our lives like he never existed .
That is the ever - present danger confronting religion .
That 's a dangerous type of atheism .
And I think , my friends , that that is the thing that has happened in America .
That we have unconsciously left God behind .
Now , we have n't consciously done it ; we have unconsciously done it .
You see , the text , you remember the text said that Jesus ' parents went a whole day 's journey not knowing that he was n't with them .
They did n't consciously leave him behind .
It was unconscious ; went a whole day and did n't even know it .
It was n't a conscious process .
You see , we did n't grow up and say , " Now , goodbye God , we 're going to leave you now . "
The materialism in America has been an unconscious thing .
Since the rise of the Industrial Revolution in England , and then the invention of all of our gadgets and contrivances and all of the things and modern conveniences — we unconsciously left God behind .
We did n't mean to do it .
We just became so involved in getting our big bank accounts that we unconsciously forgot about God — we did n't mean to do it .
We became so involved in getting our nice luxurious cars , and they 're very nice , but we became so involved in it that it became much more convenient to ride out to the beach on Sunday afternoon than to come to church that morning .
( Yes ) It was an unconscious thing — we did n't mean to do it .
We became so involved and fascinated by the intricacies of television that we found it a little more convenient to stay at home than to come to church .
It was an unconscious thing — we did n't mean to do it .
We did n't just go up and say , " Now God , we ’re gone . "
We had gone a whole day 's journey and then we came to see that we had unconsciously ushered God out of the universe .
A whole day 's journey — did n't mean to do it .
We just became so involved in things that we forgot about God .
And that is the danger confronting us , my friends : that in a nation as ours where we stress mass production , and that 's mighty important , where we have so many conveniences and luxuries and all of that , there is the danger that we will unconsciously forget about God .
I 'm not saying that these things are n't important ; we need them , we need cars , we need money ; all of that 's important to live .
But whenever they become substitutes for God , they become injurious .
And may I say to you this morning , that none of these things can ever be real substitutes for God.
Automobiles and subways , televisions and radios , dollars and cents can never be substitutes for God .
For long before any of these came into existence , we needed God .
And long after they will have passed away , we will still need God .
And I say to you this morning in conclusion that I 'm not going to put my ultimate faith in things .
I 'm not going to put my ultimate faith in gadgets and contrivances .
As a young man with most of my life ahead of me , I decided early to give my life to something eternal and absolute .
Not to these little gods that are here today and gone tomorrow , but to God who is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
Not in the little gods that can be with us in a few moments of prosperity , but in the God who walks with us through the valley of the shadow of death , and causes us to fear no evil .
That 's the God .
Not in the god that can give us a few Cadillac cars and Buick convertibles , as nice as they are , that are in style today and out of style three years from now , but the God who threw up the stars to bedeck the heavens like swinging lanterns of eternity .
Not in the god that can throw up a few skyscraping buildings , but the God who threw up the gigantic mountains , kissing the sky , as if to bathe their peaks in the lofty blues .
Not in the god that can give us a few televisions and radios , but the God who threw up that great cosmic light that gets up early in the morning in the eastern horizon , ( who paints its technicolor across the blue — something that man could never make .
I 'm not going to put my ultimate faith in the little gods that can be destroyed in an atomic age , but the God who has been our help in ages past , and our hope for years to come , and our shelter in the time of storm , and our eternal home .
That 's the God that I 'm putting my ultimate faith in .
Go out and be assured that that God is going to last forever .
Storms might come and go .
Our great skyscraping buildings will come and go .
Our beautiful automobiles will come and go , but God will be here .
Plants may wither , the flowers may fade away , but the word of our God shall stand forever and nothing can ever stop him .
All of the P - 38s in the world can never reach God .
All of our atomic bombs can never reach him .
The God that I 'm talking about this morning is the God of the universe and the God that will last through the ages .
If we are to go forward this morning , we 've got to go back and find that God .
That is the God that demands and commands our ultimate allegiance .
If we are to go forward , we must go back and rediscover these precious values — that all reality hinges on moral foundations and that all reality has spiritual control .
Paul 's Letter to American Christians ( 1956 )
Your ultimate allegiance is not to the government , not to the state , not to nation , not to any man -made institution .
The Christian owes his ultimate allegiance to God , and if any earthly institution conflicts with God 's will it is your Christian duty to take a stand against it .
You must never allow the transitory evanescent demands of man-made institutions to take precedence over the eternal demands of the Almighty God .
“ Paul 's Letter to American Christians " , Sermon delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church , Montgomery , Alabama ( 4 November 1956 )
I understand that you have an economic system in America known as Capitalism .
Through this economic system you have been able to do wonders .
You have become the richest nation in the world , and you have built up the greatest system of production that history has ever known .
All of this is marvelous , but Americans , there is the danger that you will misuse your Capitalism .
I still contend that money can be the root of all evil .
It can cause one to live a life of gross materialism .
I am afraid that many among you are more concerned about making a living than making a life .
You are prone to judge the success of your profession by the index of your salary and the size of the wheel base on your automobile , rather than the quality of your service to humanity .
The misuse of Capitalism can also lead to tragic exploitation .
This has so often happened in your nation .
They tell me that one tenth of one percent of the population controls more than forty percent of the wealth .
Oh America , how often have you taken necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes .
If you are to be a truly Christian nation you must solve this problem .
You cannot solve the problem by turning to communism , for communism is based on an ethical relativism and a metaphysical materialism that no Christian can accept .
You can work within the framework of democracy to bring about a better distribution of wealth .
You can use your powerful economic resources to wipe poverty from the face of the earth .
God never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth , while others live in abject deadening poverty .
God intends for all of his children to have the basic necessities of life , and He has left in this universe " enough and to spare " for that purpose .
So I call upon you to bridge the gulf between abject poverty and superfluous wealth .
King makes two biblical allusions to Luke 15:17 and 1 Timothy 6:10 : " For the love of money is the root of all evil " .
It can cause one to live a life of gross materialism .
You are prone to judge the success of your profession by the index of your salary and the size of the wheel base on your automobile , rather than the quality of your service to humanity .
The misuse of Capitalism can also lead to tragic exploitation .
This has so often happened in your nation .
They tell me that one tenth of one percent of the population controls more than forty percent of the wealth .
Oh America , how often have you taken necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes .
If you are to be a truly Christian nation you must solve this problem .
You can work within the framework of democracy to bring about a better distribution of wealth .
You can use your powerful economic resources to wipe poverty from the face of the earth .
God never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth , while others live in abject deadening poverty .
God intends for all of his children to have the basic necessities of life , and He has left in this universe " " for that purpose .
So I call upon you to bridge the gulf between abject poverty and superfluous wealth .
The Birth of a New Nation ( 1957 )
" The Birth of a New Nation , " Sermon Delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church , Montgomery , Alabama ( 7 April 1957 )
Ghana has something to say to us .
It says to us first , that the oppressor never voluntarily gives freedom to the oppressed .
You have to work for it .
... Freedom is never given to anybody .
For the oppressor has you in domination because he plans to keep you there , and he never voluntarily gives it up .
And that is where the strong resistance comes .
Privileged classes never give up their privileges without strong resistance .
Freedom only comes through persistent revolt , through persistent agitation , through persistently rising up against the system of evil .
Give us the ballot , and we will no longer have to worry the federal government about our basic rights .
Civil rights issue is not an Ephemeral , evanescent domestic issue that can be kicked about by reactionary guardians of the status quo ; it is rather an eternal moral issue …
We must meet hate with love .
We must meet physical force with soul force . …
We must follow nonviolence and love .
We must work with determination to create a society , not where black men are superior and other men are inferior and vice versa , but a society in which all men will live together as brothers and respect the dignity and worth of human personality .
Keep moving .
Let nothing slow you up .
Move on with dignity and honor and respectability .
Three years ago the Supreme Court of this nation rendered in simple , eloquent , and unequivocal language a decision which will long be stenciled on the mental sheets of succeeding generations .
For all men of goodwill , this May seventeenth decision came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of human captivity .
It came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of disinherited people throughout the world who had dared only to dream of freedom .
Unfortunately , this noble and sublime decision has not gone without opposition .
This opposition has often risen to ominous proportions .
Many states have risen up in open defiance .
The legislative halls of the South ring loud with such words as " interposition " and " nullification . "
But even more , all types of conniving methods are still being used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters .
The denial of this sacred right is a tragic betrayal of the highest mandates of our democratic tradition .
And so our most urgent request to the president of the United States and every member of Congress is to give us the right to vote .
Give us the ballot , and we will no longer have to worry the federal government about our basic rights .
Give us the ballot and we will no longer plead to the federal government for passage of an anti-lynching law ; we will by the power of our vote write the law on the statute books of the South and bring an end to the dastardly acts of the hooded perpetrators of violence .
Give us the ballot , and we will transform the salient misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs into the calculated good deeds of orderly citizens .
Give us the ballot , and we will fill our legislative halls with men of goodwill and send to the sacred halls of Congress men who will not sign a " Southern Manifesto " because of their devotion to the manifesto of justice .
Give us the ballot , and we will place judges on the benches of the south who will do justly and love mercy , and we will place at the head of the southern states governors who have felt not only the tang of the human , but the glow of the Divine .
Give us the ballot , and we will quietly and nonviolently , without rancor or bitterness , implement the Supreme Court 's decision of May seventeenth , 1954 .
So far , only the judicial branch of the government has evinced this quality of leadership .
If the executive and legislative branches of the government were as concerned about the protection of our citizenship rights as the federal courts have been , then the transition from a segregated to an integrated society would be infinitely smoother .
But we so often look to Washington in vain for this concern .
In the midst of the tragic breakdown of law and order , the executive branch of the government is all too silent and apathetic .
In the midst of the desperate need for civil rights legislation , the legislative branch of the government is all too stagnant and hypocritical .
This dearth of positive leadership from the federal government is not confined to one particular political party .
Both political parties have betrayed the cause of justice .
The Democrats have betrayed it by capitulating to the prejudices and undemocratic practices of the southern Dixiecrats .
The Republicans have betrayed it by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of right wing , reactionary northerners .
These men so often have a high blood pressure of words and an anemia of deeds .
We come humbly to say to the men in the forefront of our government that the civil rights issue is not an Ephemeral , evanescent domestic issue that can be kicked about by reactionary guardians of the status quo ; it is rather an eternal moral issue which may well determine the destiny of our nation in the ideological struggle with communism .
The hour is late .
The clock of destiny is ticking out .
We must act now , before it is too late .
This is no day for the rabble - rouser , whether he be Negro or white .
We must realize that we are grappling with the most weighty social problem of this nation , and in grappling with such a complex problem there is no place for misguided emotionalism .
We must work passionately and unrelentingly for the goal of freedom , but we must be sure that our hands are clean in the struggle .
We must never struggle with falsehood , hate , or malice .
We must never become bitter .
I know how we feel sometime .
There is the danger that those of us who have been forced so long to stand amid the tragic midnight of oppression — those of us who have been trampled over , those of us who have been kicked about — there is the danger that we will become bitter .
But if we will become bitter and indulge in hate campaigns , the new order which is emerging will be nothing but a duplication of the old order .
We must meet hate with love .
We must meet physical force with soul force .
There is still a voice crying out through the vista of time , saying : " Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , pray for them that despitefully use you . "
Then , and only then , can you matriculate into the university of eternal life .
That same voice cries out in terms lifted to cosmic proportions : " He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword . "
And history is replete with the bleached bones of nations that failed to follow this command .
We must follow nonviolence and love .
Now , I ’m not talking about a sentimental , shallow kind of love .
I ’m not talking about eros , which is a sort of aesthetic , romantic love .
I ’m not even talking about philia , which is a sort of intimate affection between personal friends .
But I 'm talking about agape .
I 'm talking about the love of God in the hearts of men .
I ’m talking about a type of love which will cause you to love the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed that the person does .
We 've got to love .
We must not seek to use our emerging freedom and our growing power to do the same thing to the white minority that has been done to us for so many centuries .
Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man .
We must not become victimized with a philosophy of black supremacy .
God is not interested merely in freeing black men and brown men and yellow men , but God is interested in freeing the whole human race .
We must work with determination to create a society , not where black men are superior and other men are inferior and vice versa , but a society in which all men will live together as brothers and respect the dignity and worth of human personality .
I conclude by saying that each of us must keep faith in the future .
Let us not despair .
Let us realize that as we struggle for justice and freedom , we have cosmic companionship .
This is the long faith of the Hebraic - Christian tradition : that God is not some Aristotelian Unmoved Mover who merely contemplates upon himself .
He is not merely a self - knowing God , but an other - loving God forever working through history for the establishment of His kingdom .
Keep moving .
Let nothing slow you up .
Move on with dignity and honor and respectability .
Conquering Self - centeredness ( 1957 )
An individual has not begun to live until he can rise above the narrow horizons of his particular individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity .
And this is one of the big problems of life , that so many people never quite get to the point of rising above self .
And so they end up the tragic victims of self - centeredness .
They end up the victims of distorted and disrupted personality .
Life 's most persistent and urgent question is : ' What are you doing for others ? '
Life has its beginning and its maturity comes into being when an individual rises above self to something greater .
When people are self - centered , they are self - centered because they are seeking attention , they want to be admired and this is the way they set out to do it .
But in the process , because of their self - centeredness , they are not admired ; they are mawkish and people do n’t want to be bothered with them .
And so the very thing they seek , they never get .
And they end up frustrated and unhappy and disillusioned .
Find your sense of importance in something outside of the self .
And you are then able to live because you have given your life to something outside and something that is meaningful , objectified .
You rise above this self - absorption to something outside .
This is the way to go through life with a balance , with the proper perspective because you ’ve given yourself to something greater than self .
Sometimes it ’s friends , sometimes it ’s family , sometimes it ’s a great cause , it ’s a great loyalty , but give yourself to that something and life becomes meaningful .
[ N ] o matter where you stand , no matter how much popularity you have , no matter how much education you have , no matter how much money you have , you have it because somebody in this universe helped you to get it .
And when you see that , you ca n’t be arrogant , you ca n’t be supercilious .
You discover that you have your position because of the events of history and because of individuals in the background making it possible for you to stand there .
Another way to rise above self - centeredness [...] is by having the proper inner attitude toward your position or toward your status in life or whatever it is .
You conquer self - centeredness by coming to the point of seeing that you are where you are today because somebody helped you to get there .
We never get anywhere in this world without the forces of history and individual persons in the background helping us to get there . [...]
So do n’t boast , do n’t be arrogant .
You , at that moment , rise out of your self - centeredness to the type of living that makes you an integrated personality .
I want to continue the series of sermons this morning that I started several weeks ago .
The series dealing with problems of personality integration .
This morning our subject is : “ Conquering Self - centeredness . ” …
I at least want to suggest certain ways to conquer self - centeredness and at least place the subject before you .
So that you can go out and add the meat and try , in some way , to make it meaningful and practical in your everyday lives .
An individual has not begun to live until he can rise above the narrow horizons of his particular individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity .
And this is one of the big problems of life , that so many people never quite get to the point of rising above self .
And so they end up the tragic victims of self - centeredness .
They end up the victims of distorted and disrupted personality .
Variants ( Many of MLKs ' speeches were delivered many times with slight variants ) :
An Individual has not started living fully until they can rise above the narrow confines of individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of humanity .
Every person must decide at some point , whether they will walk in light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness .
This is the judgment : Life 's most persistent and urgent question is : ' What are you doing for others ? '
As quoted in The Words of Martin Luther King , Jr. by Coretta Scott King , Second Edition ( 2011 ) , Ch. " Community of Man " , p. 3
Life has its beginning and its maturity comes into being when an individual rises above self to something greater .
Few individuals learn this , and so they go through life merely existing and never living .
Now you see signs all along in your everyday life with individuals who are the victims of self - centeredness .
They are the people who live an eternal “ I . ” They do not have the capacity to project the “ I ” into the “ Thou . "
They do not have the mental equipment for an eternal , dangerous and sometimes costly altruism .
They live a life of perpetual egotism .
And they are the victims all around of the egocentric predicament .
They start out , the minute you talk with them , talking about what they can do , what they have done .
They ’re the people who will tell you , before you talk with them five minutes , where they have been and who they know .
They ’re the people who can tell you in a few seconds , how many degrees they have and where they went to school and how much money they have .
We meet these people every day .
And so this is not a foreign subject .
It is not something far off .
It is a problem that meets us in everyday life .
We meet it in ourselves , we meet in other selves : the problem of selfcenteredness .
Now , we can say to a certain extent that persons in this situation are persons who have really never grown up .
They are still children , at a point .
For you see , a child is inevitably , necessarily egocentric .
He is a bundle of his own sensations , clamoring to be cared for .
And , to be sure , he has his own social context .
He belongs to his mother , but he cares for her only because he wants to be fed and protected .
He does not care for his mother for her sake but he cares for his mother for his own sake .
And so a child is inevitably egocentric , inevitably self - centered .
And that is why Dr. Burnham says that during the first six or seven years of development , the ego is dominant within the child .
And both in behavior and in attitudes , a child is a victim of self - centeredness .
This is a part of the early development of a little child .
When people become mature , they are to rise above this .
I look at my little daughter every day and she wants certain things and when she wants them , she wants them .
And she almost cries out , “ I want what I want when I want it . ”
She is not concerned about what I think about it or what Mrs.
King thinks about it .
She wants it .
She ’s a child and that ’s very natural and normal for a child .
She is inevitably self - centered because she ’s a child .
But when one matures , when one rises above the early years of childhood , he begins to love people for their own sake .
He turns himself to higher loyalties .
He gives himself to something outside of himself .
He gives himself to causes that he lives for and sometimes will even die for .
He comes to the point that now he can rise above his individualistic concerns , and he understands then what Jesus meant when he says , “ He who finds his life shall lose it ; he who loses his life for my sake , shall find it . ” ’
In other words , he who finds his ego shall lose his ego , but he who loseth his ego for my sake , shall find it .
And so you see people who are apparently selfish ; it is n’t merely an ethical issue but it is a psychological issue .
They are the victims of arrested development , and they are still children .
They have n’t grown up .
And like a modern novelist says about one of his characters , “ Edith is a little country , bounded on the east and the west , on the north and the south , by Edith . ”
And so many people are little countries , bounded all around by themselves and they never quite get out of themselves .
And these are the persons who are victimized with arrested development .
Now the consequences , the disruptive effects of such self - centeredness , such egocentric desires , are tragic .
And we see these every day .
At first , it leads to frustration and disillusionment and unhappiness at many points .
For usually when people are self - centered , they are self - centered because they are seeking attention , they want to be admired and this is the way they set out to do it .
But in the process , because of their self - centeredness , they are not admired ; they are mawkish and people do n’t want to be bothered with them .
And so the very thing they seek , they never get .
And they end up frustrated and unhappy and disillusioned .
I ’m sure you have seen people in life who are so desirous of gaining attention that if they cannot have and gain attention through normal channels , through normal social channels , they will gain it through anti-social means . [… ]
They are so selfcentered that they must gain attention and they must be seen in order to survive .
They want to be admired and in their quest for admiration , they do n’t gain it and in their failure to gain it , they become frustrated and bewildered and disillusioned .
Also , it leads to extreme sensitiveness .
The individual who is self - centered , the individual who is egocentric ends up being very sensitive , a very touchy person .
And that is one of the tragic effects of a self - centered attitude , that it leads to a very sensitive and touchy response toward the universe .
These are the people you have to handle with kid gloves because they are touchy , they are sensitive .
And they are sensitive because they are self - centered .
They are too absorbed in self and anything gets them off , anything makes them angry .
Anything makes them feel that people are looking over them because of a tragic self - centeredness .
That even leads to the point that the individual is not capable of facing trouble and the hard moments of life .
One can become so self - centered , so egocentric that when the hard and difficult moments of life come , he cannot face them because he ’s too centered in himself .
These are the people who cannot face disappointments .
These are the people who cannot face being defeated .
These are the people who cannot face being criticized .
These are the people who cannot face these many experiences of life which inevitably come because they are too centered in themselves .
In time , somebody criticizes them , time somebody says something about them that they do n’t like too well , time they are disappointed , time they are defeated , even in a little game , they end up broken - hearted .
They ca n’t stand up under it because they are centered in self .
Then , finally , it can become so morbid that it rises to ominous proportions and leads to a tragic sense of persecution .
There are persons who come to the point that they are so self - centered that they end up with a persecution complex and the end result is insanity .
They end up thinking that the universe stands against them , that everybody is against them .
They are turning around within themselves .
They are little solar systems within themselves and they ca n’t see beyond that .
And as a result of their failure to get out of self , they end up with a persecution complex and sometimes madness and insanity .
These are some of the effects of selfcenteredness .
Now one will inevitably raise the question :
How then do we conquer self - centeredness ?
How do we get away from this thing that we call self - centeredness ?
How can we live in this universe with a balance and with a type of perspective that keeps us going smoothly and we are not too absorbed in self ?
How do we do it ?
I think one of the best ways to face this problem of self - centeredness is to discover some cause and some purpose , some loyalty outside of yourself and give yourself to that something .
The best way to handle it is not to suppress the ego but to extend the ego into objectively meaningful channels .
And so many people are unhappy because they are n’t doing anything .
They ’re self - centered because they are n’t doing anything .
They have n’t given themselves to anything and they just move around in their little circles .
One of the ways to rise above this self - centeredness is to move away from self and objectify yourself in something outside of yourself .
Find some great cause and some great purpose , some loyalty to which you can give yourself and become so absorbed in that something that you give your life to it .
Men and women have done this throughout all of the generations .
And they have found that necessary ego satisfaction that life presents and that one desires through projecting self in something outside of self .
As I said , you do n’t solve the problem by trying to trample over the ego altogether .
That does n’t solve the problem .
For you will always have the ego and the ego has certain desires , certain desires for significance .
The three great psychoanalysts of this age , of this century , pointed out that there are certain basic desires that human beings have and that they long for and that they seek at any cost .
And so for Freud the basic desire was to be loved .
Jung would say that the basic desire is to be secure .
But then Adler comes along and says the basic desire of human nature is to feel important and a sense of significance .
And I think of all of those , probably - certainly all are significant but the one that Adler mentions is probably even more significant than any : that all human beings have a desire to belong and to feel significant and important .
And the way to solve this problem is not to drown out the ego but to find your sense of importance in something outside of the self .
And you are then able to live because you have given your life to something outside and something that is meaningful , objectified .
You rise above this self - absorption to something outside .
This is the way to go through life with a balance , with the proper perspective because you ’ve given yourself to something greater than self .
Sometimes it ’s friends , sometimes it ’s family , sometimes it ’s a great cause , it ’s a great loyalty , but give yourself to that something and life becomes meaningful .
I ’ve seen people who discovered a great meaning in their jobs and they became so absorbed in that that they did n’t have time to become self - centered .
They loved their job .
And the great prayer that anyone could pray at that point is : “ O God , help me to love my job as this individual loves his or hers .
O God , help me to give my self to my work and to my job and to my allegiance as this individual does . ”
And this is the way out .
And I think this is what [ Ralph Waldo ] Emerson meant when he said : “ O , see how the masses of men worry themselves into nameless graves , while here and there , some great unselfish soul forgets himself into immortality . ”
And this becomes a point of balance when you can forget yourself into immortality .
You ’re not so absorbed in self , but you are absorbed in something beyond self .
And there is another way to rise above self - centeredness and that is by having the proper inner attitude toward your position or toward your status in life or whatever it is .
You conquer self - centeredness by coming to the point of seeing that you are where you are today because somebody helped you to get there .
And so many people , you see , live a self - centered , egocentric life because they have the attitude that they are responsible for everything and for their position in life .
For everything they do in life , they feel , somehow , that they are responsible and solely responsible for it .
An individual gets away from this type of self - centeredness when he pauses enough to see that no matter what he does in life , he does that because somebody helped him to do it .
And he then gains the type of perspective and the type of balance which keeps him from becoming self - centered .
He comes to see that somebody stands in the background , often doing a little job in a big way , making it possible for him to do what he ’s doing .
[ N ] o matter where you stand , no matter how much popularity you have , no matter how much education you have , no matter how much money you have , you have it because somebody in this universe helped you to get it .
And when you see that , you ca n’t be arrogant , you ca n’t be supercilious .
You discover that you have your position because of the events of history and because of individuals in the background making it possible for you to stand there .
One of the problems that I have to face and even fight every day is this problem of self - centeredness , this tendency that can so easily come to my life now that I ’m something special , that I ’m something important .
Living over the past year , I can hardly go into any city or any town in this nation where I ’m not lavished with hospitality by peoples of all races and of all creeds .
I can hardly go anywhere to speak in this nation where hundreds and thousands of people are not turned away because of lack of space .
And then after speaking , I often have to be rushed out to get away from the crowd rushing for autographs .
I can hardly walk the street in any city of this nation where I ’m not confronted with people running up the street , “ Is n’t this Reverend King of Alabama ? ”
Living under this it ’s easy , it ’s a dangerous tendency that I will come to feel that I ’m something special , that I stand somewhere in this universe because of my ingenuity and that I ’m important , that I can walk around life with a type of arrogance because of an importance that I have .
And one of the prayers that I pray to God everyday is : “ O God , help me to see myself in my true perspective .
Help me , O God , to see that I ’m just a symbol of a movement .
Help me to see that I ’m the victim of what the Germans call a Zeitgeist and that something was getting ready to happen in history ; history was ready for it .
And that a boycott would have taken place in Montgomery , Alabama , if I had never come to Alabama .
Help me to realize that I ’m where I am because of the forces of history and because of the fifty thousand Negroes of Alabama who will never get their names in the papers and in the headline .
O God , help me to see that where I stand today , I stand because others helped me to stand there and because the forces of history projected me there .
And this moment would have come in history even if M. L. King had never been born . ”
And when we come to see that , we stand with a humility .
This is the prayer I pray to God every day , “ Lord help me to see M. L. King as M. L. King in his true perspective . ”
Because if I do n’t see that , I will become the biggest fool in America .
We never get anywhere in this world without the forces of history and individual persons in the background helping us to get there .
If you have the privilege of a fine education , well , you have it because somebody made it possible .
If you have the privilege to gain wealth and a bit of the world ’s goods , well , you have it because somebody made it possible .
So do n’t boast , do n’t be arrogant .
You , at that moment , rise out of your self - centeredness to the type of living that makes you an integrated personality .
Finally , the proper religious faith gives you this type of balance and this type of perspective that I ’m talking about .
This , you see , is something of the genius of great religion , that on the one hand , it gives man a sense of belonging and on the other hand , it gives him a sense of dependence on something higher .
So he realizes that there is something beyond in which he lives and moves and even moves and gains his being .
This is what great religion does for him .
And there needs to be something in your life of a goddess of Nemesis which pulls you down when you get too high and pulls you up when you feel the sense of inadequacy and that is what religion at its best does .
It keeps you to the point that you do n’t feel like you are too low and you do n’t feel like you are too high but you ’ll maintain that type of balance .
And you come to see that you ’re an adjective , not a noun .
It is only God that is a noun , you are a dependent clause not an independent clause .
You come to see through great religion , somehow , there is only one being in this universe that can say “ I am ” unconditionally .
We turn over to Genesis and we read of God saying , “ I am that I am , ” and that ’s the only being that can say that .
But man is a child of God and he must always say , “ I am , because of . ”
And when you come to see that , you see that your existence is adjectival ; it is dependent on something else .
Your existence is dependent on the existence of a higher power and you can’t walk around the universe with arrogance .
You ca n’t walk about the universe with a haughty spirit because you know that there is a God in this universe that you are dependent on .
For a long time , man felt that he was the center of the universe and all of his science had given him that .
All of the days in the past he came up under what was known as the geocentric theory : the earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around the earth .
Then came Copernicus and Galileo and others , said that the sun is the center , the heliocentric theory came into being .
And that reminded us somehow that we are dependent on something .
We are not just at the center of this universe .
We are only at the center to the extent that we give ourselves and our allegiance to God Almighty .
And I ’m so glad that the new science came into being to dampen our arrogance .
It says to us that our earthly planet is a dependent planet ; it is a small planet in the orbits of this universe .
The sun is the center of this universe , that man must look beyond himself to discover his significance .
And that does something to each of us so that we can see when we have faith in God that we have nothing to boast about , we have nothing to be arrogant about but we live with a humility that keeps us going .
As I look at drunkard men walking the streets of Montgomery and of other cities every day , I find myself saying , “ But by the grace of God , you too would be a drunkard . ”
As I look at those who have lost balance of themselves and those who are giving their lives to a tragic life of pleasure and throwing away everything they have in riotous living , I find myself saying , “ But by the grace of God , I too would be here . ”
And when you see that point , you can not be arrogant .
But you walk through life with a humility that takes away the self - centeredness that makes you a disintegrated personality .
[ Y]ou are what you are because of somebody else .
You are what you are because of the grace of the Almighty God .
He who seeks to find his ego will lose it .
But he who loses his ego in some great cause , some great purpose , some great ideal , some great loyalty , he who discovers , somehow , that he stands where he stands because of the forces of history and because of other individuals ; he who discovers that he stands where he stands because of the grace of God , finds himself .
He loses himself in that something but later finds himself .
And this is the way , it seems to me , to the integrated personality .
Loving Your Enemies ( November 1957 )
It is love that will save our world and our civilization , love even for enemies
Discover the element of good in your enemy .
And as you seek to hate him , find the center of goodness and place your attention there and you will take a new attitude .
Love is creative understanding goodwill for all men .
It is the refusal to defeat any individual . …
Love is understanding , redemptive goodwill for all men , so that you love everybody , because God loves them .
Force begets force , hate begets hate , toughness begets toughness .
And it is all a descending spiral , ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody .
Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe .
And you do that by love
Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence .
It is like eroding acid that eats away the best and the objective center of your life
Non-cooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good
Far from being the pious injunction of a utopian dreamer , this command is an absolute necessity for the survival of our civilization .
Yes , it is love that will save our world and our civilization , love even for enemies .
How do you go about loving your enemies ?
I think the first thing is this :
In order to love your enemies , you must begin by analyzing self .
And I ’m sure that seems strange to you , that I start out telling you this morning that you love your enemies by beginning with a look at self .
It seems to me that that is the first and foremost way to come to an adequate discovery to the how of this situation .
… some people are n’t going to like you .
They ’re going to dislike you , not because of something that you ’ve done to them , but because of various jealous reactions and other reactions that are so prevalent in human nature .
But after looking at these things and admitting these things , we must face the fact that an individual might dislike us because of something that we ’ve done deep down in the past , some personality attribute that we possess , something that we ’ve done deep down in the past and we ’ve forgotten about it ; but it was that something that aroused the hate response within the individual .
That is why I say , begin with yourself .
There might be something within you that arouses the tragic hate response in the other individual .
The success of communism in the world today is due to the failure of democracy to live up to the noble ideals and principles inherent in its system .
And this is what Jesus means when he said : " How is it that you can see the mote in your brother ’s eye and not see the beam in your own eye ? "
Or to put it in Moffatt ’s translation : " How is it that you see the splinter in your brother ’s eye and fail to see the plank in your own eye ? "
And this is one of the tragedies of human nature .
So we begin to love our enemies and love those persons that hate us whether in collective life or individual life by looking at ourselves .
And this is one of the tragedies of human nature .
So we begin to love our enemies and love those persons that hate us whether in collective life or individual life by looking at ourselves .
A second thing that an individual must do in seeking to love his enemy is to discover the element of good in his enemy , and everytime you begin to hate that person and think of hating that person , realize that there is some good there and look at those good points which will over - balance the bad points .
There is something within all of us that causes us to cry out with Ovid , the Latin poet , " I see and approve the better things of life , but the evil things I do . "
There is something within all of us that causes us to cry out with Plato that the human personality is like a charioteer with two headstrong horses , each wanting to go in different directions .
There is something within each of us that causes us to cry out with Goethe , " There is enough stuff in me to make both a gentleman and a rogue . "
There is something within each of us that causes us to cry out with Apostle Paul , " I see and approve the better things of life , but the evil things I do . "
So somehow the " isness " of our present nature is out of harmony with the eternal " oughtness " that forever confronts us .
And this simply means this :
That within the best of us , there is some evil , and within the worst of us , there is some good .
When we come to see this , we take a different attitude toward individuals .
The person who hates you most has some good in him ; even the nation that hates you most has some good in it ; even the race that hates you most has some good in it .
And when you come to the point that you look in the face of every man and see deep down within him what religion calls " the image of God , " you begin to love him in spite of .
No matter what he does , you see God ’s image there .
There is an element of goodness that he can never sluff off .
Discover the element of good in your enemy .
And as you seek to hate him , find the center of goodness and place your attention there and you will take a new attitude .
Another way that you love your enemy is this :
When the opportunity presents itself for you to defeat your enemy , that is the time which you must not do it .
There will come a time , in many instances , when the person who hates you most , the person who has misused you most , the person who has gossiped about you most , the person who has spread false rumors about you most , there will come a time when you will have an opportunity to defeat that person .
It might be in terms of a recommendation for a job ; it might be in terms of helping that person to make some move in life .
That ’s the time you must not do it .
Nianias , Helen ( 2015-01 - 19 ) .
" Martin Luther King Jr. Day :
The inspiring speeches you might not know " .
The Independent .
There will come a time , in many instances , when the person who hates you most , the person who has misused you most , the person who has gossiped about you most , the person who has spread false rumors about you most , there will come a time when you will have an opportunity to defeat that person .
It might be in terms of a recommendation for a job ; it might be in terms of helping that person to make some move in life .
That ’s the time you must not do it .
That is the meaning of love .
In the final analysis , love is not this sentimental something that we talk about .
It ’s not merely an emotional something .
Love is creative , understanding goodwill for all men .
It is the refusal to defeat any individual .
When you rise to the level of love , of its great beauty and power , you seek only to defeat evil systems .
Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system , you love , but you seek to defeat the system .
King , Jr. , Martin Luther ( ) .
“ Loving Your Enemies , ” Sermon Delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church .
The Greek language comes out with another word for love .
It is the word agape .
… agape is something of the understanding , creative , redemptive goodwill for all men .
It is a love that seeks nothing in return .
It is an overflowing love ; it ’s what theologians would call the love of God working in the lives of men .
And when you rise to love on this level , you begin to love men , not because they are likeable , but because God loves them .
You look at every man , and you love him because you know God loves him .
And he might be the worst person you ’ve ever seen .
And this is what Jesus means , I think , in this very passage when he says , " Love your enemy . "
And it ’s significant that he does not say , " Like your enemy . "
Like is a sentimental something , an affectionate something .
There are a lot of people that I find it difficult to like .
I do n’t like what they do to me .
I do n’t like what they say about me and other people .
I do n’t like their attitudes .
I do n’t like some of the things they ’re doing .
I do n’t like them .
But Jesus says love them .
And love is greater than like .
Love is understanding , redemptive goodwill for all men , so that you love everybody , because God loves them .
You refuse to do anything that will defeat an individual , because you have agape in your soul .
And here you come to the point that you love the individual who does the evil deed , while hating the deed that the person does .
This is what Jesus means when he says , " Love your enemy . "
This is the way to do it .
When the opportunity presents itself when you can defeat your enemy , you must not do it .
I think the first reason that we should love our enemies , and I think this was at the very center of Jesus ’ thinking , is this : that hate for hate only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe .
If I hit you and you hit me and I hit you back and you hit me back and go on , you see , that goes on ad infinitum .
It just never ends .
Somewhere somebody must have a little sense , and that ’s the strong person .
The strongperson is the person who can cut off the chain of hate , the chain of evil .
And that is the tragedy of hate , that it does n’t cut it off .
It only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe .
Somebody must have religion enough and morality enough to cut it off and inject within the very structure of the universe that strong and powerful element of love .
Somewhere somebody must have some sense .
Men must see that force begets force , hate begets hate , toughness begets toughness .
And it is all a descending spiral , ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody .
Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe .
And you do that by love .
There ’s another reason why you should love your enemies , and that is because hate distorts the personality of the hater .
We usually think of what hate does for the individual hated or the individuals hated or the groups hated .
But it is even more tragic , it is even more ruinous and injurious to the individual who hates .
You just begin hating somebody , and you will begin to do irrational things .
You ca n’t see straight when you hate .
You ca n’t walk straight when you hate .
You ca n’t stand upright .
Your vision is distorted .
There is nothing more tragic than to see an individual whose heart is filled with hate .
He comes to the point that he becomes a pathological case .
For the person who hates , you can stand up and see a person and that person can be beautiful , and you will call them ugly .
For the person who hates , the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful .
For the person who hates , the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good .
For the person who hates , the true becomes false and the false becomes true .
That ’s what hate does .
You ca n’t see right .
The symbol of objectivity is lost .
Hate destroys the very structure of the personality of the hater . [...] when you start hating anybody , it destroys the very center of your creative response to life and the universe ; so love everybody .
Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence .
It is like eroding acid that eats away the best and the objective center of your life .
So Jesus says love , because hate destroys the hater as well as the hated .
Now there is a final reason I think that Jesus says , " Love your enemies . "
It is this : that love has within it a redemptive power .
And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals .
That ’s why Jesus says , " Love your enemies . "
Because if you hate your enemies , you have no way to redeem and to transform your enemies .
But if you love your enemies , you will discover that at the very root of love is the power of redemption .
You just keep loving people and keep loving them , even though they ’re mistreating you .
Here ’s the person who is a neighbor , and this person is doing something wrong to you and all of that .
Just keep being friendly to that person .
Keep loving them .
Do n’t do anything to embarrass them .
Just keep loving them , and they ca n’t stand it too long .
Oh , they react in many ways in the beginning .
They react with bitterness because they ’re mad because you love them like that .
They react with guilt feelings , and sometimes they ’ll hate you a little more at that transition period , but just keep loving them .
And by the power of your love they will break down under the load .
That ’s love , you see .
It is redemptive , and this is why Jesus says love .
There ’s something about love that builds up and is creative .
There is something about hate that tears down and is destructive .
So love your enemies .
History unfortunately leaves some people oppressed and some people oppressors .
And there are three ways that individuals who are oppressed can deal with their oppression .
One of them is to rise up against their oppressors with physical violence and corroding hatred .
But oh this is n’t the way .
For the danger and the weakness of this method is its futility .
Violence creates many more social problems than it solves .
And I ’ve said , in so many instances , that as the Negro , in particular , and colored peoples all over the world struggle for freedom , if they succumb to the temptation of using violence in their struggle , unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness , and our chief legacy to the future will be an endless reign of meaningless chaos .
Violence is n’t the way .
Another way is to acquiesce and to give in , to resign yourself to the oppression .
Some people do that .
They discover the difficulties of the wilderness moving into the promised land , and they would rather go back to the despots of Egypt because it ’s difficult to get in the promised land .
And so they resign themselves to the fate of oppression ; they somehow acquiesce to this thing .
But that too is n’t the way because non-cooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good .
But there is another way .
And that is to organize mass non-violent resistance based on the principle of love .
It seems to me that this is the only way as our eyes look to the future .
As we look out across the years and across the generations , let us develop and move right here .
We must discover the power of love , the power , the redemptive power of love .
And when we discover that we will be able to make of this old world a new world .
We will be able to make men better .
Love is the only way .
Loving Your Enemies ( Christmas 1957 )
Jesus is not an impractical idealist ; he is the practical realist .
We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive .
He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love
The chain reaction of evil hate begetting hate , wars producing more wars — must be broken , or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation .
Darkness cannot drive out darkness : only light can do that .
Hate cannot drive out hate : only love can do that .
Every genuine expression of love grows out of a consistent and total surrender to God
By its very nature hate destroys and tears down ; by its very nature , love creates and builds up .
Love transforms with redemptive power
Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend .
We never get rid of an enemy by meeting hate with hate ; we get rid of an enemy by getting rid of enmity .
There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us .
When we discover this , we are less prone to hate our enemies
Love is the most durable power in the world .
This creative force … is the most potent instrument available in mankind 's quest for peace and security .
Delivered at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery , Alabama ( 25 December 1957 ) .
He actually wrote it while he was in jail for committing non-violent civil disobedience during the Montgomery bus boycott .
In this sermon King discusses Jesus command to " love your enemies " and answers the question how one can love his enemies .
Upheaval after upheaval has reminded up that modern man is traveling along the road called hate , in a journey that will bring us to destruction and damnation .
Far from being the pious injunction of a Utopian dreamer , the command to love one 's enemy is an absolute necessity for our survival .
Love even for enemies is the key to the solution of the problems of our world .
Jesus is not an impractical idealist ; he is the practical realist .
I am certain that Jesus understood the difficulty inherent in the act of loving one 's enemy .
He never joined the ranks of those who talk glibly about the easiness of the moral life .
He realized that every genuine expression of love grows out of a consistent and total surrender to God .
So when Jesus said " love your enemy , " he was not unmindful of its stringent qualities .
Yet he meant every word of it .
Our responsibility as Christians is to discover the meaning of this command and seek passionately to live it out in our daily lives .
Let us be practical and ask the question :
How do we love our enemies ?
First , we must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive .
He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love .
It is impossible even to begin the act of loving one 's enemies without prior acceptance of the necessity , over and over again , of forgiving those who inflict evil and injury upon us .
It is also necessary to realize that the forgiving act must always be initiated by the person who has been wronged , the victim of some great hurt , the recipient of some tortuous injustice , the absorber of some terrible act of oppression .
The wrongdoer may request forgiveness .
He may come to himself , and , like the prodigal son , move up with some dusty road , his heart palpitating with the desire for forgiveness .
But only the injured neighbor , the loving father back home can really pour out the warm waters of forgiveness .
Forgiveness does not mean ignoring what has been done or putting a false label on an evil act .
It means , rather , that the evil act no longer remains as a barrier to the relationship .
Forgiveness is a catalyst creating the atmosphere necessary for a fresh start and a new beginning .
It is the lifting of a burden or the canceling of a debt .
The words " I will forgive you , but never forget what you have done " never explain the real nature of forgiveness .
Certainly one can never forget , if that means erasing totally for his mind .
But when we forgive , we forget in the sense that the evil deed is no longer a mental block impeding a new relationship .
Likewise , we can never say , " I will forgive you , but I wo n't have anything further to do with you . "
Forgiveness means reconciliation , a coming together again .
Without this , no man can ever love his enemies .
The degree to which we are able to forgive determines the degree to which we are able to love our enemies .
Second we must recognize that the evil deed of the enemy - neighbor , the thing that hurts , never quite expresses all that he is .
An element of goodness may be found even in our worst enemy .
Each of us is something of a schizophrenic personality , tragically divided against ourselves .
A persistent civil war rages within all or our lives .
Something within us causes us to lament with Ovid , the Latin poet , " I see and approve the better things , but follow the worse , " or to agree with Plato that human personality is like a charioteer having two headstrong horses , each wanting to be go in a different direction , or to repeat with the Apostle Paul , " The good that I would I do not , but the evil which I would not , I do . "
This simply means that there is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us .
When we discover this , we are less prone to hate our enemies .
When we look beneath the surface , beneath the impulsive evil deed , we see within our enemy - neighbor a measure of goodness and know that the viciousness and evilness of his acts are not quite representative of all that he is .
We see him in a new light .
We recognize that his hate grows out of fear , pride , ignorance , prejudice , and misunderstanding , but in spite of this , we know God 's image is ineffably etched in being .
Then we love our enemies by realizing that they are not totally bad and that they are not beyond the reach of God 's redemptive love .
Third we must not seek to defeat or humiliate the enemy but to win his friendship and understanding .
At times we are able to humiliate our worst enemy .
Inevitably , his weak moments come and we are able to thrust in his side the spear of defeat .
But this we must not do .
Every word and deed must contribute to an understanding with the enemy and release those vast reservoirs of goodwill which have been blocked by impenetrable walls of hate .
The meaning of love is not to be confused with some sentimental outpouring .
Love is something much deeper that emotional bosh .
Perhaps the Greek language can clear our confusion at this point .
In the Greek New Testament are three words for love .
The word eros is sort of aesthetic or romantic love .
In the Platonic dialogues eros is the yearning of the soul for the realm of the divine .
The second word is philia , a reciprocal of love and the intimate affection and friendship between friends .
We love those whom we like , and we love because we are loved .
The third word is agape , understanding and creative , redemptive goodwill for all men .
An overflowing love which seek nothing in return , agape is the love of God operating in the human heart .
At this level , we love men not because we like them , nor because they possess some type of divine spark ; we love every man because God loves him .
At this level , we love the person who does an evil deed , although we hate the deed that he does . [...]
When Jesus bids us to love our enemies , he is speaking neither of eros nor philia ; he is speaking of agape , understanding and creative , redemptive goodwill toward men .
Only by following this way and responding with this type of love are we able to be children of our father which is in heaven .
Let us move now from the practical how to the theoretical why :
Why should we love our enemies ?
The first reason is fairly obvious .
Returning hate for hate multiplies hate , adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars .
Darkness cannot drive out darkness ; only light can do that .
Hate cannot drive out hate ; only love can do that .
Hate multiplies hate , violence multiplies violence , and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction .
So when Jesus says " love your enemies , " he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition .
Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else ?
The chain reaction of evil - Hate begetting hate , wars producing more wars - must be broken , or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation .
This passage contains some phrases King later used in " Where Do We Go From Here ? " ( 1967 ) which has a section below .
The first reason is fairly obvious .
So when Jesus says " love your enemies , " he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition .
Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else ?
Another reason why we must love our enemies is that hate scars the soul and distorts the personality .
Mindful that hate is an evil and dangerous force , we too often think of what it does to the person hated .
This is understandable , for hate bring irreparable damage to its victims .
We have seen its ugly consequences in the ignominious deaths brought to six million Jews by a hate - obsessed madman named Hitler , in the unspeakable violence inflicted upon Negroes by blood - thirsty mobs , in the dark horrors of war , and in the terrible indignities and injustices perpetrated against millions of God 's children by unconscionable oppressors .
But there is another side which we must never overlook .
Hate is just as injurious to the person who hates .
Like an unchecked cancer , hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity .
Hate destroys a man 's sense of values and his objectivity .
It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful , and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true .
Modern psychology recognizes what Jesus taught centuries ago :
Hate divides the personality and love in an amazing and inexorable way unites it .
A third reason why we should love our enemies is that love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend .
We never get rid of an enemy by meeting hate with hate ; we get rid of an enemy by getting rid of enmity .
By its very nature , love creates and builds up .
Love transforms with redemptive power .
An even more basic reason why we are commanded to love is expressed explicitly in Jesus ' words , " love your enemies .... that ye may be children of your father which is in heaven . "
We are called to this difficult task in order to realize a unique relationship with God .
We are potential sons of God .
Through love that potentiality becomes actuality .
We must love our enemies , because only loving them can we know God and experience the beauty of His holiness .
The darkness of racial injustice will be dispelled only by the light of forgiving love .
For more that three centuries American Negroes have been frustrated by day and bewilderment by night by unbearable injustice , and burdened with the ugly weight of discrimination .
Forced to live with these shameful conditions , we are tempted to become bitter and retaliate with a corresponding hate .
But if this happens , the new order we seek will be little more than a duplicate of the old order .
We must in strength and humility meet hate with love .
Time is cluttered with wreckage of communities which surrendered to hatred and violence .
For the salvation of our nation or mankind , we must follow another way .
This does not mean that we abandon our righteous efforts .
With every ounce of our energy we must continue to rid this nation of the incubus of segregation .
But we shall not in the process relinquish our privilege and our obligation to love .
While abhorring segregation , we shall love the segregationist .
This is the only way to create the beloved community .
To our most bitter opponents we say : " We shall match your capacity to inflict suffering by our capacity to endure suffering .
We shall meet your physical force with soul force .
Do to us what you will , and we shall continue to love you .
We cannot in all good conscience obey your unjust laws because noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good .
Throw us in jail and we shall still love you .
Bomb our homes and threaten our children , and we shall still love you .
Send your hooded perpetrators of violence into our community at the midnight hour and beat us and leave us half dead , and we shall still love you .
But be ye assured that we will wear you down by our capacity to suffer .
One day we shall win freedom but not only for ourselves .
We shall so appeal to your heart and conscience that we shall win you in the process and our victory will be a double victory . "
Love is the most durable power in the world .
This creative force , so beautifully exemplified in the life of our Christ , is the most potent instrument available in mankind 's quest for peace and security .
Napoleon Bonaparte , the great military genius , looking back over his years of conquest , is reported to have said : " Alexander , Caesar , Charlemagne and I have built great empires .
But upon what did they depend ?
They depended on force .
But centuries ago Jesus started an empire that was built on love , and even to this day millions will die for him . "
Who can doubt the veracity of these words .
The great military leaders of the past have gone , their empires have crumbled and burned to ashes .
But the empire of Jesus , built solidly and majestically on the foundation of love , is still growing .
It started with a small group of dedicated men , who , through the inspiration of their Lord , were able to shake the hinges form the gates of the Roman Empire , and carry the gospel into all the world .
Today the vast earthly kingdom of Christ numbers more than 900,000,000 and covers every land and tribe .
Jesus is eternally right .
History is replete with the bleached bones of nations that refused to listen to him .
May we in the twentieth century hear and follow his words - before it is too late .
May we solemnly realize that we shall never be true sons of our heavenly Father until we love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us .
Three Ways of Meeting Oppression ( 1958 )
Violence ends by defeating itself .
It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers .
Nonviolent resistance is not aimed against oppressors , but against oppression .
Oppressed people deal with their oppression in three characteristic ways .
One way is acquiescence : the oppressed resign themselves to their doom .
They tacitly adjust themselves to oppression and thereby become conditioned to it .
In every movement toward freedom some of the oppressed prefer to remain oppressed .
There is such a thing as the freedom of exhaustion .
Some people are so worn down by the yoke of oppression that they give up .
A few years ago in the slum areas of Atlanta , a Negro guitarist used to sing almost daily : " Been down so long that down do n't bother me . "
This is the type of negative freedom and resignation that often engulfs the life of the oppressed .
To accept passively an unjust system is to cooperate with that system ; thereby the oppressed become as evil as the oppressor .
Non-cooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good .
The oppressed must never allow the conscience of the oppressor to slumber .
Religion reminds every man that he is his brother 's keeper .
To accept injustice or segregation passively is to say to the oppressor that his actions are morally right .
It is a way of allowing his conscience to fall asleep .
At this moment the oppressed fails to be his brother 's keeper .
So acquiescence - while often the easier way - is not the moral way .
It is the way of the coward .
A second way that oppressed people sometimes deal with oppression is to resort to physical violence and corroding hatred .
Violence often brings about momentary results .
Nations have frequently won their independence in battle .
But in spite of temporary victories , violence never brings permanent peace .
It solves no social problem ; it merely creates new and more complicated ones .
Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral .
It is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all .
The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind .
It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding ; it seeks to annihilate rather than to convert .
Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love .
It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible .
It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue .
Violence ends by defeating itself .
It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers .
The third way open to oppressed people in their quest for freedom is the way of nonviolent resistance .
Like the synthesis in Hegelian philosophy , the principle of nonviolent resistance seeks to reconcile the truths of two opposites , acquiescence and violence , while avoiding the extremes and immoralities of both .
The nonviolent resister agrees with the person who acquiesces that one should not be physically aggressive toward his opponent ; but he balances the equation by agreeing with the person of violence that evil must be resisted .
He avoids the nonresistance of the former and the violent resistance of the latter .
With nonviolent resistance , no individual or group need submit to any wrong , nor need anyone resort to violence in order to right a wrong .
Nonviolent resistance is not aimed against oppressors , but against oppression .
1960s
The language , the cultural patterns , the music , the material prosperity , and even the food of America are an amalgam of black and white .
The time is always right to do what ’s right .
Of all the forms of inequality , injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane .
Call it democracy , or call it democratic socialism , but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God ’s children

In our glorious fight for civil rights , we must guard against being fooled by false slogans , such as " right to work . "
It is a law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights .
It is supported by Southern segregationists who are trying to keep us from achieving our civil rights and our right of equal job opportunity .
Its purpose is to destroy labor unions and the freedom of collective bargaining by which unions have improved wages and working conditions of everyone …
Wherever these laws have been passed , wages are lower , job opportunities are fewer and there are no civil rights .
We do not intend to let them do this to us .
We demand this fraud be stopped .

I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry .

I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism , to self - defeating effects of physical violence .

With the benefit of hindsight it seems like the easiest decision , but remember this was very early - 1970s .
Lee Marvin was an Oscar - winning leading man and as such able to pick and choose his next role ; Francis Ford Coppola on the other hand , although respected , was yet to win acclaim for his as - yet - unreleased The Godfather .
It was the best part of a decade before Apocalypse Now saw the light of day ; by then the Colonel in question had morphed from Karnage to Kurtz , and a certain Mr. Marlon Brando had taken the role .

Mr. Lee Marvin ,
We ’d like you to play the part of Colonel Karnage in Apocalaypse Now .

Publisher ’s Note : Senior Command staff at Ft. Knox contacted me shortly after publication of this report , and thousands of phone calls as a result .
They confirmed that there was a security exercise at Ft. Knox this week .
An officer in the security loop altered the scenario to include “ Tea Party ” among the terrorist groups that might assault Ft. Knox , “ in order to make it more realistic . ”
The alterations were not approved at the Command level and were not used by the Installation Command Post .
The officer who circulated the scenario through official channels has been identified and will “ receive appropriate counsel . ”
Further , Command staff noted , “ An official investigation has been initiated to determine the manner in which this information was included in the exercise scenario .
Fort Knox leadership is committed to continued positive associations with our community groups and organizations and will continue to work to enhance and improve those relationships . ”
Commanders provided assurance that this type of scenario would not find its way into official circulation again .
The fact that any officer would associate Tea Party folks with “ white supremacists ” armed with “ military grade weapons ” and “ bomb making components , ” and believe that association would make this scenario “ more realistic , ” is troubling , at best .
We owe our gratitude to a handful of Patriots , who , at risk to their careers , came forth with this information and expected us to handle it honorably and accurately – and we did just that .
In regard to the verbatim scenario documentation we posted , even though those documents were not classified , Command staff asked that we remove them for specified security reasons .
As our mission is not only to uphold our Constitution by holding those in positions of authority accountable to their oaths , but also to support our uniformed Patriots , we agreed to remove the documents from our Web site .
“ The duty imposed upon [ the president ] to take care , that the laws be faithfully executed , follows out the strong injunctions of his oath of office , that he will ‘ preserve , protect , and defend the constitution . ’
The great object of the executive department is to accomplish this purpose ; and without it , be the form of government whatever it may , it will be utterly worthless for offence , or defence ; for the redress of grievances , or the protection of rights ; for the happiness , or good order , or safety of the people . ” – Justice Joseph Story
A few months back , the commander in chief of our Armed Forces , that erstwhile community organizer Barack Hussein Obama , denigrated a large cross section of Americans who identify with the Tea Party movement – those who advocate for Essential Liberty and Rule of Law .
Obama identified them as malcontents , “ waving their little tea bags . ”
Since then , the Obama administration and their Leftmedia sycophants have endeavored to characterize Tea Party attendees as rude , radical , racist , redneck , enemies of the state .
They have attempted to tie high - profile acts of violence against the government to the Tea Party , including the pilot who crashed his plane into a Texas IRS headquarters .
( Turns out , he was a Leftwing nut . )
In fact , Americans who attend Tea Party rallies are from all walks of life , as noted in the Patriot Declaration , Patriots who are peacefully and constitutionally petitioning their government for redress .
As I noted in my tax - day essay , Tea Parties are “ not a call for revolution but for restoration – a call to undertake whatever measures are dictated by prudence and necessity to restore constitutional Rule of Law . ”
However , Obama ’s words do have consequences .
This week , I was contacted by a number of civilian and military personnel ( enlisted and officer ranks ) who expressed concern about a military exercise scenario proposed for Ft. Knox , the U.S. Bullion Depository .
( For the record , I called Ft. Knox security for an official comment and received the standard reply : “ We are not authorized to discuss this exercise . ” )
As with most such exercises , the Ft. Knox scenario outline occurred in stages , as if real time intelligence was being provided at various intervals .
The first intel advisory I received was issued on Friday , 23 April 2010 , and identifies the terrorist threat adversaries as “ Local Militia Groups / Anti-Government Protesters / TEA Party . ”
You read that right : “ TEA Party ” !
The advisory states that plans for a demonstration may have been interrupted by “ Federal and local law enforcement ” raids on a “ White Supremacists Organization , ” but “ TEA Party organizers have stated that they will protest at the Gold Vault at a future date . ”
Further , the intel advisory states , “ Anti-Government - Health Care Protesters have stated that they would join the TEA Party as a sign of solidarity . ”
In accordance with the exercise proposal , Ft. Knox post security is placed on high alert because , “ these groups are armed , have combative training and some are former Military Snipers .
Some may have explosives training / experience , ” and “ a rally at their compound / training area is scheduled . ”
Another intel update was issued on Monday , 26 April 2010 , noting that the “ rally at the Militia compound occurred , ” and “ Viable threats … have been made . ”
The intel on the rally notes , “ Many members were extremely agitated at what they referred to as Government intervention and over taxation in their lives .
Alcohol use ‘ fanned the flames . ’
Many military grade firearms were openly carried .
An ad hoc ‘ shoot the government agent ’ event was held with prizes ( alcohol ) given for the best shot placement . ”
The report states further , “ Components of bomb making are reported to have been on the site .
Some members have criminal records relating to explosive and weapons violations . ”
In response to the “ immediate threat , ” the exercise stipulates , “ local detention centers are being made ready for mass arrests . ”
Both the “ QRF I and QRF II ” are placed on two hour recall , and the “ 5 - 15 CAV ” was ordered to “ draw weapons from holder and store in most available arms room , ” and “ coordinate with MASA for immediate ammunition draw ; have equipment readied for immediate use , i.e. vehicles staged and loaded IAW 5 - 15 CAV SOP ; LMR ’s charged . ”
QRF refers to Quick Reaction Force .
QRF
I is the 194th Armored Brigade .
QRF II is the 194th Armored Brigade .
The 26 April order gives specific instructions for the 5 - 15 CAV ( a 16th Cavalry battalion ) to have weapons , ammo , vehicles and communications at ready , and it places the other 2,200 members of the units on two - hour recall .
In other words , these orders are to gear up for defending Ft. Knox against Tea Party folks and their co-conspirators who oppose nationalization of our health care sector .
Now , for almost 30 years I have , on occasion , participated in the development and implementation of small and large scale military exercises within the U.S. and around the world .
Such exercises are critical to the readiness of our forces , and the standard for the real time intel reports in these drills requires thinly veiled references to assets of existing or collateral threat vectors , communist regimes such as China and terrorist networks such as al - Qa'ida , etc .
Perhaps the author of the Ft. Knox scenario should focus on a response plan for , say , an Islamic terrorist who attacks unarmed troops on his own post .
( See Ft. Hood / Major Nidal Malik Hasan . )
While the Ft. Knox exercise scenario is amateurish in its construct ( meaning it appears to be composed by someone with not much experience in such matters ) , the fact that it made it out into official channels sets an ominous political precedent .
The military officers and enlisted personnel with whom I spoke are all dedicated uniformed Patriots who are loyal , first and foremost , to their oath to “ support and defend ” our Constitution “ against all enemies , foreign and domestic . ”
Their concerns about this exercise mirrored my own .
As one put it , the scenario “ misrepresents freedom loving Americans as drunken , violent racists – the opponents of Obama ’s policies have been made the enemy of the U.S. Army . ”
They were equally concerned that it appears the command staff at Ft. Knox had signed off on this exercise , noting , “ it has been issued and owned by field grade officers who lead our battalions and brigades , ” which is to say many Lieutenant Colonels saw this order before it was implemented .
It ’s not likely that Ft. Knox Commanding General James Milano or Deputy Commander Col .
David Teeples , or even the regimental and brigade commanders for the 16th Cav and 194th AB , actually read the exercise scenario , but that does n’t absolve responsibility for such an egregious example of political agendas infiltrating military exercise scenarios .
One officer insisted , “ The American people should require greater accountability of their commissioned officers , that they abide by their oath and never allow politically motivated propaganda like this exercise on any post or base again . ”
Another observed , “ Whether this is complacency by officers who do not see such orders as a problem , or worse , officers who recognize the problem but do not insist the orders are changed , this is a serious problem .
We are discussing the training of American citizen soldiers in the use of potentially deadly force against a specific group of political dissenters .
There is never a time in an officer ’s career in which he does not have a duty to apply critical thought to the orders he is given and asked to give .
It is my opinion that any officer that has allowed these orders to persist , to reach the level of junior officers and soldiers , has demonstrated a lack of judgment or apathy towards what his duty requires of him .
Either way , we should demand more of the commissioned officers , who we as a nation empower to lead our sons and daughters into battle . ”
Indeed , and at best , the blatant malfeasance on the part of the individuals who composed this exercise reflects poorly on the uniformed services .
The antidote to this patent misrepresentation of peaceable Patriots is to expose it with the Light of Truth .
As our motto Veritas vos Liberabit affirms , the Truth shall set you Free !

Personal information concerning the private lives of almost 1,000 British Muslim university students is to be shared with US intelligence agencies in the wake of the Detroit bomb scare .
The disclosure has outraged Muslim groups and students who are not involved in extremism but have been targeted by police and now fear that their names will appear on international terrorist watch lists .
So far , the homes of more than 50 of the students have been visited by police officers , but nobody has been arrested .
The case has raised concerns about how the police use the data of innocent people and calls into question the heavy - handed treatment of Muslim students by UK security agencies .
This week , MPs criticised the Government 's key policies on countering extremism which they said were alienating Muslim communities .
Last year ,
The Independent reported on the alleged harassment of young Muslims by the police and security service , MI5 , whose officers had tried to recruit them as spies .
In the latest case , details of students from University College London ( UCL ) were handed over to police by the university 's student union , after detectives visited the campus in early January 2010 during their continuing investigation into the attempted Christmas Day bombing in Detroit by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab .
Abdulmutallab studied engineering at UCL in 2005 - 08 , and was president of the UCL Islamic Society in 2006 - 07 .
Police had first approached UCL's Islamic Society , which refused to hand over the information .
Mojeed Adams - Mogaji , the society 's president , said : " I was concerned about what they would do with the data .
At another meeting with the Metropolitan Police , they told us they would keep it for seven years and would share the data with other intelligence agencies if requested .
Obviously , I 'm very concerned with what they plan to do with this information . "
Gareth Peirce , the prominent human rights lawyer , advised the Islamic Society during the affair .
Last night she described the police 's actions as " completely inappropriate " .
She said : " You wonder if he [ Abdulmutallab ] had been a member of a society without the name Islamic on it , then would there have been such an appetite to grab the information .
It adds to the fear that the Muslim community is a suspect community .
The whole concept of data protection was meant to nail down absolute privacy and here it is being breached without a legal reason being imposed on the university to comply . "
Eric Metcalfe , at the Justice student human rights network , said he believed it was another example of " heavy - handed " policing aimed at countering radicalism rather than investigating alleged crime .
" There is no reason why the police can't go to court and persuade a magistrate to issue a warrant with which the university would have to comply , " he said .
" But this seems more about heavy - handed intelligence gathering , which may not have respected the privacy rights of the students . "
Zubair Idris , 21 , a second - year international medical student at UCL , said : " I feel frustrated and outraged .
To pass on 900 student details because they were members of UCL Islamic Society is ridiculous .
The reason I joined the society was for socio-cultural reasons .
I 've never seen the guy [ Abdulmutallab ] .
I was n't here when he was at university . "
Sayyida Mehrali , 19 , a first - year neuroscience student , added : " I feel that it is a bit extreme that my information has been passed onto the Metropolitan Police as I joined UCL after Umar Farouk had left .
There was never any opportunity to meet this individual and I think it 's shocking that they have my details on a database . "
From 2005 to 2007 , Muslim students at Dundee University were harassed by Tayside Police 's Special Branch community contact unit , who targeted " ethnic religious groups " in order to gather intelligence on activities that " could be considered extremist . "
The university 's Student Advisory Service allowed the police to attend the Freshers Fair to speak to students , but there was an outcry after branch officers posed as community officers and spoke to students covertly .
They also approached students on campus , attended university meetings and events and visited students at their homes .
They repeatedly harassed members of the Dundee University Islamic Society , and during the Israel - Lebanon war in 2006 , visited Muslim students at their flats late at night .
The police initially approached the UCL Islamic Society on 4 January 2010 for a list of names of their members between 2005 and 2008 .
Following legal advice , the society declined to give the information .
The police then approached the student union with a personal data request .
The union provided names and email addresses of members of the UCL Islamic Society and Royal Free and UCL Medical Islamic Society between September 2005 and June 2009 .
The police then approached the university for telephone numbers and home addresses .
These were passed on by the UCL Registry .
There are further concerns about the role of the student union in the disclosure of the data .
Mr Adams - Mogaji said : " We also realised that the student union gave the details of the UCL Medical Islamic Society without being requested for it .
The union is supposed to protect the societies under it and not hastily succumb to pressure without the need to .
We 're clearly not safe with the union and our trust in them is undoubtedly diminishing . "
Qasim Rafiq , a former president of the UCL Islamic Society and spokesman for the Federation of Student Islamic Societies ( FOSIS ) , said : " Giving unnecessary personal data to the police seems to demonstrate a lack of regard for the personal data of its members .
For me , it goes against the principles of the union to act in a flagrant manner towards its constituents .
We had to demand the student union to email the students whose details were given to the police , and had we not had done so students who have been contacted by the police would n't have been aware that their details had been passed on . "
In a statement , the Metropolitan Police said : " As part of enquiries police spoke to a number of people who may have been able to provide information relating to the background of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab .
This has included liaison with UCL , the student union , the Islamic Society and the FOSIS .
" Inquires made at UCL – where Abdulmutallab studied between 2005 and 2008 – are just one strand of the investigation .
We have been careful to ensure that all inquiries and information gathered is treated sensitively . "
I ’ve been doing a bit of experimenting with the Canvas and Video tags in HTML5 lately , and found some cool features hiding in plain sight .
One of those is the Canvas.drawImage ( ) api call .
Here is the description on the draft site .
3.10 Images
To draw images onto the canvas , the drawImage method can be used .
This method can be invoked with three different sets of arguments :
drawImage ( image , dx , dy )
drawImage ( image , dx , dy , dw , dh )
drawImage ( image , sx , sy , sw , sh , dx , dy , dw , dh )
image
Each of those three can take either an , an , or anfor theargument .
The api lets you take the contents of specific HTML elements and draw them into a canvas , and the 3rd element in that list is just begging to be abused .
Copying video into a canvas element means opening up the ability to manipulate or process video frames at runtime .
Two concepts instantly came to mind that seemed like fun to try and figure out , here they are below .
Blowing apart fragments of video
Click around the video frame to blow up that part of the video , the exploded pieces will continue to play the video inside them .
After a while they retract back to their original place .
One feature I did n’t have time to figure out was adding depth to the explosion , so pieces that are closest to ground zero fly up into the air as they sail outward .
With full shadow effects this could look really cool .
3D Video
This demo in particular runs really well inside webkit based browsers , but not so much in Firefox .
Firefox does n’t appear to have any hardware acceleration for Ogg decoding so I had to drop the video size in half in order to run at acceptable framerates .
Even still , Firefox chokes pretty badly on my Macbook Pro .
* Update * – I ’ve changed the ogg video to be 640 x 360 , prepare to see firefox weep
Lessons learned
There ’s a couple hints I found out along the way that are good to know if you want to play around with drawing video .
First , you need a bit of hackish code to get this to work effeciently and it flows like this .
[ Video playing ] -> [ Draw Video onto Canvas 1 ] ->
[ Draw fragments of Canvas 1 onto Canvas 2 ]
Do n’t ask me why , but copying pixel data out of a video tag is expensive , so expensive that drawing it into a temporary canvas , and then drawing pieces of that temp canvas onto a final canvas is faster then just referencing the video tag repeatedly within the same loop .
That ’s why you ’ll see 2 Canvases in the source code for the demos .
I ’m sure there ’s a technical reason for this duplication process , but it ’s a lazy reason .
Secondly , do n’t try copying individual pixels around .
You can still see the remnants of my first code attempt inside the explosion demo with getPixel ( ) and setPixel ( ) .
This turned out to be horribly slow and completely unnecessary .
Canvas.drawImage ( ) + matrix transforms on the canvas space is far more efficient then handcrafted pixel pushing .
On the other hand , pixel manipulation allows you to do things like runtime chroma keying , get ready for a new wave of “ clippy ” style videos with full transparency popping over websites to help you out .
Lastly , I ’m learning very quickly that not all browsers are created equal when it comes to performance , it ’s a crapshoot when it comes to heavy video + image manipulation .
Safari and Chrome work well with h.264 , Firefox slogs along with Ogg Theora , and Opera is somewhere in the middle .
There were quite a few 3D movies released in theatres last year , certainly more than any other year in recent memory .
Along with the news that 3D televisions and even video games were in development , 3D was already on the horizon .
Then of course came Avatar , and the great technical work and huge box office takings proved 3D cinema was both financially viable , and in big demand .
It was inevitable that production of 3D movies would ramp up .
Alice in Wonderland came next , and scored huge at the box office , opening bigger than Avatar .
The post - production 3D process however meant that the 3D work was hugely inferior to that seen in Cameron ’s movie .
Then just over a week ago Clash of the Titans was released .
The once again post - production 3D conversion was this time rushed through by the lowest bidder , and was reportedly awful .
Clash of the Titans did n’t open nearly as big as Alice .
Whilst the presence of Johnny Depp , and Tim Burton behind the camera will have boosted Alice ’s box office appeal , and lower review scores will have also dented Titans ’ chances , i think certainly some of the blame for this can be attributed to the disappointment felt by those that went to see Alice expecting it to match up to Avatar in the 3D stakes .
After that experience , a lot of movie - goers were probably put off of paying out for Titans only to be disappointed once again .
Unfortunately , the far superior 3D work in How to Train Your Dragon went unseen by many , as it has made far less than either Titans or Alice , although interestingly all three are currently continuing to make money .
The problem facing the 3D boom is the cynical attempts by studios to cash in on its popularity .
By rushing through movies with ropey post - production 3D conversion , they risk alienating the audiences that were so wowed by Avatar ’s revolutionary visuals .
With 3D ticket prices rising , viewers expect a great 3D feast , and are n’t currently getting it .
Studios need to start being careful , they ca n’t afford to let down the people willing to pay extra for the 3D experience .
This audience will quickly become fed up of paying out huge amounts of money to see lazy conversion , and underwhelming 3D effects .
The danger is that when movies are finally released with great 3D work , there will no longer be people willing to pay the money to see them .
The whole 3D boom comes at an interesting time .
The 1990 ’s were a time of independent films , where well written , intelligent stories were pulling in the crowds .
As a result big budget productions waned , as they were n’t so economically viable .
Over the last decade , particularly last year , blockbuster popcorn movies have come back in a big way .
Movies like 2012 , Transformers 2 and other effects heavy productions made the lions share of the profits over the last 12 months .
IMAX theatres reported record takings , and of course 3D movies like Avatar drew in huge audiences .
This draws some parallels with the first time 3D was introduced to cinema audiences .
By the 1950 ’s , television had hit homes in a big way .
For the first time , audiences could stay in with their families and be entertained by a visual medium , without having to pay for tickets .
As you ’d expect , cinema attendances suffered .
To combat this , the industry went back to making big budget movies , historical epics and elaborate musicals , re-introducing spectacle to the big screen .
Studios proliferated the use of technicolor and stereo sound , and wide - screen , CinemaScope and 3D were introduced .
Film company bosses knew that to rival the power of television , they had to provide something that TV shows could n’t .
Now , of course , TV has been well established for decades , but in the last ten years television shows have increased in quality greatly .
Shows like The Sopranos and The Wire have shown that writing in television shows can equal anything found at the cinema , and the likes of 24 , Battlestar Galactica and Glee have shown that good production values , special effects and elaborate musical numbers can be enjoyed nightly from the comfort of your armchair .
Once again , studios might be trying to draw people out to theatres by providing the kind of big budget event movies , and cutting edge IMAX and 3D visuals that can not be seen on a television set .
The approach was only moderately successful fifty years ago however , and today ’s audience will quickly tire of style if it is n’t backed up by a reasonable amount of substance .
Ironically , with the imminent release of 3D televisions , and the news here in the UK that satellite company Sky have ordered over 15,000 3D televisions to give away to pubs for showing 3D sporting events , it seems that the movie industry needs to rush the 3D cinema revolution along so they do n’t actually fall behind television for the first time .
Ultimately , with the list of movies set for 3D conversion growing all the time , and more and more directors considering shooting with 3D technology , it looks like 3D cinema is indeed here to stay .
But that said , the movie industry cannot afford to take it for granted .
More thought , not to mention time and money , needs to be put into making sure that 3D movies are up to scratch , and are n’t just attempts to cash in on Avatar ’s success .
If this does n’t happen , the increasing number of 3D screens may find themselves losing out to the regular 2D ones , or worse , that audiences choose to stay at home and watch great 3 - dimensional scripted television instead .

WASHINGTON — It was cold and drizzling outside the City Courthouse just after 6 a.m. on Wednesday , but no one seemed to mind among the same - sex couples waiting for the chance to apply for a marriage license .
“ This is a dream come true , ” said Sinjoyla Townsend , 41 , as she smiled ear to ear and held up her ticket indicating she was first in line with her partner of 12 years , Angelisa Young , 47 .
“ We wanted it so bad . ”
Gay rights advocates hailed the day as a milestone for equal rights and a symbolic victory as same - sex marriage became legal in the nation ’s capital .
Washington is now the sixth place in the nation where same - sex marriages can take place .
Connecticut , Iowa , Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Vermont also issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples .
CASSELL’S CRASS CONFUSION ….
Dr. Jack Cassell , an Orlando - area urologist and part - time Republican crank , probably could n’t have imagined what he was getting himself into .
This week , Cassell ’s medical office posted a sign for patients and their families : “ If you voted for Obama … seek urologic care elsewhere .
Changes to your healthcare begin right now , not in four years . ”
The ethically - challenged physician told the Orlando Sentinel he would n’t deny care to patients who support the president , but Casell wants those patients to feel unwelcome and seek medical treatment from doctors who do n’t care how they voted .
Since the Sentinel ‘s piece was published on Friday morning , news of the doctor who puts his partisanship ahead of his patients spread very quickly .
Over the last 48 hours , I ’ve seen reports on Cassell ’s bizarre antics on CNN , Fox News , the New York Times , the LA Times , and elsewhere .
Even in hyper - partisan times , medical professionals are n’t supposed to cross lines of professionalism like this , and the story seems to have struck a chord .
But perhaps the most important coverage was an interview between Cassell and Alan Colmes on the radio Friday night .
The host tried to get a better sense of why , exactly , Cassell hates the Affordable Care Act so much .
The urologist specifically argued that officials , in light of the new law , are “ cutting all supportive care , like nursing homes , ambulance services . ”
Colmes :
What do you mean they ’re cutting nursing homes ?
Cassell :
They ’re cutting nursing home reimbursements .
Colmes :
Is n’t what they ’re cutting under the Medicare plan what was really double dipping ; they were getting credits and they were getting to deduct them at the same time .
Cassell :
Well you know , I ca n’t tell you exactly what the deal is .
[ emphasis added ]
Colmes :
If you ca n’t tell us exactly what the deal is , why are you opposing it and fighting against it ?
What a good question .
Cassell struggled to explain himself , saying he ’d seen some things “ online , ” and adding that the information he needs to understand the law “ should be available to me . ”
Of course , the information is available to him , and has been for months .
Cassell chose not to do his homework before driving patients away — patients who , it turns out , may know a lot more than he does about the law he claims to hate .
This is painfully common — some of the loudest , angriest critics of the Affordable Care Act are also some of the least informed , most confused , embarrassingly ignorant observers anywhere .
In this case , Cassell has become a national joke because he ’s repulsed by a health care reform plan that he fully admits he does n’t understand .
It ’d be funny if it were n’t so pathetic .
Post Script :
For the record , Cassell ’s rhetoric about “ cutting nursing homes ” notwithstanding , the National Association of Home Care and Hospice praised the Democratic plan .
PITTSBURGH -- Ryan Braun , Jim Edmonds and the Milwaukee Brewers went totally batty .
The Brew Crew piled up 25 hits Thursday and trounced Pittsburgh 20 - 0 , handing the Pirates the most lopsided loss in their 124 - year history .
" It was fun and it was special , " said Braun , who homered , doubled , singled and drove in five runs .
" This game is really so much about failure , particularly as a hitter , that you rarely get a day where everyone is enjoying so much success at the same time . "
" I 've never been involved in a game like this and I likely never will be again .
So , I enjoyed it and I 'll savor it .
It 's one to remember , " he said .
Milwaukee matched a club mark for margin of victory and set a record for its biggest shutout win .
Prince Fielder hit his first home run of the season while Edmonds and George Kottaras also connected -- they were among 10 Brewers with an RBI .
Milwaukee finished with 12 extra - base hits .
Milwaukee led 10 - 0 after five innings and then scored six runs in the seventh and four more in the ninth .
The rout came a day after the Brewers beat up Pittsburgh 8 - 0 .
Edmonds doubled twice and singled .
Rickie
Weeks doubled twice , singled and scored four times .
" Now that was something else , " Milwaukee manager Ken Macha said .
Randy Wolf ( 2 - 1 ) pitched six scoreless innings and three relievers finished up .
The Brewers won their fourth in a row and gave Pittsburgh its third straight loss .
Daniel McCutchen ( 0 - 2 ) was tagged for six runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings .
Remarkably , his ERA stayed the same as it was entering the game , 14.73 .
" Lots of times , it felt like I was throwing batting practice to them , " McCutchen said .
The Brewers also won by 20 in 1992 when they beat the Toronto Blue Jays 22 - 2 .
The Pirates ' previous one - sided loss was by 18 runs , done twice .
Milwaukee swept the three - game series and outscored the Pirates 36 - 1 .
Pittsburgh has lost eight times this season , by at least six runs each time and 85 - 13 overall .
According to STATS LLC , it was the fifth most - lopsided shutout in modern major league history , which began in 1900 .
The Cleveland Indians beat the New York Yankees 22 - 0 in 2004 and the Pirates beat the Chicago Cubs by the same score in 1975 .
The 35 - run differential in a three - game series tied for the third largest ; the largest was 40 runs ( 50 - 10 ) by the Superbas , now the Dodgers , over the Cincinnati Reds in 1901 .
" They came in and kicked our butt , " Pittsburgh manager John Russell said .
" Whoever comes in is going to do that if we do n't pitch well .
We need to learn from this game .
We do n't want to do this anymore . "
Braun hit a three - run homer to end a nine - pitch at - bat in the third inning to push Milwaukee 's lead to 4 - 0 and added a two - run double .
Fielder took a while to hit a home run -- he tied for second in the NL last year with 46 .
Wolf allowed six hits and improved his career record against Pittsburgh to 8 - 1. Claudio Vargas , Manny Parra and Trevor Hoffman each pitched one inning .
Fielder started the scoring with his solo home run to center field in the second inning and Braun 's drive in the third made it 4 - 0 .
Fielder hit a two - run single in the fourth off D.J. Carrasco .
An inning later , Kottaras homered and Braun doubled for a 10 - 0 cushion .
Edmonds ' homer highlighted a six - run seventh off Joel Hanrahan and closer Octavio Dotel gave up four runs in the ninth .
" Games like these are awkward , " Edmonds said .
" You do n't want to keep piling on the runs but you also have to respect the game and keep playing .
It was just a day where everything went right for us and everything went wrong for them . "
Game notes
Fielder is playing with a sore left hand , the result of getting jammed by a number of inside pitches in recent days , according to Macha .
... Pittsburgh third baseman Andy LaRoche ( back spasms ) missed his fifth straight game .
Russell is hopeful he can play Friday night at Houston .
... Milwaukee is 37 - 12 against the Pirates over the last four seasons .
Back in August 2005 , I broke the story that Dick Cheney and the Pentagon were working on a contingency plan to use tactical nuclear weapons in an attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
The nukes would be used because they were the only effective way to destroy the hardened sites , many of which are located deep underground .
I also reported that the contingency plan would kick in if there were another major terrorist attack against the United States , whether or not Iran was actually involved .
It would use the terrorist action as a justification for taking preemptive action and employing nukes would serve as a warning to Iran that any retaliation would result in possible additional nuclear strikes .
If implemented , it would have constituted the first use of nuclear weapons since the end of the Second World War .
It would be convenient to assume that the Dick Cheney school of international relations no longer exists .
In truth , the summer of 2005 seems almost like ancient history , part and parcel of a very different world , where Cheney , Wolfowitz , Feith , and Rumsfeld were still running amok scarcely reined in by the more moderate but equally ghastly Condi Rice .
Iraq was just starting to implode and Afghanistan was on a back burner but the hubris that drove the Bush Administration to look for enemies to destroy seems dated at the present due to economic and political deterioration in the United States .
Even many of those who saw America as the essential nation five years ago now recognize decline when they see it and are arguing for retrenchment .
But some things do n’t change and the theory that just a few really big bombs can change the Middle East for the better has again surfaced .
Two weeks ago the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) issued a study suggesting that low yield tactical nuclear weapons are just the ticket for destroying Iran ’s nuclear plants .
The report states that " some believe that nuclear weapons are the only weapons that can destroy targets deep underground or in tunnels . "
" Options in Dealing with Iran ’s Nuclear Program " was written by Abdullah Toukan and Anthony Cordesman , both highly respected analysts and commentators .
The authors and CSIS do not exactly endorse the use of nuclear weapons and they note that there would be major political consequences , but they accept that there is a high likelihood that Israel is planning an attack of some kind and also observe that Tel Aviv ’s only other options would not be very effective .
Israel has no heavy bombers and only a limited supply of bunker buster bombs .
F - 16 fighter bombers launched from Israel would have little time on target and only limited conventional payloads that could not do much damage to the dispersed and deeply dug - in Iranian facilities .
Iranian air defenses , which have been enhanced over the past few years , might also prove to be a formidable obstacle .
At best , the Israelis would only be able to delay an Iranian nuclear program for six months to a year and the attack itself would guarantee Tehran ’s commitment to develop its own nuclear deterrent as quickly as possible .
An Israeli nuclear strike could , on the other hand , be launched using ballistic missiles that Tel Aviv already has or from cruise missiles on submarines , which are also already in the country ’s arsenal , meaning that Israeli warplanes would not have to cross hostile territory and face antiaircraft fire .
The targeting would also be more accurate using missiles that could be carefully aimed rather than unstable and possibly under attack aircraft and the results , compared to a conventional attack , would be devastating .
Two issues likely will determine whether Israel will use nuclear weapons against Iran .
The first relates to the ultimate objective of the Israeli attack .
An attack with conventional weapons will hardly cripple the presumed Iranian nuclear program and would be designed rather to send a message and to bring the United States into the conflict to finish the job .
But if the Israelis were to make the judgment that the United States will somehow refuse to cooperate or be drawn in , they might just be tempted to use the tactical nuclear weapons reported to be in their arsenal to destroy the Iranian nuclear infrastructure .
The second issue is Israeli isolation and irrationality , something that is harder to assess but which is becoming more evident .
Israel continues to be protected by the United States in the UN through its veto power and also in other international fora , but there should be no doubt that President Obama has a visceral dislike for Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and everything he represents .
And the feeling is mutual , but given the vulnerability of Israel if the US were to withdraw its support , the actions of Netanyahu to goad and defy Obama have to be seen as those of a man whose ability to behave rationally might well be questioned .
The truth is that Israel is fast becoming a pariah nation , like South Africa before the final collapse of apartheid , because no one any longer accepts the legitimacy of its settlement growth and occupation policies .
Like South Africa , the Israeli response to criticism has been to become more reactionary and inward looking , constructing a police state internally and waging unending war against its neighbors to maintain cohesion against foreign enemies .
The program to divest from Israel is gathering steam both in Europe and the US and even traditional allies of Tel Aviv like Britain have begun to react to Israeli rogue behavior .
The recent expulsion of Israel ’s Mossad chief from London over the issue of copying fifteen British passports for use in assassination operations was significant .
Visitors to Israel have now been warned that surrendering passports at immigration could lead to their being cloned to support illegal activities , a warning that is literally without precedent .
Several European countries that claim universal jurisdiction in war crime cases , including Spain , appear to be prepared to arrest traveling Israeli officials for civilian deaths in Gaza .
Israel demonstrated both its increasing isolation and its irrational side in response to the British expulsion of its intelligence chief .
Two Israeli parliamentarians compared the British to dogs , one adding that the " British may be dogs , but they are not loyal to us , but rather to an anti-Semitic system . "
What system he had in mind was not exactly clear and it is also interesting to note that an Israeli legislator would expect loyalty from the British government .
There was some speculation in the media that at least some of the anger might be directed against British Foreign Secretary David Miliband , who is Jewish and has family in Israel .
Miliband has generally been regarded as a good friend of Israel , having blocked legal moves to arrest visiting Israeli politicians and generals as war criminals , but even he had to take steps when the integrity of British passports was being undermined .
To be sure , there is a certain danger in isolating the Israelis too much as it could easily feed the always present Masada complex that might influence a dangerously unstable government to take action that might include exploiting its nuclear arsenal in search of Armageddon .
And make no mistake that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman are not to be trusted by anyone .
Netanyahu ’s deceptions and evasions were too much even for markedly pro-Israeli US President Bill Clinton , who became angry with him after being repeatedly lectured on policy , asking whether Netanyahu thought that he represented the superpower .
King Hussein of Jordan similarly finally gave up on achieving anything with a stonewalling and lying Netanyahu in the 1990s .
The fact is , Bibi Netanyahu has never been interested in peace and his policies of creeping annexation of the West Bank and ethnic cleansing are instead designed to create a unitary Israeli state without Palestinians .
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman is even worse than Netanyahu and is a symbol of the kleptocratic impulses that characterize the extreme right in Israel .
He is a racist who has openly advocated executing Arab members of the Knesset and drowning Palestinian prisoners in the Dead Sea .
At one time he called for bombing the Aswan dam to punish Egypt for supporting the Palestinians and he was behind a bill in the Knesset that would have required all Israeli citizens of Arab descent to swear loyalty to Israel as a Jewish state or face expulsion .
That he is the Foreign Minister of a country that pretends to have western - style democratic political values is itself telling .
It all adds up to a toxic brew .
If the US refuses to cooperate in bombing Iran conventionally , Israel might well accept the view that the Iranian nuclear program can only be destroyed by using other nuclear weapons .
Tel Aviv , controlling its own nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver the bombs on target , would be able to stage such an attack unilaterally .
An increasingly isolated Israel headed by reactionary and irrational politicians who are influenced by their own sense of racial superiority just might decide that the gamble is worth it .
It would be a very bad decision for Israel , Iran , and for the United States .
Could we be in for 30 years of global COOLING ?
Britain's big freeze is the start of a worldwide trend towards colder weather that seriously challenges global warming theories , eminent scientists claimed yesterday .
The world has entered a ' cold mode ' which is likely to bring a global dip in temperatures which will last for 20 to 30 years , they say .
Summers and winters will all be cooler than in recent years , and the changes will mean that global warming will be ' paused ' or even reversed , it was claimed .
Big chill : Scientists have claimed that the world has entered a ' cold mode ' which could last three decades , a theory that challenges climate change
The predictions are based on an analysis of natural cycles in water temperatures in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans .
They are the work of respected climate scientists and not those routinely dismissed by environmentalists as ' global warming deniers ' .
Some experts believe these cycles - and not human pollution - can explain all the major changes in world temperatures in the 20th century .
If true , the research challenges the science behind climate change theories , and calls into question the political measures to halt global warming .
According to some scientists , the warming of the Earth since 1900 is due to natural oceanic cycles , and not man -made greenhouse gases .
It occurred because the world was in a ' warm mode ' , and would have happened regardless of mankind 's rising carbon dioxide production .
And now oceanic cycles have switched to a ' cold mode ' , where data shows that the amount of Arctic summer sea ice has increased by more than a quarter since 2007 .
The research has been carried out by eminent climate scientists , including Professor Mojib Latif .
He is a leading member of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
He and his colleagues predicted the cooling trend in a 2008 paper , and warned of it again at an IPCC conference in Geneva in September .
Working at the prestigious Leibniz Institute in Kiel University in Germany , he has developed methods for measuring ocean temperatures 3,000ft under the surface , where the cooling and warming cycles start .
For Europe , the crucial factor is the temperature in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean .
He said such ocean cycles - known as multi-decadal oscillations or MDOs - could account for up to half of the rise in global warming in recent years .
Professor Latif said : ' A significant share of the warming we saw from 1980 to 2000 and at earlier periods in the 20th century was due to these cycles - as much as 50 per cent .
' They have now gone into reverse , so winters like this one will become much more likely .
All this may well last two decades or longer .
' The extreme retreats that we have seen in glaciers and sea ice will come to a halt .
For the time being , global warming has paused , and there may well be some cooling . '
Many meteorologists have blamed the current freeze on ' Arctic oscillation ' - a weather pattern in which areas of high pressure have pushed the warming jetstream away from Britain .
They have insisted this temporary change will have no effect on long - term warming patterns .
But another expert , Professor Anastasios Tsonis , head of the University of Wisconsin Atmospheric Sciences Group , said MDOs will continue to determine global temperatures .
He said : ' They amount to massive rearrangements in the dominant patterns of the weather , and their shifts explain all the major changes in world temperatures during the 20th and 21st centuries .
We have such a change now . '
WASHINGTON — The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted narrowly on Thursday to condemn as genocide the mass killings of Armenians early in the last century , defying a last - minute plea from the Obama administration to forgo a vote that seemed sure to offend Turkey and jeopardize delicate efforts at Turkish - Armenian reconciliation .
The vote on the nonbinding resolution , a perennial point of friction addressing a dark , century - old chapter of Turkish history , was 23 to 22 .
A similar resolution passed by a slightly wider margin in 2007 , but the Bush administration , fearful of losing Turkish cooperation over Iraq , lobbied forcefully to keep it from reaching the House floor .
Whether this resolution will reach a floor vote remains unclear .
In Ankara , the capital , the office of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan immediately issued a sharp rebuke .
“ We condemn this bill that denounces the Turkish nation of a crime that it has not committed , ” the statement said .
Ambassador Namik Tan , who had only weeks ago taken up his post in Washington , has been recalled to Ankara for consultations , according to the statement .
Historians say that as many as 1.5 million Armenians died amid the chaos and unrest surrounding World War I and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire .
Turkey denies , however , that this was a planned genocide , and had mounted a vigorous lobbying campaign against the resolution .
" It was one of the more popular teachers who played the victim , I do n't think there would have been as much concern if it was one or two of the others . "

Did the IRS Garnish Your Wages or Bank Account , or Do You Have a Federal Tax Lien ?
The IRS can place a lien against your property which may impact your credit for many years .

A tax lien may also prevent a new employer from hiring you .

A client testimonial
I need hardly say why , but I shall .
Its destruction of our prosperity and its barely concealed and irrational hatred of wealth - creators ; its infantilisation of people through the welfare state and its cultivation of a taxpayer - funded clientele ; its sundering of the United Kingdom by devolution ; its contempt for Parliament ; its reduction of state schools to third - rate child - minding operations , and of our universities to underfunded vocational training colleges ; its deliberate subversion of our culture and way of life by uncontrolled immigration ; its surrender to the forces of anti-democracy in Europe ; its imperilling of our Armed Forces , aggravated by the hypocrisy with which it praises them ; its disdain for our countryside and its people ; above all its naked tribalism and gerrymandering , and its leech - like attitude towards the productive sectors that must pay for it .
It has been a disgrace , and the man who leads it is to blame .
Keeping him in Downing Street would be an act of insanity on a par with feeling unwell , and asking Dr Shipman to make you better .

The Fedora project has released the beta of the Fedora 13 Linux distribution , named after rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard , and it is now available to download .
Like the alpha version released five weeks ago , the first and only beta has been released a week later than originally planned .
This has prompted the project administrators to postpone the final release date of Fedora 13 by a week and it is now rescheduled for the 18th of May .
Since the distribution , advertised with the release slogan " Rock it " , went into feature freeze before the alpha version , the beta does n't offer any major surprises ; instead , the developers have focused on completing the more than 40 most important new features and on fixing bugs .
Today , the Fedora developers have also started the " Graphics Test Week " during which they invite users to test the open source graphics drivers used in Fedora 13 for compatibility and functional reliability ; the tests can be run using Live images and do n't require testers to install the Linux distribution .
On Tuesday , testing is focused on NVIDIA 's GeForce graphics hardware , Wednesday 's focus wil be on Radeon GPUs by AMD / ATI and Thursday 's focus will be on Intel graphics chips .
As is customary during such test days , the distribution 's developers are available on IRC channel # fedora - test - day on Freenode to answer questions and provide support .

What Would You Do to This Dirtbag ?
February 8th , 2010
This week I have an unbelievable video for you .
WARNING : If you are offended by a low - life criminal using the foulest of language , then you should watch this video with your speakers turned OFF .
As you watch this video , think to yourself , at what point you would be justified to use deadly force … if you were carrying your gun , at what point would you shoot ?
After watching the video and answering these questions for yourself , see my comments below …
Click Below to watch the video :
Please make sure that JavaScript is enabled and you have the latest version of the Flash Player to see this video .
If you liked this post , please share it :
So what would you do ?
When would you be justified to use lethal force ?
If you were carrying your gun , at what point would you shoot ?
Well , you are not justified in using deadly force unless your assailant demonstrates the ability , opportunity , and intent to immediately inflict serious bodily injury to you or those around you .
In this case , he has a crowbar .
Does that give him the ability to seriously injure you or those around you ?
Certainly .
Does he have the opportunity to immediately inflict serious bodily injury ?
The answer lies in HOW CLOSE is he and what , if anything , is between you and his crowbar ?
Is he demonstrating the intent to seriously injure or kill you with that crowbar ?
Not while he is beating your car ’s fenders , but as soon as he moves to your driver ’s side window and raises the crow bar …
YES !
So what should you do ?
Plan A :
As we demonstrate in our very stimulating classroom lectures at Front Sight , the best gun fight is the one you AVOID , so use that 3,000 pound , four sided shield you are driving to get away if at all possible .
No worries about the damage to the car .
It is just a car and it is insured .
Plan B :
If you are boxed in , do not have a gun , and cannot get away , then use the 3,000 pound deadly weapon you are driving and when he comes around the front or back of the car , pin him against the car in front or behind you or simply run him over .
Whatever you do , do it with authority .
Plan C :
If you have a gun ( is n’t this video one of the best examples of why EVERY responsible citizen should carry a gun ? ) and cannot get away , pin him , or run him over , then as he raises the crowbar to smash your driver ’s side window , lean back away from the window as you raise your pistol , see a flash of your sights and press the trigger for an accurate , controlled pair of shots into his chest .
Note :
Be ready to deliver a head shot after a controlled pair to his chest because this guy is likely feeling no pain due to the effects of whatever street drugs he is on .
His central nervous system may only react properly to a bullet in the brain .
Plan D :
There is no plan D .
Again , mindset and training is everything in a situation like this so you should be running “ what - if ” scenarios through your mind to be prepared when someone like the street scum in this video picks you or your family as his next intended victim .
If you and your family want the mindset and training to handle yourself with expertise on the street , but do n’t yet have a gun , then get a Springfield Armory XD Pistol at no charge when you take advantage of the Greatest Course , Gun , and CCW Permit Offer in the firearms training industry see this link :

The chatter in Twitter can accurately predict the box - office revenues of upcoming movies weeks before they are released .
In fact , Tweets can predict the performance of films better than market - based predictions , such as Hollywood Stock Exchange , which have been the best predictors to date .
The Social Computing Lab at HP Labs in Palo Alto , CA found that using only the rate at which movies are mentioned could successfully predict future revenues .
But when the sentiment of the tweet was factored in ( how favorable it was toward the new movie ) , the prediction was even more exact .
To quantify the sentiments in 3 million tweets the team used the anonymous human workers found by the Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate a sample of tweets , and then trained an algorythmic classifier to derive a rating for the rest .
The graph above compares the predicted vs actual box office scores of tweet - rates ( blue line ) and Hollywood Stock Exchange ( green line ) .
Benardo Huberman , the chief investigator on this work , says that they predicted the outcomes of new movies released in November and December 2009 and January 2010 , including Avatar , Invictus , The Blind Side and Twilight .
Of course , predicting movie revenues is only a tidy test case .
If you can use Twitter to predict the future of movie tickets , then why not elections , or sales of other products ?
As the authors write :
This method can be extended to a large panoply of topics , ranging from the future rating of products to agenda setting and election outcomes .
At a deeper level , this work shows how social media expresses a collective wisdom which , when properly tapped , can yield an extremely powerful and accurate indicator of future outcomes .

Oh , how I wish I ’d come up with Matt Taibbi ’s description of Goldman Sachs as a “ great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity . ”
A prescient lad , he said that even before the revelations this past week about “ The Big Short ” .
Seems these very shrewd operators basically : 1 ) made a bunch of loans to people they knew had a very good chance of defaulting ; 2 ) bundled them into a security that they noodged Moody ’s and Standard and Poors to rate AAA ; 3 ) sold them to unsuspecting investors as a solid investment ; and 4 ) shorted them so that when the price fell , they ’d clean up .
In fact , the only way they could have lost money would have been for the loans to be repaid .
Thus they not only screwed the poor schmucks who could n’t repay loans ( remember the sliding rates that went up after a few years ?
Let ’s stack the deck while we ’re at it . )
But they screwed their clients .
And when the bottom fell out , they screwed everybody .
Lloyd Blankfein–who has an eerie resemblance to Erich von Stroheim , the “ Man You Love To Hate ” –claims he was doing God ’s work , but for the life of me , Blankfein ’s God has little to do with any modern God I know –more like Cthulhu ( and we ’re back to great vampire squids ) .
Senator Dodd from Arkham has heard the call of Cthulhu and has busily crafted a financial reform bill that keeps the monsters and their derivatives intact–it seems mostly concerned with restoring the power of the regulators to wank instead of work and watch internet porn .
Not break up the banks that bet AGAINST AMERICANS .
Most recently , Blankfein has had the gall to tell us that if we break up the banks , we will weaken America .
Like the worst economic crisis since Black Friday did n’t do that already .
Maybe he meant it in relative terms .
After all , they broke the economy of the entire world –maybe America would have come out ahead on the deal .
If we ’d shorted it .

Google executives have also said privately that the company had been far more transparent about the intrusions than any of the more than two dozen other companies that were compromised , the vast majority of which have not acknowledged the attacks .
Google continues to use the Gaia system , now known as Single Sign - On .
Hours after announcing the intrusions , Google said it would activate a new layer of encryption for Gmail service .
The company also tightened the security of its data centers and further secured the communications links between its services and the computers of its users .
Several technical experts said that because Google had quickly learned of the theft of the software , it was unclear what the consequences of the theft had been .
One of the most alarming possibilities is that the attackers might have intended to insert a Trojan horse — a secret back door — into the Gaia program and install it in dozens of Google ’s global data centers to establish clandestine entry points .
But the independent security specialists emphasized that such an undertaking would have been remarkably difficult , particularly because Google ’s security specialists had been alerted to the theft of the program .
However , having access to the original programmer ’s instructions , or source code , could also provide technically skilled hackers with knowledge about subtle security vulnerabilities in the Gaia code that may have eluded Google ’s engineers .
“ If you can get to the software repository where the bugs are housed before they are patched , that ’s the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , ” said George Kurtz , chief technology officer for McAfee Inc. , a software security company that was one of the companies that analyzed the illicit software used in the intrusions at Google and at other companies last year .
Rodney Joffe , a vice president at Neustar , a developer of Internet infrastructure services , said , “ It ’s obviously a real issue if you can understand how the system works . ”
Understanding the algorithms on which the software is based might be of great value to an attacker looking for weak points in the system , he said .
When Google first announced the thefts , the company said it had evidence that the intrusions had come from China .
The attacks have been traced to computers at two campuses in China , but investigators acknowledge that the true origin may have been concealed , a quintessential problem of cyberattacks .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A huge ash cloud from an Icelandic volcano spread out across Europe on Friday causing air travel chaos on a scale not seen since the Sept. 11 attacks and costing airlines hundreds of millions of dollars .

The plume that floated through the upper atmosphere , where it could wreak havoc on jet engines and airframes , threw travel plans into disarray on both sides of the Atlantic .
Severe disruption of European air traffic was expected on Saturday because of the dangers posed by the volcanic ash , aviation officials said .
Airports in much of Britain , France and Germany remained closed and flights were set to be grounded in Hungary and parts of Romania .
“ I am furious and frustrated , ” said Sara Bicoccih , stranded at Frankfurt airport on her way home to Italy from Miami .
The U.S. military had to reroute many flights , including those evacuating the wounded from Afghanistan and Iraq , a Pentagon spokesman said .

“ I would think Europe was probably experiencing its greatest disruption to air travel since 9/11 , ” a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority , Britain ’s aviation regulator , said .
“ In terms of closure of airspace , this is worse than after 9/11 .
The disruption is probably larger than anything we ’ve probably seen . ”
Following the attacks on Washington and New York in 2001 , U.S. airspace was closed for three days and European airlines were forced to halt all transatlantic services .
Disruption from the volcanic ash eruption in Iceland is costing airlines more than $ 200 million a day , air industry group the International Air Transport Association said .
But unless the cloud disrupts flights for weeks , threatening factories ’ supply chains , economists do not think it will significantly slow Europe ’s shaky recovery from recession or affect second - quarter gross domestic product figures .
“ The overall impact should be very limited even if the problem persists for a day or more ... , ” IHS Global Insight chief UK and European economist Howard Archer said .
Vulcanologists say the ash could cause problems to air traffic for up to six months if the eruption continues .
The financial impact on airlines could be significant .
The fallout hit airline shares on Friday with Lufthansa , British Airways , Air Berlin , Air France - KLM , Iberia and Ryanair down between 1.4 and 3.0 percent .
Irish airline Ryanair , Europe ’s biggest low - cost carrier , said it would cancel flights to and from northern European countries until 1200 GMT on Monday .
David Castelveter , a spokesman with the Air Transport Association of America trade group , said U.S. airlines had cancelled at least 170 flights to and from Europe .
Delta Air Lines , the world ’s largest airline , cancelled 75 flights between the United States and European Union on Friday and for Saturday , it has halted 35 flights from the EU to the United States , Delta spokesman Anthony Black said .
PLUME DRIFTING
Joe Sultana , head of network operations at European air control agency Eurocontrol , said the situation was unprecedented .
Eurocontrol said it was up to each country when flights were resumed , based on whether there was clear air .
For example , it is clear in parts of Scotland and northern Norway and Sweden , but clear airspace that had been over Vienna and Geneva was closing , so they could be affected .
Mark Seltzer , a forecaster at Britain ’s Met Office , said that on Thursday the plume affected northern Scotland because of northwesterly winds at high levels .
“ However , the winds have become , at upper levels , more westerly and that is steering it more into Scandinavia , taking it away from Scotland and Northern Ireland . ”
The volcano began erupting on Wednesday for the second time in a month from below the Eyjafjallajokull glacier , hurling a plume of ash 6 to 11 km ( 4 to 7 miles ) into the atmosphere .
Officials said it was still spewing magma and although the eruption could abate in the coming days , ash would continue drifting into the skies of Europe .
Iceland ’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said there was some damage to roads and barriers protecting farms .
“ There is still an evacuation of around 20 farms , which is 40 to 50 people , ” she added , noting this was less than the 800 people who had been evacuated earlier this week .
MERKEL DIVERTED
Volcanic ash contains tiny particles of glass and pulverised rock that can damage engines and airframes .
In 1982 , a British Airways jumbo jet lost power in all its engines when it flew into an ash cloud over Indonesia , gliding towards the ground before it was able to restart its engines .
The incident prompted the aviation industry to rethink the way it prepared for ash clouds .
In addition to travel problems , health officials warned that the volcanic ash could also prove harmful to those with breathing difficulties .
In Brussels , European aviation control officials said some 12,000 to 13,000 flights were likely to operate in European airspace on Friday , compared with about 29,500 normally .
The ash was expected to spread further south and east .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , returning from a trip to the United States , was diverted to Portugal and was expected to spend the night in Lisbon .
However , the Polish president ’s funeral looked set to go ahead on Sunday as planned , at his family ’s insistence , despite some world leaders being unable to fly in .
The air problems have proved a boon for other transport firms .
All 58 Eurostar trains between Britain and Europe were operating full , carrying some 46,500 passengers , and a spokeswoman said they would consider adding more services .
London taxi firm Addison Lee said it had taken requests for journeys to Paris , Milan , Zurich and Salzburg in Austria .
Singer Whitney Houston took a ferry from Britain to Ireland for three concerts in Dublin after her flight was scratched .
A Victorian magistrate who assaulted his neighbour in a dispute over dog faeces has been fined and placed on good behaviour bonds for two years .
Raffaele Barberio , 60 , was this afternoon fined $ 7500 after admitting he assaulted his neighbour and took a key to his victim 's prestige car .
Earlier , the court heard Barberio “ just snapped ” when his neighbour challenged him about failing to pick up his dog 's faeces .
Barberio was suffering a delayed response to the death of his mother and experiencing enormous stress when the incident occurred , defence lawyer Robert Richter , QC , told the Moorabbin Magistrates Court in a criminal hearing this morning .
Barberio was charged after scuffling with his neighbour over a threat to throw dog faeces and , on a later occasion , using a key to cause $ 9000 damage to the victims ' car , a gold Range Rover with personalised number plates .

A well - known financial news aggregator is being ordered by a federal judge to delay publication of prominent financial analysts ' buy and sell recommendations to allow the well - to - do the first crack at capitalizing on that trading research .
The 3 - year - old litigation , brought by Barclays Capital , Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley and others , rests on the so - called " hot news " doctrine the Supreme Court first recognized in a 1918 case concerning the unauthorized and immediate republication of wire service reports .
A New York federal judge said Theflyonthewall.com breached the doctrine , which allows suits for re-reporting time sensitive " hot news . "
Research that Theflyonthewall.com re-posted or alluded to on its site was designated for the banks ' clients that earn the firms not less than $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 in trading commissions yearly , U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled .
Thursday 's ruling comes as rightsholders are invoking the hot news doctrine to counter a swell of news regurgitation sites .
In July , for example , The Associated Press defeated All Headline News in a court battle requiring the aggregator to stop rewriting and publishing AP stories .
Theflyonthewall.com , which has deals with Bloomberg , Thomson Reuters and about 5,000 paying clients in all , claimed it obtained the research through reporting , by having " hefty relationships with people in the know . "
The New Jersey company claimed that , since at least 2006 , it was a legitimate media outlet in a case weighing how far researchers can go to block redistribution of their findings and conclusions .
Judge Cote tipped the scales of justice on the side of the banks and their clients .
The ruling , which is being appealed , could have ramifications for other real - time , financial news sites .
" We believe that the decision is at variance with existing case law , and will appeal the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , " Theflyonthewall.com 's attorney , Glenn Ostrager , said in a Friday e-mail .
" We fully expect that the financial press will vigorously support Theflyonthewall with * amicii * briefs to the Circuit Court on the grounds that the recommendations are news which the financial press regularly reports . "
Theflyonthewall.com 's practices , the judge wrote , were interfering with the banks ' ability to profit ( . pdf ) from their research .
The banks ' clients were also being harmed by not getting exclusive , pre-market access to market - moving news , Cote wrote .
" The firms ’ intellectual capital , and their substantial investment in producing high - quality equity research is ultimately justified only by the role that research plays in driving commission revenue , " Cote ruled .
" The greater the perception of value , the more that clients are willing to pay to gain and retain access to that research by directing their trading business to the firm . "
But Cote did not altogether bar Theflyonthewall.com from distributing the banks ' findings .
She wrote that the hot news doctrine , in combination with the " goal " of intellectual property , " is to provide an incentive for the production of socially useful information without either under - or overprotecting the efforts to gather such information . "
For research acquired before the market 's 9:30 a.m. East Coast opening , Theflyonthewall.com must wait until at least 10 a.m. before it publishes that information , the judge said .
It must also wait two hours to publish the banks ' buy - and - sell reports it obtains during the intra-day trading cycle .

How would you like to choose between personalized Pandora stations , or select from the programming in your Stitcher custom channels , while keeping both hands on the wheel ?
With some new features set to debut in the new 2011 Ford Fiesta , you could do that , and a lot more through a connected smartphone .
Pandora , Stitcher , and OpenBeak are the first three applications to be SYNC - enabled , allowing hands - free voice control of app functions — which , of course , stream through the audio system thanks to SYNC's Bluetooth or USB - based connectivity .
The hitch ?
For now , the interface only works with Android and Blackberry apps — and specific ones at that .
It does n't yet work with Windows Mobile , or with the iPhone .
Ford says that " interoperability with the iPhone and other smartphones " will be introduced next year .
Ford ( NYSE : F ) now says that it has three different types of apps in the so - called SYNC ecosystem : built in apps , like Ford 's Vehicle Health Report and 911 Assist , cloud - based apps such the Traffic , Directions & Information app , and third - party apps like Pandora and Stitcher .
Some are predicting that by 2015 , smartphones and mobile devices will be the number - one way we get our Internet access , and Ford is hoping that within just a few years the number of third - party apps will bring it all home to the car — and keep it safer and more convenient with simple voice commands .
To help stoke that app market , Ford has released a toolkit for app developers .
Pandora for the iPhone
Last year , the Fiesta Movement beckoned hipsters through Facebook and Twitter to cut YouTube video submissions .
Then Ford chose 100 winners who got a Fiesta — and the expectation to carry on their own social - media Fiesta — for six months .
The Fiesta , with fuel economy ratings of up to 40 mpg , an extremely stylish interior , and buzzy exterior hues like Blue Flame and Lime Squeeze , has been priced from a low $ 13,995 base MSRP up to about $ 23 k fully loaded .
But many of those who reserved their Fiesta online or via texty text before April 2 got a free SYNC entertainment system upgrade .
The Fiesta will begin reaching dealerships this summer .

In pictures : Bangkok clashes aftermath Clashes pile pressure on Abhisit Hundreds of red-shirted opposition supporters also reportedly forced their way into government offices in the northern cities of Chiang Mai and Udon Thani in protest at the crackdown in the Thai capital .
Both the security services and Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva 's government had promised to show restraint in dealing with the demonstrators in order to avoid a repeat of last year 's riots , when two protesters were killed .
But the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Bangkok says the deaths of so many more in Saturday 's clashes can only mean greater political uncertainty for the country .
' Regret ' Reports from Bangkok on Sunday morning said the city of 15 million appeared to be calm as an unofficial truce took hold .

Reds and yellows Q&A : Thailand protests
The protesters , who want the government to call new elections , have been camped out in parts of the city for a month .
Hundreds of soldiers and riot police advanced after nightfall on one of the red - shirt camps , near Phan Fah bridge and Ratchadamnoen road , close to several government buildings and a UN office .
Local media say both sides fired weapons and detonated explosive devices in the clashes which ensued .
Television footage showed chaotic scenes , with clouds of tear gas enveloping the streets .
Paul , a British teacher who lives in Thailand , told the BBC he had been in a crowd of protesters across the road from the Khao San intersection when he saw a man of about 50 being shot in the chest as he waved a flag from a pick - up truck .
" The army were firing live rounds on civilians , " he said .
" I would n't have believed it if I had n't seen it myself . "
Shortly before midnight , Prime Minister Vejjajiva went on national television to say troops had halted their operation and express his " regret " to families of victims .
Soldiers , he insisted , would only have fired live rounds " into the air and in self - defence " .
" The government and I are still responsible for easing the situation and trying to bring peace and order to the country , " he added .

' Darkest hour '
The red -shirts - a loose coalition of left - wing activists and supporters of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra - want Mr Abhisit to dissolve parliament and call an election .
They say Mr Abhisit came to power illegitimately in a parliamentary vote after a pro-Thaksin government was forced to step down in 2008 .
Mr Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 .
They have vowed to defy the state of emergency declared on Wednesday with more rallies .

ZURICH ( Reuters ) -
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , Switzerland ’s largest bank was teetering .
UBS , which was more than three times bigger than Lehman in terms of assets , had to write down some $ 50 billion during that tumultuous period .
The logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at the company 's office at the Bahnhofstrasse in Zurich in this July 1 , 2009 file photo .
REUTERS / Arnd Wiegmann / Files
Investors the world over breathed a sigh of relief on October 16 when the Swiss government rescued UBS .
But unbeknownst to them at the time , the bank faced a potentially devastating crisis on a very different front .
One day after the bailout , top executives from UBS and Swiss regulators were summoned to a closed - door meeting in New York by U.S. officials who were conducting a wide - ranging tax fraud investigation that centered on the bank .
The UBS delegation , led by newly - appointed Group General Counsel Markus Diethelm , arrived armed with the results of an internal report highlighting instances of tax fraud within the bank , insiders told Reuters .
The plan was simple : admit guilt , settle the case quickly and move on .
But Kevin Downing , the U.S. Department of Justice Tax Division Attorney who had been investigating UBS since the middle of 2008 , chose that meeting to drop a bombshell : he wanted the bank to disclose names of U.S. tax evaders as a condition for a settlement .
That put UBS in the nightmarish position of either breaching nearly a century of Swiss bank secrecy or risking indictment in the United States .
“ UBS was already in a position of weakness from the credit crisis , ” said one person who attended the meeting and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity .
“ It became crystal clear at that meeting that without addressing the issue of client names , no settlement could be found . ”
Interviews with insiders and a review of documents reveal previously undisclosed details about how the sprawling tax case was resolved -- at several points in the process , for example , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was involved .
The confrontation also pushed UBS closer to the brink than is commonly realized .
And while the bank ultimately defused the situation by coughing up $ 780 million and agreeing to hand over some client names , the damage to its huge and increasingly important wealth management operation still weighs heavily on the Swiss banking flagship .
In the months ahead , UBS ’s new management team will try to stabilize its battered wealth management division , whose advisers have been bolting and taking clients with them .
All of this in turn has forced the bank to confront a broader , more existential question : what exactly is UBS today ?
An asset - gathering megabank or a leaner player , more attentive to its wealthy clients ’ needs .
SWISS SECRETS
For UBS and other Swiss banks , the implications of the New York meeting on October 17 , 2008 were hardly trivial .
Sharing bank client data would have been against UBS ’s core principles : confidence , security and discretion , symbolized by the three keys of its 70 - year - old logo .
Doing so might also shatter wealthy clients ’ trust in the bank -- and in the whole Swiss financial center .
Under scrutiny by the DOJ was the so - called U.S. cross -border business of UBS .
This consisted of wealth management services offered to American residents outside the United States .
It operated out of Switzerland and was separate from UBS ’s New York - based Americas wealth management business .
In documents relating to the UBS case , the DOJ said the bank helped some 52,000 Americans hide billions of dollars of untaxed assets in secret Swiss accounts between 2000 and 2007 .
According to settlement documents , UBS sometimes used shell financial entities to hide the money , depriving the Internal Revenue Service of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenues .
The business was referred to by some UBS executives as “ toxic waste ” due to the risks it carried under U.S. law .
But UBS bankers , seemingly unaware of the legal consequences , made 3,800 trips to the United States to visit these clients in 2004 alone .
The cross - border accounts were hardly a big part of the bank ’s business .
They added up to almost $ 20 billion , or less than 1 percent of UBS ’s total invested assets of about $ 2 trillion ( 2.174 trillion Swiss francs ) at the end of 2008 .
The business was so small it was initially below the radar screen of Swiss financial regulator FINMA , at the time known as the Federal Banking Commission .
The agency ’s main concern back then was the systemic risks posed by UBS ’s increasingly wobbly fixed - income division .
Passing on some UBS client data to the United States was possible under certain strict conditions under an existing U.S. - Swiss tax agreement .
U.S. authorities put in a request for the client data to Berne , but the process was cumbersome and slow and the Department of Justice grew increasingly impatient .
The investigation was launched by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission , which suspected that UBS had breached U.S. securities law .
But when the Department of Justice became involved , raising the prospect of criminal prosecutions , Swiss regulators became alarmed .
Their concerns grew in April , 2008 , when U.S. authorities briefly detained Martin Liechti , the Zurich - based head of UBS ’s U.S. cross - border business , while he was visiting Miami .
Then in May , Bradley Birkenfeld , a former UBS financial adviser who famously admitted smuggling a diamond in a toothpaste tube on behalf of a client , was arrested .
He began a 40 - month sentence in January .
Those cases got the Swiss Federal Banking Commission ’s attention .
As the summer wore on , the agency started pressuring UBS to speed things up .
But the bank , still in the throes of the financial crisis , was preoccupied with its own survival .
UBS had recently removed its all - powerful chairman , Marcel Ospel , who had blessed UBS ’s big expansion into the United States a decade earlier and fostered the risky U.S. investments that eventually brought UBS to its knees .
Peter Kurer , a well - known Swiss lawyer who had joined the bank in 2001 as its general counsel , replaced Ospel as chairman in April 2008 .
Kurer took months to appoint Diethelm as UBS ’s top lawyer .
That lengthy process did not help the bank ’s dealings with U.S. authorities .
Diethelm , an ambitious former chief legal officer at Swiss Re , had made his name in the legal community by negotiating a multi-billion - dollar settlement between a group of insurers and a developer of the World Trade Center .
But within weeks of taking on the job he found himself working for a nearly crippled lender that was facing indictment in the United States .
Hoping to come to the rescue in what was clearly becoming an untenable situation for UBS , the Swiss Finance Ministry sent a letter to its U.S. counterparts to make clear that Berne was willing to find a solution to the UBS case despite the obvious legal constraints .
That did not sit well with U.S. officials , who saw the letter as political interference , insiders say .
The Swiss never got an official response .
Instead , the next time U.S. officials contacted the bank , on November 12 , it was to inform UBS that Raoul Weil , its global head of wealth management , was being indicted .
“ That was a clear message , ” said a high - level Swiss source .
“ One can imagine that without the letter they would have at least delayed the indictment of Weil . ”
Executives inside the bank feared that Chief Executive Marcel Rohner and Chairman Peter Kurer would be next , although neither had been named in court documents , these insiders say .
The indictment of Weil , who immediately stepped down from the executive board and has denied all wrongdoing despite remaining a fugitive in Switzerland , jump - started the negotiations .
In November , the Department of Justice asked UBS to submit a collateral consequences study , normally one of the last steps before an indictment of a company .
“ They said : we have now the authority from the highest level of government to proceed with an indictment , ” the UBS source said .

Inside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , officials were also alarmed .
They feared the indictment of UBS could panic already jittery financial markets .
But the N.Y .
Fed could not interfere in the DOJ ’s affairs .
“ UBS has to find a way to disclose the taxpayer names to DOJ in order to avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of an indictment , ” Thomas Baxter , the New York Fed ’s general counsel , told a Swiss interlocutor , according to another person familiar with the discussions .
In December , UBS held an intense board meeting at which top executives examined alternatives and assessed risks .
Kurer , who had recused himself because of pending UBS litigation , could not take part .
At the meeting , directors discussed the possibility of “ Notrecht ” -- German for emergency law , which the government could use to bypass bank secrecy rules and rescue UBS .
But the board decided that the bank should act within the parameters of existing Swiss law .
“ UBS had to go back to the drawing board , ” said one insider .
Was the Department of Justice really going to pull the trigger ?
Would it risk pushing over the cliff a bank with three times more employees than Lehman Brothers , about 27,000 of whom were based in the United States ?
No one knew for sure , but the Swiss decided not to take the risk .
On a cold night on February 18 , the Swiss government convened an emergency late evening cabinet meeting in Berne and gave its blessing to a hefty $ 780 million criminal settlement .
More painful than the money , though , was an agreement by UBS to deliver about 280 names of serious U.S. tax avoiders .
The government had essentially traded nearly a century of Swiss bank secrecy for UBS ’s survival .
This was done with the blessing of Swiss regulators , who had to draft an emergency regulation to bypass the court system to save UBS from the risk of failure .
A day after the settlement , the U.S. Internal Revenue Service shocked the Swiss government by demanding that UBS disclose the names of 52,000 possible U.S. tax evaders .
The Swiss had clearly failed to take both the criminal and civil investigation into UBS off the table , and pressure on their treasured bank secrecy laws continued .
THE JOHN DOE SUMMONS
Finding someone to take on the job of steadying the UBS ship amid financial turmoil and a U.S. criminal investigation was not easy .
“ No - one wanted to talk to us because of this thing , ” said a senior UBS source .
In the weeks running up to the February 18 criminal settlement Kurer interviewed three candidates .
One of them was German - born Oswald Gruebel , a former Chief Executive of Credit Suisse credited with turning around the second largest Swiss bank at a difficult time .
Gruebel had retired with a bitter taste in this mouth after losing a battle to become chairman of the bank he had spent 22 years with .
On February 26 , 2009 , barely a week after the settlement of the criminal side of the UBS case , Gruebel agreed to take on the challenge .
He immediately signaled a change of tune by announcing sharp cost cuts in an interview with local media .
He said it would take him two to three years to rebuild the bank .
Kurer reluctantly left the bank and was replaced by former Swiss finance minister Kaspar Villiger .
UBS was counting on Villiger ’s political ties to help it settle the remaining leg of the U.S. tax case , known as the John Doe summons .
A former trader of humble origins and no formal university education , Gruebel is an outsider in what remains a close - knit hierarchical world of Swiss banking .
Born in East Germany in 1943 , he fled through the Iron Curtain as a 10 - year - old orphan and learned the ropes of the business on Deutsche Bank ’s bond trading floor in the 1960s .
A straight - talking banker with a dry sense of humor , he is described as “ cold ” and “ tough ” by close aides and tends to avoid the limelight .
Yet Gruebel is admired by peers as a fighter who possesses deep knowledge of investment banking , wealth management and commercial banking at a time when most banking executives tend to be specialized .
UPHILL STRUGGLE
When Gruebel took the job of chief executive in February , the bank had just been stabilized thanks in part to a loan from the Swiss state .
It was also safe from U.S. criminal charges after its February settlement .
But UBS was by no means out of the woods .
It still faced a civil tax litigation that threatened the confidentiality of thousands of U.S. clients and led to an exodus of clients and financial advisers .
And the bank remained far from profitable , losing over 21 billion Swiss francs in 2008 , the biggest annual loss in Swiss corporate history .
The John Doe summons represented a real legal headache for UBS .
While it had been possible to stretch Swiss law to settle charges of tax fraud , the summons breached new ground by targeting tax evasion , an area in which the Swiss do not offer international cooperation .
Insiders say that by early March , it was clear that without Swiss government intervention , UBS would face another damaging legal clash that threatened Switzerland ’s relationship with the United States .
While UBS continued talks with the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice , the Swiss foreign ministry got in on the act , sending officials to visit the U.S. State Department in late March .
The following month , Swiss Finance Minister Hans - Rudolf Merz , who at the time also held the rotating post of Swiss President , met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in Washington .
By their own reckoning , the Swiss were in a weak negotiating position : on April 2 , the Group of 20 nations had put them on a list of tax havens and the U.S. administration was pressing ahead with legislation against illicit tax gains in offshore centers .
But they had a few things going for them .
The U.S. State Department was grateful for the nation ’s diplomatic support -- such as representing U.S. interests in places like Cuba and Iran and helping to broker a deal that normalized relations between Turkey and Armenia .
The pact was signed in Switzerland last October .
This , insiders said , helped create what they called a “ certain atmosphere ” that made it possible for Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy Rey to have numerous phone calls with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and to meet her face to face three times in the run-up to the August deal .
In the end , at a crucial July 31 , 2009 meeting , Clinton and Calmy Rey were able to agree a deal in principle to avert a damaging court case against UBS .
The Swiss , constrained by their red tape , could not guarantee the timing of the delivery of any client names .
But the IRS was satisfied with reassurances that Swiss authorities would eventually do so .
A U.S. State Department official said the United States welcomed the deal “ and the continued efforts by the Swiss government to ensure that its obligations under the UBS Agreement are met . ”
The State Department declined further comment for this story .
UBS and the United States settled the civil leg of the case on August 19 .
There was no fine involved this time around , but a promise to hand over another 4,450 names within a year .
Two months later Gruebel played his ace : after weeks of secret contacts , he hired Robert McCann , a former head of wealth management at archrival Merrill Lynch , to be the new face of UBS ’s battered American franchise .
Within three months of starting , McCann installed a brand new team of mostly ex-Merrill executives -- known within the bank as the Wealth Management Americas Renewal Team .
STOPPING THE ROT
It has taken Gruebel less than a year to show investors and clients that the bank has regained its financial footing .
This involved some tough choices .
Gruebel shrunk the bank ’s workforce by 11,000 , to 65,000 .
He also sold a crown jewel -- Brazil ’s wealth management unit Pactual -- for $ 2.5 billion just three years after buying it .
But the Swiss giant is still losing client money and withdrawals at its wealth management franchise accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
And investors balked when Gruebel said he saw no immediate recovery in inflows and predicted more withdrawals over the next few quarters .
Since the middle of 2008 , a total of 225 billion Swiss francs have left the bank , according to calculations from Keefe , Bruyette and Wood ’s analyst Matthew Clark .
That is more than 11 percent of the bank ’s combined wealth management assets of 2 trillion Swiss francs at the end of March 2008 .
At the current rate , Morgan Stanley analyst Huw van Steenis reckons that rival Credit Suisse will surpass UBS in terms of wealth management assets by next year .
“ Credit Suisse Private Banking momentum means it could become larger than UBS in Swiss private banking going into 2011 , ” said Steenis , who expects UBS to lose a further 37 billion Swiss francs this year .
Gruebel recognized early on that the loss of credibility among wealth management clients was the single biggest issue he had to deal with .
At first , clients were withdrawing their money strictly because of the credit crisis .
But the breach of trust that followed the tax fraud scandal in the United States only made the matter worse .
He is expected to face a tough shareholder meeting on April 14 .
Activist investors like the investment fund Ethos plan to challenge the bank ’s sizable 2009 bonuses and to vote against the discharge of UBS board members from any responsibility stemming from the credit crisis .
“ Having done a fantastic job in building a global brand they were seriously damaged by the fact they went almost bust and did some serious missteps in public relations in the U.S. tax affair , ” said Michael Malinski , a specialist wealth management consultant who has 22 years of practical experience in the business .
“ If you are a potential client , unless there was a compelling reason to go with UBS , you would choose someone else . ”
Even though UBS suffered the bulk of its client outflows outside America , Former Paine Webber President Joseph Grano , who ran the post - merger UBS PaineWebber wealth management business in the United States before leaving in 2004 , said he believes the Swiss bank ’s brand name in the country is beyond repair .
Gruebel ’s top priority is to stop the exodus of private client money .
Some of the outflows are the result of clients choosing to remain with UBS financial advisers who have bolted the bank for greener pastures .
Ultimately , he must figure out what to do with the bank ’s U.S. wealth management business -- the old Paine Webber franchise that it bought for $ 12 billion in 2000 and which has been unprofitable ever since .
UBS tried to sell it repeatedly during the crisis , but could only attract low - ball offers .
With McCann on board , UBS believes it has a chance to make the business work .
“ If he can achieve that , keeping the unit or selling it will be a purely financial choice , ” said Ray Soudah , founder of Millennium Associates , a Swiss - based M&A consultancy with a focus on wealth management .
More importantly , UBS has another tough decision to make .
Given the current political and regulatory pressures in Switzerland , the bank cannot continue playing a big role in both investment banking and wealth management .
Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand is drafting a proposal that would make it impossible for UBS or Credit Suisse to drag the economy down should another crisis hit the banking sector .
And some Swiss political parties , including the radical ultra-nationalist SVP , the country ’s biggest political force , have called in the past for forcing UBS to sell its investment banking business .
Gruebel , who helped shape the universal banking model in Switzerland , is not expected to give up on investment banking so easily .
Nor will Credit Suisse .
But he may be forced to curb investment banking activities , which , unlike the wealth management business , are capital intensive .
And in the current financial environment , capital remains an important commodity .
ANGRY GERMANS
Ongoing heavy pressure on Switzerland by cash - strapped Western nations seeking to recoup taxpayers ’ undeclared cash is also not helping UBS .
In the wake of its painful 2009 U.S. tax settlement , all Swiss - based private banks are attempting to kick suspected U.S. tax cheats out .
But European governments are not sitting still waiting for this to happen .
Germany , whose citizens own a quarter of an estimated 726 billion Swiss francs of undeclared EU assets stashed in Switzerland according to Helvea analyst Peter Thorne , has been particularly virulent .
On March 19 , German prosecutors launched an investigation of Credit Suisse for allegedly aiding German clients to dodge taxes .
UBS is also the subject of a German inquiry , launched in February , that focuses on suspected fraud and tax evasion in that nation .
None of this is helping the Swiss bank rebuild client trust at a time when Berne is trying to negotiate a sensitive new tax treaty with its German neighbors .
The Swiss giant is reacting to the international attacks on bank secrecy and offshore banking by narrowing its focus to the super - rich and to high - growth markets like Asia , a region where the Swiss wealth manager remains a leader .
“ In the U.S. , UBS is just a shadow of itself .
In Asia they are still the strongest .
In Europe they are somewhat in between , ” a former UBS executive said .
Even though the bank still offers private banking services to clients , it has quietly adopted a strategy of making it less attractive for small undeclared European accounts to stick with UBS , insiders say .
Banking on a strictly - confidential basis is more costly for clients , who must now travel to Switzerland , at risk of being noticed by custom police , if they want to see how their investments are doing .
The bank has also adopted a new code of business conduct and ethics clearly stating that “ UBS does not provide assistance to clients in acts aimed at breaching their fiscal obligations . ”
And there are indications that unwanted client defections may be slowing .
“ Outflows persisted in the fourth quarter of 2009 but are well below the peak , ” said analyst Matthew Clark .
“ Despite everything that happened to UBS , cumulative outflows only correspond to 16 percent of the wealth management business ( ex - U.S. ) , ” he said .
“ This is not a lot and this is a very resilient business , ” he added .
“ Considering everything that has happened to UBS , its wealth management business has proven remarkably resilient and there is scope to see the glass half full . ”
All Swiss banks appear to be counting on the government to find a solution to the “ Schwarzgeld ” or black money , as the untaxed money belonging to Westerners is commonly known in Switzerland .
But the stakes remain exceptionally high .
In February , Gruebel said UBS alone holds about 140 billion francs of potentially undeclared assets of Western European origins .
Rival Credit Suisse said for it the amount was 100 billion Swiss francs .
Even so , the highest end of the market appears safe for UBS and other Swiss banks .
That is because the super wealthy use lawyers to minimize the tax impact through sophisticated watertight tax avoidance structures rather than stashing cash in a secret bank account , or they come from emerging countries that are less sensitive about tax evasion issues .
“ Tax evasion is not a problem of the big guys , ” said one seasoned Swiss banker .
Many pointed out that she was drawing a direct line between the fatwas of some of Saudi Arabia 's leading clerics - including one who was alleged to have said that men and women found in each other 's company should be killed - and the suicide belts of Islamic terrorists .
It seems Code Pink really got under Karl Rove 's skin because he lashed out at FOX & Friends for bringing up the issue to him .
Fox News contributor Karl Rove directed some unfriendly fire at the hosts of " Fox and Friends " this weekend when the show 's anchors decided to ask Rove to respond to protesters who disrupted the former top Bush adviser 's book tour .
" This is sad , you people are recycling stuff that happened three to four weeks ago , this is a small blemish on what was a great trip , " Rove said when asked about members of the group Code Pink who showed up at a March 30 book signing in Beverly Hills , Calif. , called Rove a " war criminal " and brandished handcuffs .
" It was a blemish , " he insisted , adding that there were no such incidents at other stops on his book tour .
" Please do n't paint this as much a sign of anything , " he continued .
" These are sort of sad and pathetic people ...
Can you imagine being some kind of nut wandering around with handcuffs ?
Let 's not give them any more attention . "
The Code Pink protesters have proven to be a thorn in Rove 's side at several stops on the tour to promote his book " Courage and Consequence . "
Toshio Yamamoto 's earliest memory of ramen goes back to when he was five years old .
He was slurping down a bowl of instant noodles at home with his parents when he accidentally flipped it over and burnt himself .
" I 've been eating instant ramen ever since , " he says .
By his early elementary school years , Yamamoto had mastered the skill of cooking noodles in a pot , treating himself to a serving of Maruchan whenever hunger struck .
It was the beginning of a lifelong passion that would eventually make him a pseudo web celebrity .
Yamamoto is the man behind i-ramen.net , a web site that meticulously chronicles and reviews thousands of different types of ramen from Japan and beyond .
After we profiled his web site on Boing Boing , the 49 - year old hardware engineer agreed to answer a few questions about his instant ramen obsession .
Yamamoto eats instant noodles for breakfast five days a week —
Tuesdays , Wednesdays , and Thursdays are cup noodle days ; on Saturdays and Sundays he eats the kind that comes in plastic packaging .
Until recently , Yamamoto was eating instant noodles seven days a week .
He recently decided to slow down his pace for logistical reasons .
" For one person to chase a single theme over a long period of time is a very special thing , " he says .
" I feared that , if I continued at that pace , I would get bored . "
The rest of his meals are " just normal meals " — lunch at his company 's cafeteria , simple dinners at home .
" I do n't hate ramen shops , but I 'm not particularly drawn to them either . "
He started the web site in 1995 , reviewing ramen from the 80s that he happened to have stored in his pantry .
When a Japanese magazine picked it up as fodder , he decided to continue to document his culinary adventures .
i- ramen.net is a monster database with over 4,000 distinct ramen reviews — he occasionally revisits the classics to make sure the taste has n't changed , but for the most part the site consists of new brands and special edition flavors , often from different countries .
Over New Years , for example , he flew to Hong Kong and returned with over 100 packets that he 's now in the process of reviewing .
Yamamoto also has a YouTube channel .
Using Adobe Premiere Elements 4 and some 8 mm video skills he acquired as a college student , he created hundreds of video reviews of instant ramen — precise 40 - second clips with bouncy music , sound effects , and a voice over that describes the texture , the ingredients , the umami , and ends with a kicker , like " This was altered for American taste buds .
It 's not something I would ever choose to eat " or " The premium beef paired with ordinary noodles makes it oddly unbalanced . "
In some of them , you see him adding a hot dog and some cabbage .
That 's for nutritional balance ; also , since hot dogs and cabbage are always readily available , adding those two ingredients consistently removes the possibility of a biased review .
For products catered towards Muslims , like instant ramen from Indonesia , he makes sure not to put pork hot dogs inside .
The key to enjoying instant noodles every day is simple : " It 's to eat while possessing a feeling of happiness . "
Yamamoto can conjure up this feeling by reminding himself of the universality of instant ramen .
" When I think about all the people even on the opposite end of the globe who are eating instant noodles at the same time as me , it really makes me feel connected beyond borders , " he says .

Richard Garriott's Next Journey
By Brandon Sheffield
Richard Garriott is best known as the creator of the Ultima RPG series , and he says that his experiences in the early days of game creation give him the multidisciplinary oversight into major content problems that today 's designers often lack .
He 's turning his attention from major MMOs , in the wake of the closure of his long - in - the - coming , short - in - the - operating Tabula Rasa , and instead joining the ranks of developers moving into the social gaming space -- a place where he sees not just business opportunity , but also a place to aim expertise honed both in the early days of gaming and at the onset of the MMO revolution .
His new company , Portalarium , will be a test of his ideas about game development , which he shares freely in this wide - ranging interview .
Conducted at the DICE 2010 summit , where he delivered a lamentation on the state of games writing , this in - depth Gamasutra interview with Garriott takes in his view of the mainstream games industry of 2010 and where the real opportunities lie -- and why .
Why Facebook ?
Richard Garriott : Well , the target is not specifically Facebook .
The target is really what I would call broadly the explosively growing market -- the new market of players -- which I 'll call broadly casual and social network players .
You know , I kind of look at it and go , " I feel like I 've now lived through three major shifts in the gaming industry . "
Number one is the beginning of the industry , [ laughs ] you know , where I was lucky enough to be one of the first developers of games .
And so , with that came great opportunity and revolutions .
The second one was the emergence of online gaming .
Now , I would argue that Ultima Online was a major stepping - stone in convincing people that online gaming was relevant .
At the time I was trying to get it going , no one supported it .
It was very hard to get going , but when it finally shipped , it ultimately ended up making ten times the revenue of all the previous Ultima games combined .
That has now for the last decade been by far the dominant growth area of gaming at all .
I mean , look at things like World of Warcraft , and it's now ten to a hundred times bigger than Ultima Online .
But if you look at this new casual and / or social media gaming , a lot of people in this building still either pooh - pooh it or do n't get it or do n't understand it , yet already the number of players on these games is dramatically in excess of even things like World of Warcraft .
The amount of money flow on this side of the fence is already dramatically in excess of almost any game anybody in this room ever develops .
And yet , you know , people still here are still in the mode , just like in my mind they were with online gaming before the models were proven , thinking , " Oh , you know , the quality level is not there yet , " or , " Oh , the types of games offered really are n't interesting to me yet . "
And I 'm going like , " Well , yeah , that 's true -- it might not be yet , but I assure you it will be and very soon .
And it's one of these coming juggernauts that you either need to learn to understand and participate in the evolution of or you 're left behind , just like online gaming . "
What is your ultimate goal for your company right now ?
RG : So , I believe the casual gamer and the social gaming platform represents the largest ever yet seen emergence or change within the gaming industry .
And all of us in the development community have a choice to either participate and lead in this journey or get left behind .
I believe that my group , which helped start gaming back in the early days of Origin and Ultima that helped begin and grow the online gaming space , which has been the main motivator for the last 10 years , is perfectly suited to also jump in to contribute here with this new emergence .
And so I believe we 'll be able to bring very high quality play experiences to a consumer base that is growing the fastest and demanding play options faster than any previous group has had .
It 's interesting to me -- it seems a lot of people from that era that feel the same .
RG : We were just talking to Sid Meier .
Sid Meier .
Steve Woita .
All these people are getting back in there because ...
RG : Because we did it .
And I think everybody else is still a little too egotistical to realize it .
I think there 's a lot of reluctance based on the fact that a lot of game developers still make the games they would want to play , and in general , games like FarmVille are not going to fill that particular need .
RG : I agree .
And by the way , I do n't play FarmVille , personally .
However , for example , I can tell you that in this last year , almost 100 percent of my gaming as an avid gamer has been on my iPhone .
But I 've tried every portable platform that 's existed , and none of them were terribly good , but finally we have a platform where lighter mobile games are compelling even to a hardcore gamer .
The way we find this market , the key thing about the casual and social gaming market to me , my definition of it says this : " What 's important to these users is not the game fundamentally ; it 's really their friends . "
So , the first thing you have to realize is their friendships and networking with their friends is the dominant activity .
So , to find them , you have to go into that community .
And then when you decide that you have presented them something entertaining , your friend has to be able to say , " Hey , I found something that 's fun .
Check it out , " they have to be able to send you a link .
They have to be able to download and check it out yourself with no cost , never going to the retail store , never sitting with a long download , never with an instruction manual , never with a tutorial .
You have to sit down and play it .
Well , in my mind , every online game that we 've already made to date would be a better game if I could pick it up for free , I could download it immediately , I could launch it without any installs , etcetera , etcetera .
So , the things the new market is demanding is actually a benefit to every game we 've already made in history .
And as you make these games , a lot of those people will come along the ride .
A lot of them will be immersed with gaming and want to play more .
Some of them will stay light ; some will increase their journey .
But either way , it 's going to be radically market - expanding , and the quality of the offerings is also going to go up very quickly .
One of the things that the portable area is going to be able to do , is that the majority of offerings that you see today on these social media networks are all developed on things that were great common denominators like Flash and Java .
And the reason why those were great initial foundations is because it 's ubiquitous .
You can run it on IE or through Firefox or Safari or on your iPhone eventually .
It 's easy to transport thing you write there .
And the engine is already designed for you , and there 's books written on it and etcetera .
And so it makes sense that that would be the first place that people would build games .
But the results of those games do n't provide you with the same what I 'll call graphical power that you do out of a more customized engine , and I would also argue that the user interface , what I 'll call the tactile feel that you get when you play a lot of these earlier games , are n't yet up to years of iteration of gaming that we 've already done in more hardcore games .
And so I actually think it 's actually going to be fairly straightforward for those of us in the traditional gaming market to bring sensibilities of user interface , of graphic quality , of engine performance as long as when we arrive on the scene , we also respect well those fundamentals -- I 've already mentioned what I believe that market is -- and then we offer a palette of everything from very simple games like poker and farming or whatever else , as well as a full suite of ... to my mind , it could be any MMO you pick , as long as it does n't violate those premises .
In terms of the UI and kind of backend concerns in the existing social network games , what do you think are the main areas that need to be improved upon , and in what way ?
RG : Well , I would think this early generation of social games that exist , the thing they 've done brilliantly is that they respect and enhance the social ties of groups of friends within a social network .
So , they 're doing a very good job of every time I log into one of those games , you can see the kind of next level of crafting that people are learning to how to help bond people to each other , and I 'm trying to make sure we learn those laws very quickly , too .
The place that I so far see so little progress on has been the recognition that , if you have the option of two games that are otherwise identical , and one of them is in fact physically just difficult to use -- hard to install , unreliable to install , graphically inferior , obtuse user interface , inelegant or less beautiful than the other -- of course you 're going to pick the one that 's more beautiful and easier to use .
And I see so far less progress in that area than in what 's clearly the core of social games , which is the social part .
That part is learning is going very quickly .
But strangely , and I think the reason why , by the way , is the people that are making these games are this new breed that gets that , but are n't members of this group [ traditional game developers ] yet , so to speak , and very few people in this building have chosen to back them up .
It 's interesting to me looking at some of these earlier offerings and seeing that the graphical quality is n't quite there -- and that in many cases , it does n't matter .
I do n't believe that it wo n't matter , but I believe it has n't really mattered yet in many cases .
RG : Well , no .
And by the way , that was true ... about Ultima Online .
So , Ultima Online , we made by using ...
We were on Ultima 9 at the time , but we used Ultima 6 graphics literally to build Ultima Online .
And so the traditional press , all the press in this building , panned it .
They went , " Here is a game .
It looks three years old .
Who gives a flip about playing with other people .
It 's irrelevant . "
And guess what ?
It was n't irrelevant .
It was the harbinger of things to come .
And the same thing 's happening right now in social media .
Do you think that story has any kind of place in this arena ?
RG : I do .
I was asked to play the anti-story role during that debate [ at DICE ] .
And so hopefully I represented the anti-story side pretty well .
But fundamentally , I 'm a story guy .
But I was correctly articulating what I thought the challenges to doing good story were , which is that it 's almost never done well and it's rare that the marketplace has rewarded good story .
So , I think those are true .
That being said , I actually think what takes games out of being an irrelevant way to spend some time and puts it into literature and meaningful life experience is to put good story in it .
And so for me personally , I think it 's a really big deal , and I think it absolutely can be done on online interactive environments just like we barely are able to do it now in solo player gaming experiences , but it 's definitely a big challenge .
What about the stories that exist between the players , versus top - down narrative ?
RG : So , the analogy I would give you is the early days of Dungeons & Dragons on paper .
I was one of the earliest adopters of Dungeons & Dragons on paper , and every Friday and Saturday night throughout my high school time , we would have a group of 30 to 40 people that would play at my house , my parents ' house , usually in two or three or four games at once in different rooms for years .
But as the game gained popularity , an interesting thing changed .
Early Dungeons & Dragons , no one cared about the rules .
No one cared about what your +2 or +3 sword was because it was irrelevant .
What really mattered is if you had a great gamemaster who was weaving a great story you all got to play your part in .
And if your team did something that was fun and clever and would not have worked , the guy would roll some dice back here , but it worked because it was fun and clever .
If you were doing something really stupid or boring , it did n't work , funny thing .
And so what it became is a dialogue discourse between a great gamemaster and engaged players .
Well , once D&D became more and more popular and you ran out of good storytellers for gamemasters , it devolved , in my mind , into the [ talks with a lisp ]
" Well , I 'm standing behind you and I 've got a +3 sword , and I 've got a slight advantage because my dexterity is a little higher " , and they do complicated calculations , then once every five minutes , roll die , and say you win .
Which I think it not roleplaying .
It might be a fun game ...
This is my personal definition ; most people do n't adhere to this .
Diablo , great game .
Loved it .
For me , I use the term " RPG " for it because it is a stats game .
It 's a " Do I have the best armor equipment compared to the creature I 'm facing ? "
There 's not really any story for it .
It 's a great challenge reward cycle game .
Blizzard , by the way , does the best challenge reward cycle games I 've seen .
On the other hand , Thief or Ultima are role - playing games versus RPG -- which I know stands for role - playing game .
When I think of a role - playing game , it is now where you are charged with playing an actual role and qualitative aspects of how you play are every bit as important as what equipment you use .
That 's what I find most interesting .
It 's a lot easier to do stories there .
And while I think your question really came from what about the story that has naturally evolved between players , clearly that 's what 's profoundly important about any shared experience .
But if you only rely on that , if you just create a sandbox and say , " You guys make your own stories , " it goes back to D&D .
There 's no context .
There 's no guidance .
There 's no showcasing .
A good game should constantly lead you over the next hill to see what 's on the other side , and it 's got to be something of wonder that you and your friends all get to share .
The interactive dialogue in Fallout 3 is not amazing , but it has great scenario design .
I feel like as an industry we 're better at doing that than delivering actual narrative , written story .
RG : While I think narrative , written story is an important component of good narrative -- which does n't have to have written story .
I think as an art form , we need them all [ to be ] strong , like they are well - developed in the cinematic industry .
But there 's no question .
I think often , just what I call " ad hoc " -- what feels to you is ad hoc discovery -- but in fact was the designer put it there near enough for you to bump into and then made each of those encounters have some special response based on the context of where you 've been and who you are , I think is very powerful .
And I agree , we have some examples , like apparently Fallout 3 has , that begin to showcase that .
One idea that I had for how to make interactive dialogue better -- I 'm just curious to bounce this idea off of you -- is iterative dialogue writing , wherein you write it to the best of your ability , and then you play through it properly in the game and then do a re-write based on how it works contextually .
RG : Well , I think as a process that absolutely is necessary .
I think that would absolutely give benefit .
I would add to that and go , you know the experience you described in Fallout ?
What was so positive about that -- and again remove from your mind whether it was a text interaction or an event interaction -- because in my mind , both of them advance your state of belief about yourself and your state of belief about the world and where you are and the Joseph Campbell hero 's journey arc , so it could be any of those processes .
But the things that almost all games do so poorly that you 've uncovered with your example of Fallout [ having interesting events but poor dialogue ] is most dialogue in most games are you 're told to go to location A , you might find some monsters on the way to location A , but there 's nothing relevant story - wise to your growth as an individual is going to happen on your way to location A , and when you get to location A , there 's generally one real outcome , which is go to location B .
And I do n't care how good a storyteller you are , that 's never going to be very interesting .
You 're never going to feel like you 've really participated in a truly meaningful way unless you discover things on the journey from A to B , and also when you do get to A and meet that person and have dialogue with , some form of discourse with , that it again has some outcome that for you will be unexpected , as often is not .
If you think about it in the real world , when you research a problem , you might know , " Gee , to find some information , I might need to go to France , where she lives , " but you might not know exactly who to talk to , exactly what question to ask , and exactly what company to go and investigate .
That 's the joy of discovery .
You have a general indicator , France , but you do n't know what you 're going to do when you get there .
And that 's the joy and excitement of being there .
You 're like , " Wow , I 'm going to have to figure out what it is . "
I have heard that you in the past did a scenario wherein the combat was n't so much important as the way you were comporting yourself .
RG : Yes .
Ultima IV ...
Here 's the challenge and reward of doing that .
What 's interesting about Ultima IV is it was very different than any other game I 'd made previously , although I 've tried to incorporate many elements of that in future games .
When I was writing it , I was n't sure anybody would get it .
When I would explain it to friends and family , they absolutely did not get it , and yet it was the first number one best - selling Ultima I ever did by far .
It 's really what put Ultima on the map .
What 's interesting about it is when you create a game around combat , it 's pretty easy to go , " You know , you have weapons that go from wimpy to tough .
You got armor that goes from wimpy to tough .
You got creatures that go from wimpy to tough .
And my skill and experience is going to go from wimpy to tough . "
So , it 's just this feathering of constantly increasing challenge and reward .
It 's a system you can put aside and say , " We 're done . "
When you think of the movie Star Wars , what 's interesting about it is it's not the same battle over and over again , just a little tougher .
There 's actually a story arc .
Each challenge is unique compared to the previous challenge .
Well , that means , in a gaming sense , you need to code it uniquely in many ways .
It 's not a system anymore .
Or if it there 's any systematic - ness to it , it 's a lot more elements and a lot more moving parts .
It 's a lot harder to balance than just everything gets tougher .
So , what I did with Ultima IV is I actually created a game where the game told you , in words , that it was going to be monitoring your behavior .
But when you did deeds good , bad , or otherwise , there was no point system that you were aware of that was going up or down .
And so you could never be sure when you were being tested and when you were n't .
And some tests would be easy for me to do .
Like if you stole money from a shop , that 's pretty easy for me to test , so I 'm going to record it .
I 'm not going to tell you .
I 'm not going to stop you .
I 'm not going to tell you , but I am going to record it .
It was n't really easy to lie to somebody and really test it very well , you know what I mean ?
Even if I set up one case in the whole game where you could , I could n't make a system out of it .
But again , I at least made you think it so you'd be worried about it .
So , I the entire overarching part of the game was to create this sense of , " Hey , I 'm responsible for my own actions in this game , and some of them , an unknown fraction of it , is going to reflect on how the world reacts to me . "
If you cheated that NPC , later on , you were going to back and need something from that NPC , and he'd say , " I 'd like to help you , but you 're the most dishonest thieving scumbag I 've ever met , so no way . "
Here 's where the Ultima IV epiphany happened for me .
My previous games -- Akalabeth , Ultima I , Ultima II , and Ultima III -- I published all but Ultima III through other publishers .
Ultima III was Origin 's first game , my company 's first game .
That was the first time I got letters , what you might call fan mail , from people .
And fan mail in our industry is one paragraph of , " Hey , I really like your game , " and usually pages of " Here 's what you did wrong , " or , " Let me tell you how to make your next game . "
But what became clear when I would read that mail is how people were interpreting my games in a very different way than I had made them , or they were interpreting things into it that just were n't there .
They were just reading things into the game .
I was like , " Wow , it 's fascinating how much people are reading between the lines .
It 's just not there . "
And also , I was going like , " Okay , the storyline for Ultima I : go kill Mondain the wizard , who sits in his castle and waits for you to come kill him , and you go loot corpses on the way to get there and probably take advantage of villagers on the way .
Ultima II : Go kill Minax the enchantress , his lover , and on they go .
Pillage and plunder .
Ultima III : Go kill Exodus , their offspring , and pillage and plunder on the way . "
And I 'm going like , " God , I 'm so tired of telling this story . "
And , by the way , that 's still the same story almost every game still has to this day .
And I 'm going like , " Okay , there 's got to be more to life than writing the go kill the evil wizard story . "
And combine that with the fact that people were reading so much into my games that was just never there , and they were playing by pillaging and plundering a lot more than I thought they were .
And so I 'm going , " Okay .
I 'm going to make a game where the world ... "
I really had no moral message I was trying to tell .
What I was trying to do was craft a world where the world responded to you in the same way the real world responds to you .
If you behave like a jerk , no one 's going to like you and no one 's going to help you , and you 're not going to be successful .
And thus laid the groundwork for Ultima IV .
I also heard you once say you really enjoyed programming ; it was your preferred aspect of game development .
Is that the case in the past ?
How did you wind up getting to this situation of much more narrative and design ?
RG : Yeah , okay .
Here 's the truth behind that then and I think I know where that came from .
You know , my first five games I wrote by myself , so I was the programmer , I was the artist , I was the terrible writer , I was the sound effects engineer , and I was the marketer .
I wrote the documentation , et cetera .
But since then , on we started having teams .
The first artist we hired and every artist we 've ever hired has been a hundredfold better artist than I ever was .
I could literally just use stick figures .
The first writers we hired from an English mastery standpoint were all head and shoulders above me .
Programmers , on the other hand , were different .
I was actually a good programmer .
When we would hire programmers , I felt comparable to them in skill , though I no longer program .
But I could , I believe , if I 'd kept up the skill , so to speak , be a good programmer .
But now every programmer we hire could run circles around me .
Design is the one very unusual case .
In design , I can name in the industry only a handful of people that I think are as good or better designers as I am .
And it actually less a statement towards what a great designer I believe I am -- because I still believe I make plenty of mistakes and I 'm only so - so at it -- but rather how hard the problem is and how unique a moment in time I began .
Because since I was the programmer , artist , designer , etcetera , it means that I now truly understand the trade - offs between those disciplines , and I understand what 's important about design versus if you look at most designers today , they do n't get a chance to be all those different skills , and most everybody just thinks , " Oh , I love all these games .
I 've got my great idea for a game .
I can't program and I can't draw art , so I 'll be a designer . "
And so designers have no job qualifications really , if you know what I mean .
And so everybody wants to be one and nobody 's skilled at it .
Hopefully it 's slightly changing now that engines are getting more usable -- for example , in the console games space with Unreal .
The scripting is much easier for people to use now .
And also in the independent or Flash gaming spaces , where there are game makers and there are ActionScript libraries that can help people get there .
RG : It still requires design skill .
One interesting thing about designers ... most programmers worked hard to become a programmer .
I mean , they spent years studying it .
Most artists were somehow born with some natural low - level talent -- I do n't understand how that happened -- but then they also spend years honing it .
Most designers , by the time they decide to design their first game , have not put in the years of labor to become a designer that those other skills already have .
With or without any tool advantage .
More importantly , when I sit down to do a design -- which is my favorite part by the way , not programming -- when I want to design , for example , a symbolic language to include in the game , which I love to do , I will go buy an entire research library on the subject , and I will pore through that subject for a month , because even though I was n't an expert on it , the only way to successfully include that area of design is to truly become as close to a world - leading subject as it possible , because I 'm competing against literature , from a qualitative standpoint .
Almost no other designer that I have ever know does that level of research to this day even though I go talk about it all time .
Whenever I talk at GDC or talk to designers , I go , " It 's labor .
You 've got to sit down , and if you 're going to talk about any particular subject through your design , you have to become the expert in that area .
And if you 're not , you 're just going to be retreading the same ground everybody else has done , and it 's not going to be interesting . "
That might be where something of a programming mindset may come into play .
I mean , designers do n't tend to be research and development oriented .
RG : Right .
Designers tend to be gamers who want to fix what they think was broken in the previous game .
But that 's not the way to be a great designer .
Similar to your point of storytelling not necessarily being rewarded , do you think that many players even notice ?
RG : Well , I think , for example , I did n't see Fallout 3 , but I 'm guessing it also looked and sounded and played very well .
Therefore , it 's a good game all the way around .
What 's interesting about games , especially hardcore games -- the core of what we do -- is gamers are n't really forgiving of sucky aspects of any game .
So , just because you have good story is no excuse to be less than pretty close to state of the art on graphics , sound , action , etcetera .
And each of these is really hard to do .
It 's hard to do good graphics .
It 's hard to do good sound .
It 's hard to do goo action .
And story is extra hard .
And so , that 's why I think it 's missed a lot , because it 's harder than most other aspects and it gives you no additional reward .
You can't throttle down on your spending on those other areas to do a pretty good story .
You can a little bit , but not much .
In my experience , gamers will tend to have a strong response to graphics they perceive to sub-par or physics that are wacky , but I 'll get all up in arms about a story that I think is irresponsible or bad or poorly written , and I 'll see nothing written online about it .
Native English speakers have so little interaction with the written word , speaking properly , and grammar , I sometimes feel like they would n't know a good story from a bad story .
RG :
You know , and I think fundamentally we share the same what I 'll call " disappointment " in the perceptions or demands of the American consumer .
I agree with that .
That being said , I think there are worthwhile exceptions .
For example , Lord of the Rings .
Even as a painfully long movie , the fact that they took the time and really did pretty good justice to that very sophisticated , deep , and meaningful story , I think it was appreciated by the general marketplace .
It 's just hard to do .
And those are the exceptions .

Someone hacked into Lindsay Lohan 's BlackBerry to send out harassing messages to the people on her buddy list , but it was n't Lohan 's rival heiress Paris Hilton .
Leslie Sloane Zelnik , the pop star 's spokeswoman , said the " disgusting and very mean messages " had everyone in her camp thinking that Hilton had been involved .
The two have had several confrontations in recent months , including a spat at Hollywood hot spot Hyde , where the two engaged in an argument in front of other patrons .
" Some people think Paris may have been involved because the wording of the messages sounds very familiar , " Zelnik told The New York Post 's Page Six .
" They were n't , " she now said .
" We now have her lawyers looking into it . "
Hilton had her own problems with portable electronics two years ago , when her T - Mobile account was hacked and private messages were put on the Web .
That incident exposed juicy tidbits that included her belief that Jessica Simpson , who was then married to Nick Lachey , had a crush on Justin Timberlake .
Hilton 's representative Elliot Mintz further denies that his client was involved in the apparent invasion into Lohan 's buddy list .
