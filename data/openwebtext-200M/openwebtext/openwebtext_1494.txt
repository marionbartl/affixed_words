Leave it to a bunch of engineering students at Yale to design a crazy spokeless bike .
It 's not the first spokeless bike we 've seen , but it looks a lot more like a real bike than past models .

Only the back wheel is spokeless , but that 's just because they only had a limited amount of time and money to build this .
It would be pretty simple to do what they did to the back wheel to the front wheel .
As for how it works :
It 's a single speed setup .
We used two cranks and two bottom brackets in the front to gear up the ratio .
It goes from ( IIRC ) 53 to a 13 , which is connected to the second crank and another 53 which connects to the rear hub .
The rear hub is just a normal ratcheting rear hub that we mated to our belt pulley .
Not sure if all these bike terms are right , but that 's the general idea .
The front wheel would be almost exactly the same as the rear wheel except that it could be a little lighter .
Some of the aluminum can be shaved off since there 's no powertrain to connect to .

Twenty billion pieces of DNA in 100 small fish have opened the eyes of biologists studying evolution .
After combining new technologies , researchers now know many of the genomic regions that allowed an ocean - dwelling fish to adapt to fresh water in several independently evolved populations .
The discovery -- made possible in a project funded by the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health -- involved threespine stickleback fish taken from three land - locked freshwater Alaskan lakes and two ocean populations .
The work appears in the Feb. 26 issue of PLoS Genetics , an open - access online publication of the Public Library of Science .
A six - member UO team across two separate labs combined Illumina massively parallel sequencing with a specialized technology that they developed .
They then compared the genomes of 20 fish each from Alaska 's Bear Paw , Boot and Mud lakes , and 20 each from saltwater populations in Rabbit Slough and Resurrection Bay .
All sites are located along Alaska 's south - central coast .
Researchers found that all of the fish were closely related in most of their genomes , but with differences in very specific regions .
Each fish contains 500 million base pairs of DNA .
Researchers were surprised to find that across the independently derived populations very similar regions were identified , indicating that the same genes may be evolving when stickleback adaptation is repeated in different lakes .
Researchers now are focusing efforts to understand which specific genes are involved in such adaptation .
The approach taken in the study , said William A. Cresko , professor of biology and member of the UO 's Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology , could be applied to other organisms .
" It would be fascinating to determine whether similar results would be found in studies of ocean - dwelling sockeye salmon and their freshwater counterparts the Kokanee , for example , " he said .
The findings , presented at professional conferences , he added , already are fueling research efforts in a variety of other organisms around the world .
Sticklebacks are a small silver - colored fish , barely two inches in length ; they are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere in both oceans and freshwater .

" Populations of freshwater stickleback arise when new habitats open up and are colonized , " Cresko said .
" Alaska has a lot of lakes that have been around only about 10,000 years , formed after glaciers receded .
Instead of dying out when they were cut off from saltwater , they evolved very rapidly and in a lot of ways , such as in their bones and armor , the shapes of their jaws , as well as coloration and behavior .
When one population no longer recognizes and wo n't mate with another population , they effectively become a new species , so some of the regions we are identifying may be important for speciation , too . "
Sticklebacks have long been a focus for behavioral biologists because of their complex courtship rituals .
Only recently have they come under genetic and genomic scrutiny , and the UO has been at the forefront of such studies .
Until recently , efforts focused on small numbers of traits , tracking just a few genes at a time .
In a 2006 talk on campus , Cresko outlined the challenges of the research , saying that faster , cheaper DNA - analyzing tools were needed to scan entire genomes .
In the audience was Eric Johnson of the UO 's Institute of Molecular Biology .
For the next three years , Cresko and Johnson worked to develop a technique they called Restriction - site Associated DNA -- the development of which helped spawned Floragenex , a UO technology spinoff company -- and subsequently combined it with a genomic revolution called Next Generation Sequencing using a genome - analyzer tool known as Illumina 's GA2 sequencer .
" We combined two technologies to develop sequence RAD ( restricted - site associated DNA ) tags , " Cresko said .
" With this , we can quickly look across entire genomes and ask new questions :
Can we find genomic regions that were altered due to natural selection ?
And then compare this with a completely evolved population ?
How many regions are the same , how many are different ? "
Previous research using RAD markers had focused on finding differences between samples grown in labs , Johnson said , " but many interesting biological questions can't be assayed in a lab , and many species of animals cannot be reared in a lab . "
" Bill 's lab showed that RAD markers can detect differences between natural populations , and his lab developed new analytical tools to understand the data , " Johnson said .
" It is a great fit for RAD markers , because they sample a genome at a higher density than other marker systems and provide DNA sequence data at a low error rate -- two crucial aspects for this kind of study . "

Once the technology was ready , it took Cresko's team about six months to run the DNA analyses .
Now that the technique is operating smoothly , the same experiments might be done in several weeks , he said .
Under a new NSF - funded project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , Cresko and Frank von Hippel , a University of Alaska biologist , are looking closely at another set of stickleback populations .
They are working on lakes formed when the 1964 Alaska earthquake lifted several offshore islands 10 meters ( 32.8 feet ) in four minutes .
" We hope to learn something about these fish while they are still evolving , literally , from an ocean population to a freshwater one , " Cresko said .
Under the ARRA grant , Cresko received $ 364,756 , while von Hippel got $ 306,901 to support this research .
Co-authors of the PLoS paper with Cresko and Johnson are Paul A. Hohenlohe and Susan Bassham , postdoctoral researchers in Cresko's lab , Paul Etter , a postdoctoral researcher in Johnson 's lab , and Nicholas Stiffer of the UO 's genomics core facility .
A friend clued me in on a series of lectures that George Soros gave on his theory of reflexivity last October at the Open Society Institute .
I was surprised by how much it resonated with other critiques I ’ve read about neoclassical economics , albeit from deeper - than - usual philosophical underpinnings .
Here are some excerpts from this first lecture , which introduces the theory :
I can state the core idea in two relatively simple propositions .
One is that in situations that have thinking participants , the participants ’ view of the world is always partial and distorted .
That is the principle of fallibility .
The other is that these distorted views can influence the situation to which they relate because false views lead to inappropriate actions .
That is the principle of reflexivity .
For instance , treating drug addicts as criminals creates criminal behavior .
It misconstrues the problem and interferes with the proper treatment of addicts .
As another example , declaring that government is bad tends to make for bad government .
Both fallibility and reflexivity are sheer common sense .
So when my critics say that I am merely stating the obvious , they are right - but only up to a point .
What makes my propositions interesting is that their significance has not been generally appreciated .
The concept of reflexivity , in particular , has been studiously avoided and even denied by economic theory …
Economic theory is built on the concept of equilibrium , and that concept is in direct contradiction with the concept of reflexivity …
The concept of reflexivity needs a little more explication .
It applies exclusively to situations that have thinking participants .
The participants ’ thinking serves two functions .
One is to understand the world in which we live ; I call this the cognitive function .
The other is to change the situation to our advantage .
I call this the participating or manipulative function .
The two functions connect thinking and reality in opposite directions …
In the real world , the participants ’ thinking finds expression not only in statements but also , of course , in various forms of action and behavior .
That makes reflexivity a very broad phenomenon that typically takes the form of feedback loops .
The participants ’ views influence the course of events , and the course of events influences the participants ’ views .
The influence is continuous and circular ; that is what turns it into a feedback loop .
Reflexive feedback loops have not been rigorously analyzed and when I originally encountered them and tried to analyze them …
Feedback loops can be either negative or positive …
According to Popper , scientific laws are hypothetical in character ; they cannot be verified , but they can be falsified by testing .
The key to the success of scientific method is that it can test generalizations of universal validity with the help of singular observations …
These difficulties do not preclude social scientists from producing worthwhile generalizations , but they are unlikely to meet the requirements of Popper ’s scheme , nor can they match the predictive power of the laws of physics .
Social scientists have found this conclusion hard to accept .
Economists in particular suffer from what Sigmund Freud might call “ physics envy . ”
There have been many attempts to eliminate the difficulties connected with the human uncertainty principle by inventing or postulating some kind of fixed relationship between the participants ’ thinking and the actual state of affairs .
Karl Marx asserted that the ideological superstructure was determined by the material conditions of production and Freud maintained that people ’s behavior was determined by drives and complexes of which they were not even conscious .
Both claimed scientific status for their theories although , as Popper pointed out , they can not be falsified by testing .
But by far the most impressive attempt has been mounted by economic theory .
It started out by assuming perfect knowledge and when that assumption turned out to be untenable it went through ever increasing contortions to maintain the fiction of rational behavior …
I contend that situations that have thinking participants have a different structure from natural phenomena .
The difference lies in the role of thinking .
In natural phenomena thinking plays no causal role and serves only a cognitive function .
In human affairs thinking is part of the subject matter and serves both a cognitive and a manipulative function …
I had to abandon my reservations and recognize a dichotomy between the natural and social sciences because the social sciences encounter a second difficulty from which the natural sciences are exempt .
And that is that social theories are reflexive .
Heisenberg ’s discovery of the uncertainty principle did not alter the behavior of quantum particles one iota , but social theories , whether Marxism , market fundamentalism or the theory of reflexivity , can affect the subject matter to which it refers …
I propose a simple remedy : recognize a dichotomy between the natural and social sciences .
This will ensure that social theories will be judged on their merits and not by a false analogy with natural science .
I propose this as a convention for the protection of scientific method , not as a demotion or devaluation of social science .
The convention sets no limits on what social science may be able to accomplish .
On the contrary , by liberating social science from the slavish imitation of natural science and protecting it from being judged by the wrong standards , it should open up new vistas .
It is in this spirit that I shall put forward my interpretation of financial markets tomorrow .

Featured Sporting Event : 7th Sydney Tower Stair Challenge – August 24th 2016
We congratulate Mark Bourne for being the winner of this event in a time of 7 minutes 17 seconds to complete the 309 m , 1504 step , 88 story climb .
The first woman home in 5th place overall was Suzy Walsham in a time of 8.39 seconds .
this was Suzy ’s second win in a row in the woman ’s section .
There were 722 finishers of the 840 starters in this years race .
the average time was 20.47 minutes .
The event is on the Tower Running World Cup circuit for the elite runners with the remainder of the field made up of individuals and teams with a lot running for charity .
Peter James who is more well known for spending time on Bondi Beach of after pounding the Sydney streets with his rubbish removal round working for the rubbish removal Sydney contractor with the next most energetic efforts attending surf school lessons , loved the challenge and as grueling as it was cant wait to better his time next year !.
Luke Alpes who is one of Sydney ’s top personal trainers with several Sydney Gyms enjoyed the challenge of coaching several other Sydney personal trainers to get ready for the event .
Runners for the event , pushed him to join them and found the tight turning shaft of the tower an effort to conquer as you cannot really train for that anywhere by Center Point .
He acknowledged the charitable sponsorship and support of Roof Repairs Sydney along with Pest Control Sydney , SEO Sydney and Personal Injury Lawyers Sydney who ’s principals or senior management have been stair racers themselves and made it possible for numerous out of state runners to make the event .

In The Media : Press Release
Sports Management International Launch Australasian Expansion
Sports Management International has announced the expansion of their international network with the intended opening of a Sydney office in October 2018 .
The company has seen significant growth in athletes from the continent making significant inroads in the northern hemisphere .
The market research showed that there was many top level athletes simply not taking advantage of the opportunities due to a lack of an international agency active in the region .
Mr John Shoult , spokesman for International Sports Management said , “ We are excited at the opportunities in the region .
Top athletes from Australian and New Zealand can use our international network to access introductions that they are finding currently almost impossible to achieve . ”
Many eye brows have been raised in 2016 with the success of athletes from Australasia .
New Zealand professional basketball player Steven Adams for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association .
After playing college basketball for Pittsburgh , he was labelled a top international prospect for the NBA .
Australian NRL star Jarryd Hayne was also catapulted into the American sports media ’s attention with his switch to NFL with the San Francisco Forty Niners .
These are just two of the many from the region that have gained attention in 2016 .
Sports Management International has worked extensively with local sports star agents and have seen the opportunity to develop and formalise these relationships with the new Brisbane & Sydney satellite offices .
Mr Shoult siad , “ The opportunities are enormous and typified by the over night success for Adams and Hayne .
We have seen an extraordinary array of other sports stars in the region that we know will make it in the Australian professional sports arena and given they see this as a desire in their sporting career , we want to assist them in this journey . ”
Sports Management International has a special arrangement with Australian Immigration Agency that have office locations and recognised Migration Agent Melbourne , Brisbane and Perth to assist athletes with all immigration matters and forex brokers to assist with currency & CFD Brokers transfers ..

Things to Know Before You Travel to Australia
Besides deciding the cities you ’ll visit and the sights you wish to see , you are bound to discover that there are numerous other essential components of planning the itinerary before you travel to Australia .
It is advisable that you do a bit of research so that you know what to expect before you embark on your travels .
This guide makes it easier for you to discover some of the most important things you should know before you book your flight to Australia .
Continue reading to find out more .
You ’ll Actually Need A Visa To Travel To Australia – The Australian Visa Types :
If you plan to travel as a tourist to Australia , then you will certainly be required to have a travel visa .
However , there is an exception to this for New Zealand citizens .
The citizens of Canada , the US , Japan , Hong Kong , Brunei , Malaysia , South Korea , and Singapore can apply for the ETA online , which costs 20 AUD or US$ 18.50 .
Upon completion of the application process and no problems arise , you can expect to get a confirmation via email in a fairly quick manner ( normally happens in a matter of a few days ) and there is absolutely no need to get a printout .
When you get to the airport , the authorities will simply look you up in the systems with the details of your passport .
With an ETA , you get a maximum of three months of travel time in Australia in a one - year period .
Note that it does n’t allow you as a traveler to work .
If you do not come from any of the above - aforementioned countries , you should not apply for the ETA online .
The country of origin determines how you apply for your tourist visa , the cost , and the specific restrictions that apply .
For more relevant information on visa applications , you can read more about The Different Types of Australian Visas .
The citizens of the eligible countries can complete a simple online visa application process and obtain either an eVisitor or ETA visa to travel to Australia .
Note that both these visa types allow the eligible citizens to go to Australia numerous times within a period of one year , with a 90 - day maximum stay period with every entry made to the country .
With the aforementioned visa types , you can travel to the country , for business , to visit family and friends , on vacation , or even as part of a cruise .
Here are is a summary of some of the types of visa for Australia you need to apply for prior to travel , depending on your country of origin :
ESTA – This Esta visa is meant for passport holders coming from countries including Canada , Brunei , Japan , South Korea , Singapore , Malaysia , and the US .
EVisitor – The eVisitor is valid for a fixed 90 - day consecutive stay within a one - year period .
It is applicable for transit , business , and tourism .
If you are a passport holder from any of the European member states , then you need this .
It also applies to citizens from Iceland , Andorra , Monaco , San Marino , Liechtenstein , Vatican City , and Switzerland .
Visitor Visa –
The visitor visa is supposed to be obtained by citizens from any Australian Embassy for tourism or business purposes .
If you plan to visit Australia to see family and friends , go on a cruise trip , or visit as a tourist , then you are granted a stay period of 3 - 12 months .
The Best Time to Travel to Australia
The most ideal time of the year to travel to this beautiful country largely depends on the region you ’re going to .
It is worth noting that Australia is located in the Southern portion of the hemisphere , meaning the seasons are the complete opposite of what you would experience in the Northern part of the hemisphere .
You should ideally travel to the South of Australia in the months of January , February , and December .
These are the months when this part of the country ( Melbourne and Sydney ) typically experience warm summer weather .
Since many tourists come to this region in the high season , it is more crowded and your overall cost of the trip is slightly more .
For this reason , you might want to consider visiting in March , April , October , or November , especially if you do not want crowds .
What ’s more , you also get the opportunity to save money while enjoying the pleasant temperatures .
In the northern tropics , summers are very humid and hot .
Since this area is mostly wet during this season , it can be quite uncomfortable and you honestly do n’t want to plan a visit in this period .
Therefore , if you plan to visit the Northern parts of Queensland , you might want to consider visiting in winter ( June , July , or August ) .
Winter is yet another good season to visit these hot regions including Uluru .
If you would like to visit the cities in the South and the Northern tropics , you can comfortably do so in a single trip in the shoulder months .
What is Prohibited in Australia ?
Australia is quite strict when it comes to what you can bring in and certain items are prohibited .
Food items that include vegetables and fruits , eggs and meat , are not permitted into the country .
Visitors are also not permitted to bring in seeds , feathers , skins , and plants .
The laws of the country also prohibit firearms , weapons , protected wildlife , and drugs .
Some medications that are meant for personal use are subjected to regulatory controls .
For this reason , it is a good idea to carry a letter written by your doctor indicating the specific medicines you ’re taking , including your medical conditions .
The tourism website for Australia only states that all medications are supposed to be declared , while the customs site states that visitors should only declare medications that are subject to dependence or abuse .
Are Vaccines Necessary Before Traveling to Australia ?
You do not need to get any vaccines prior to traveling to the country , but if you come from a country with cases of yellow fever infections , then you will be expected to provide proof that you ’ve gotten a vaccination against yellow fever .
The same applies if you recently visited yellow fever infected country within the last six days of arriving in Australia .
It is our hope that the tips presented above will come in handy as you prepare a comprehensive itinerary for your trip to Australia .
We are certain that you ’ll enjoy your trip to this gorgeous country !

Everything you needed to know if you are a lover of travel , it ’s as simple as that .
The writers , considered by some as the best world travel bloggers share their and other people ’s experiences .
Traveling is described on Trip.com Wikipedia page as a wonderful hobby carried out by millions of people across the globe every day .
Here ’s why traveling is important to them .
The ability to move around from one place to the other place is the main virtue one can ever have .
All humans and animals have been secured with this ability , but humans are always a step forward .
We human beings , have an extraordinary virtue of seeing , experiencing and learning from it , and this is exactly what makes our traveling more satisfying and enriching .
At the turn of the 18th Century , a person who went on a long - distance journey returned home after many years .
Till their return , his or her family had either no or very little information regarding his situation and well - being .
In some cases , a person would never return .
Despite of this people travelled ; not always because they needed to , but many because they loved to .
And why not ?
Traveling not only takes us to distant lands and expands our horizons and the life of various people , but this also removes the dullness of our lives .

Alliance Climate Control – Air Conditioning Sydney residents Trust : Proud Sponsors of Puck Prospectus Australia
Democrats may be spending themselves ( and the country ) into oblivion , but some Republicans are not doing much better .
The fiscal irresponsibility is pervasive , appearing not only in the party ’s national leadership , but also among state legislators .
Oh , sure .
Republicans have put up a good front recently , objecting strenuously to the flood of spending by Democratic lawmakers .
Some of their horror is doubtless genuine .
Spending during Obama / Pelosi / Reid ’s ( as yet short ) reign has increased at unprecedented levels .
The nation is facing record spending and deficits — and OPR have only just begun .
But it is easy for Republicans to take a purely partisan stance against Democratic spending .
If they want to regain the trust of voters , they must do more .
They must demonstrate their ability ( and willingness ) to do better .
They must not only reverse recent Democratic excesses , but they must also reverse their own recent excesses .
Unfortunately , it does not seem that many in the current Republican leadership have the will to take such a stand .
Consider the fact that Republican National Chairman Michael Steele has spent twice as much as his predecessors , as recently reported by Politico .
It would be one thing if he were spending all that money on campaign ads and get - out - the - vote efforts .
But he ’s not .
He ’s paying for limousines , world - class caterers , private airplanes — even an annual RNC meeting in Hawaii .
The exodus of Republican donors during his tenure emphasizes the recklessness of his spending — and the irresponsibility of anyone in Republican leadership who is not taking action against such lack of discipline .
Why should voters trust leaders like Steele with federal tax dollars when these leaders are so thoughtless with private donations ?
But the problem does not stop with a few spendthrift national leaders .
This fiscal irresponsibility extends even to conservative states like Texas .
Naturally , the election year has prompted some Republican officials to make big , splashy , headline - grabbing displays of fiscal conservatism .
Well , terrific , but these same officials also made many terrible , fiscally irresponsible decisions earlier , during non-election years .
Voters are thus being asked to take a leap of faith :
Trust that the conservative , election - year version of these officials remain .
Hope that the big government , spendthrift version of these officials will not return after the election .
In general , Texas has received much praise for being fiscally conservative , but let ’s face it .
Texas is being graded on a curve against states like California , New York , and New Jersey .
Without the curve , Texas would not be earning an “ A ” from conservative economists .
Maybe it would get a “ C. ” Texas legislators have changed the tax code in irresponsible ways .
Moreover , state spending has exploded .
As this chart shows , more than $ 320 billion in taxpayer funds could have ( and should have ) been saved if Texas had spent its dollars more responsibly in the years since 1990 .
As the chart also shows , the problem has been getting worse in recent years — despite the fact that allegedly conservative Republicans are in charge of state government .
Many Republican lawmakers started out with good intentions .
They meant to be small government .
Maybe they were for a while .
But too many have become jaded by too many years in Washington or Austin .
They are not as effective as they once were .
And they certainly have not proven that they can reverse the irresponsible spending spree , started by Republicans during the George W. Bush years and rashly escalated during Barack Obama ’s administration .
Some discontent voters and media commentators have noted the broken state of both political parties and have advocated a third party solution .
An official Tea Party has some appeal , especially to fiscal conservatives , but its advocates should not forget the typical outcome of third party races , at least at the presidential level .
Historically speaking , such attempts to circumvent the two - party system have been unsuccessful .
The presidential election of 1912 demonstrates the difficulties that even a very popular third party candidate will face .
The election that year was a three - way race among incumbent William H. Taft ( Republican Party ) , Woodrow Wilson ( Democrat Party ) , and former President Teddy Roosevelt ( Bull Moose Party ) .
The third - party candidate , Roosevelt , was immensely popular and soundly defeated Taft at the polls .
But his entry into the campaign badly split the Republican vote .
Neither man could overtake Wilson .
Although Roosevelt and Taft earned a combined 7.6 million popular votes to Wilson ’s 6.2 million popular votes , they won only a combined 96 electoral votes .
Wilson won the White House in an electoral landslide ( 435 electoral votes ) .
The strength of America ’s two - party system can be frustrating , but for reasons this author has discussed elsewhere , it also provides the country with many advantages that should not be dismissed too quickly .
For both philosophical and practical reasons , tea party activists should think twice before they attempt a “ fix ” that includes abandoning the two major political parties in favor of a new party .
They would probably serve their cause best by working within the existing parties .
The weaknesses of the Democratic Party have been the subject of much commentary lately , but the Republican Party is equally in need of revitalization .
Both parties need young , fresh new leaders to take our nation forward .
There are definite exceptions , but most incumbents have been in elected office for too long .
They have lost perspective .
They do not remember what it is like to live under the laws and taxes that they have enacted .
With primaries quickly approaching , it is time to send them a reminder .
Wii revival shaping up splendidly
When we first reported on the NBA Jam Wii revival , we were a little worried about the game 's graphics .
Though it was said they'd be " true to the original " , PR people say a lot of things , so we were skeptical at hearing about the " true - to - life body types , updated physics , and visible player emotion . "
Our fears are gone now with the release of the debut trailer which showcases a true Jam title .
Legacy video has been removed
As you can see , it looks pretty much exactly like the old stuff , with the graphics updated just as much as needed .
The announcer sounds like he might even be the same dude , too !
Now just to secure 2 Unlimited 's " Get Ready For This " as the theme again .
NBA Jam will be released on the Wii sometime this year .
PVP changed a lot since 1.8 or so it seems and it affected Minecraft players that play singleplayer as well as Minecraft players that play Minecraft servers .
In fact if you ’re playing Minecraft servers you ’ve probably noticed that even more .
Why ?
Mainly because of things like hit delay .
In Minecraft 1.8 you could fight players with no delay , just hit them as fast as you can , while in later versions of Minecraft they ’ve added some delays , shields and other things .
The main issue with current PVP in Minecraft for me are those delays , mainly because I ’m not used of it and because I hate waiting and looking at mobs while they ’re attacking me .
It ’s really not much fun …
Looking at Minecraft news and updates things are about to change with Minecraft 1.17 and it ’s about time .
PVP in Minecraft 1.9 up to 1.16 is just too slow and whenever you ’re playing on Minecraft servers against players or just fighting mobs , even in single player it ’s just too slow and painful .
But I guess for now all we can do is wait for Minecraft 1.17 and hope it will fix those issues .
According to a new study by The Kinsey Institute for Higher Sexication , people do n't agree on what the term " had sex " means .
Well , class , grab a seat , because we listened to Salt N' Pepa and we 're gonna talk about sex !
According to the study , 95 percent of people agree that when a penis goes into a vagina then " sex " — that thing that we have spent so much much , waged so many wars , and sweated so many hours in the gym to attain — has occurred .
However , 11 percent of people say that if there was no ejaculation , then there was no " sex . "
Also 30 percent of people think oral sex is not " sex " and 20 percent believe that anal sex is not " sex " even though they both have " sex " in the title .
That 's like saying there 's no " doom " in The Temple of Doom .
It also means that about the quarter of the population think that all gay men and lesbians are virgins .
The study concludes that there is a disagreement about what constitutes " having sex . "
We hate confusion , so we are going to break it down for you : " Having sex " means any consensual behavior between two or more individuals involving genital contact and bodily penetration .
That means oral sex , anal sex , and vaginal sex are all " sex . "
Sorry , guys on the DL , even if you have anal sex ( top or bottom ) with guys means you still " have sex " with men .
It is also " sex " if no orgasm or ejaculation occurs .
If you put a penis ( or vagina ) in your mouth in a coat room for 30 seconds , you had " sex " with that person .
It was probably short and unfulfilled for both parties , yes , but it was still sex .
" Sex " also includes any activity that happens in the presence of prophylactics .
Just because you wore a condom , does not mean you did n't bang that fat chick who lived in the room next to yours sophomore year .
This leaves some leeway for hand jobs , heavy petting , and general rubbing .
However , if any of these behaviors occurred and the subject of sex is brought up , they must be acknowledged .
It 's like being charged with a felony but not convicted .
So if you jerked a guy off in a New Jersey truck stop and someone asks , " Did you have sex today ? "
You can say , " No , " but you must add , " But I did jerk someone off . "
Also , if you reached into a girl 's pants and played around a bit while making out before being interrupted by your screaming wife who yells , " Are you having sex with her ? " you can say , " No ! " but you must add , " I was just playing around in her pants a bit . "
That , everyone , is the definition of sex .
It 's kind of like pornography , it 's hard to define , but we know it when we see it .
The rest of it is just semantics so we can make ourselves not feel like dirty sluts or get away with cheating on a significant other .
Really only lawyers and eight - year - olds play semantics and only religious prudes are ashamed of sex .
And no one likes any of those .
Credit counseling
The most popular debt management option is credit counseling ( " consumer credit counseling " ) .
Applying this debt consolidation approach , a credit counselor will set you up in a debt management plan ( " DMP " ) .
The aim of the plan is to consolidate your high interest debts into a combined monthly payment based on a reduction of the debt interest rate .
In turn , you will remit a payment to the credit counselor , who will distribute the interest - reduced payments to each creditor .
Additionally , your enrolled credit accounts must be closed and the open accounts must be restricted for future charges .
The credit counseling approach is probably not a good option if you suffered a major loss of income and have excessive high - interest debt .
According to a Consumer Reports survey , credit counseling debt management plans have a 21 % completion rate .
A reason addressed is their unbearable monthly payments , which generally compare to or are greater than the minimum payments that a debtor previously struggling to make .
Possibly the top reason for their low completion rate is the mere interest rate reduction , which is often ineffective for a consumer with a major financial challenge .
Some critics have argued that credit counselors are debt collectors primarily serving the interests of creditors and not consumers .
Most of their compensation comes from creditors that participate in debt management plans .
Each year , credit counselors collect approximately $ 5 BILLION from consumers on behalf of creditors that pay them a fee known as " fair share . "
The fee ranges between 7 - 15 % for every dollar collected from a consumer by a credit counselor .
Although the " enrollment " in a debt management plan has no effect on an actual credit score , it is generally " negatively " reported to the credit bureaus .
The credit report credit item may indicate a consumer participates in a " Debt Management Hardship Plan . "
Because of this red flag , many lenders suspect that a consumer is unfit to manage his finances .
As a result , consumers are oftentimes denied credit .
Additionally , some creditors , such as American Express , do not participate in debt management plans .
The plans also do not accept business debt .
Note : 2 out of 10 people complete a DMP and the graduates spend 4 to 6 years paying back 1 ½ to 3 times their original debts .
You can also be cancelled from a debt management plan if you miss a monthly payment , which would reset your debts to their original interest rates and leave you unprotected from creditors .

ED #118 : Spyware In Microsoft Windows 7
We just learned some troubling news about the recently - released anti-hack update for Windows 7 as well as the upcoming Microsoft Windows 7 Service Pack 1 .
From what we understand , this could also involve new updates for Windows Vista and Windows XP .
First of all , the new Windows 7 anti-hack update does more than just scan for anti-activation exploits .
It also performs a simple heuristic - based scan of all storage media ( hard disk drives , flash drives , etc. ) in the system to detect potential " terrorism - related " materials .
From the documents we have seen , this is how it works :
The anti-hack update will scan for anti-activation exploits , as it's meant to do .
However , it will remain in the background even after the computer has been verified to be using a genuine copy of Windows 7 .
The update waits until the computer is " locked " by the user , or idle ( no key presses or mouse movements ) for at least 15 minutes .
It then initiates a heuristic - based scan of all storage media , pausing whenever interrupted by the user unlocking the computer , or activity like a key press or mouse movement .
If potential " terrorism - related " materials are found , the update transmits an encrypted alert including details on the materials found as well as system information , user details , and of course , the IP address .
If there is no Internet connectivity , the update will store the information and send it out once connectivity is re-established .
According to the document , the heuristic - based scan is a very simple one and is only intended to flag potential computers used by terrorists and collect information for further processing .
It is not stated where the alerts ultimately go to , but they are most likely going to the NSA .
It is also not stated whether the update will only scan the drives once , or do it on a regular basis .
For legal reasons , Microsoft has intentionally made this update optional , which is why it is not automatically selected when you check for new updates .
By selecting the update , you would have agreed in principle to allow Microsoft to scan your computer .
We highly recommend that you do NOT to install this update , even if you have a genuine Windows 7 licence .
To learn more about this update , take a look at our article , Microsoft Silently Rolls Out Anti-Hack Update For Windows 7 .
As far as we know , there is no way to know if the update has sent out , or is sending out , information on your computer .
To be safe , just do n't install the update .
Unfortunately , we suspect that it is just a matter of time before your computer gets scanned .

Today Good Morning America interviewed Cynthia Shackelford , who won $ 9 million in a lawsuit against her husband 's mistress last week .
When asked what she 'd like to tell cheating spouses , Shackelford puts all the blame on other women :
My main message is to all those women out there who might have their eyes on some guy that is married to not come between anybody ...
Lay off ...
It 's not good to go in there .
It hurts the children .
My children are devastated .
I 'm devastated .

Hear that ladies ?
Stop targeting happily married men , drugging them , and forcing them to have sex with you .
Think of the children !
But wait — is it possible mistress Anne Lundquist is n't the only one to blame for Shackelford 's divorce ?
A jury in North Carolina , one of only seven states to allow " alienation of affection " lawsuits , certainly thinks she 's at fault , but Allan Shackelford posted a statement ( in the third person , no less ! ) on the Greensboro News & Record website .
Note the twist at the end !
Allan Shackelford and Cynthia Shackelford had significant problems in their marriage for years , including three rounds of marital counseling that failed .
Allan Shackelford had been involved in numerous affairs going back to the first two years of their marriage .
Cynthia Shackelford told Allan Shackelford that she wanted to divorce him at least two years before he began a relationship with Anne Lundquist .
Their marriage did not break - up because of Anne Lundquist .
It ended because of the problems that Allan Shackelford and Cynthia Shackelford created for themselves .
But , Cynthia Shackelford was never prepared to look in the mirror and take responsibility for her own mistakes .
I know , because I am Allan Shackelford .

When asked about her husband 's statement , Shackelford said she , " Had absolutely no knowledge of any of these other affairs .
We had a great marriage .
He was very affectionate .
We have two wonderful children .
I mean , this is all a shock to me . "
What happened to Shackelford is horrible , and she probably is in shock and is n't thinking clearly .
But just because she thinks the marriage was " great " does n't make it so — it just means her husband was a really good liar .
Sleeping with a man you know is married is a shitty thing to do , but someone needs to explain to Shackelford that her husband , not his mistress , is the one who broke a vow to be faithful .

Spurned Spouse Gets Her Due [ Greensboro News - Record ]
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue warned the U.S. faces a double - dip recession because of the taxes and regulations under consideration by the Democratic Congress and President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE .
“ Congress , the administration and states must recognize that our weak economy simply could not sustain all the new taxes , regulations and mandates now under consideration .
It ’s a sure - fire recipe for a double - dip recession , or worse , ” Donohue said in a speech providing the Chamber 's outlook for 2010 .

Donohue said the lawmakers should not let former President George W. Bush 's tax cuts expire at the end of year and lambasted Democratic efforts on healthcare and financial regulatory reform as well as climate change .
If the tax cuts are allowed to expire , “ we will likely end up with even bigger deficits and greater economic misery , ” Donohue said .
Many tax lobbyists expect Congress to extend the cuts for people with lower tax rates , but to allow higher rates to be reimposed on those in the top bracket .
He also faulted Obama and Democratic lawmakers for not doing more to create jobs .
Donohue criticized a separate tax on banks floated by the administration on Monday , and said that the rationale for any tax increases would be increased spending , not lowering huge budget deficits exacerbated by the recession .
“ We are talking about a massive tax increase in a very weak economy — a tax increase whose clearly intended purpose is not to reduce the deficit , but to pay for more spending , ” he said .
He also promised the Chamber would be more involved in the 2010 midterm election than it has been in any other before , and will hold accountable lawmakers who vote against the group 's priorities .
Donohue ’s speech follows a year in which the nation ’s leading business lobbying group consistently butted heads with the Democratic White House , particularly on Obama ’s keystone issues of healthcare and climate change .
The Chamber stumbled at times .
Several high - profile members , including Apple , left the Chamber because of the group ’s opposition to Obama ’s pursuit of climate change legislation .
Nike quit the Chamber ’s board of directors over the same issue , publicly complaining that the business group was not representing all of its members on the issue .
In October , pranksters pretending to be Chamber officials held a fake press conference announcing the group had shifted its stance on climate change .
Chamber officials trekked to the National Press Club after a wire service issued an incorrect story based on a fake news release put out by a group known as The Yes Men .
On healthcare , Donohue said the legislation under consideration by Congress would do nothing to rein in costs and was a prescription for “ fiscal insolvency and an eventual government takeover of American healthcare . ”
He said the House climate bill would raise energy costs and kill jobs .
Donohue also blasted the administration ’s policies on trade , hitting it for not sending to Congress pending deals negotiated by the Bush administration with South Korea , Colombia and Panama .
“ We need a bold and aggressive trade policy , something we do n’t have today , ” he said .
The Chamber is predicting the economy will grow at a rate of about 3 percent in 2010 .
The business lobby has set out a goal of creating 20 million new jobs over the next 10 years .

The Corrie family want a fuller account of Rachel 's death A court case brought by the family of Rachel Corrie , a US protester killed by an Israeli army bulldozer in 2003 , has begun in Israel .
The civil action against the Israeli defence ministry will decide whether damages should be paid for her death in Gaza at the age of 23 .
Ms Corrie and other activists had been trying to stop the demolition of Palestinian homes .
Her family has maintained that a full investigation was never carried out .
Ms Corrie 's writings - published posthumously - and a play about her life made her a symbol of the international campaign on behalf of Palestinians .
About 20 protesters held signs in her memory outside the court in Haifa , where her family are suing for more than $ 300,000 ( £ 200,000 ) in damages .
" I think that as the truth comes out about Rachel , the truth will not wound Israel , the truth is the start of making us heal .
So I 'm glad to have this day and the start of finding the truth , " said the dead protester 's father , Craig Corrie , outside the court .
Driver ' unaware '
The Israeli army concluded in an investigation in 2003 that its forces were not to blame for Ms Corrie 's death .
It said that on the day she died , bulldozers had been flattening ground in the Rafah refugee camp in an attempt to stop suicide bombers reaching Jewish targets .
Ms Corrie , it went on , was hidden behind an earthwork and the military bulldozer driver was not aware she was there .
The play based on Rachel Corrie 's diaries toured the world The Israeli military added that the activists should not have been in a closed military zone .
Activists present at the time have said she was clearly visible and was looking directly into the cabin of the bulldozer .
Ms Corrie 's family says the order to use bulldozers should never have been given while non-combatants - the peace activists - were in the area .
Mr Corrie told the BBC he believes that the driver of the bulldozer received new orders just before his daughter was killed " something to the effect of not letting the internationals [ peace activists ] stop them " .
He said : " Five minutes later , Rachel was killed .
So with that order apparently something changed and Rachel did n't know the change . "
Ms Corrie 's mother , Cindy , described her daughter as a compassionate person who " opened people 's eyes " to the situation in Gaza .
Diaries kept during her time in the Palestinian territories were later turned into a play - My Name is Rachel Corrie - which has toured all over the world , including the West Bank and Israel .

Seattle , Washington ( CNN ) --
An 18 - year - old fugitive suspected of stealing airplanes eluded police again Thursday despite an active manhunt -- including helicopters and search dogs -- on an island off the coast of Washington state .
At least five local and federal agencies were involved in the hunt for Colton Harris - Moore on Orcas Island , which began at 1:15 a.m. PT ( 4:15 a.m. ET ) , according the San Juan County Sheriff 's Office .
But 15 hours later police were forced to " scale down " the search after finding no trace of their quarry , according to a statement from Sheriff Bill Cumming .
Thursday 's search focused on " a very isolated and very rugged area on the west side of the island where only a few homes are located , " according to a statement from Sheriff Bill Cumming .
In addition to the search dogs and helicopters , FBI agents were in the manhunt .
The statement did not elaborate on what led authorities to the area .
Read about what police say was his latest exploit
Harris - Moore 's alleged exploits have attracted a following on the social - media site Facebook -- with several pages boasting thousands of fans -- and established him as a thorn in the side of local law enforcement officials , who said they are frustrated by their inability to put handcuffs on the teen .
Harris - Moore faces 11 felony charges , including allegations of driving a stolen car , Internet identity thefts and burglaries .
" Keep on running never give up .
Planes , Trains , and automobiles ! " read a message posted Thursday on one of the Facebook sites dedicated to Harris - Moore .
First arrested at 12 on burglary charges , Harris - Moore earned the nickname the " barefoot burglar " for allegedly breaking into vacation homes along the Washington coast without wearing any shoes .
But a string of alleged plane thefts that began in 2008 raised Harris - Moore 's profile , and a December issue of Time magazine dubbed him " America 's Most Wanted Teenage Fugitive . "
Investigators said at least four planes stolen or crashed in Washington state involved an inexperienced pilot who may have walked away from the rough landings by sheer luck .
Harris - Moore has not been charged in any of the plane thefts , but Cumming , the San Juan County sheriff , said he is the main suspect .
Forensic evidence has not linked Harris to the thefts , but Cumming said investigators suspect the teen fugitive is responsible .
" There is the letter of the law , and there is what we believe , " Cumming told CNN in a recent interview .
" We will continue to investigate and search for him in relation to the plane thefts . "
In a theft last month , a plane skirted airspace closed for the Vancouver Winter Olympics , alarming federal authorities on high alert .
The plane landed on Orcas Island , south of the U.S. - Canadian border .
A local market also was ransacked near where the empty plane was found , police said , and the thief left an apparent calling card : outlines of feet drawn on the floor .
" His fans say he 's sticking it to the man , " said Kyle Ater , owner of Orcas Homegrown Market .
" But I am a small independent grocery store owner , I am not Wal - Mart .
I have slept in the store every night since it was robbed .
I just want to go home . "

A combination of toxic chemicals and pathogens are probably to blame for colony collapse disorder in honeybees , according to a study conducted by researchers at Washington State University .
Researchers conducted careful studies to uncover contributors to the disorder , in which seemingly healthy bees simply vanish from a hive , leaving the queen and a handful of newly hatched adults behind .
" One of the first things we looked at was the pesticide levels in the wax of older honeycombs , " researcher Steve Sheppard said .
The researchers acquired used hives from the U.S. Department of Agriculture , finding that they had " fairly high levels of pesticide residue . "
When bees were raised in these hives , they had " significantly reduced longevity , " the researchers said .
Prior research by scientists from Pennsylvania State University found unprecedentedly high levels of two pesticides in every sample of honeycomb or foundation wax tested , as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides .
The pesticides found in the highest concentrations were fluvalinate and coumaphos , used to eradicate the bee pest varroa mites , which have themselves been suggested as a cause of colony collapse .
"
We do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder , but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources , " said Penn State researcher Maryann Frazier .
" Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of [ colony collapse disorder ] .
We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors , possibly including mites , viruses and pesticides .
" The Washington State researchers uncovered another potential cause , which likely interacts with chemicals to contribute to colony collapse : the pathogen Nosema ceranae , which entered the United States around 1997 and has since spread to bee hives across the country .
The pathogen attacks bees ' ability to process food and makes them more susceptible to chemicals and other infections .
" What it basically does is it causes bees to get immune - deficiency disorder , " said beekeeper said Mark Pitcher of Babe 's Honey .
" So it 's actually causing the bees to almost get a version of HIV .

They ’re not as menacing as Burmese pythons proliferating in the Everglades , but giant African snails are targets of the government too .
The invasive mollusks are considered a major plant pest and a potential public health threat because they can spread diseases , including meningitis .
Now federal and state authorities are seeking to prevent the large , slimy , shell - toting snails from reestablishing themselves in Florida .
Once established , agricultural officials said , the mollusks “ can create a giant swath of destruction . ”
“ The idea is that these are prolific breeders , ” said Mark Fagan , spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services .
“ Our primary concern is the potential harm it can do to agricultural crops , as well as [ public ] health concerns . ”
The Florida department , the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are leading the mollusk - prevention effort .
Known as Achatina fulica , the species is one of the world ’s largest land snails .
They can grow to 8 inches long and 4.5 inches in diameter .
It is illegal to import the snails into the United States without a permit .
The snail has not been an issue in Florida for several decades .
In 1966 , a child smuggled three snails into the Miami area as pets .
His grandmother later released them into a garden , and by 1973 , the population had grown to more than 18,000 , officials said .
Over the next decade , officials spent more than $ 1 million to eradicate them .
That effort is considered the only successful giant African snail eradication on record .
Scientists say the snails consume at least 500 kinds of plants , including citrus crops , Fagan said .
They also can damage buildings by consuming plaster , stucco and other materials they need to grow their shells .
They carry parasites and worse .
“ These snails are known to carry meningitis bacteria , so it ’s also a health concern , ” Fagan said .
The snails are identified by seven to nine whorls , or spirals .
They have a brownish shell covering half the length of their bodies .
They live as long as nine years and have female and male reproductive organs .
After mating , each snail can produce 100 to 400 eggs .
Mated adults lay about 1,200 eggs a year .
The snails originate in East Africa .
Officials say they have been introduced into Caribbean islands such as Martinique and Guadeloupe , and they have been detected in Saint Lucia and Barbados .
Fagan said multiple snails were found in February at one property in Hialeah , Fla .
Authorities searched the nearby area , but no other snails turned up , he said .
Last year , state and federal wildlife officials began a concerted effort to prevent the spread of pythons in and around the Everglades because those invasive reptiles prey on native species .
Fagan said it ’s difficult to compare the dangers posed by two species .
“ The snakes pose a completely different threat to nature , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think you can compare the two . ”

Lafayette ’s vicious animal law
What the law says : Lafayette ’s law outlaws vicious animals within city limits .
It describes a vicious animal as one that attacks or bites without being provoked , approaches someone in a terrorizing way or has been trained as a fighting animal .
Fines : Mandatory $ 500 fine first offense .
A second offense carries a minimum $ 750 fine .
Animal ’s fate :
It ’s up to a municipal judge to decide whether the animal must be removed from the city or destroyed , or if it can stay with certain provisions .
LAFAYETTE — Spork , a 10 - year - old miniature Dachshund up on vicious animal charges in Lafayette for biting a veterinarian technician , has not only his owners fighting to save him , but also a Facebook fan club numbering in the thousands .
In August , Spork ’s owners took him to Lafayette ’s Jasper Animal Hospital to have a bad tooth extracted .
Owner Kelly Walker said she was holding the 17 - pound dog in her arms while the technician attached a hospital band , then took out scissors to cut off the excess .
The dog bit the technician in the face when she reached out to take Spork from Walker .
Walker said her dog was simply scared — so scared he defecated on her arm — and in pain , not vicious .
“ He ’s our family pet , our little baby , ” she said . ” I just feel like there ’s a lot of injustice here all the way around . ”
She said what happens to Spork is entirely up to a judge ’s discretion , making euthanization and a lifetime in a kennel both possibilities .
Another concern , she said , is people will be reluctant to seek medical care for their dogs , out of fear that they ’ll end up in the same position .
Vets and other Lafayette dog-related businesses also could lose customers , she said .
“ It ’s just out of hand , ” she said .
Her family has spent about $ 6,000 so far fighting the ticket .
A court hearing is set in April .
The technician , Allyson Stone , lost small pieces of her lips and was treated at Boulder Community Hospital and by a plastic surgeon .
Stone told police that Spork showed no signs he was going to bite , adding that she felt the attack was unprovoked , according to the police report .
She told police she wanted to press charges because she was concerned that Spork would bit his owner or someone else and she wanted to prevent another attack .
Jasper chief veterinarian and founder Donlad Dodge , in a written statement , said the hospital routinely notifies animal control in dog bite cases .
Dodge said that he supported Stone pressing charges because a record is needed when an animal causes serious injury to a person in case of future incidents .
“ Jasper Animal Hospital has not advocated for , or participated in any way , in subsequent decisions by the city of Lafayette to prosecute Spark ’s guardians , ” he said in a statement .
“ We remain very worried about everyone concerned — the dog , his guardians and the injured technician .
We consider this incident a tragedy , and we sincerely wish the best for everyone concerned , Spork in particular . ”
Jennifer Edwards , the lawyer representing the Walkers , said the charges should be dismissed .
“ The case should have never happened , ” she said .
“ Bites are just an assumed risk of a veterinary technician .
It ’s the name of the game . ”
Colorado law excludes those who work with animals in veterinarian offices from pressing charges in animal bite cases .
But Lafayette ’s local laws , which take precedence , include a vicious animal law that does n’t have a similar exclusion .
Lafayette also does n’t allow jury trials in vicious animal cases .
Thousands of people are rallying around Spork .
The “ Save Spork ” Facebook page has drawn more than 9,000 members , many urging people to boycott the Jasper Animal Hospital or the city itself and to send letters to city officials .
Blog posts , mainly in support of Spork , also are proliferating .
In a statement , Lafayette City Administrator Gary Klaphake said city officials can’t influence a court case .
“ We are confident that ( the judge ) will review all the facts of the case based upon the evidence presented in court , decide whether a violation occurred and take appropriate action only if there was a violation , ” Klaphake wrote .
He said the city ’s vicious animal ordinance , which also allows dogs to be impounded in the most serious cases , does n’t mandate euthanization “ other than in extreme circumstances as required by a judge . ”
The Lafayette City Council approved the vicious animal law in 2006 .
The council steered clear of an all - out breed ban , instead taking a broader approach to dealing with aggressive animals .

August 's Top Releases
August 's Top Free Releases
Returning to our monthly Top Release series , we 're excited to unveil Steam 's Top Releases for the month of August .
Many games made their debuts , but this list highlights the 20 that rose to the top of the charts .
Like with previous months , we establish the Top 20 by looking at revenue generated during the two weeks following each game 's release .
We are also highlighting the top 5 free - to - play games , established by the total number of unique players they acquired during launch .
As we watch the Top Release lists fill out over the course of each month , it 's always a fun surprise to see the different types of games players are enjoying .
August saw that variety on a unique level , with an entire spectrum of transportation options finding success .
Whether taking to the skies with Microsoft Flight Simulator , exploring rail networks around the world with Train Sim World® 2 , getting into the driver seat with Project CARS 3 , or ferrying across mystical seas in Spiritfarer® , August brought an unbelievable variety of vehicles .
As the months roll on , we 'll have to keep an eye on what new conveyance options become available on Steam .
We were struck by how many of August 's Top Releases offer some level of Remote Play integration .
The feature , which is available for about half of August 's releases , allows games to be launched from a PC and then streamed and played on a number of supported devices .
It 's not uncommon these days for players to have several different portable tech devices , so it makes sense for developers to give players the freedom to enjoy their games from whatever device is appropriate for the moment .
For some players , this means looting aliens in Risk of Rain 2 with a swipe on the tablet .
For others , a phone might be the preferred device for knocking out friends in Fall Guys .
If you enjoy the convenience of playing from a phone , the uniqueness of interacting with a tablet , or the comfort of sitting in front of the TV , be sure to check the Remote Play Hub , where you 'll find thousands of games supporting Steam Remote Play .
Three of the games on August 's list go a step further by offering Remote Play Together support .
With this feature , Remote Play technology allows friends to connect to each other 's sessions as if they were sitting in the same room .
If you or a friend just purchased this month 's hits , Captain Tsubasa PGA TOUR 2K21 , or Spiritfarer® , make sure to join a session and experience the timeless thrill of sitting together ( virtually ) to play some local multiplayer .
Finally , we 'd like to congratulate and welcome the teams that are making a Top Release list with their first - ever launch on Steam .
Congrats and welcome to DDNet Team https://store.steampowered.com/app/1194840/Frog_Fractions_Game_of_the_Decade_Edition/ , and Wube Software Ltd. --

SATURDAY PM UPDATE : Disney ’s Alice
In Wonderland is a monster hit despite blowing past its budget and bringing back mediocre reviews .
It clearly becomes the biggest 3D bow ever and the best March release ever and the highest grossing movie of 2010 with $ 41 million on Friday and $ 44.3 million on Saturday .
Remember , those higher priced 3D tickets make all the difference .
Even so , the Tim Burton - directed , Johnny Depp- starring fantasy flick had the biggest 3D release of all time .
Of its 3,728 North American locations this weekend , its total domestic 3D count is 2,063 , plus 180 Imax 3D engagements .
That helped the pic post a $ 116.3 M opening weekend with numbers blowing away Avatar ‘s first Fri-Sat - Sun .
IMAX on Friday had the biggest day in their history with $ 4.3 M for Alice .
The IMAX weekend take of $ 11 + M also is a record for the big screen company .
Overseas ,
Alice shot to # 1 almost everywhere after opening day and date in 40 territories beginning Wednesday .
Disney narrowly avoided a boycott overseas when UK and other exhibitors were angered by the studio’s plans to shorten the theatrical - to - DVD window from 16 weeks to just 12 weeks .
( UK Exhibitors End Boycott Of Disney ’s Alice )
As for foreign grosses , Alice debuted to $ 94 million in 40 + markets representing only 60 % of the international marketplace .
That means the worldwide box office was $ 210.3 M .
That ’s only 2nd to Avatar ‘s $ 242 M global bow , but Wonderland ‘s domestic total blew past Avatar‘s .
This would be a huge triumph for Walt Disney Studios except this also is one of those awkward Hollywood situations where a studio cleans house of top executives only to have the new management preside over a hit courtesy of their predecessors .
In this case , Rich Ross et al will benefit from what Dick Cook and Oren Aviv hath wrought .
Everyone knows that Dick had a very special relationship with both Tim and Johnny .
But what ’s really amusing is the way that one of Alice ‘s producers , Joe Roth , is trying to use the film to claw his way back into Hollywood .
I see the former Disney and Fox production chief who failed miserably with his Revolution Studios is up to his old trick of manipulating the media , this time with a tale of how he put together Wonderland singlehandedly .
( Oh , puh-leeze . )
“ Do n’t you think 4 years in the penalty box is long enough ? ” a Roth pal emailed me today .
Not when considering how arrogantly he made so many awful movies .
And not when knowing that Alice blew past its budget .
( Roth admits to $ 150 M , but I hear the real figure is $ 200 M . )
The only other major newcomer this weekend was Overture ’s Brooklyn ’s Finest directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Richard Gere , Don Cheadle and Ethan Hawke opened like most R- rated action films : it had a $ 4.7M Friday and $ 5.5M Saturday for a $ 13.5 M weekend .
Here ’s the Top 10 as of Saturday .
( Numbers will be refined in the morning . )
1. Alice In Wonderland ( Disney ) NEW [ 3,728 Theaters ]
Friday $ 41 M , Saturday $ 44.3 M , Weekend $ 116.3 M , Worldwide $ 210.3 M
2. Brooklyn ’s Finest ( Overture ) NEW [ 1,936 Theaters ]

3. Shutter Island ( Paramount ) Week 3 [ 3,178 Theaters ]
Friday $ 4.0 M , Saturday $ 6.0 M , Weekend $ 13.0 M , Cume $ 95.6 M
4. Cop Out ( Warner Bros ) Week 2 [ 3,150 Theaters ]
Friday $ 2.8 M , Saturday $ 4.0 M , Weekend $ 9.1 M , Cume $ 32.3 M

10 . Dear John ( Sony ) Week 5 [ 2,496 Theaters ]
Friday $ 965 K , Saturday $ 1.3 M , Weekend $ 2.8 M , Estimated Cume $ 76.6 M
7:40 PM : I ’m hearing that Friday ’s North American grosses for Disney ’s 3D Alice In Wonderland are looking like $ 35 + M and maybe even as high as $ 40 M from 3,728 theaters .
This would make it the biggest film of 2010 so far and its aleady the biggest 3D bow ever .
Also opening this weekend is Overture ’s cop drama Brooklyn ’s Finest which could hit $ 5 M today for a possible $ 13 M weekend .
10:55 AM : I just learned that today ’s matinees for Disney ’s Alice In Wonderland are running ahead of Avatar ‘s so far .
FRIDAY AM : First it was $ 90 +M .
Now I ’m hearing from Hollywood that Disney ’s Alice In Wonderland has a real shot at $ 100 million weekend .
" THIS GUY'S BLEEDING LIKE A STUCK PIG !!
SOMEBODY MAKE IT STOP !! "
" ... we , ah ... " we what ?
What do we need ? " ... may need ... " dear God man , what do we need ?
An undertaker and a MOP !
Wait , no , he 's still moving and groaning !
What 's the name of those people who help hurt people ?
Think , Al , THINK ! " ... ah ... emergency surgery ... "
Yes , I had the words " emergency " and a term for something medical !
I am doing good .
Wait , I do n't mean * I* need it , I mean that GUY needs it ... help !
Where to send them , WHERE DO I SEND THE EMERGENCY SURGEONS ??? " ... in the studio . "
SEND HELP TO GUY ON FLOOR IN STUDIO !
* Yes ... I am aware that Hatori is a fictional character
I know you 've seen this video before , and it 's still one of my favorite dark bloopers .
Here 's how I break it down .
First , anyone who knows anything about blades , knives , swords , or steel would know this guy is full of shit right off the bat .
There is no way in hell any decent set of steel blades would be sold for $ 44.95 for three blades and a stand .
I would n't even think the stand would be that decent .
Hell , if IKEA sold a katana stand , it would cost more ( and have a Seuss - like name : " The Jukrapp Sword Stand : $ 79.99 " ) .
Any decent " practice sword " would be made of bamboo or a hardwood .
Why ?
Because they are practice swords not meant to cut or hurt people .
That is why they are practice swords , and not actual ones .
So this guy says how sturdy they are , hitting the table like a damn fool who has never handled a sword of such low caliber before , which causes a metal chunk the size of half the sword to break off and stab him in the abdomen somewhere .
He goes through several stages of realization here .
There 's surprise , then pain , anger , and confusion .
" Ohhh ... that got me good . "
I suspect that 's when he realized the pain was just the beginning , and the ensuing blood flow was rather alarming .
I guess when one takes up home shopping announcer as a job , one does not sign a " fatality " waiver .
" Ya'll right ? " asks his buddy offstage .
Now , having dealt with many a crisis before , I can not fault the man for asking that .
In fact , I guarantee if you have to announce a sudden death of a relative to another relative , their first response is usually , " Really ? " or " No ! " or " You 're kidding ! "
Later , you can't really say , " Why would you ask if I was kidding ?
What the fuck kind of response is THAT ? "
Although from experience , you think of asking this after the 4th or 5th " You 're kidding . "
In this case , the voice asked if he was all right , not because he thought he was , but has a tinge in his voice like he is trying to force the issue with a passive aggressive demeanor .
Next , our salesperson is slinking off camera , bent over behind the display stand , not thinking about how this would be considered a " practice " anything .
I am not sure if he 's slinking from pain , shame , or to spare us the sight of a gushing flood of life - sustaining body fluid into his Land 's End polo .
The best piece of comedy , however , comes from whatever guy rescued his sales presentation .
Like a surprise cherry filling to a dark humor chocolate cake , this strange unlikely witness gets sucked into the viewfinder .
I guess they did n't have a second announcer or salesperson available .
Maybe this happened at 3 am when they thought one guy could handle it alone while the others were on break .
So here comes a guy who is as awkward on camera as he is at dealing with a sudden medical emergency .
I am not sure if he was the cameraman , a director , or some shop assistant .
But he has the kind of flat , stunned face of a veteran WoW junkie trying to explain to the cops that he did n't know the girl he planned to meet at the mall over the Internet was under 18 .
" Folks , right now ... " he starts , and then pauses , while his comrade lies gushing people - juice onto the cheap wood flooring .
Perhaps he has a bit of wisdom to impart upon the shocked viewers .
Maybe he will calm us by saying the man is stunned but doing okay .
The elderly ladies planning on buying this sword set for their adult grandson who said " he likes ninjas " are stunned .
They are waiting on the phone with a credit card in hand , and need to know the nice young man will be okay .
But after his brief introduction to the masses , his wit and quick thinking run dry and all he can think of is what 's going though his mind :
So instead , this goes through his mind , like a cacophony of horror stunting any hope at some smooth , James Bond dialog he desperately craves right now .
Thus we get someone who looks like he has Down 's syndrome in a K - Mart V - neck .
Mother did n't tell him there 'd be days like these .
No finer words spoken than someone caught in mid orgasm jacking off in front of their computer showing clips of Rainbow Brite .
His face , like a deer in headlights or a man just slapped across the face with a huge sloppy wet fish , is adrift .
His thoughts are like those of someone who had just run his car off a cliff : knowing that the slow arc downwards to the ground far below is too painful to contemplate .
For a brief moment , his brain shuts down in a peaceful blank place .
A mental purgatory that is a buffer to the reality of the horror slithering in a growing pool of red off camera like an aborted fetus crying out to its mother .
Sadly , years later , no one will believe Al when he describes this event .
" Al , you tell wonderful stories , " his drinking buddies will say , slapping him twice in the shoulder to state he meant nothing by that comment , but to reassure Al everyone knows he 's full of shit .
I used to work at Chesapeake Knife and Tool .
In 1991 , we sold katanas .
Not nice ones , not like Hatori Hanzo * steel , but $ 169 blades that quite frankly result in this kind of mishap .
My district manager used to love to tell this story from our Baltimore store , and swore it was true , because he was at the store when it happened .
During the Christmas rush , a customer bought one ( " He paid cash , and that 's the important part , " my district manager used to joke ) .
Since it was Christmas , the cashier asked , " shall I wrap this up and hold it in the back so you can complete your shopping ?
"
" No thanks , " the customer said , eying the sword for defects .
" I 'll use it right here .
" And he did .
He ran himself right through , I assume trying to commit what he thought was seppuku according to a book or samurai movie he saw once .
The cashier screamed , customers fled the store , and the customer stood there ... fell to his knees , and according to the district manager , " looked around to see if something else was going to happen .
"
When the paramedics arrived , he was still conscious , kneeling , calm , but confused .
" I thought I was supposed to be dead or something , " he told an EMT .
There was not as much blood as one might have thought from such an act .
The EMTs clipped the sword off at both ends with some kind of cutters , wrapped him up , strapped him to a gurney , and wheeled him away .
He lived .
He somehow missed every major organ in his act of ultimate self - criticism .
Later , he sent us a letter of apology stating his girlfriend had just left him , he was being dramatic , was sorry about any damage he might have caused us , and he was being monitored and taken care of by professionals .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The dollar rose by the most in a month on Thursday amid signs of increasing tensions within Europe over an aid plan for the debt - strapped Greek government .
The dollar also received support from some discussion in the market about the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise the discount rate sooner than previously slated .
The euro declined to $ 1.3620 from $ 1.3735 in North American trade late Wednesday .
The euro slipped 0.9 % versus the Japanese currency to 122.95 yen .
The dollar index DXY , - 0.24 % , which measures the U.S. unit against a trade - weighted basket of six major currencies , rose to 80.228 , up from 79.734 -- the biggest increase in a month .
Still , on Wednesday , the index closed at the lowest level in a month .
The dollar bought 90.30 Japanese yen , little changed from Wednesday .
Recent gains in the U.S. dollar stem from " dealer talk of Fed hike in the discount rate , " said Ashraf Laidi , chief market strategist at CMC Markets , in emailed comments Thursday .
Federal Reserve has not made any announcement Thursday about the discount rate , which is the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed during emergencies .
Fed officials have said before that adjustments in the discount rate are intended to normalize the Fed 's lending facilities and are not an indication of change in monetary policy .
The Federal Reserve has said it wants to get the discount rate , now at 0.75 % , back to its pre-crisis level , which has historically been 1 % above the target fed funds rate , the more closely followed policy measure that affects a wider array of consumer borrowing costs .
The last statement from the Federal Open Market Committee this week signaled policy makers do n't think the economy can tolerate higher rates right now .
It 's unlikely that the Fed would adjust the discount rate without clearly preparing the market for it first , like it did when it first raised the discount rate a month ago , said Win Thin , a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman .
" Because in the current environment and without preparation , a discount rate hike would be potentially be destabilizing , we suspect the Fed will not do it , " Thin said .
Greece , IMF
The dollar also got a boost versus the euro midday after a spokeswoman for the International Monetary Fund said Greece had n't approached the IMF for financing , but the fund remains ready to help if needed , according to Dow Jones Newswires .
" Recent wire headlines noting IMF presence in Greece prompted some initial euro selling , " said strategists at Action Economics .
" Worries related to stress points around the relationship between Greece and Germany and the potential effect on any bailout plan is touching the markets , " said John Stoltzfus , a senior market strategist at Ticonderoga Securities .
" The euro weakened against the dollar and the yen , and some risk aversion came back into the system that has the risk - recovery trade unwinding , " he said .
A senior Greek official earlier told Dow Jones Newswires that the prospect of help from the European Union " does n't look good " and that Greece could seek IMF help over the April 2 - 4 weekend if a more detailed aid plan is n't produced at an E.U. summit on March 25 - 26 .
The report comes amid signs Germany and other euro - zone countries are moving more in favor of an IMF role in providing any needed aid to Greece amid public opposition to a taxpayer funded bailout for a euro - zone partner .
Read about Greek debt concerns .
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told reporters in Brussels that Greece would prefer E.U. measures but that the International Monetary Fund remained an option .
" Investor sentiment was hit by the political divisiveness over whether and how to help Greece with loans or guarantees , " said Ken Jaques , credit and derivatives manager at Informa .
" Markets are unnerved not only by the lack of clarity about Greece 's future but also by European leaders ' inability to find common ground on basic economic policy -- France this week criticized Germany for running a trade surplus , which drives its trading partners , like Greece , to suffer deficits . "
The dollar showed little reaction to a pair of U.S. reports showing weekly jobless claims fell and an index of consumer prices was unchanged in February .

I am a 18 year old looking for a summer job .
it is hard for me to find work and I just want a job so I can afford a car for college next summer .
I can clean , babysit , answer phones , pretty much whatever as long as it pays !!
From Mike Anderson to ***********@***********.org
Hey ,
I saw your ad looking for work and I think I have a job for you !
I am looking for an assistant on my farm for the summer .
It will involve working outdoors .
Let me know if you are interested .
Mike
From Stephanie ******* to Me
Hi Mike !
I am interested in your job !
I love animals and used to ride horses so a farm would be great !
what kind of work would I be doing , and where is your farm located ?
it needs to be close to ******** so my parents can drop me off and pick meup
From Mike Anderson to Stephanie *********
Stephanie ,
It is very close to **********.
I 'm glad to hear you are familiar with horses , because you will be primarily working with horses .
My farm gets all the old horses that other farms do n't need anymore , and they are starting to take up a lot of room in my stable , which I want to turn into a garage for my new truck .
Therefore , the horses need to go .
As my assistant , you will be in charge of killing the horses and dumping them in the lake behind my farm .
I used to have a captive bolt pistol ( cattle gun ) that I used to put them down , but it broke when I tried to use it to tap a keg .
You 'll probably have to use my 12 - gauge shotgun to put them down .
Sometimes they do n't die right away when you shoot them , and will start freaking out .
You just have to stay calm and keep shooting .
Do n't worry , I 'll show you how to use the shotgun if you are n't familiar with one .
You then need to use my chainsaw to cut the horses into smaller parts that you can carry down to the lake .
It can get a little messy , so I suggest wearing some clothes that you do n't care about , or some clothes that the horse blood would compliment .
The lake is n't mine , it is my neighbor's .
He gets kind of angry when he sees me dumping dead horses in his lake , so you have to make sure he is n't around when you do it .
I have some cinderblocks you can use to weigh the horses down so he wo n't see them .
I have a lot of horses , and each horse takes about an hour and a half to dispose of , so you should have plenty of work .
The job will pay $ 15 an hour .
When can you start ?
Mike
From Stephanie ******* to Me
omg that is HORRIBLE !
That is truely awful and sick !!
Why cant you just give the poor horses away ?
sorry but I am not helping you slaughter horses !!!
From Mike Anderson to Stephanie *********
Stephanie ,
I 'm sorry if you are a bit surprised , but this is how farms work .
You can't give away old horses , you have to kill them .
I thought about it , and if you do n't want to use the chainsaw to cut up the horses , you can just use my truck to drag them down to the lake .
Do you have your license or permit ?
If not , this could be good driving practice for you .
You do n't want to pass up on this great job opportunity .
Mike
From Stephanie ******* to Me
No that is not how farms work you are just SICK !
I am NOT interested
From Mike Anderson to Stephanie *********
Stephanie you are going to regret this some day when you try to get a real job .
I think this would look great on your resume .

Horses are extraordinary animals .
They weigh over a ton and can go as fast as 10 mph over a mile and carry a rider more than 20 % of their own body weight .

ANN ARBOR , Mich . - A recent discovery in understanding how to chemically break down the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into a useful form opens the doors for scientists to wonder what organism is out there - or could be created - to accomplish the task .
University of Michigan biological chemist Steve Ragsdale , along with research assistant Elizabeth Pierce and scientists led by Fraser Armstrong from the University of Oxford in the U.K. , have figured out a way to efficiently turn carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide using visible light , like sunlight .
The results are reported in the recent online edition of the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
Not only is it a demonstration that an abundant compound can be converted into a commercially useful compound with considerably less energy input than current methods , it also is a method not so different from what organisms regularly do .
" This is a first step in showing it 's possible , and imagine microbes doing something similar , " Ragsdale said .
" I do n't know of any organism that uses light energy to activate carbon dioxide and reduce it to carbon monoxide , but I can imagine either finding an organism that can do it , or genetically engineering one to channel light energy to coax it to do that . "
In this collaboration between Ann Arbor and Oxford , Ragsdale 's laboratory at the U - M Medical School does the biochemistry and microbiology experiments and Armstrong 's lab performs the physical - and photochemical applications .
Ragsdale and his associates succeeded in using an enzyme - modified titanium oxide to get carbon dioxide 's electrons excited and willing to jump to the enzyme , which then catalyzes the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide .
A photosensitizer that binds to the titanium allows the use of visible light for the process .
The enzyme is more robust than other catalysts , willing to facilitate the conversion again and again .
The trick :
It can't come near oxygen .
" By using this enzyme , you put it into a solution that contains titanium dioxide in the presence of a photosensitizer , " he said .
" We looked for a way that seems like nature 's way of doing it , which is more efficient . "
Armstrong notes that " essentially it shows what is possible were we to be able to mass - produce a catalyst with such properties " .
The direct product - carbon monoxide - is a desirable chemical that can be used in other processes to produce electricity or hydrogen .
Carbon monoxide also has significant fuel value and readily can be converted by known catalysts into hydrocarbons or into methanol for use as a liquid fuel .
Although carbon monoxide serves as a source of energy and biomass for microbes , it is toxic for animals and this risk needs to be managed when it is generated or used in chemical reactions .

Research in Ragsdale 's lab was funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health .
Ragsdale , a professor of biological chemistry at the U - M Medical School , is a fellow of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute , which develops , coordinates and promotes multidisciplinary energy research and education at U -M .
Defiant Brown will ' keep going ' even without majority
The general election is widely expected on 6 May Prime Minister Gordon Brown has signalled that he will " keep going " as leader even if Labour fails to secure a majority at the general election .
Asked on BBC Radio 4's Woman 's
Hour if he would quit , Mr Brown said " I 'll keep going " before being interrupted and asked the question again .
He replied : " I will keep going .
I will keep going because I want a majority . "
In response the Conservatives said : " The prospect of him going on even longer is truly terrifying . "
" We are fighting this election to stop this country suffering five more years of Gordon Brown . "
The election is widely expected to take place on 6 May and there has been growing speculation about a possible hung parliament - where no single party has a majority - after recent opinion polls .
' Comfortable with women '
The Times reported on Monday that ministers had said Mr Brown intended to resist pressure to step down swiftly as Labour leader in the event of an election defeat .
Asked , at the end of a wide - ranging half hour interview , whether he owed it to the Labour Party to stand aside if he did not secure a majority he said : " I think I owe it to people to continue and complete the work that we 've started of taking this country out of the most difficult global financial recession .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" And to be honest , going around the country , I feel there 's more to do to improve the health service , more to do to give people better opportunities , more to do for women on maternity pay and equal pay , more to do on the discriminations that still exist . "
BBC political correspondent Norman Smith says some of Mr Brown 's supporters fear that if he stood down too soon after a defeat , a victorious Conservative Party could call a second , snap election - in order to seek a bigger majority - at a time when Labour is distracted by a leadership battle .
Mr Brown has faced a number of challenges to his authority during his time as prime minister .
Most recently , in January , former cabinet ministers Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon wrote to all Labour MPs asking them to support a call for a secret ballot on his leadership .
But they failed to attract any significant support .
Former minister Geoffrey Robinson , the Labour MP for Coventry North West , said : " If we had another general election within the year , one would have thought that going to the country while the Labour Party conducts an election would be rather farcical . "
He said " everyone " had " written off " Mr Brown during the financial crisis , adding that to fight on after a hung Parliament would be " a very considerable achievement " .
Mr Robinson added that " the momentum " was with Labour and Mr Brown .
' Fight back '
Earlier in his Woman 's Hour interview Mr Brown was asked about his attitude to working with women , following ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint 's claim Mr Brown treated women in his Cabinet as " little more than female window - dressing " .
Asked whether he was simply more comfortable around men than women , Mr Brown said : " No , I feel more comfortable with women , I 've got to tell you .
Right throughout my life I 've worked very closely with the women who 've worked with me .
" Some of the most senior people working with me are not only women , but extremely , extremely professional and competent women . "
Mr Brown admitted that allegations he had bullied Downing Street staff were " damaging " , but insisted that while he was " tough " and would " fight back if I am in difficulty " , his office was " a family " .
We do n't know yet what savings we can get from cutting or keeping unemployment down
Gordon Brown
He was asked why he had chosen to take part in an interview with Piers Morgan last month in which he talked about matters in his personal life , including his marriage and the death of his daughter .
" I felt that how people understood me was being mediated by a number of newspapers that were presenting me in a way that 's just not me .
" I felt that I should be prepared to do like any other person who 's in politics and do interviews , open myself to any questions that people had .... and be prepared to show that nobody could be as one - dimensional as newspapers were presenting . "
The PM said was also quizzed about his love of bananas , following reports that he ate up to nine a day .
Asked how many he ate each day , the PM replied : " I do n't know , quite a few .
I think they 're pretty good for you ... as an alternative to chocolate . "
Frontline services
As well as his eating habits , Mr Brown discussed the issue of spending cuts , but said there was some uncertainty about future plans .
" We do n't know yet what savings we can get from cutting or keeping unemployment down , but that runs into billions of pounds .
" If we have these savings , we can use them to fund departments .
If we do n't have these savings , it makes it more difficult . "
He said hospitals , schools and policing would have their frontline budgets protected for at least the next two years .
Beyond that , he added : " I think you can be reasonably sure that the protection for health and education and policing will be continued . "

That lead to , “ Maybe I can actually build that .
It could be funny . ”
Then I thought , “ I should use the new HTML5 < audio > element .
It ’s timely .
And it ’s a good chance for me to learn how it works . ”
Then I thought , “ But what should I use as the audio sample ?
I know , I ’ll use a recording of myself reciting ‘ Mary Had A Little Lamb , ’ as homage to Thomas Edison .
Because what I ’m doing is clearly as revolutionary as what he did . ”
Next thing I knew , I was recording myself shouting ‘ Mary Had A Little Lamb , ’ wondering if the neighbors could hear me , and feeling rather silly .
The more I worked on it , the more absurd the whole idea seemed .
But I got it working .
Sort of .
It only works in Firefox .
So , with apologies to people who do n’t use Firefox , or are n’t willing to fire it up just for a laugh , here is my revolutionary new audio player that adjusts the volume from “ whisper ” to “ shout ” :

Three Iowa State University physicists who took winter trips to the Large Hadron Collider for meetings and experimental work are starting to see real data from the planet 's biggest science experiment .
Finally .
The multibillion - dollar collider made international news on Sept. 10 , 2008 , when it sent its first beam of protons around 17 miles of underground tunnel near Geneva , Switzerland .
But breakdowns in the machine 's high - current electrical connections forced a complete shutdown for more than a year of repairs and tests .
Physicists from around the world cheered on Nov. 20 , 2009 , when the collider once again sent protons racing through its tunnel .
Three days later the machine recorded its first proton - proton collisions .
And on Nov. 30 it set a new world record when it accelerated two beams of protons to a total energy of 2.36 trillion electron volts .
Physicists at CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research , shut down the collider on Dec. 16 to prepare for even higher energy collisions later this year .
" The data look just beautiful , " said Soeren Prell , an Iowa State associate professor of physics and astronomy .
advertisement
Prell has been looking at the first data recorded with the ATLAS experiment 's silicon pixel detector .
The pixel detector is the innermost part of ATLAS , one of two giant , general purpose detectors at the collider .
ATLAS will measure the paths , energies and identities of the particles created when protons or lead ions collide at unprecedented energies .
The pixel detector uses 80 million pixels to make precise measurements as close to the particle collisions as possible .
Prell said the pixel detector is already sending physicists fairly clean data with very little background noise .
But , he said , physicists still have to work to make sure the pixel detector is properly aligned and calibrated .
It has a resolution down to 10 millionths of a meter and so it has to be just as precisely aligned .
The detector 's data also has to be distributed to physicists around the world for study and analysis .
Jim Cochran , an associate professor of physics and astronomy , is the ATLAS experiment 's analysis support manager for the United States .
It 's his job to make sure researchers have the data they need for their analyses .
And , so far , the experiment 's analysis system has been able to keep up with the data .
But that 's going to be a bigger challenge when the collider is turned back on in February and begins running at higher energies and much higher collision rates .
" One of the concerns I 've had is whether we 'll be able to handle the data loads we 're expecting , " Cochran said .
" We have to have our computing systems optimized so we can do it .
We 've already had 700,000 collision events , and that 's nothing compared to what 's coming . "
That 's just one of the reasons Chunhui Chen , an assistant professor of physics and astronomy , is telling people that big , new , Nobel - winning physics from the Large Hadron Collider wo n't happen right away .
There 's just too much data to collect , distribute and analyze .
advertisement
But , " This is a very big moment , " said Chen , who 's working on the ATLAS experiment 's pixel detector and the ATLAS trigger system that recognizes and records interesting collision events .
" Potentially , we 'll be able to see some new physics . "
That could include the Higgs boson , a particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics .
The model theorizes that space is filled with a Higgs field and particles acquire their masses by interacting with the field .
Detection and study of the Higgs could answer basic questions about why matter has mass and how particles acquire mass .
Physicists also hope the higher energies made possible by the Large Hadron Collider could answer big physics questions about matter and antimatter , dark matter , supersymmetry , extra dimensions , a grand unified theory or perhaps something entirely unexpected .
" One hundred years ago physicists discovered special relativity and quantum mechanics , " Chen said .
" We know our understanding of physics is incomplete .
We do n't know what 's beyond our understanding .
And so this is going to be a long research program .
It will take years of dedicated study to really unearth the secrets of the universe . "

By the executive committee of the New Anti-Capitalist Party
March 14 , 2010 -- Paris --
Two major lessons emerge from the first round of the regional elections .
The magnitude of abstention by millions of youth , workers and the unemployed , who mostly wished to register their rejection of the political parties that have alternated in power and that are responsible for aggravating their conditions of life .
The vigor of the rejection of the right and President Nicholas Sarkozy 's government -- accomplices of big investors and the richest classes , who have made the majority of the population pay the cost of the crisis and who are destroying public services and social gains -- fuelled the upsurge of the Socialist Party ( PS ) and Europe Écologie [ Greens ] .
This rejection of the right allowed the PS and its allies , which have been governing 20 regions since 2004 , not to be punished for their record .
Moreover , the campaign for the just completed first round was vitiated by the wave of disturbing racism from which the National Front ( FN ) greatly benefitted .
We thank the women and men who voted for the New Anti-Capitalist Party ( NPA ) lists or the unity lists in which the NPA participated .
Overall , our electoral results * are disappointing even though the results of some of our lists seem to be promising .
We will analyse these facts and their causes in greater detail in coming days .
For next Sunday ( March 21 ) , we call on the voters to confirm and amplify the results of the first round by inflicting the greatest possible defeat on the lists supported by Sarkozy and [ his right - wing Union for a Popular Movement ] UMP .
Punishing the right is an absolute necessity , even though we think that the left - wing majorities to come will be no better defence against the politics of Sarkozy than they have been for the last several years .
However , punishing the right in the elections will not be enough to block its politics .
Just like what 's happening in Greece , under a socialist government , it is likely to get worse in coming weeks .
Pay for their crisis ?
No way !
Like the front of youth , workers , the unemployed and the retired in Greece , we must prepare for the third round , which is social !
The 23rd of March has to become the first stage of convergence of struggles for pensions , wages and the prohibition of layoffs .
And it 's around these demands we wish to build the broadest unity against the right , the bosses and the bankers .

French regional elections see centre weaken
By Jim Jepps
March 15 , 2010 -- The Daily ( Maybe ) -- On March 14 , the French regional elections saw the ruling right wing UMP take a beating and the Socialist Party ( PS ) extend its already extensive reach across French regional governments .
The elections shine a light on exactly how unpopular Sarkozy ’s government has become .
The right were determined to make this election about national identity and Islam , and the vote was conducted in the context of proposed laws to ban the burka .
While playing the race card backfired for Sarkozy the dangerous game that the right were playing stoked the fascist vote and saw the National Front ( FN ) resurrected , gaining 12 % * .
The FN 's campaign focused on the " danger " that Islam poses to France and , as Sarkozy has just found out , if you encourage people to be racists they will vote for the down - the - line racists .
The results had added significance for the FN as long - time leader Jean - Marie Le Pen is 81 and is expected to step down from the party 's leadership soon .
The regional elections were an opportunity for potential leaders to jockey for position and Le Pen 's daughter , Marine , who is already an MEP , has emerged as the likely successor .
The election 's Islamophobic rhetoric spilled over into direct action with dozens of pig- masked protesters raiding a restaurant last week for the " offense " of selling halal burgers .
Commenting on Sarkozy ’s tactics Greens leader Daniel Cohn - Bendit pointed to the FN rise and said , " Bravo Mr. Sarkozy , here 's the result . "
However the story was not one sided and the French left , which has not always been strong on these issues , were able to confront these racist ideas with mixed success .
The New Anti-Capitalist Party ran a hijab - wearing candidate to national uproar and most parties of the left refused to compromise with the anti-Islam mood .
The Greens ( Europe Écologie ) ran a very clear anti-racist campaign and saw their vote skyrocket , leaving them as the nation 's third party .
It 's clear that while French society is seeing a rise in racism , there is a powerful countertrend of anti-racism .
Martine Aubry , leader of the victorious Socialist Party , stressed that “ the French sent a clear and strong message .
They today expressed their refusal to see a divided France ” .
That may be overstating the case , but certainly Sarkozy ’s poor performance is a real victory for the left .
The rise of Greens was not wholly unexpected -- as the Greens first won third place last year at the European elections -- but its impressive result of 13 % * , including more than 20 % in Paris , is a massive leap forward from the last regional elections six years ago in 2004 where the Greens polled just 2 % *.
When the second round of voting takes place next Sunday , March 21 , this puts the left in a formidable position because the Greens explicitly position themselves as a party of the left and take part in Socialist Party - led coalitions .
Negotiations have already begun between the PS and the Greens for joint lists in the second round elections which will see unprecedented Green representation .
This means that while the left won 20 of the 22 French regions last time they are in position to extend that already impressive hold on regional government .
However , one of the headlines of the election is the record low turnout , with over half the electorate refusing to cast their vote .
A closer look at the Socialist Party support sees that it has had a successful night because its vote collapsed less spectacularly than Sarkozy ’s vote rather than because of some revival in its fortunes .
The Socialist Party has been riven with splits and rows over the last few years that saw some leading members leave the party .
Likewise Sarkozy 's leadership has been consistently rocked by internal rows and disaffection –- including court cases and high profile walkouts .
However , unlike the PS , Sarkozy has no potential coalition partners on the right with the FN adamant that it will not lend him support in the second round .
With the centre parties losing ground and the good results for the Greens and the FN it 's clear that French society is becoming increasingly polarised , a pattern we 've seen recently in a number of elections in Europe .
However , the parties of the far left , which stood on a number of unity tickets , did not significantly benefit from the collapse of the centre .
The left vote was , as usual , split –- but this time between left unity coalitions .
The New Anti-Capitalist Party ( NPA ) , whose most recognisable figure Olivier Besancenot was the highest - polling far left candidate at the last presidential election , polled a disappointing 2 % *.
Much of the press attention was focused on the fact that one NPA region selected a young female activist who wears the hijab .
The party ’s leadership were supportive of their candidate but there is no doubt that this was a controversial decision both inside and outside of the party .
The NPA were outshone by the “ Face of the Left ” ( Front de gauche ) , a coalition between disaffected Socialist Party members , Communists and some smaller parties .
It polled a more respectable 6.2 % * , however both parties will no doubt be disappointed with the results .
What all this means for French politics is clear -– that the future is unclear .
With racism on the rise and the FN renewal of fortunes , the threat of the far right is still very much present .
However the right - wing government is unloved and faces opposition both at the ballot box and in the streets .
It 's quite possible that this period could see the Socialist Party put its troubles behind it and go on to win the presidency at the next election , but nothing is certain both because of threats to their right and to their left .
Although those coalitions to the Socialist Party 's left did not perform very well at this election , their vote did not collapse either and they may still be able to capitalise on the problems of the centre .
Certainly the extraordinary rise of the Greens ' vote shows that French voters are willing to look to alternatives and to oppose the growing tide of racism .
French elections – first thoughts
By Liam Mac Uaid
March 15 , 2010 -- Mac Uaid -- French Sarkozy took a well heralded pummelling in the first round of the French regional elections and some of the lessons from France are likely to apply in the upcoming British polls .
A few things leap out from the raw figures .
The first is that lots of people decided not to vote .
According to one poll cited in Libération 53.5 % of voters abstained .
The New Anti-Capitalist Party ( NPA ) , which scored a modest 2 % , suggests reasonably enough that it was young people , workers and the unemployed who stayed at home .
The second is the strength of the far right .
The Front National won 11.7 % * of the vote dispelling any fantasy that it's a spent force .
The racist and Islamophobic undercurrent which ran throughout the pre-election period must have benefited Le Pen .
On the other side of the coin , Europe Ecologie ( EE ) won 13.3 % * making it the third - largest force after the UMP and the Socialist Party ( PS ) .
The combined results of the anti-Sarkozy forces PS ( 30 % * ) , EE ( 13 % * ) , Front de gauche ( 6.2 % * ) and the NPA and LO ’s combined 3.3 % * tally up to a serious rejection of Sarkozy 's project .
However , the third lesson , which we can take from the NPA 's relatively weak performance , is that offered a choice between an explicitly capitalist party and even a neoliberalised social - democratic party working - class voters will , in the first instance , return to social democracy rather than taking the more radical new option .
As Greece shows , having a social - democratic government offers very little protection at all when the International Monetary Fund and the European Union start demanding pension cuts , wage reductions and job losses .
A lot of PS voters are heading for a hangover .
The question then becomes one of offering a political expression for their inevitable disillusionment when the PS comes into office .

Morning Star : Dissatisfied French voters deal slap to Sarkozy
With more than 96 per cent of votes counted , the opposition centre - left Socialist Party was frontrunner with around 30 per cent* of the vote .
Mr Sarkozy 's Gaullist Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) was in second place with around 27 per cent* , while Europe Ecologie garnered 12.5 per cent* of the vote .
The far - right National Front took 11.5 per cent * .
The Left Front , which unites the French Communist Party , the Left Party and smaller groupings , won about six per cent * .
Together , candidates from the Socialist Party , Europe Ecology and the Left Front were just shy of 50 per cent* of the vote .
Socialist Party leader Martine Aubry described the result as " encouraging . "
In casting their ballots , the French " wanted most of all to express their wish for a more just and stronger France " , Ms Aubry said .
The Socialists , who already control 20 of the 22 regions of mainland France , have begun horse - trading with the Greens and the left in a bid to present unified slates of candidates in this Sunday 's decisive second round .
The centre - left Socialists and their allies are now on track to score a grand slam on March 21 by winning every one of metropolitan France 's 22 regions .
Though the campaign had focused on regional concerns such as roads and local jobs , the vote was seen by many as a referendum on Mr Sarkozy 's sweeping pro-business reforms .
Voter turnout was at a record low of about 48 per cent , 10 points lower than in the last regional election six years ago .
Prime Minister Francois Fillon of the UMP insisted that the high abstention rate " does not permit us to draw any conclusions of national relevance " and stressed that " nothing has been decided for the second round " .
But political analyst Roland Cayrol said : " The French people want to punish the governing powers .
Members of the governing right attribute this score to the abstentions but , in reality , the success of the left is indisputable . " .
Second round to the Socialist Party and allies
March 22 , 2010 -- Le Monde reports : " The Left obtained 59 % of the votes in six metropolitan regions where it dueled with the Right , according to TNS - Sofres / Logica .
In 12 regions where there were triangle races joined by the National Front , the Socialist Party and its allies scored 49 % , against 33.5 % for the Right and 17.5 % for the National Front " ( " La gauche confirme son succès , l'Alsace reste à droite , " 21 March 2010 ) .
The Right held on to Alsace and captured Réunion .
The abstention rate is estimated to be between 49 % and 49.5 % this time , slightly lower than in the first round ( 53.6 % ) , but much higher than in the second round of the 2004 regional elections ( 34.32 % ) .
France : Elections a blow to Sarkozy
By Chris Latham
March 27 , 2010 -- Green Left Weekly --
French voters have dealt a blow to right - wing President Nicolas Sarkozy in the first and second rounds of voting in the French regional elections .
The opposition Socialist Party ( PS ) expanded its control of regional presidencies to 23 of the 26 regions , based on a record voting percentage in the second round on March 21 .
There were mixed results for parties to the left of the PS , and also a resurgence of the far - right National Front ( FN ) .
The elections have been marred by record - low voter turnout , with 46.5 % and 51 % of voters taking part in the two rounds .

For many California areas , unemployment rates moved persistently higher in January , indicating that the national economic recovery has n’t yet translated into jobs for the Golden State .
New county - by - county figures released by the state Wednesday showed that in eight counties , more than 1 in 5 people were out of work .
Moreover , revised numbers for last year show that fewer people were employed than was previously believed .
The state was one of five , along with Florida , Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina , that reached their highest unemployment rates since the government began keeping track in 1976 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
California ’s was 12.5 % in January , up from 12.3 % in December .
“ The unemployment rate will be persistently at this high level for at least a few more months , ” said Esmael Adibi , an economist at Chapman University in Orange .
The unemployment rate for the Riverside - San Bernardino - Ontario metro area reached 15 % in January , its highest since 1990 , the earliest year for which the state has comparable data available .
Unemployment in Orange County reached 10.1 % , up from 9.1 % in December .
The state ’s revised data for last year showing elevated unemployment indicate that a recovery could take longer than previously predicted .
“ The impact on the labor market was much more severe than what we had estimated , ” Adibi said .
Most counties were still struggling under the burden of joblessness , especially the eight counties where rates were higher than 20 % .
Merced County , for instance , had an unemployment rate of 21.7 % in January , and Imperial County ’s rate was 27.3 % .
The national unemployment rate in January was 9.7 % , and the country experienced a strong 5.75 % annualized increase in gross domestic product in last year ’s final three months .
“ The real mystery now is why we are n’t getting job growth when the GDP has been positive , ” said Stephen Levy , director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy .
Budget problems in state and local government are expected to further drag down the state ’s recovery , Levy said .
Even if they do n’t get pink slips , state employees are earning less money because of furloughs and salary reductions , which reduces consumer spending in the state .
The government sector , which includes public education , lost 4,500 jobs from December to January .

Hack lost her job as a gardener with the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks a year ago , and said that finding work has been a challenge at her age , 54 .
“ I ’m like a fish out of water , ” she said .
Los Angeles County , with an unemployment rate of 12.5 % , was hard hit by declines in the trade , transportation and utilities sector , which shed 21,900 jobs , and professional and business services , which lost 16,300 jobs .
The same sectors were hit in the Inland Empire , losing 7,700 and 3,600 jobs , respectively .
Orange County lost 5,700 jobs in trade , transportation and utilities and 3,000 in professional and business services .
San Diego County ’s unemployment rate reached 11 % in January , up from a revised 10.3 % in December .
The unemployment rate in Ventura County was 11.6 % in January , up from a revised 10.9 % in December .
California ’s unemployment rate was the fifth - highest in the nation , behind Michigan , Nevada , Rhode Island and South Carolina .

How to Deliver a Great Presentation Like Steve Jobs [ Digital Inspiration ]
Kliph Nesteroff wrote a long article for WFMU 's blog about Cary Grants ' LSD experiences .
Cary Grant was the first mainstream celebrity to espouse the virtues of psychedelic drugs .
Whereas novelist Aldous Huxley 's famous 1954 treatise The Doors of Perception recounted his remarkable experiences with mescaline , Huxley was hardly mainstream – a darling of intellectual circles to be sure , but a far cry from a matinee idol .
Grant was one of the biggest stars Hollywood had to offer when he jumped headlong into Huxley 's Heaven and Hell .
His endorsement of subconscious exploration , arguably , created more interest in LSD than Dr. Timothy Leary who was largely preaching to the converted .
Grant on the other hand was the fantasy of countless Midwestern women .
He convinced wholesome movie starlets like Esther Williams and Dyan Cannon to blow their minds .
When Ladies Home Journal and Good Housekeeping interviewed him , the topic of conversation was n't Cary 's favorite recipe or " the problem with youth today . "

[ Note our follow - up posts on this topic : Web Security Trust Models , and Web Certification Fail : Bad Assumptions Lead to Bad Technology ]
Sometimes geeky technical details matter only to engineers .
But sometimes a seemingly arcane technical decision exposes deep social or political divisions .
A classic example is being debated within the Mozilla project now , as designers decide whether the Mozilla Firefox browser should trust a Chinese certification authority by default .
Here ’s the technical background :
When you browse to a secure website ( typically at a URL starting with “ https : ” ) , your browser takes two special security precautions : it sets up a private , encrypted “ channel ” to the server , and it authenticates the server ’s identity .
The second step , authentication , is necessary because a secure channel is useless if you do n’t know who is on the other end .
Without authentication , you might be talking to an impostor .
Suppose you ’re connecting to https://mail.google.com, to pick up your Gmail .
To authenticate itself to you , the server will ( 1 ) do some fancy math to prove to you that it knows a certain encryption key , and ( 2 ) present you with a digital certificate ( or “ cert ” ) attesting that only Google knows that encryption key .
The cert is created by a Certification Authority ( “ CA ” ) , which asserts that it has done the necessary due diligence to establish that the designated encryption key is known only to Google Inc .
If the CA is competent and honest , then you can rely on the cert , and your connection will be secure .
But a dishonest CA can trick you into talking to an impostor site , so you need to be cautious about which CAs you trust .
Your browser comes preinstalled with a list of CAs whom it will trust .
In principle you can change this list , but almost nobody does .
So browser vendors effectively decide which CAs their users will trust .
With this background in mind , let ’s unpack the Mozilla debate .
What set off the debate was the addition of the China Internet Network Information Center ( CNNIC ) as a trusted CA in Firefox .
CNNIC is not part of the Chinese government but many people assert that it would be willing to act in concert with the Chinese government .
To see why this is worrisome , let ’s suppose , just for the sake of argument , that CNNIC were a puppet of the Chinese government .
Then CNNIC ’s status as a trusted CA would give it the technical power to let the Chinese government spy on its citizens ’ “ secure ” web connections .
If a Chinese citizen tried to make a secure connection to Gmail , their connection could be directed to an impostor Gmail site run by the Chinese government , and CNNIC could give the impostor a cert saying that the government impostor was the real Gmail site .
The Chinese citizen would be fooled by the fake Gmail site ( having no reason to suspect anything was wrong ) and would happily enter his Gmail password into the impostor site , giving the Chinese government free run of the citizen ’s email archive .
CNNIC ’s defenders respond that any CA could do such a thing .
If the problem is that CNNIC is too close to a government , what about the CAs already on the Firefox CA list that are governments ?
Is n’t CNNIC being singled out because it is Chinese ?
Does n’t the country with the largest Internet population deserve at least one slot among the dozens of already trusted CAs ?
These are all good questions , even if they ’re not the whole story .
Mozilla ’s decision touches deep questions of fairness , trust , and institutional integrity that I wo n’t even pretend to address in this post .
No single answer will be right for all users .
Part of the problem is that the underlying technical design is fragile .
Any CA can certify to any user that any server owns any name , so the consequences of a misplaced trust decision are about as bad as they can be .
It ’s tempting to write this off as bonehead design , but in truth the available design options are all unattractive .
The number of Americans targetted by entertainment industry lawsuits nearly doubled this month , as the the US Copyright Group ( " an ad hoc coalition of independent film producers and with the encouragement of the Independent Film & Television Alliance " ) brought suit against 20,000 BitTorrent users .
30,000 more lawsuits are pending , bringing the total number of US entertainment industry lawsuit defendants up to 80,000 ( when you include the 30,000 victims of the RIAA ) .
This beatings - will - continue - until - morale - improves gambit is puzzling to me .
It seems likely to me that most of these defendants will settle for several thousand dollars ( regardless of their guilt ) rather than risk everything by hiring a lawyer to defend themselves .
But does the " US Copyright Group " really think that Americans will go back to the mall with their credit - cards in hand once their friends ' lives have been ruined by litigation ?
How about making peace , instead ?
Offer blanket licenses , DRM - free downloads , ad - supported streams , and products whose EULA consists of " By buying this product you agree to abide by copyright " ( a far cry from the current status quo , which goes more like " By buying this product , you agree … [ 15,000 words omitted ] … that we can spy on you , take it away again , stop you from exercising your consumer rights to lend or give away this product , etc etc etc ) .

Even more curious was Boehner 's out of character OP - Ed piece from last week :
My Constituents Care Way More About Political Gamesmanship Than Jobs , Health Care , And The Economy
It is my responsibility as an elected official to look out for the people back home , the voters who sent me to Washington .
So , after 20 years representing Ohio's 8th District , I know what the good citizens of Montgomery , Preble , and Butler counties really want : someone who engages in the kind of calculated political gamesmanship that increases his standing in the Republican party while simultaneously hindering our country 's legislative process at every conceivable turn .
I assure you , the last thing my voters need is some well intended , do - all - I - possibly - can - to - help - the - little - guy congressman running around Washington , working across the aisle , and fighting tooth and nail for jobs , health care , and financial reform to ensure their tax dollars never end up in the hands of banks capable of holding our entire economy hostage .
No , sir .
My constituents deserve better .
.
The fact is , if I ever worked across the aisle to help thousands of uninsured Ohioans receive health care , I would n't be able to look them in the eye .
How could I explain to them that I abandoned the idiotic yet politically fruitful claim that Barack Obama is a socialist bent on destroying the American way of life ?
How could I admit to them that deficit spending is the only way to get us out of an economic crisis perpetuated by my party 's disastrous fiscal ideology ?
How could I tell them I stopped obsessing over scoring petty political points right before the midterm election ?
How could I stop being the greedy , myopic scumbag they elected me to be ?
You do n't often see a Republican take the mask off .
Even for a second .
So this is extraordinary .
Could this be a side effect Boehner 's over use of Deep Orange MicroMist Tanning spray ?
Last year 's recall of the spray became a minor embarrassment for Boehner .
John Boehner ’s tanning spray recalled House Minority leader John Boehner ’s signature sunless tanning spray has been recalled by Naranja Skin Co. due a growing number of customer complaints .
The Ohio representative ’s Deep Orange MicroMist Tanning spray had enjoyed national success until numerous customers recently needed to be hospitalized because they suffered adverse effects from using the spray .
Thirteen people , in all , needed emergency care when continued use of the spray caused : impaired vision ( red only color visible ) ; uttering of nonsensical statements without justification ; and a complete inability to empathize with others .
Although the Naranja Skin Co. claimed the hospitalizations were isolated incidents , it issued a formal apology and has also called for an immediate recall of all sold and unsold product .
Boehner characterized Naranja ’s recall as a precautionary move and stood by the products ’ formula ,
This could possibly explain Boehner 's toxic personality .

The result is the highly refined MontBell Ultra - Light Down Inner series .
This family of products delicately balances the characteristics that define reliable ultra - light apparel .
For example , the U.L. Down Jacket weighs less than most cotton Tee - shirts , blocks an amazing amount of wind , and is warmer than most heavy fleece jackets , while compressing to the size of a 32 ounces water bottle .
Specifically designed as a replacement for the heavy and bulky fleece garments used by many backcountry enthusiasts , the U.L. Down Series is “ what you need ” when warmth is critical , minimal weight is paramount , and space in your pack is at a premium .

[ I EN HALL MED FLESK OG MJØD ] .IN A HALL WITH PORK AND MEADIn an old ash hung a nosecold man .
Under a black sky from where the rain poured down .
None went thither to cut the corpse down , For no one could know whereat the hanging took place .
Lonely man he was when he went to Allfather 's place , he arrived clothed in a body armour to a marvellous , grim palace .
A thousand year had passed since last man went thither , They cried in a gloomy happiness when at last a son there came .
North of the trolly cape was a place of mist far down .
Rows of Norse sons wandered thither north and nie .
None in lack of grave and none in lack of sons , For they went by fire and pestilence there to the beds of the coldhouse .

still the feasts are held among the faithful sons of Od .
Reformist Political Action as a Diversion , Part One
Over the weekend I saw some sort of Coffee Party event in the DC area featuring Annabel Park and other movement organizers .
I have to say , they seemed like a pretty nice bunch of people .
Of course after this past year , that ’s a pretty low bar to clear .
They were n’t taunting people with Parkinson ’s Disease , or screaming “ nigger ” and “ faggot , ” or generally giving the barking mad impression of someone about to start speaking in tongues and biting the heads off of snakes .
But nice or not , I got the clear impression that they could be best described by one word : goo - goos .
If there ’s one dominant theme in all the remarks by Park and other movement leaders up on that stage , it ’s civic engagement and particpation .
One of them –I forget her name–quoted Churchill on democracy :
It ’s the worst system except for all the others .
The political process is all we ’ve got , she said , so we have to particpate in it and make sure it works as well as possible .
Throughout the meeting , I heard the same general idea restated by many different people : Government is neither good nor evil , but a tool–and our responsibility is to see that it ’s used for good .
The Tea Party folks may believe Obama was born in Kenya , or that he ’s secretly a Muslim or a Marxist .
But they have one belief I agree with : their distrust of government .
That does n’t mean I endorse the batshittier stuff about black helicopters or white boxcars .
But even on that level , I think it ’s safe to say that the boundaries between the kind of creeping bureaucratic authoritarianism we ’ve experienced over the past thirty years of assorted wars against drugs and terror , and a full - blown dictatorship , are a lot blurrier than most people assume .
But even stipulating that most people engaged in government policy - making mean well ( which is probably true ) , and leaving aside my moral objections to the initiation of force as a libertarian , I believe that making government the primary vehicle for achieving your ends is a fool ’s errand .
One of the people at the Coffee Party event seemed to suggest as much , although I do n’t think he fully grasped the implications of what he was saying .
He questioned the Coffee Party movement ’s centrism , arguing that –far from simply wanting to split the difference between the “ extremes ” of left and right–most people in the movement were horrified by the corporate takeover of the political system and were critical of the Democratic leadership from the left .
And he pointed out just what a terrible , uphill struggle it was to participate in government or exert control over it in any meaninful sense without addressing the structural role of corporate power in the political system .
People could put every ounce of effort into electing “ progressive ” candidates –Obama and Pelosi are probably the most “ progressive ” president and speaker who will be elected for a generation , and hold the largest majority Democrats will probably hold for that length of time–and they still operate within a framework set by the corporations that fund their campaigns and provide most of the “ expert ” advice for their staffs in drafting legislation .
I think that guy had in mind a “ solution ” based on public campaign finance , or something of the sort .
But if he thinks that would end the corporate nature of our political system , he ’s sadly mistaken .
I ’ll concede it might lead to a form of corporate serfdom that ’s a bit more tolerable for us serfs , like the Western European model of social democracy .
And given a choice between two forms of statism , I ’ll be the first to admit I ’d prefer the one that weighs less heavily on my neck .
I ’d rather have six week vacations and free healthcare than live under the kind of sweatshop banana republic that people like Dick Armey and Tom Delay have wet dreams about .
But if that friendly left - wing critic of the Coffee Party movement thinks the European model of social democracy is any less corporate or any less capitalist than the Reagan - Thatcher model , he ’s–again–sadly mistaken .
Like our American system , the European continental model is a system of power based on collusion between centralized big government and centralized big business .
The faction of organized capital that controls it is a little more enlightened and humane than the one that controls our banana republic , and they ’ve got a big more sense when it comes to their long - term interests , but that ’s about the only difference .
As I ’ve said before , the main difference between the social democratic or New Deal corporate liberal model , and the Reagan - Thatcher model , is that the faction of organized capital that controls the former is like a humane farmer who thinks he ’ll get more work out of his animals in the long run from taking good care of them ; the faction that controls the latter is like Jones in Animal Farm , thinking it ’s more profitable to work them to death and replace them .
But regardless of how humane our masters are , it ’s hopeless to believe that political participation will make them any less our masters .
The state , in its essence , is a machine suited to control by insiders , and the coalition of insiders that controls it will always outlast any attempt at outside democratic control in the long run .
Stay tuned .
The head of EU data protection agencies has told Google it must warn people of the impending arrival of its Orwellian Street View spymobiles .
According to AP , Alex Turk has written to Google 's data privacy chief Peter Fleischer insisting that it " should always give advance notice on its website and in the local or national press before it takes pictures " .
It must also avoid capturing snaps " of a sensitive nature and those containing intimate details not normally observable by a passer - by " .
Furthermore , Turk is not impressed with Street View's " disproportionate " data retention policy , and wants all original unblurred Street View material deleted after six months .
Google defended that it already posts info as to where it 's snooping .
Citizens on the risk list today include the good burghers of Maidenhead , Vienna and Johannesburg .
Regarding the data retention issue , Google last year grudgingly agreed to an EU demand to delete original unblurred images , but was evasive about exactly when , insisting they were essential " to deal with any potential concerns from individuals who might feature incidentally on the Street View imagery " .
Fleischer agreed that " long term we only keep the blurred copy of Street View panoramas , and we will work with them and our engineers to determine the shortest retention period that also allows for legitimate use under EU laws " .
Google 's standard approach to Street View privacy concerns is to shoot first and negotiate later with individual countries .
Finland , Germany , Greece and the UK are the EU members who 've locked swords with the service , while the Swiss are waging their own private war on the spymobiles .
In the case of Finland , Street View caused a bit of a rumpus when an elevated spycam snapped a man with his pants down , even though he was behind a fence in his own garden .
In Japan , Google received numerous complaints about footage captured from a camera poised " just over the height of garden walls and so on " .
Google agreed to lower the cameras , and reshoot the 12 Japanese cities already covered . ®
An old joke observes that 98 percent of people masturbate , and the other 2 percent are .
But according to a recent study based on a representative sample of American adults , only 38 percent of women said they 'd masturbated at all during the past year .
The figure for men was 61 percent .
The study by University of Chicago sociologists analyzed data from 3,116 Americans aged 18 to 60 ( 1,769 women and 1,347 men ) gathered during face - to - face interviews as part of the National Health and Survey .
The interviewers asked , " On average , over the past 12 months , how often did you masturbate ? "
It 's possible that the face - to - face format suppressed the response .
Some people might not have admitted masturbating to an interviewer .
But even allowing for this possibility , it seems clear that is by no means as prevalent as the old joke suggests , or as many people believe .
Previous studies have shown that men are most likely to masturbate from their teens into middle age .
That was partly true in this study .
Men 's masturbation rate fell somewhat after age 50 .
But on the whole , men who masturbate continue to do so into later life .
However , it apparently takes young women some time to warm up to masturbation .
In this study , women aged 20 to 39 were the most likely to masturbate , with lower rates among women 18 to 20 and those over 40 .
Previous research has shown that masturbation becomes more likely with increased , greater frequency of sexual thoughts , sexual experimentation before , and a larger number of lifetime sexual relationships .
This study agreed on both sexes .
Previous studies have suggested that poor health reduces masturbation .
In this study , that was true for women , but not for men .
Men who masturbate keep doing it regardless of their health .
Previous studies have shown that compared with people raised in families that are religiously liberal or non-observant , those raised in fundamentalist families report less masturbation .
This study agreed .
Traditionally , masturbation has been regarded as a convenient sexual outlet for people who lack a lover .
In this study , that held true for both men and women .
In this study , white people were the most enthusiastic masturbators .
African - Americans , Asian - Americans , and Pacific Islanders reported less masturbation .
In American culture , masturbation is often viewed as a sexual refuge for singles , as a way to compensate for a lack of in a relationship .
In this survey , that turned out not to be the case .
In both genders , a sexless relationship suppressed masturbation .
Respondents who masturbated the most were usually involved in a sexual relationship .
Having partner sex , it appears , piques interest in solo sex .
Finally , sex involves both physical and emotional closeness .
In this study , any disconnect between these two elements , i.e. , physical contact but no emotional closeness or visa versa , was associated with increased masturbation .
In fact , for women , one of the best predictors of masturbation was a relationship that lacked emotional .
Sadly , like most sex surveys , this one did not include people over 60 , despite a growing research literature that most of those over 60 remain sexual .
Bottom line : Masturbation is considerably less prevalent than many people believe , and its frequency depends on many personal and socio-economic factors .
This was long lost post I had written about 8 months ago ( converted from wiki to HTML – so pardon typos if any )
Terminologies
Capistrano is a ruby gem which helps in remote deployment .
As against widely known convention , Capistrano can be used for any deployment , not just a rails app !
Nginx is a web - proxy server .
This is simply a light weight HTTP web - server which received requests on HTTP and passes them to other applications .
This is way more preferable than Application servers like Apache !
Moreover , nginx is very easily configurable and can support multiple domain - names very easily .
It has an in - build load - balancer which can send requests to apps based on its internal load - balancing mechanism .
Thin is the next - generation lean , mean rails server .
Its much faster , lighter in memory than mongrel .
Its has an internal event based mechanism for request processing and a very high concurrency performance ratio than other rails servers .
Linode is a VPS ( a Virtual Private Server ) that is hosted by www.linode.com.
As the name suggests ; ) , its a “ Linux Node ” .
We are using Ubuntu 8.10 ( Tip : To find Ubuntu release , issue command : lsb_release - a ) NOTE :
In the linode we had , it was a raw machine with no packages installed .
Please read Linode RoR package installation for details .
Steps
Capistrano Configuration
Follow the steps provided by Capistrano for basic instructions : Capistrano – From The Beginning Some modifications that you may need ( as I needed for deployment ) :
Edit Capfile and add the following to it .
This ensures that remote capistrano deployment does not fork a remote shell using command “ sh - c ” .
Some hosting servers do not allow remote shells .
default_run_options [ : shell ] = false
In addition to changes mentioned in Capistrano tutorial , add the following to config / deploy.rb .
This ensures that “ sudo ” is not used ( default for Capistrano ) and the user is “ root ” .
Not usually a good practice .. but what the hell !
set :use_sudo , false set :user , " root "
Since capistrano uses default script / spin and script / process / reaper , we need to override the deploy : start , deploy : stop and deploy : restart to ensure that we can start / stop the thin service and the ferret_server .
I know that in deply : restart , there is a copy - paste involved but I am trying to find out how to invoke a rake task from another rake task .
namespace : deploy do desc " Custom AceMoney deployment : stop . " task : stop , :roles => : app do invoke_command " cd #{current_path} ;./script/ferret_server -e production stop " invoke_command " service thin stop " end desc " Custom AceMoney deployment : start . " task : start , :roles => : app do invoke_command " cd #{current_path} ;./script/ferret_server -e production start " invoke_command " service thin start " end #
Need to define this restart ALSO as ' cap deploy ' uses it # ( Gautam ) I dont know how to call tasks within tasks .
desc " Custom AceMoney deployment : restart . " task : restart , :roles => :app do invoke_command " cd #{current_path} ;./script/ferret_server -e production stop " invoke_command " service thin stop " invoke_command " cd #{current_path} ;./script/ferret_server -e production start " invoke_command " service thin start " end end
Thin Configuraion I looked up most of the default configuration of Thin and Nginx on Ubunto at Nginx +
Thin .
Some extra configuration or differences are mentioned below .
The init script for starting thin and nginx during startup is configured during package installation .
Leave them as they are .
The following command generates the /etc / thin / acemoney .yml for 3 server starting from port 3000 .
Note that the -c option specifies the BASEDIR of the rails app .
Do NOT change any settings in this file as far as possible .
thin config - C /etc/thin/acemoney.yml -c /home / josh / current -- servers 3 -e production -p 3000
Starting and stopping thin is as simple as
service thin start service thin stop
This will read the acemoney .
yml file and spawn the 3 thin processes .
I noticed that each thin server took about 31 MB in memory to start with and with caching went upto ~ 70MB .
On the contrary , a mongrel server ( tested earlier ) started with 31 MB but exceeded 110 MB later !
Nginx Configuration Installation on nginx is simple on Ubuntu 😉
apt - get install nginx
Configure the base /etc/nginx /nginx.conf .
The default configuration are fine but I added / edited a few more for as recommended at Nginx Configuration
worker_processes 4 ; gzip_comp_level 2 ; gzip_proxied any ; gzip_types text / plain text / html text / css application / x- javascript text / xml application / xml application / xml+rss text / javascript ;
According to this configuration above , nginx will spawn 4 worker threads and each worker thread can process 1024 connections ( default setting ) .
So , nginx can now process ~4000 concurrent HTTP requests !!!
See performance article of thin at Thin Server
Configure the domainname , in our case acemoney .in. Ensure that acemoney .
in “ A record ” entry points to this server !
Check this by doing a nslookup or a ping for the server .
In /etc / nginx / sites - available create a file by the domainname to be hosted .
So I added /etc/nginx/sites-available/acemoney.in .
In /etc / nginx / sites - enabled create a symbolic link to this file .
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/acemoney.in
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/acemoney.in
Now add the contents in /etc/nginx / sites-available/acemoney .in
This is the key configuration to hook up nginx with thin .
upstream thin { server 127.0.0.1:3000 ; server 127.0.0.1:3001 ; server 127.0.0.1:3002 ; } server { listen 80 ; server_name acemoney .in ; root / home / josh / current / public ; location / { proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $ remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $ proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header Host $ http_host ; proxy_redirect false ; if ( - f $ request_filename/index.html ) { rewrite (.*) $ 1/index.html break ; } if ( - f $ request_filename.html ) { rewrite (.*)
$ 1.html break ; } if (!-f $ request_filename ) { proxy_pass http://thin ; break ; } } error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html ; location = /50 x. html { root html ; } }
To analyze this configuration , here are some details :
The following lines tell nginx to listen on port 80 for HTTP requests to acemoney .in.
The ‘ root ’ is the public directory for our rails app deployed at / home / josh / current !
server { listen 80 ; server_name acemoney .in ; root / home / josh / current / public ;
Now , nginx will try to process all HTTP requests and try to give the response .. for static HTML ’s it will automatically give the data from the ‘ root ’ .
If it cannot find the HTML file , it will ‘ proxy_pass ’ it to thin .
“ thin ” in the code below is an ‘ upstream ’ directive that tells nginx where to forward the current request it cannot directly serve .
if (!-f $ request_filename ) { proxy_pass http://thin ; break ; }
The upstream code is where load - balancing plays a role in nginx .
The following code tells nginx which all processes are running on which different ports and it forwards requests to any of the servers based on its internal load balancing algorithm .
The servers can be on different machines ( i.e. different IP addresses ) if needed .
In AceMoney , we have started 3 thin servers on 3 different ports !
upstream thin { server 127.0.0.1:3000 ; server 127.0.0.1:3001 ; server 127.0.0.1:3002 ; }
Performance Statistics
Nothing is complete without them .
Here is what I found out for 3 thin servers and 1 ferret_server .
top - 14:06:10 up 7 days , 22:58 , 2 users , load average : 0.00 , 0.00 , 0.00 Tasks : 84 total , 1 running , 83 sleeping , 0 stopped , 0 zombie Cpu0 : 0.0 %us , 0.0%sy , 0.0 % ni,100.0 %id , 0.0 % wa , 0.0 %hi , 0.0 % si , 0.0%st Cpu1 : 0.0 %us , 0.0%sy , 0.0 % ni,100.0 %id , 0.0 % wa , 0.0 %hi , 0.0 % si , 0.0%st Cpu2 : 0.0 %us , 0.0%sy , 0.0 % ni,100.0 %id , 0.0 % wa , 0.0 %hi , 0.0 % si , 0.0%st Cpu3 : 0.0 %us , 0.0%sy , 0.0 % ni,100.0 %id , 0.0 % wa , 0.0 %hi , 0.0 % si , 0.0%st Mem : 553176 k total , 530868 k used , 22308 k free , 16196 k buffers Swap : 524280 k total , 2520 k used , 521760 k free , 87280 k cached PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME + COMMAND 12424 mysql 18 0 127 m 42 m 5520 S 0 7.9 0:23.01 mysqld 18338 root 15 0 77572 70 m 4392 S 0 13.1 0:06.79 thin 18348 root 15 0 71176 64 m 4388 S 0 11.9 0:06.51 thin 18343 root 15 0 68964 62 m 4384 S 0 11.5 0:07.20 thin 18375 root 18 0 70912 54 m 2660 S 0 10.0 2:34.24 ruby 8141 www-data 15 0 5176 1736 820 S 0 0.3 0:00.07 nginx 8142 www-data 15 0 5176 1724 816 S 0 0.3 0:00.01 nginx 8144 www-data 15 0 5152 1720 816 S 0 0.3 0:00.06 nginx 8143 www-data 15 0 5156 1656 784 S 0 0.3 0:00.00 nginx
As can be seen :
Each thin server takes around 70 M
The Mysql server takes 41 M
Ruby process ( 18375 above ) is the ferret_serve which takes 54 M
4 nginx threads take about 1.7 K in memory .
Overall : ( 3 thin server cluster + Mysql + ferret ) : 300MB
This post about JavaScript testing is part of the Setting up a full stack for web testing series .
Introduction
JavaScript tests are sufficiently special to deserve a post outside of unit and functional testing .
You need a special set of tools to write these tests .
But then again for JavaScript the usual split between unit and functional tests is still applicable .
So what I wrote about those two topics is also relevant here .
In this post I cover two separate tools for JavaScript testing : JsTestDriver , which is great for JavaScript unit tests , and Selenium which can be used to functional test a web application that uses JavaScript .
Selenium
Selenium is a software suite used to remotely control browsers .
It consists of various sub-projects :
Selenium Core : This is the original Selenium .
It allows you to create a HTML page with some browser commands .
Those commands can then be run in the browser when you open the page .

This is a great way to learn the Selenium syntax as you can then export the recorded actions in several programming languages .

Selenium Remote Control ( Selenium RC ) : A Java server that allows controlling browsers remotely .
Can be used from any programming language using a simple HTTP API .
. Selenium Grid : Basically the same as Selenium Remote Control but for running in parallel .
Personally I only use Selenium RC , so I wo n’t talk about the other parts .
To get started , read the excellent Selenium documentation which explains everything a lot better than I could .
If you want a quick start I recommend the Selenium RC chapter .
The basic test case in Selenium works like this :
Open the page to test ( with by first logging in ) Execute some action like a click on a link or a mouse event Wait for the action to execute ( Ajax loads to finish , etc . )
Assert that the result is as expected
These four steps are repeated for every test case – so a lot of pages will be opened .
Opening all those pages is the reason why Selenium tests tend to be very slow .
As a test framework you can use whatever you already have – in your favorite programming language .
The difference is just that in your tests you will talk to Selenium to get the current state .
Take the following Python code as an example :
def test_login ( ) : sel = selenium ( " localhost " , 4444 , " * firefox " , " http://localhost:5000 / " ) sel.start ( ) sel.open ( " / login " ) assert sel.is_text_present ( " Login " ) assert sel.is_element_present (" username " ) assert sel.is_element_present ( " password " ) assert sel.get_value ( " username " ) == ' Username '
This script launches a Firefox browser and opens a login page of an application running on the localhost .
It then gets several values from Selenium and asserts the correctness of these values using the standard test framework methods .
JsTestDriver
JsTestDriver is a relatively new tool which can be used to submit tests suites to browsers .
Those browsers have to register with a Java - based server and you execute tests by submitting them to that same server .
So far that sounds very similar to Selenium .
The difference is that JsTestDriver works with a blank page in which it directly inserts the test suite .
It does that with a lot of optimizations to make sure the test runs are as fast as possible .
After that the unit test suite is run – directly inside the browser – and the client gets the test results including stack traces if available .
I recommend the Getting started documentation on the JsTestDriver wiki to see some code .
One of the main differences to Selenium is that you write the tests directly in JavaScript .
There is a built - in test framework but you can also use other frameworks depending on your taste .
To show some code that you can contrast with the Selenium example above , consider this example :
GreeterTest = TestCase ( " GreeterTest " ) ; GreeterTest.prototype.testGreet = function ( ) { var greeter = new myapp .
Greeter ( ) ; assertEquals ( " Hello World ! " , greeter.greet ( " World " ) ) ; } ;
Differences
Selenium is a very magic piece of software .
Everybody falls in love with it when seeing their browser doing all the work .
It ’s something people just ca n’t resist .
And so they end up using Selenium for all their web testing needs .
I ’ve been there myself .
The downside of Selenium is that it ’s very brittle and slow .
This is something that can’t really be avoided because all it does is control a browser .
Opening pages and waiting for all scripts to load takes some time .
And doing that hundreds or thousands of times , as is easily the case in a large test suite , leads to very slow test executions .
So instead of falling into that trap and only using Selenium , I recommend to clearly separate out unit tests which you can then execute in JsTestDriver .
JsTestDriver does a lot less work and because of that is a lot more stable and faster .
Then do integration tests with Selenium to test some basic workflows .
As an example take an autocompletion widget which is used on a search home page .
Almost everything the widget does you can test by just calling its public interfaces and seeing if it does the right thing .
This includes all the strange edge cases such as handling network timeouts or invalid data .
So this part you do with a big JsTestDriver test suite .
Then you only need one small functional test case to make sure the widget is correctly embedded in your home page .
That ’s your Selenium test .
As is evident I ’m very happy that JsTestDriver has come along .
Before that the only good solution for JavaScript testing was Selenium – and as I explained above it ’s not a perfect fit for every testing need .
Conclusion
If you have followed my testing tutorial so far you now have all your testing tools set up .
Some more chapters will follow but those now cover testing philosophy and tools around the principal testing framework .

GARDEN GROVE –
At least two longtime vendors for the Crystal Cathedral ’s Glory of Christmas and Glory of Easter pageant say the megachurch has failed to pay them tens of thousands of dollars they are owed for the 2009 Christmas pageant and has not indicated when they will be paid .
Kristina Oliver , who owns Oliver Livestock Co. in Hemet , says the cathedral owes her more than $ 56,000 .
For 29 years , her family has been supplying the pageants with live animals – camels , goats , sheep , horses and donkeys – a much - touted feature of the Glory pageants .
Oliver sent a letter to Sheila Schuller Coleman , founder Robert H. Schuller ’s daughter , who is now the head of Crystal Cathedral Ministries .
In the letter , she talked about her daughters ages 3 and 1 , her husband who has been battling cancer and the danger of her losing their home if she does n’t receive the payment .
“ I ’ve been completely ignored without so much as a courtesy of a response or explanation , ” Oliver said .
“ I understand the church has been hurting for cash … but the way I ’ve been treated , with no courtesy or professionalism , is unacceptable . ”
Cathedral administrators responded to the vendors ’ complaints Thursday with a written statement saying they have seen a 30 percent to 40 percent drop in revenue .
The church has “ significant debt , ” but they also have the assets to cover that debt , the statement said .
“ As a result , there are vendors that we have not been able to pay in a timely manner .
It grieves us that we are in such a position , ’’ the statement said .
Last month , Crystal Cathedral administrators announced that continuing financial woes have prompted them to start shutting down all operations at their 20 - acre campus in Rancho Capistrano , closing a church , preschool , retreat area , soccer fields , camping grounds and a conference and wedding center .
The megachurch has put various properties up for sale , has laid off employees and suspended its “ Glory of Easter ” pageant this year .
The cathedral has also scaled down its “ Hour of Power ” broadcasts viewed by millions worldwide .
Spokesman John Charles said the Cathedral is doing everything it can to strengthen itself financially and is not looking at bankruptcy as an option .
“ We ’re trying to avoid it at all costs , ” he said .
Administrators say they will call a vendor meeting in a week to form a vendor committee and develop a plan to “ treat all vendors equitably . ”
But vendors say they are losing patience .
Juliet Noriega , who has made the costumes for the pageants and has managed the shows ’ wardrobe for more than 25 years , says she is still waiting to be paid more than $ 10,000 for services rendered .
The Prescott , Ariz .
resident said the pageants were her major source of income each year .
“ But , of course , if they are not going to pay me , I ’m not inclined to come back , ” Noriega said .
She said it is unfair for the Crystal Cathedral to put her and other service providers at the bottom of the pile .
“ If someone is going to put forth an effort , they should be paid , ” she said .
“ I ’m very concerned because what I ’m owed is a substantial amount of money . ”
Oliver says she has put in numerous telephone calls and sent several e-mails since the show ended in early January , but was only met with silence .
“ I only heard back from the lady who organized the pageant saying that she did n’t know why the invoices were n’t being paid , ” Oliver said .
Oliver did receive a response from Sheila Schuller Coleman on March 19 in response to her letter detailing her financial problems and her urgency to get paid .
“ Dear Kristina , ” Coleman wrote , “ I have read your heartbreaking letter and I can only tell you how sorry I am .
I have forwarded your letter to Gwen Myers who is controlling all our finances at this time .
She will get back to you with her response .
I will be copied on her response .
God bless !! ”
Myers responded to Oliver Sunday .
“ Thank you so much for your ongoing support of Crystal Cathedral Ministries ! ” Myers wrote .
“ … As you know , the Ministry is experiencing severe financial difficulties and is currently unable to pay anything other than current payables .
The Ministry does not have sufficient resources to address past due or aged payables at this time . ”
Myers added : “ The primary goal of the Ministry is to get its financial house in order to the point where there is a positive cash flow on a consistent monthly basis .
At that time CCM will address aged payables with a payment plan that treats all entities and individuals equitably .
Thank you for your patience ! ”
For more than a year , Crystal Cathedral has been trying to dig its way out of a $ 55 million debt .
The megachurch has put its office building on Chapman Avenue for sale .
The cathedral has also been seeking a buyer for the 20 - acre retreat center at Rancho Capistrano .
The remaining 150 acres are in escrow to be sold to Continuing Life Communities , a developer that plans to build senior homes , as well as the city of San Juan Capistrano .
City officials have said that they are looking at a variety of options for that property including a luxury hotel and a winery .
The church ’s plan is to get about $ 60 million for both properties and get out of the financial hole .
So far , they have not been able to complete the sale of either of those properties .
Noriega says she is not sure whether the church will even have a “ Glory of Christmas ” this year .
“ It ’s almost the end of March and the costumes have not even been picked up from the dry cleaners , ” she said .

Do n't raise your family in Britain , say expats : UK voted worst place in developed world to bring up children
' Fresh start ' : Leah Wood and her husband Jack
Britain is the worst country in which to raise children , while Australia is the best , a study has found .
The survey of expatriates living in six different countries found there was a better standard of living Down Under , and a better quality of family life .
A massive 78 per cent of children who moved there from countries such as the UK spent more time outdoors than they did before , and the majority ate more healthily .
In comparison , foreign children who moved to Britain were more likely to become lazy and inactive .
A third of parents who have moved here said their children watched more TV than they did before and 27 per cent saw an increase in the amount of time spent playing video games .
Overall , Britain was also branded the most difficult country to move to .
Schools were found to be less welcoming , and it was difficult to arrange child care .
A massive 45 per cent of parents said the quality of their family life had decreased since moving to the UK - just 16 per cent noticed an improvement , according to the survey commissioned by HSBC .
Britain was rated the lowest of the six countries examined .
The list , from best to worst , read Australia , Singapore , Hong Kong , United Arab Emirates , the U.S. and the UK .
The results bode well for Leah Wood , 31 , who recently emigrated to Sydney with her Australian husband Jack MacDonald and their nine - month - old daughter Maggie .
Miss Wood , the daughter of Rolling Stone Ronnie said she wanted a ' fresh start ' .
She said : ' My husband is Australian and I love the lifestyle and the pureness of this city .
It 's really easy to be organic here .
I want the best for my little Maggie . '
An HSBC spokesman said : ' When you 're talking to an expat community you 're obviously talking to people with a varied degree of experience in terms of different countries .
' The key centres around childcare and education ... they were the things that were really highlighted .
The UK has scored lower than some of the other countries in those respects . '
The best and the worst : Australia has been voted the best place in the world to raise children , while Britain came last in the poll of six western countries
But Britain did rank highly in terms of cultural integration , with 83 per cent saying they were able to adapt to UK living ' well ' or ' really well ' .

The spokesman said : ' The UK is a great place to be able to dip into a number of different cultural experiences . '
The Offshore Offspring report , commissioned by HSBC , examined children 's integration , health and well - being by questioning 3,100 expats from 50 nations living in the six countries .
In 2008 , emigration from recession - hit Britain reached a record level with 427,000 people leaving , up from 341,000 in 2007 , according to the Office for National Statistics .
The US military has used drones to attack suspected terrorists in Pakistan since at least 2004 .
Proponents of the small , unmanned planes say they are capable of “ surgical strikes ” that reduce civilian casualties and effectively combat terrorism .
Is that true ?
Well , not really , according to a new report from the New America Foundation , a non-profit research institute .
ADVERTISEMENT
The percentage of civilians killed by drones in Pakistan is at about 32 percent , or one out of three , the report states , and the strikes themselves have little effect in deterring terrorist activities in either Pakistan or Afghanistan .
Researchers do not believe any of the reported strikes targeted Osama bin Laden .
An excerpt :
Our study shows that the 114 reported drone strikes in northwest Pakistan , including 18 in 2010 , from 2004 to the present have killed approximately between 834 and 1,216 individuals , of whom around 549 to 849 were described as militants in reliable press accounts , about two - thirds of the total on average .
Thus , the true civilian fatality rate since 2004 according to our analysis is approximately 32 percent .
The group ’s report is titled “ The Year of the Drone , ” referring to 2009 .
According to the figures obtained by the foundation , the Obama administration has increased the use of drone strikes considerably when compared to the previous years of the Bush administration .
There were 114 reported drone strikes from 2004 through 2009 , but only 45 during the Bush years .
The other 51 were during last year .
… [ A ] lthough the drone strikes have disrupted militant operations , their unpopularity with the Pakistani public and their value as a recruiting tool for extremist groups may have ultimately increased the appeal of the Taliban and al Qaeda , undermining the Pakistani state .
This is more disturbing than almost anything that could happen in Afghanistan , given that Pakistan has dozens of nuclear weapons and about six times the population .

Although the US military executes the strikes with the approval of the Pakistani government , the people feel differently .
Only 9 percent approve of drone strikes .
The group ReThink Afghanistan has already created a short documentary using some of the report ’s findings .
“ Clearly when you have a drone strike that kills a wedding party of ninety people when you ’re really after one person and maybe you did n’t even get that person , this contributes to the problem , ” Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - Minn . ) says in the film .

Watch it here :
For neuroscientists , one of the best ways to study brain activity is with a scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , which reveals blood flow in the brain .
However , although fMRI is a powerful tool for identifying brain regions that are active during a particular task , it offers only an indirect view of what ’s happening .
Measuring a more direct indicator of neural activity , such as concentrations of neurotransmitters ( brain chemicals that carry messages between neurons ) could be much more valuable .
Now , for the first time , MIT and Caltech researchers have come up with a new type of fMRI sensor that can do just that .
The two sensors , described in the Feb. 28 online edition of Nature Biotechnology , detect dopamine — a neurotransmitter involved in learning , movement control and many other brain processes .
“ This new tool connects molecular phenomena in the nervous system with whole - brain imaging techniques , allowing us to probe very precise processes and relate them to the overall function of the brain and of the organism , ” says Alan Jasanoff , an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT and senior author of the paper .
Dopamine holds particular interest for neuroscientists because of its role in motivation , reward , addiction and several neurodegenerative conditions , including Parkinson ’s disease .
The new sensors could help scientists learn more about how dopamine acts in the brain and in other organs , says Andrew Alexander , co-director of the Brain Imaging Core at the University of Wisconsin at Madison .
“ Previously we really have n’t had specific biomarkers for looking at things like dopamine or other chemical neurotransmitters ” with MRI , says Alexander .
Designing a new sensor
Conventional fMRI measures blood flow in the brain by tracking hemoglobin , the molecule that carries oxygen .
Hemoglobin has an iron atom at its core that binds to oxygen .
When bound to oxygen , hemoglobin ’s magnetic properties change in a way that can be detected with MRI .
“ fMRI is an extremely powerful technique for studying how the brain functions , and it ’s the only way to obtain spatial information and information about when things are happening , ” says Jasanoff , who also has appointments in the Departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Nuclear Science and Engineering , and in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT .
However , the spatial and temporal information is imprecise .
Researchers can detect increased activity in a certain area , but they ca n’t see what the activity is , nor can they get a high - resolution picture of which neurons are involved .
A more detailed picture of brain activity could emerge with MRI sensors specific to particular neurotransmitters .
The MIT team designed sensors specifically for dopamine , but their technique could be used to create sensors for other neurotransmitters or even unrelated molecules of biological interest .
To build the new sensors , the MIT team worked with chemical engineers at Caltech , using an approach called “ directed evolution . ”
They started with a protein called cytochrome P450 , an enzyme found in most organisms that is paramagnetic ( meaning it can become weakly magnetic when exposed to a magnetic field ) .
Using a technique called error - prone PCR , which is a faulty version of the way cells naturally replicate their genes , they generated a large collection of different mutated forms of the gene .
Each mutated gene was placed into an E. coli bacterium , which produced the mutated protein .
The researchers then tested each protein for its ability to bind dopamine .
At the end of each round , they took the best candidate and mutated it again for a new round of improvement .
At the end of five rounds , they had two sensors that would bind strongly to dopamine but not to other neurotransmitters .
“ You want it to be specific to dopamine — you do n’t want it to bind to dopamine and half a dozen other things , ” says Jasanoff .
In studies of rats , the researchers showed that the sensor can effectively detect dopamine in the brain .
However , in its current form , the dopamine probe must be injected into the brain , and the imaging is limited to the site of injection .
Bruce Jenkins , director of neurochemical imaging at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at MGH , says the new probe is “ very cleverly designed , ” but points out that an important challenge is yet to come : getting the molecule to cross the layer of cells that separates the brain from circulating blood .
“ Trying to get a charged protein across the blood - brain barrier is very tricky , ” he says .
The MIT team hopes to overcome that obstacle by applying barrier disruption techniques used historically to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to the brain .
They will also try to genetically program brain cells to express the sensor , so it does n’t have to be injected .
They plan to adapt the directed evolution strategy to look for sensors for other neurotransmitters as well .
If successful , that could help researchers in Jasanoff ’s lab and elsewhere create a better wiring diagram of how different brain regions and neurotransmitters work together to yield behavior such as learning , memory , addiction and movement .
“ We hope to develop probes that target different parts of the mechanism , allowing us to piece these systems together in a way that ’s noninvasive , ” says Jasanoff .
Trend towards ' endless cities ' could significantly affect population and wealth in the next 50 years
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The world 's mega-cities are merging to form vast " mega - regions " which may stretch hundreds of kilometres across countries and be home to more than 100 million people , according to a major new UN report .
The phenomenon of the so - called " endless city " could be one of the most significant developments - and problems - in the way people live and economies grow in the next 50 years , says UN - Habitat , the agency for human settlements , which identifies the trend of developing mega-regions in its biannual State of World Cities report .
The largest of these , says the report - launched today at the World Urban Forum in Rio de Janeiro - is the Hong Kong - Shenhzen - Guangzhou region in China , home to about 120 million people .
Other mega-regions have formed in Japan and Brazil and are developing in India , west Africa and elsewhere .
The trend helped the world pass a tipping point in the last year , with more than half the world 's people now living in cities .
The UN said that urbanisation is now " unstoppable " .
Anna Tibaijuka , outgoing director of UN - Habitat , said : " Just over half the world now lives in cities but by 2050 , over 70 % of the world will be urban dwellers .
By then , only 14 % of people in rich countries will live outside cities , and 33 % in poor countries . "
The development of mega-regions is regarded as generally positive , said the report 's co-author Eduardo Lopez Moreno : " They [ mega - regions ] , rather than countries , are now driving wealth . "
" Research shows that the world 's largest 40 mega - regions cover only a tiny fraction of the habitable surface of our planet and are home to fewer than 18 % of the world 's population [ but ] account for 66 % of all economic activity and about 85 % of technological and scientific innovation , " said Moreno .
" The top 25 cities in the world account for more than half of the world 's wealth , " he added .
" And the five largest cities in India and China now account for 50 % of those countries ' wealth . "
The migration to cities , while making economic sense , is affecting the rural economy too : " Most of the wealth in rural areas already comes from people in urban areas sending money back , " Moreno said .
The growth of mega-regions and cities is also leading to unprecedented urban sprawl , new slums , unbalanced development and income inequalities as more and more people move to satellite or dormitory cities .
" Cities like Los Angeles grew 45 % in numbers between 1975 - 1990 , but tripled their surface area in the same time .
This sprawl is now increasingly happening in developing countries as real estate developers promote the image of a ' world - class lifestyle ' outside the traditional city , " say the authors .
Urban sprawl , they say , is the symptom of a divided , dysfunctional city .
" It is not only wasteful , it adds to transport costs , increases energy consumption , requires more resources , and causes the loss of prime farmland . "
" The more unequal that cities become , the higher the risk that economic disparities will result in social and political tension .
The likelihood of urban unrest in unequal cities is high .
The cities that are prospering the most are generally those that are reducing inequalities , " said Moreno .
In a sample survey of world cities , the UN found the most unequal were in South Africa .
Johannesburg was the least equal in the world , only marginally ahead of East London , Bloemfontein , and Pretoria .
Latin American , Asian and African cities were generally more equal , but mainly because they were uniformly poor , with a high level of slums and little sanitation .
Some of the most the most egalitarian cities were found to be Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh .
The US emerged as one of the most unequal societies with cities like New York , Chicago and Washington less equal than places like Brazzaville in Congo - Brazzaville , Managua in Nicaragua and Davao City in the Phillippines .
" The marginalisation and segregation of specific groups [ in the US ] creates a city within a city .
The richest 1 % of households now earns more than 72 times the average income of the poorest 20 % of the population .
In the ' other America ' , poor black families are clustered in ghettoes lacking access to quality education , secure tenure , lucrative work and political power , " says the report .
The never - ending city
Cities are pushing beyond their limits and are merging into new massive conurbations known as mega-regions , which are linked both physically and economically .
Their expansion drives economic growth but also leads to urban sprawl , rising inequalities and urban unrest .
The biggest mega-regions , which are at the forefront of the rapid urbanisation sweeping the world , are :
• Hong Kong - Shenhzen - Guangzhou , China , home to about 120 million people ;
• Nagoya - Osaka - Kyoto - Kobe , Japan , expected to grow to 60 million people by 2015 ;
• Rio de Janeiro - São Paulo region with 43 million people in Brazil .
The same trend on an even larger scale is seen in fast - growing " urban corridors " :
• West Africa : 600 km of urbanisation linking Nigeria , Benin , Togo and Ghana , and driving the entire region 's economy ;
• India : From Mumbai to Dehli ;
• East Asia : Four connected megalopolises and 77 separate cities of over 200,000 people each occur from Beijing to Tokyo via Pyongyang and Seoul .

Atkins bites back :
You could shed up to a stone in two weeks with the new version of the world 's most famous diet
Doctors have reinvented the world 's most famous diet .
Now it 's healthier , easier and works even better ...
Since Dr Atkins launched the original low - carb diet in the Seventies , millions have tried it , lost weight , gained it again , and a fantastically lucrative worldwide low - carbohydrate industry has been born .
It reached its peak in the Nineties with Hollywood stars such as Renee Zellweger and Jennifer Aniston among its high - profile devotees .
But health concerns about the Atkins ' focus on fat and meat at the expense of fruit and vegetables meant it was always considered contentious by diet experts , and although many people lost weight , few devotees were ever able to stick with its draconian restrictions for very long .
Contentious : Since Dr Atkins launched the original diet in the Seventies , millions have tried it , and a fantastically lucrative worldwide low - carbohydrate industry has been born
Now a trio of American doctors , who scrutinised the diet and more than 150 studies of its impact on health and weight loss , have come up with a healthier , easier and more effective version .
Instead of insisting on a turgid diet of steak , eggs and yet more steak , dripping in butter ( but with a small salad garnish ) , their New Atkins Diet allows you to enjoy vegetables , berries , potatoes , and even bread , while still losing weight .
Better still , they say , the diet works so well that you could shed as much as a stone in the first two weeks .
Although many of the basic Atkins ' principles remain ( protein with every meal , restricted carbohydrates , no sugar ) the new diet is more health - conscious than before .
MEAT FEAST
In 2000 the Atkins Diet had around 2 million followers including Geri Halliwell and Kim Cattrall
Old Atkins allowed you as much protein as you could eat .
New Atkins recommends 4 - 6 oz with each meal ( 8 oz for tall men ) , which is within healthy recommended amounts .
Vegetables are allowed from day one - so much so that even vegetarians and vegans can follow this version of the diet .
Berries , nuts and legumes ( chickpeas , kidney beans , lentils ) and alcohol can be re-introduced after two weeks , and once you get within 10lb of your goal weight , wholegrains ( bread , rice , even pasta ) are back on the menu .
Coffee , once banned , is positively encouraged on the back of research which shows moderate caffeine intake boosts long - term health ( it contains several antioxidants ) and its fat - burning properties mean it may help with the regulation of body weight .
COMBAT ATKINS 'FLU '
In the first few weeks on Atkins , many dieters suffer with headaches , dizziness , weakness , fatigue and constipation .
Although some blame caffeine withdrawal ( no longer necessary as coffee and diet drinks are permitted on New Atkins ) , these symptoms are also caused by the dramatic shift in fluid , and therefore salt , caused by the low - carb diet .
This can be countered by drinking lots of water and keeping salt intake up ( New Atkins recommends at least half a teaspoon of salt a day or 2tbsp of soy sauce ) .
If symptoms persist , try temporarily increasing carbohydrates a little by adding more vegetables , nuts or seeds to the diet , cutting back again when you feel better .
Furthermore , the new diet introduces a merciful element of choice and its basic principles are easily customised to suit your individual metabolism , goals or time frame .
Anyone with less than a stone to lose , for instance , has the option of skipping the fast - track - first phase and kicking off their diet with a wider choice of dietary options .
But if you 've spent years yo - yo dieting , you are over - 50 , or your body has an in - built resistance to weight loss , you are encouraged to spend as long on the first phase as you think you need .
And when you reach your target weight you can ease into an individually tailored maintenance plan that allows you to gauge your reactions to certain carbohydrates and adjust your long - term eating habits accordingly .
The key to success on the new Atkins is keeping a close eye on your daily intake of what the authors call ' net carbs ' ( also called digestible carbs or impact carbs ) .
On old Atkins you were expected to add up the total grams of carbohydrate you consumed in a day , keeping it under 20g ( which is very low indeed ) .
New Atkins thinks in terms of ' net carbs ' , which you calculate by taking total carbs ( in grams ) minus fibre ( in grams ) .
The idea is that because fibre is indigestible and so does n't impact your blood sugar levels you can subtract the number of grams of dietary fibre from the total number of carbohydrate grams in any food , to find its true net carb value .
Cooked green beans , for example , may contain 4.9g of carbohydrate per half cup , but 2g of that is fibre , so the net carbohydrate value is 2.9g .
Lettuce is 1.4g of carbohydrate per cup , but more than half of that ( 1g ) is fibre .
The result is you can eat more carbohydrates on new Atkins , increase your intake of healthy foods , and still lose weight .
BANNED !
On the Atkins diet you just have to get used to life without the following : Fruit juice and sweetened fizzy drinks .
Foods made with flour and / or sugar including white bread , pasta , pastries , biscuits , cakes and sweets .
Food with any sugar .
Low fat or diet foods ( usually high in carbs ! ) .
Junk food .
Chewing gum , breath mints , cough syrups which may contain sugar .
Foods with added trans fats .
As your weight drops and you progress through the diet plan , you are encouraged to slowly re-introduce carbohydrates - in a specific order , one carbohydrate source at a time - to a maximum of 95g of net carbs per day , without gaining weight .
The beauty of this is that if any food triggers cravings , causes a tummy upset or interferes with weight loss success , it can be easily identified and then avoided .
The idea is to start with the foods you should be eating most often , and build to the foods you will be able to enjoy occasionally , depending on your individual tolerance for carbohydrates , in this order :
Leafy greens and low - carb vegetables .
Dairy foods high in fat and low in carbs ( cream , sour cream , hard cheese ) .
Nuts and seeds ( not chestnuts ) .
Berries , cherries , melon ( not watermelon ) .
Whole milk yogurt , cottage cheese and ricotta .
Legumes ( chickpeas , lentils etc ) .
Tomato and vegetable juice .
Fruit ( not dried or juice ) , higher - carb vegetables ( squash , carrots , peas ) .
Whole grains ( brown rice , wholemeal pasta and bread ) .
Carb - counting : Order a bowl of olives instead of reaching for the bread basket
NOW EATING OUT ISN'T A CHORE
One of the greatest complaints about old Atkins was dealing with restaurants and eating out .
New Atkins is easier .
As long as you steer clear of refined carbohydrates in the form of white bread , white rice , anything thickened or coated in flour , deep - fried or breaded , there is a wealth of choice .
Be on guard for hidden carbohydrates : gravy is usually thickened with flour , sugar lurks in salad dressings and may even appear in coleslaw and other deli salads .
Even smaller restaurants often post their menus online , so try to decide what you 're going to order before you arrive to avoid being tempted to try less suitable dishes .
Select simple grilled or roasted meats or fish but avoid stews , which may contain potatoes or other starchy vegetables .
Restaurants love repeat customers , so do n't hesitate to ask what 's in a dish .
Then specify any changes you want such as salad dressings or sauces on the side .
Make a habit of asking for an additional portion of vegetables or a side salad in lieu of potatoes .
SWEET SURPRISE
Dessert options that are allowed : CHOCOLATE PUDDING :
Whip together 2tbsp of double cream , 1tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder , with sweetener and a drop of vanilla essence .
Add 1tsp of instant coffee granules for a mocha twist .
Add 1tbsp of unsweetened shredded coconut .

TRY THESE TYPICAL DAILY MENUS
In the initial fast - track phase of the New Atkins , you are encouraged to eat protein with each meal , and confine yourself to a daily carb intake of 20 net grams , from salad ( up to three bowls a day ) , and vegetables ( two cups a day - choose from more than 50 options steamed , sautéed , roasted or stir - fried ) .
BREAKFAST : 2 fried eggs plus avocado with no -sugar salsa .
SNACK : Cup cucumber slices and 2 slices Cheddar cheese .
LUNCH : Can tuna , 2 cups mixed green salad with cup cooked broccoli , spring onions , 4 pieces of marinated artichoke hearts and salad dressing
SNACK : Roast turkey slices .
DINNER : Beefburger ( no bun ) wit tablespoons sautéed onions , cup mushrooms , 2 slices Cheddar cheese and 2 cups green salad with dressing .
Typical menu : Breakfast could be two fried eggs served with avocado and salsa ; dinner could be a beefburger with salad and cheese - but leave out the bun
After two weeks , you can slowly increase your daily carb intake ( from 25g to 50g ) until you find your personal tolerance for consuming carbs while continuing to lose weight .
Sticking to the principles above , you can now reintroduce berries , nuts , seeds and some legumes ( beans ) which are relatively low in carbs and packed with antioxidants and fibre .
Alcohol is permitted , but it 's a good idea to stick to wine or spirits and sugar - free mixers in moderation ( drinking slows fat burning and may hinder weight loss ) .
When you are about 10 lb from your goal weight , you should be ready to broaden the range of acceptable whole food carbohydrates in the form of other fruits , starchy vegetables , dairy products and finally whole grains ( although not everyone can eat these on a regular basis ) .
Protein - rich :
Try a grilled chicken salad with peanut sauce for a healthy lunch
BREAKFAST : 2 - egg omelette with cup grated cheese , and 1 medium orange .
SNACK : 2 oz pine nuts and 4 oz tomato juice .
LUNCH : Grilled chicken with 2 tablespoons of peanut sauce , and a mixed salad of 2 cups lettuce , cup peppers , 2 medium carrots , cup sweetcorn , with Italian dressing .
SNACK : 1 apricot and cup cottage cheese .
DINNER : Lamb kebabs with cup raita , 1 cup low - carb ( or wholemeal ) pasta , 1 cup Brussels sprouts , a salad of 2 cups lettuce , 1 medium carrot grated , with vinaigrette .

NEXT WEEK : ATKINS FOR LIFE ?
HOW TO STICK TO YOUR DIET
Even the administration seems tentative about when Iran will exceed American tolerance .
In the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies , several senior officials complain — though never on the record — that President Obama and his staff have not clearly defined when Iran will gain a “ nuclear weapons capability . ”
Many argue that similar indecision preceded the day in 2006 when Mr. Bush woke up to discover that North Korea had conducted a nuclear test .
So what is the argument for containment ?
Basically , it assumes that if China and Russia changed over decades , so might Iran .
And nuclear weapons can handcuff a nation as easily as they can empower it .
Last week , at the University of Oklahoma , Mr. Brzezinski argued that either an Iranian bomb or an attack on Iran would be “ a calamity , a disaster . ”
He said containment could work because Iran “ may be dangerous , assertive and duplicitous , but there is nothing in their history to suggest they are suicidal . ”
Nevertheless , in their Foreign Affairs essay , James Lindsay and Ray Takeyh concede that the Iran case differs substantially from the cold war ones , and that a successful strategy today would have to recognize that fact .
They urge Mr. Obama to prescribe three explicit no - go zones for the Iranians : “ no initiation of conventional warfare ” against another nation ; “ no transfer of nuclear weapons , materials , or technologies ” ; no increase in support for terrorists .
The penalty , they argued , would have to include “ military retaliation by any and all means necessary , ” including the use of nuclear weapons .
It is a logical list .
But there is a counterargument :
Why would Iran believe the threat if the United States , having said it would never allow Iran to get a nuclear capability , then allowed it ?
In fact , the administration is deep into containment now — though it insists its increases in defensive power in the Gulf are meant to deter a conventional attack by Iran .
If Iran ’s threat went nuclear , America might have to extend its nuclear umbrella as well .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates carefully stepped around that option last week while in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , trying to reassure leaders who increasingly fear the prospect of an Iranian bomb .
Mr. Gates defended the sanctions strategy : “ I think the prospects of success are certainly better than in a lot of other situations where sanctions have been applied , ” he said .
But he spent most of his time explaining the need for “ defensive capabilities ” against Iranian missiles .
Few doubt the missile threat can be contained .
Strategists worry more that Iran might slip a crude weapon or nuclear material to terrorists , betting it could n’t be traced back to Tehran .
( It ’s not a bad bet — the science of “ nuclear attribution ” is a lot weaker than it seems on “ 24 . ” )
Yet another argument against containment comes from Brent Scowcroft , the national security adviser under Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush .
“ The ultimate consequence of trying to contain Iran has little to do with Iran itself , ” he argues .
“ The biggest risk is that it will start an eruption of proliferation ” around the Gulf , starting with Turkey , Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
They would doubt the American deterrent capability , he said , and the problem would spread to Japan and South Korea .

Here are 16 plants that could clean your air for just the price of a few drops of water each day .
First lets check some of the evidence behind the claim that plants can purify your household air :
1. NASA Research
A NASA research document came to the conclusion that “ house plants can purify and rejuvenate air within our houses and workplaces , safeguarding us all from any side effects connected with prevalent toxins such as formaldehyde , ammonia and also benzene . ”
Here are the results of the NASA research study :

Clever Glass Inventor Wins $ 72 Million Loan Guarantee From Nobel Prizewinning Chu's DOE
March 5th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
Sage Electrochromics , Inc , a Minnesota - based inventor of an international breakthrough glass innovation – a window that can be switched on or off to reject up to 98 % of the sun ’s heat and light on demand – has received a financial shot in the arm from the Obama administration Department of Energy for a total of $ 103 million .
[ social_buttons ]
Earlier this year , the company had been one of the recipients of the Recovery Act funded Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credits ( for $ 31 million ) , and today was offered an additional $ 72 million loan guarantee to help it invest in a 250,000 square foot high volume manufacturing facility to ramp up operations to mass produce its energy - saving glass .
“ This investment will help cut utility bills , reduce carbon pollution , and create jobs our economy needs , ” said Energy Secretary Secretary Chu in granting the loan guarantee .
“ It ’s a perfect example of the power of American innovation to create a stronger economy and a healthier planet . ”
Globally , this is a breakthrough technology – an electronically tintable glass that can be switched from clear to darkly tinted and back at the push of a button .
It could radically reduce world energy use , as it makes it possible to switch windows on or off , reducing building energy use by as much as 28 % .
The company had been working with the NREL to develop and perfect its “ sunglasses for buildings ” that can be switched on to allow only 3.5 % of heat and light in , in its tinted state .
This means that it eliminates virtually all solar heat gain on hot afternoons .
Their SageGlass® is made the same way that regular energy - efficient low-e glass is made .
The company coats regular glass with layers of metal oxides using a vacuum deposition process called “ sputtering . ”
By shooting a low - voltage current though the coatings , the company manipulates how the glass absorbs or reflects light and heat from the sun .
The difference is that the emissivity of this glass can be controlled by a switch .
On sunny winter days when you want the maximum sunlit warmth coming in your windows , you can leave it turned off , and warm up the house .
On hot sunny summer days , you can “ put on sunglasses ” and stay visually connected to the outdoors , but be protected from the glare and the heat gain .
Obviously the energy ramifications are hugely significant for two reasons .
Buildings use 40 % of our energy , mostly for heating and cooling .
This breakthrough assists both by making passive solar design much more effective .
Passive design capitalizes on the fact that the sun travels much lower in the sky in winter , so that porches or overhangs over large South facing windows can do much to cool in Summer and warm in Winter for free .
In addition , buildings have no dirty denier industry funding disinformation to prevent changes in dirty energy use .
Architects are more typically part of an educated class that does not reject the need to reduce fossil energy use to slow climate change .
For both these reasons , this breakthrough could really change energy use .
Also , this could affect how we design buildings : on sunny days , when the tint is turned on , it is virtually impossible to see inside , giving many more people , in an increasingly crowded world , the privacy and visual connection to the world outside .
Great work and kudos to NREL , Sage Electrochromics , and the innovation - friendly Obama administration Department of Energy !

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
1955 : Computer pioneer Doug Ross demonstrates the Director tape for MIT ’s Whirlwind machine .
It 's a new idea : a permanent set of instructions on how the computer should operate .
Six years in the making , MIT 's Whirlwind computer was the first digital computer that could display real - time text and graphics on a video terminal , which was then just a large oscilloscope screen .
Whirlwind used 4,500 vacuum tubes to process data .
The Whirlwind occupied 3,300 square feet and was the fastest digital computer of its time .
It also pioneered a number of new technologies , including magnetic core memory for RAM .
Another one of its contributions was Director , a set of programming instructions on paper tape that is regarded as the predecessor of operating systems in computers .
The Director was designed to issue commands to the four - year - old Whirlwind machine .
The idea was to eliminate the need for manual intervention ( . pdf ) in reading the tapes for different problems during a computing session .
The Director tape would communicate with the computer through a separate input reader .
That means different tapes with various problems to be computed would be recognized and appropriately processed .
A Director tape would make a complete run possible by pushing a single button .
Programmers John Frankovich and Frank Helwig wrote the first Director tape program .
The software concept was to connect a Flexowriter – a mechanical , heavy - duty tape reader – to a newer , faster photoelectric tape reader .
This allowed the team to feed the spliced - together paper tapes directly to Whirlwind , without having a separate human operator .
Lead programmer Doug Ross finally demonstrated it in 1955 .
The Director tape was also probably the first example of a Job Control Language–driven operating system .
JCL is a scripting language used on mainframe operating systems to instruct them how to run a batch job or start a subsystem .
The Whirlwind is credited with leading to development of the SAGE , or Semi-Automatic Ground Environment , system used by the U.S. Air Force .
It 's also said to have influenced most of the computers of the 1960s .

THE less jurors know about DNA science , the more likely they are to be swayed by it and find an accused person guilty , research has shown .
Known as the ' ' white - coat syndrome ' ' , this tendency to be overwhelmed by experts could mean there is a danger jurors place undue weight on scientific evidence .
But a 20 - minute presentation to jurors significantly increases their understanding of DNA and its use in criminal trials , and will make them more sceptical and reduce the likelihood they will convict .
These are the findings of a study to be released by the Australian Institute of Criminology today .
'' The greater understanding increases their objectivity about the evidence of the experts .
When there is greater understanding of the evidence , there are fewer miscarriages of justice , '' said the lead researcher , Jane Goodman - Delahunty .
Even defence lawyers and judges were caught by this , she said .
'' I think because DNA evidence has attained a status where the underlying science is no longer so controversial that many defence lawyers no longer challenge it and show its fragilities , '' she said .

It seems longer , but it was only seven years ago that the Human Genome Project deciphered the sequence of the 3 billion nucleotides that make up a single human blueprint or genome .
That project cost more than $ 3 billion and took 13 years .
But the speed of sequencing has been increasing dramatically while the cost has been dropping in a similar fashion .
On Wednesday , researchers revealed the sequences of the genomes for five more people , bringing the total number of known genomes close to 20 .
The new findings are a " technological tour de force , " said Story Landis , director of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke .
But what makes the technology even more impressive , she said , is that these were whole genomes of people that provided " very interesting stories about rare diseases . "
Dr. James Lupski of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston was diagnosed with Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease in his teens , as were three of his seven siblings .
The genetic disease , often called CMT , affects about one in every 2,500 Americans and is caused by a loss of function in nerves , impeding the transmission of electrical impulses that control movements and sensory information sent back to the brain .
Because nerves to the feet have the longest distance to travel , the extremities are the first things to be affected .
The disorder produces foot deformities , drop foot and other difficulties that can be corrected surgically .
Lupski has so far had 10 orthopedic procedures to help overcome his problems .
There is no cure for CMT , only treatments that alleviate symptoms .
Inspired by his condition , Lupski , 53 , pursued a doctorate in genetics and a medical degree , migrating to Baylor after his graduation .
There , he began looking into the genetics of CMT .
In 1991 , his laboratory discovered that duplicate copies of a gene caused some cases of CMT , but not his own .
Since then , researchers around the world have discovered 30 other genetic variants that are linked to the disorder and 10 other locations on chromosomes that appear to carry genes associated with it .
Each of those genetic variations interferes with nerve transmission at a different location , but the illnesses they produce are all very similar .
" But each time we would check my family , we did not find the mutation , " he said .
A few years ago , Dr. Richard Gibbs , director of Baylor 's Human Genome Sequencing Center , asked Lupski to participate in sequencing the genome of James Watson , co-discoverer of the structure of DNA .
After that project was completed , Gibbs and Lupski were chatting at a meeting when they decided to sequence Lupski 's genome .
" The sequencing went very rapidly , but the analysis took a lot of time , " Lupski said .
" All of a sudden , you have 90 billion bases to sift through . "
Ultimately , the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine , they discovered two separate mutations in a gene called SH3TC2 .
One was a so - called nonsense mutation that inserted a wrong amino acid in the target protein , rendering it only partially functional .
The second was a stop mutation that caused production of that protein to be terminated prematurely , producing a dysfunctional protein .
[ Updated on March 11 at 8:40 a.m. :
The story incorrectly defined the two mutations .
One is a nonsense mutation that causes production of a protein to be terminated prematurely .
The second is a missense mutation that causes an incorrect amino acid to be inserted into the protein , rendering it only partially functional . ]
Before Lupski left the East Coast , where he was raised , he banked blood samples from his grandparents , his parents and his siblings for use in future studies .
When the team looked at the samples , they found that Lupski's father and his grandmother carried one of the mutations and his mother carried the second .
His three siblings who suffered from CMT all inherited both mutations , while the four unaffected siblings had only one and did not develop the disease .
The team also discovered that the gene mutations had recently been discovered in a family of Spanish Gypsies .
Other researchers had already produced an animal model of CMT in which the gene had been inactivated in mice and were studying its function .
They found that the gene plays a role in an intracellular mechanism called endocytic recycling , which is crucial for the health of the cell .
Interestingly , two other gene variants have also been linked to endocytic recycling and researchers are studying intervention with small molecules to bolster the process .
Lupski hopes that work may lead to similar progress with his gene .
Surprisingly , electrophysiology studies of the family members found that people who carry only one copy of either defective gene may not develop CMT , but they are not free from nerve problems .
The gene Lupski inherited from his mother confers an increased susceptibility to carpal tunnel syndrome , also known as repetitive motion syndrome .
Such people suffer severe pain from compression of the medial nerve where it crosses the wrist .
The gene carried by his father and grandmother produces mild neuropathy of the axons that carry nerve impulses .
" By no means do I think we will have an instant cure , but the epiphany from understanding this is quite remarkable , " Lupski said .
" This is a milestone in the field of CMT disease .
We have gone from being totally in the dark to having enough light to see which direction to go in .
But we are not in the bright light of having something " that could be a treatment .
The second report , published online in the journal Science by researchers from the University of Utah and the University of Washington , marks the first time in which the complete genomes of four members of a single family have been sequenced .
The report does not identify the subjects , but the Salt Lake Tribune identified them as the wife and two adopted children of researcher Lynn B. Jorde of the University of Utah and the children 's biological father .
The family has been active in advocating genetic research .
The mother , Debbie Jorde , and the unidentified biological father are both healthy .
But the two adult children , Logan and Heather Madsen , are two of only 30 people worldwide known to suffer from Miller 's syndrome , which is characterized by facial and limb malformations .
The incidence is believed to be about one in 10,000 people .
But in an exceptionally rare genetic double whammy , both children also suffer from primary ciliary dyskinesia or PCD , an equally rare condition in which the tiny hair - like cilia that are supposed to remove mucus from the lungs do not work properly .
The odds of having both diseases are thought to be about one in a billion .
The cause of PCD was previously known .
But " until now we did n't know what caused [ Miller 's syndrome ] , " Lynn Jorde told the Tribune .
" We did n't even know if it was genetic .
Now we have the causal gene and we understand how it is transmitted . "
The gene that causes Miller 's , the team found , is called DHOHD , and it is a metabolic building block , which means it could possibly be treated nutritionally , the team said .
The study also provided some other valuable information .
Researchers had previously believed that each parent contributes about 75 genetic mutations -- most of them unimportant -- to each child .
But by analyzing the genomes of both the parents and the children , the team found that each parent contributed less than half that number , only about 30 .
They were also able to identify precise locations on the chromosomes where they break apart to allow recombination of genes contributed by both the mother and father .
That knowledge should prove extremely useful in future studies .
The actual sequencing of the genomes was performed by Complete Genomics Inc. of Mountain View , while the academic researchers performed the interpretation of the results .
It is now possible to sequence a complete genome for as little as $ 5,000 , according to Landis -- still a little bit too pricey for everyone to have his genome studied .
But experts think that , within a couple of years , the price will be closer to $ 1,000 , which will make the technique much more widely available .
The next big logjam , she added , will be in computer processing of the accumulated data .
Researchers supported by the government have to post complete sequences online , and " the rate at which sequences will need to be archived is going to be mind - boggling .
The other challenge will be developing the computational ability to sort through all the sequences and make sense of them . "

There are a lot of reasons why Laura Skandera Trombley spent 16 years working on a book about a woman whom generations of Mark Twain biographers dismissed as inconsequential to his life .
But the biggest catalyst was the 450 - page elephant in the room -- a manuscript
Twain wrote in his final years savaging the reputation of his former personal assistant , Isabel Van Kleek Lyon .
That manuscript , never published but well known to Twain scholars , had little in common with “ The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ” and the other books that made Twain one of the nation ’s first celebrities .
At its heart , Trombley believes , the manuscript was a blackmail tool , a libelous screed against Lyon , whose life Twain was fully prepared to ruin to protect family secrets and his place in American history .
Early biographers believed the manuscript ’s details , including Twain ’s charge that Lyon tried to seduce him , to be true and that Lyon ’s role in Twain ’s life was too minute to bother with .
But Trombley saw the work as an elaborate lie and wondered why Twain would bother .
Her speculation turned into obsession , and eventually into “ Mark Twain ’s Other Woman : The Hidden Story of His Final Years ” ( Alfred A. Knopf : 332 pp. , $ 27.95 ) , her third book dealing with Twain ’s life and legacy .
In the new book , Trombley dissects the long - dismissed relationship between Twain and Lyon , whose ambitions brought her to the upper levels of American letters before Twain cast her off , publicly vilifying her to reporters as a conniver and thief .
Advertisement
In the end , Trombley says , Lyon became the victim of Twain ’s jealous daughter , Clara , and the fears of “ an old man being overwhelmed and just at that point really emotionally reacting to converging forces .
And one of those was the loss of his wife . ”
“ Nobody had ever really spent much time writing about it , ” says Trombley , a Twain scholar whose day job is president of Claremont ’s Pitzer College .
“ When you think about it , here ’s Twain in the last years of his life , 450 pages he devotes to this .
Why would n’t you make this a major big deal ? ”
Trombley has proved to be adept at peeling back Samuel L. Clemens ’ carefully constructed persona and forcing scholars to reconsider some basic assumptions , says Bruce Michelson , professor of English at the University of Illinois , and president of the Mark Twain Circle of America .
Breaking the ‘ boys club ’
Advertisement
Michelson , in fact , credits Trombley and fellow Twain scholar Susan Harris of the University of Kansas for challenging the conclusions of what he described as “ pretty much a boys ’ club . ”
Their research has forced Twain experts to recognize that women were the “ majority party ” in his adult life and made up the majority of his book - reading audience in his lifetime , Michelson said .
Their research showed that “ scholars had to come down from the tree - house and take down the ‘ Men Only ’ sign . ”
Michelson says he has n’t read Trombley ’s new work yet but lauded her decision to take on the subject of Twain ’s last years , which form a “ special sort of mystery and [ are ] a mess to deal with .
. . .
He was bereaved ; he had lost most of his money ; his health was compromised ; his celebrity had slipped away from his grip and taken on a life of its own ; his friends and family and opportunists were fighting over what was left of him and his legacy . ”
Twain ’s fame began with journalistic accounts of his travels , which led to the books “ The Innocents Abroad ” and “ Roughing It . ”
He was just building his reputation when he married Olivia Langdon in 1870 in Elmira , N.Y .
Olivia became , in many ways , the steadying rudder in his life .
One of Trombley ’s earlier books , “ Mark Twain in the Company of Women , ” was her first major assault on conventional beliefs about Twain , arguing convincingly that Twain ’s best work , including “ Huckleberry Finn , ” came when he was living in Hartford and surrounded by women : his wife and their three daughters ( a son had died at 19 months ) , Susy , Clara and Jean .
All but Clara would die before Twain .

Trombley believes the influence of women on Twain , including his wife ’s introducing him to leading social issues of the day , has been wrongly dismissed by chroniclers , beginning with Twain ’s hand - picked biographer and first literary executor , Albert Bigelow Paine .
But Trombley thinks there ’s more at play behind the marginalization of Lyon than blinders on the biographers ’ eyes .
She believes Twain and Clara exerted control over those early scholars .
Why ?
Trombley believes it was because of Twain ’s outspoken positions on adultery , and his fear for his legacy and Clara ’s financial well - being .
The points of friction in the story of Twain and Lyons mirror a Victorian drama .
Clara Clemens inherited much of her father ’s personality -- particularly his personal insecurity , the need to be the center of attention , a quick temper and a long memory .
An aspiring singer with modest talent , after the turn of the century she traveled the U.S. and Europe performing with a classical pianist named Charles Wark , who was married , and with whom Clara fell in love .
She began an affair that eventually gave rise to newspaper reports that Wark ’s wife accused Clara of “ alienation of affection , ” though Trombley could find no evidence of a lawsuit having been filed .
At first , Twain was kept in the dark about the affair .
But once he learned of it , he was mortified , forced Clara to end the relationship and steered her into a marriage she did n’t want to conductor Ossip Gabrilowitsch .
And though few people were aware , Lyon knew all the intimate details -- and , in fact , had helped keep the truth from Twain .

“ He was very keenly aware of public opinion , and he was 19th century enough that things like adultery and forced marriages , he thought that that would detract from his public persona , ” Trombley says .
An added ingredient was Clara ’s jealousy of Lyon , whom she felt was her competition for her father ’s attention .
And she was right .
Lyon joined the Clemens household in 1902 while Olivia was still alive but largely bed - ridden .
Age 38 and ambitious , she insinuated herself into the family , taking over Olivia ’s role in running the household .
After Olivia died , Trombley believes , Lyon made an unsuccessful romantic play for Twain .
Her letters recount late - night talks and card games and a family intimacy -- the last of which may have been the genesis for Twain ’s accusation that she tried to seduce him .
Lyon ’s main interest was security .
In that era , career options for women were limited , and marrying well also meant securing a future .
Lyon eventually married Ralph W. Ashcroft to blunt rumors that she was Twain ’s mistress , and persuaded Twain to give her 20 acres carved from his Stormfield estate near Redding , Conn. , where she built a house of her own while overseeing construction of Twain ’s final home .
The ousting of Lyon

It was that role that Clara would later use to drive a wedge between her father and her perceived rival .
In a stunningly rapid turn , Lyon was fired by Twain , who let himself be persuaded by trumped - up evidence from Clara that Lyon had stolen from him in the construction of the houses .
His health failing , Twain wrote his 450 - page dossier on Lyon and instructed Clara to keep it and his lawyer handy in case Lyon ever surfaced to reveal the affair with Wark , and the loveless marriage to Gabrilowitsch : “ He wanted to protect the brand , ” says Trombley .
“ Anything that would detract from the brand would ultimately mean a smaller amount of royalties .
You have narcissism and money .
It ’s a great combination . ”

Everybody here knew Travis the Chimp , whose owners drove him around in a tow truck , and Police Officer Frank Chiafari , on the job for 25 years , remembered playing with him when their paths would cross .
“ When I saw him , he was small and cute and friendly — he ’d wave at you , ” Officer Chiafari recalled .
“ Who would have ever thought when we were playing together , we ’d have this incident 15 years later ? ”
It has been a little over a year since Travis , the 14 - year - old , 200 - pound pet of Sandra Herold , 71 , mauled a family friend in Ms. Herold ’s driveway .
Officer Chiafari and another officer were the first to respond to Ms. Herold ’s 911 call , and after the chimpanzee attacked his vehicle and opened the driver - side door in the driveway , Officer Chiafari fatally shot Travis .
The story and its sensational underpinnings —
Travis lived like a human , eating steak and drinking wine and , when he became hostile the day of the attack , ingesting Xanax — swept the globe .
Travis had appeared in Old Navy and Coca - Cola commercials and on television shows ; the actress Morgan Fairchild , who had appeared beside him , called his death a “ sin . ”
Compiling Linux kernel for QEMU ARM emulator
[ EDIT ]
I have written a new updated version of this post here .
Last time I experimented on compiling bare - metal ARM programs and U - Boot ; now I want to compile a Linux kernel for an ARM architecture from scratch .
I do n’t have a physical ARM device handy , so I ’m using QEMU instead , as I ’ve already done before .
Both the mainline kernel and QEMU support the VersatilePB platform , so that ’s the target I chose for my tests .
The toolchain I ’ll be using is the CodeSourcery ARM EABI toolchain .
[ edit ]
From version 2010q1 of the toolchain , the manual explicitly says that the compiler is not intended for Linux kernel development ; it is anyway possible to use the GNU / Linux toolchain for the same scope . [ / edit ]
The vanilla kernel can be downloaded from kernel.org ; I took the latest at the moment ( version 2.6.33 ) and extracted it in a folder .
From that folder I ran :
make ARCH=arm versatile_defconfig
This command sets a predefined configuration , used in compilation , that is capable of building a kernel targeted to run inside the Versatile PB board .
I wanted to tweak it a little bit , so I ran :
make ARCH=arm menuconfig
I removed module support ( for simplicity ) and enabled EABI support as a binary format ( allowing also old ABI ) .
This is necessary to run software compiled with the CodeSourcery toolchain .
I exited the menu and saved the configuration , then I ran :
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- all
[ edit ]
If using the GNU / Linux toolchain , the command that must be used is , instead :
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- all
[ /edit ]
This will start the building of the kernel using the correct ARM compiler ; the build will create , among other binaries , a compressed kernel in a file called zImage located in “ arch / arm / boot “ .
This image can be run in QEMU using the following command ( assuming that you are in the “ arch / arm / boot ” directory ) :
qemu-system-arm - M versatilepb -m 128M - kernel zImage
QEMU will execute the Linux image : the kernel will display many boot messages and then it will complain that it did n’t find a root filesystem .
Let ’s then create the simplest filesystem we can do : it consists of a single “ Hello World ” executable , that can be built using the CodeSourcery GNU / Linux toolchain .
#include < stdio.h > void main ( ) { printf ( " Hello World !
" ) ; while ( 1 ) ; }
Note : an infinite loop is introduced because when Linux executes the first program in the root filesystem , it expects that the program does not exit .
Having the GNU / Linux ARM toolchain installed ( be aware that it is different from the bare EABI toolchain ) I ran :
arm - none - linux - gnueabi- gcc - static test.c -o test
This creates an executable ELF program for ARM , statically linked ( all the libraries that it needs are linked together in a single binary ) .
We can now create a simple filesystem using the cpio tool as follows :
echo test | cpio -o -- format=newc > rootfs
The cpio tool takes a list of files and outputs an archive ; the newc format is the format of the initramfs filesystem , that the Linux kernel recognizes .
The rootfs file in our case is a binary image of a filesystem containing a single file , that is the test ELF program .
QEMU can pass the filesystem binary image to the kernel using the initrd parameter ; the kernel must also know that the root filesystem will be located in RAM ( because that ’s where QEMU writes the initrd binary ) and that the program to launch is our test executable , so the command line becomes :
qemu-system-arm - M versatilepb -m 128M - kernel zImage - initrd rootfs - append " root=/dev/ram rdinit= / test "
The QEMU window will show the boot messages we saw before , but at the end of the execution a “ Hello World ! ” will be displayed .
The next step would be to create a working filesystem with a command shell and at least basic functionality .

Armada 2526 is a 4 x turn - based space strategy game , developed by Ntronium Games and published by Matrix Games .
In December 2009 I wrote a first impressions “ Armada 2526 – New 4 x space strategy game – First Impressions ” here at SpaceSector.com .
At the time the game was at version 1.01 and I still stand for most of what I wrote back then .
I invite you to read the first impressions before you read this review to have the full background about the game .
Since then Ntronium Games has released a new Armada 2526 patch ( v1.02 ) , that brought some nice new features and overall improvements to the game that undoubtedly contributed to a more finished and solid product .
So the scope of this review will be to give a more in - depth overview of the points that I did not grasp in the first impressions , after many more hours of game play , and I will also concentrate in providing you with information about the races , AI aspects , game setup customization , victory conditions , game balance , v1.02 enhancements , overall conclusions and game score .
Armada 2526 Scope
Armada 2526 follows on the footsteps of games like Master of Orion 2 , the Space Empires series , Galactic Civilizations , Sword of the Stars , StarTrek : Birth of the Federation and many other sci-fi TBS titles .
In this sense Armada 2526 provides the traditional 4x TBS space strategy gaming experience .
The Races are diverse and charismatic , but there is no central game story
Armada 2526 offers 12 races for the player to choose from .
There is no race customization option so you ’ll have to make your pick according to your liking since each of them has its own specific traits , victory conditions and gameplay styles .
In spite of having no race customization the races are sufficiently distinct , charismatic and in a sufficient number to give you more than enough options to choose from .
Each race will play quite differently due to their distinct traits and pursuits for victory however they all share the same technology tree and are allowed to build the same buildings and most of the available spaceships .
Armada 2526 Races
The story in Armada 2526 is … well there is no story in fact , only a background story for each race .
And although this might be ok and even pleasant to the hardcore fans of the genre , in the sense that people may come up with their own stories , this may shun the less core fans or other gamers that are novice to the genre .
So the game has no intro cinematic or background story , the player is thrown into the galaxy where he is expected to start writing his own tale from that point forward .
Game setup customization is rich and flexible
When you start your game you have the option to choose to play the tutorial , play a scenario or chose to customize your own game .
If it is your first game you definitely should start from the tutorial .
After that you probably will choose to generate your own custom game .
Customizing a game is simple and Armada 2526 does a very good job at providing you with lots of options .
You may choose the amount of stars in the galaxy or the way they are distributed .
You can set your galaxy size , the map type ( condensed or disperse ) , the enemy races , the number of turns you would like to play and the difficulty level .
Victory conditions variability add depth and re-playability
In Armada 2526 you win if you eliminate all your rivals or if you get the best score ( victory points ) when the number of turns you set at the beginning run out ( you may continue to play after that point if you want to ) .
Each race has its own traits , both negative and positive , but most importantly they have different victory conditions which lead to a different path to victory and ultimately a different style of play .
This is good because at the same time that this variety of victory conditions provides more gameplay options it also increases the game re-playability value which is a rather important feature every good game should always aim for .
For example playing with the Human race you get an unrest penalty and a psychic and hyperspace research fields penalty however you get a general research bonus .
You earn victory points if your population is happy enough and if you accomplished glorious victories during your game .
Armada 2526 : Game Customization Screen with Victory Conditions
If you play with the Unn Pirates you get radically different traits and victory conditions .
When playing with the Unn you get extremely low population penalty and suffer from high unrest and low - income , however you get more money from loot and have biological immunity .
You win with the Unn if you can get lots of money from booty and if you can achieve a decent amount of population .
The AI does the job
Generally speaking Armada ’s AI plays well .
Rival races really do well on wars and are good at the negotiating table , however at times the races do behave a bit erratically .
For example , the races sometimes reject extremely favorable deals and are very reluctant to accept some types of deals ( like trade offers ) or some times just start doing very repetitive behaviour stating demands that the player keeps refusing over and over .
During war the AI sometimes tends to create too many ships of one kind , like transports ships , colony ships or small ships .
With the intent to reduce high - micromanagement stress the game offers very nice automation options to the player .
If you want you can set colony management to automatic and set the development policy you ’d like to set up for that system from that point forward ( you can change the automation policy at any time ) .
For instance you may set a system to develop the military ( that will create more war ships ) , to develop defenses ( that will create more troops , missile bases and starbases ) , to develop research , improve income , increase population or just use a balanced development .
So in conclusion , although there are some minor deficiencies the AI in general does a very nice job and is quite coherent .
For instance the AI races seldom attack you with no clear reason , and will trade favorably with you if they like you and attack and reject deals if they do n’t like you .
The Music helps set the right atmosphere
The sound effects of Armada 2526 are not spectacular but the music is very good .
Some scores are even brilliant and really help set the mood , especially during the exploration and expansion phases were you do n’t know what lies beyond and which systems you expect to find .
The User Interface is ok but fails to provide enough control
Information is control and this is probably one of the aspects where Armada 2526 falls short .
But this is not saying that the User Interface is bad , far from it .
The UI is successful in providing basic functionality like colony management , research management , feature rich charts , good diplomacy screens and good system overview , however the UI does have its weaknesses .
When Armada 526 was first released ( v1.01 ) it had serious problems regarding the UI ( that you can read more about it in “ Armada 2526 – New 4 x space strategy game – First Impressions “ ) .
There were lots of information shortcomings .
For instance not knowing which fleets are stationed in a planet , not knowing enough details about each building ( which are the dependencies and which are the improvements ) , not knowing what the diplomacy indicators meant or how they are affected ( the manual was also poor at explaining this ) .
Some of this issues were solved in v1.02 ( the version released in early March 2010 ) while others were not yet sufficiently addressed .
There are also some basic functionalities missing in Armada 2526 like a planet list screen to present the player with all explored systems details : the planets that are colonized , not colonized , its mineral abundance , presence of asteroid fields , etc .
This is a key feature that is missing , in my opinion , since it becomes essential at some point to provide this information to the player so that he does not lose track of things , especially during the exploration and expansion phases of the game .
Armada 2526 : User Interface – Fleets Management
Another poor UI functionality is the fleets list management screen .
The fleets list really provides … well the list of ships , but does not categorizes or merges them in sufficiently meaningful ways .
For example you cannot sort the fleets list by type or by colony .
So what happens is that at late games , when you have dozens or hundreds of ships , you tend to lose control of them .
I speak by gaming experience , I tend to forget completely about the fleets list functionality in my games and this is not a good thing .
A word about patch v1.02
As said above Ntronium Games released a new patch for Armada 2526 in early March 2010 .
Among other fine - tune enhancements and fixes the patch provides a new automatic population transport system that alleviates the burden of having to micromanage population immigration between systems .
This was a nice improvement in my opinion .
It works well and relieves the player from unnecessary boring tasks of relocating population almost every other turn .
Some research and economy tweaks were also performed , like an option at game start - up to set the research speed ( to solve the issue of research techs running out too quickly ) or an option to reduce or eliminate the bureaucracy effect completely ( a found annoyance by many players ) .
But one of the most important features introduced by this patch was the overall improvement of information about the game , mostly done via tool - tips improvement which now includes a way to see the number of ships stationed in a designated area just by pointing the mouse cursor to it , among other information additions : the amount of discount on production an asteroid mining enterprise employs or the amount of pollution a technology complex produces among many other pieces of information .
For a complete list of patch features please check the Ntronium Forums v1.023 Full Changes List .
Bottom line
Armada 2526 is a very solid game , it is well designed and provides a good gaming experience to the player .
However it may not be for everybody , and in fact this is in line with the actual Ntronium philosophy which in its own words “ targets the discerning minority of hardcore strategy fans , rather than the mass market ” .
Armada 2526 is coherent with this motto , its non-linear sandbox mechanics allows ( or forces ) the player to make up their own stories and reduce the amount of micromanagement generally needed to accomplish some tasks .
The game also puts gameplay before graphics , which are nothing too fancy but just ok .
Another good aspect about Armada 2526 resides on the high - involvement of the player during the development process and the continuous improvement of the game by its developers .
The Armada 2526 game forums are very active with vibrant game discussions .
The developers are always willing to hear the player and most of the changes introduced by patch v1.02 were in fact in response to many suggestions and bugs reported by the community .
So in summary , if you ’re a hardcore fan of Sci -Fi TBS ( in the line of Master of Orion 2 , Galactic Civilizations 2 or StarTrek : Birth of the Federation ) or simply a fan of 4 x strategy games in general this is the right game for you to try next .
If you ’re a fan of strategy games in general you may also like Armada 2526 , but chances are that if you ’re not into this type of games probably , this is not the right title for you unless you want to start being a fan :)
You can buy Armada 2526 from Iceberg Interactive ( boxed version ) .
Alternatively you can buy Armada 2526 from GamersGate ( digital download version ) .
The Good :
– Variable victory conditions provide different gameplay styles and enhance re-playability
– Automation options relieve the player from boring micromanagement tasks
– Music is very good , setting the right atmosphere
– Races are distinct and charismatic
– AI is strong with only minor deficiencies
– Customer support is great , developer is continuously evolving the game The Bad :
– User Interface has some control shortcomings ( even after patch v1.02 )
– Some aspects about diplomacy are not streamlined and are a bit confusing
– Lack of campaign and central story may be ok for hardcore fans but bad for casual players

Clearly the abundance of pot-butter baked goods in the Bay Area has a trickle - down affect , especially when the baked goods in question are so colorful and enticing :
A fifth grader at Stoneman Elementary in Pittsburg brought a medical marijuana edible treat to school , made from delicious Fruity Pebbles , and proceeded to share it with some friends .
Apparently there was a narc in their midst , and the kid got busted .
Paramedics were called .
But unlike those lightweights in Union City , everybody could handle their high and no one had to be rushed off to the hospital .
( Note to persnickety commenters :
It is unclear from the story whether anyone actually got high , but cut us some slack . )
The kid swiped the treat from an older sister , and , we quote , " Police are looking into whether the older sister has a medical marijuana card . "
Cue the anti-pot people and cries about saving the children .

Nexon of America is putting up $ 1 million to help fund the creation of games from independent developers .
Titles chosen for the Nexon iNitiative will be sponsored , co-developed and published through Nexon 's distribution network , which currently spans more than 71 countries .
" Nexon is all about great games and The Nexon iNitiative is about finding the next generation of great game developers , " said Won Il Sue , Nexon Americas vice president of business development .
" It doesnt matter who you are , if youve got a great idea , we want to hear from you .
We re ready to fund , develop and publish the best of the best through our massive worldwide network .
" We know that there are a lot of developers out there , both professional and amateur , who feel frustrated at the barriers to getting a truly unique and innovative game developed and published .
The Nexon iNitiative is the place they can turn to with those great ideas that will sweep those barriers aside . "
Flash , client - based and ports from other platforms will be considered , said Nexon , with online titles receiving " serious consideration " .

Behavior from the brain
The Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience at Cal State L.A. , established in 2006 by Alicia Izquierdo , focuses on the brain regions and mechanisms that help us make decisions .
More specifically :
How are we able to modify our behavior when given new information ?
The lab ’s current projects are seeking answers on two main fronts :
The neural basis of adaptive decision - making
The effects of drugs of abuse on flexible behavior
Izquierdo is the first Cal State L.A. researcher with the Drug Enforcement Agency license and registration required for research that uses controlled substances , such as methamphetamine .
How rat model might help
A recently established rat model may help scientists understand the mechanisms behind diminished decision - making ability among humans using methamphetamines .
But just how much alike are the brains of rats and of humans ?
Decades of research have established many solid , clear correlations , said Alicia Izquierdo , director of The Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience at Cal State L.A .
“ The animal model has informed us about neurobiological mechanisms of disease .
This is true not only for addiction but for a multitude of diseases .
This is possible because we can empirically test the effects of ( for example ) drugs on brain anatomy and chemistry .
We therefore learn about what the neural circuitry does to support behavior . ”
“ There ’s a lot of overlap , ” she said .
“ Once you have a model in the rat , you can begin to theorize how it would work in humans . ”
Why she studies cognitive flexibility
Alicia Izquierdo summarizes the reasons for studying the effect of methamphetamine on cognitive flexibility , ( adapted from her National Institute of Drug Abuse grant abstract ) :
Methamphetamine ( mAMPH ) is a highly addictive psychostimulant and a growing public health concern , with a record of nearly 1.4 million people over the age of 12 using methamphetamine in the United States in 2005 .
In many regions of the United States , it is surpassed only by alcohol and marijuana as the most frequently used drug , often outpacing both heroin and cocaine abuse .
Those addicted to methamphetamine make poor , disadvantageous choices and relapse often .
The long - term goal of this project is to provide knowledge about the effects of methamphetamine on decision - making and the brain .
Despite an increased number of studies recently devoting attention to measuring mAMPH effects on learning and memory , no systematic investigation has been conducted on mAMPH 's impact on cognitive flexibility in either an animal model or in humans .
Cognitive flexibility is of vital importance to the success of an organism and refers to the ability to shift strategy given a new set of circumstances ....
We propose to study the effects of mAMPH on flexible cognition using a touch screen - based operant procedure sensitive to pharmacological manipulation in rodents ....
Our long - term goal is to reconcile our understanding of the neural circuitry that subserves flexible cognition with the pathological effects of drugs of abuse ....
Results arising from this project will enhance our understanding of the impact of mAMPH on flexible cognitive processes and increase our ability to identify therapeutic targets to ameliorate the poor decision - making arising from mAMPH abuse .
In 1969 , the Army Corps of Engineers accomplished an awesome feat :
They turned off Niagara Falls .
They did it to clean up the area , and check for structural integrity .
Here are pictures of this bizarre episode in structural engineering history .
These pictures were taken by tourists who visited the dry falls in 1969 .
Environmental design blog Mammoth explains the context :
For six months in the winter and fall of 1969 , Niagara 's American Falls were " de- watered " , as the Army Corps of Engineers conducted a geological survey of the falls ' rock face , concerned that it was becoming destabilized by erosion .
During the interim study period , the dried riverbed and shale was drip - irrigated , like some mineral garden in a tender establishment period , by long pipes stretched across the gap , to maintain a sufficient and stabilizing level of moisture .
For a portion of that period , while workers cleaned the former river - bottom of unwanted mosses and drilled test - cores in search of instabilities , a temporary walkway was installed a mere twenty feet from the edge of the dry falls , and tourists were able to explore this otherwise inaccessible and hostile landscape .

The Man Who Was Allergic to Radio Waves
Your cellphone does not in itself cause cancer .
But in the daily sea of radiation we all travel , there may be subtler dangers at work , and science is only just beginning to understand how they can come to affect people like Per Segerbäck so intensely
This week , the for - profit company responsible for calculating most of our credit scores announced some " new and troubling findings . "
Consumers with high FICO scores ( we 're talking 760 to 789 ) are now more likely to default on their home loan than on their unsecured credit card debt , Fair Isaac Corp. said .
This reversal of a long - held tenet came about not only because of the bad economy , company CEO Mark Greene said , but also because of " counterintuitive trends in consumer behavior . "
Let 's see .
Would that be like walking away from a home worth less than what you paid for it ?
Fair Isaac 's announcement is almost laughable .
Perhaps unintentionally , it points to a major problem facing FICO , its competitors and lenders -- credit scores are n't as accurate as they used to be .
Factors behind your credit score
Payment history , including adverse public records ( 35 percent )
Amounts owed ( 30 percent )
Length of credit history ( 15 percent )
Credit limits ( 10 percent )
Types of credit used ( 10 percent )
Median FICO score , April 2009 : 713
SOURCES : Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia ; Fair Isaac Corp .
It also shows why you should n't be as concerned about your credit score as this industry wants you to be .
Credit scores are based on history , after all .
And history has changed .
The main question is this :
If people with great credit scores are defaulting more often than expected on their real estate loans , how can lenders rely on the scores ?
I posed this question Thursday to Barry Paperno , consumer operations manager for Fair Isaac .
His response : Good question .
We 'll get back to you .
( The company responded in writing on Friday : " The newest FICO ... formula does the best job yet of any score on the market . "
See the firm 's full response in the comments below . )
Another question with no clear answer :
How will scores going forward reflect the extraordinary times of the past two years ?
' Free ' credit report ads can deceive
New rules taking effect in the coming year could curtail deceptive practices .
The credit reporting industry has gotten good at convincing people they need to know their credit histories -- even scores -- on an annual basis .
Unfortunately , they 've also used some deceptive tactics to market these scores , leading consumers to pay for reports they thought were free .
That practice could be curtailed in coming months , thanks to new rules taking effect in April and September .
Last week , the Federal Trade Commission amended its rules so that Web sites advertising " free " credit reports must link to free credit reports mandated by the government .
The confusion started seven years ago when Congress passed the
.
It required the three major credit - reporting bureaus to provide consumers a free report each year .
The law did not , however , provide scores for free -- you must pay extra for those .
The site where you can get reports entirely free is
. ( You can also call 877-322-8228 . )
But the most logical address -- FreeCreditReport.com -- belongs to Experian Information Solutions Inc. , one of the credit bureaus .
You can indeed go to that site , get a credit report and , for an extra $ 1 , your credit score .
But unless you read the fine print , you might not know that when you enter your credit card information , you also sign up for Experian 's credit - monitoring program .
That will cost you $ 14.95 a month .
It will be deducted right from your card account , unless you cancel within a seven - day trial period .
Thanks to this less than straightforward marketing , Congress this year ordered the FTC to put a stop to these practices .
Starting April 1 , online advertisers of " free " credit reports must post a notice directing consumers to the FTC 's site ,
, and
.
Ads on TV and radio must comply with the new rule by Sept. 1 .
Of course , it does n't help that the three major credit bureaus fold errors into your credit reports , essentially requiring you to check them regularly .
Just remember when you 're searching the Web for your complimentary credit report to use " annual , " not " free . "
-- Brent Hunsberger
Will they factor in the irresponsible lending , exotic financial instruments and irresponsive banks that forced people into short sales , foreclosures and other credit - damaging circumstances ?
After all , many borrowers with good credit scores took out subprime loans as the housing boom gathered steam , for reasons ranging from greed to naiveté to fraud .
Paperno's response :
We will .
We 've adjusted before .
Trust us .
" We are always redeveloping the scores based on the most current data available , " he said .
Unfortunately , that 's about all we can do .
Trust Fair Isaac .
Because the methods the company and its competitors use to develop credit scores are closely guarded .
Yet these numbers , in the recent debt bubble , wielded tremendous power .
Think about it .
Credit scores and their close cousins affect your homeowners and auto insurance rates .
They can determine the interest rate offered on your mortgage .
They can dictate the kind of credit card you get .
Even utilities are considering reporting billing histories to the nation 's major credit - reporting bureaus .
" The credit score agencies ' job is to sell credit scores , " said Calvin Bradford , a sociologist based in Virginia and longtime consultant for lenders on community reinvestment issues .
" They 've been very , very good at selling credit scores to consumers .
And to every industry you can think of . "
Economists say there might not have been anything wrong with FICO 's scoring system before the downturn , per se .
Lenders simply leaned too heavily on it .
In the height of housing run-up , lenders -- especially subprime lenders -- approved mortgages based solely on a person 's credit score .
They did this as fast as they could , because volume was key to their success , and nobody wanted to be left holding these " no - doc loans " when they went bad , Bradford said .
A 2005 study of mostly community banks found nearly half used credit scores and , most specifically , the score of the small - business owner , to underwrite small - business loans .
This surprised authors , since community banks trumpet how they lend based on relationships and other " soft " information .
In short , we became addicted to credit scores as we became hooked on debt .
Now , as we discard our debt , we need to end our credit - score fix , too .
Fortunately , we 've already started .
to limit many employers from using credit histories in hiring decisions .
Washington already has restricted the practice .
Late last year ,
Farmers Insurance Co. of Oregon $ 10,000 for violating state law when it used credit histories to re-rate customers ' auto and homeowners ' policies ( insurers still can use credit scores to deny you initial coverage ) .
" The problem is , certain entities are using credit scores for purposes they 're really not appropriate for , " said Chi Chi Wu , a staff attorney with the National Consumer Law Center , a consumer advocacy group .
Paperno , of Fair Isaac , answering a different question , echoed this assertion : " The score is n't a tool to reward you or penalize your past behavior .
It 's more to take what you 've done and predict ( behavior ) based on that . "
Even lenders are questioning the scores .
So says John Enyart , president of Portfolio Financial Servicing Co. , a Portland - based loan servicer .
His firm manages the billing and payments -- even some credit evaluations -- of $ 9 billion in commercial and consumer loans .
Enyart said lenders for months have been questioning why credit scores did n't predict the default rates they now see in their portfolios .
" The credit scoring model is broken , " he said .
" It has not held up the way we anticipated it would have . "
So , here 's what I suggest : Check your credit report every year if you want .
But do n't pay to know your score if you 're not applying for a loan .
It does n't matter that much .
Most consumers have a good idea of what it is anyway .
Nearly two in three consumers accurately estimated their credit scores in 2000 , according to a study by George Washington University marketing professor Vanessa Perry .
Only 5 percent underestimate them .
The nearly one - third of folks who overestimated scores , the study found , generally are less knowledgeable about what affects their scores and less likely to budget , save or invest regularly , Perry found .
Those results tell me that most of you do n't need to obsess about how to improve your score .
Borrow responsibly , and a good lender will lend you money whether your score is 650 or 750 .
Pay your bills on time .
Do n't keep high balances .
Borrow only when necessary .
Think twice before opening a new card or line of credit .
And if your card reduces your credit limit , there 's a simple fix .
Cut your balance outstanding , and your score should correct itself , Paperno said .
Because your score is based on the gap between your total balances and your total credit line , not the credit line itself .
Right now , Fair Isaac 's latest scoring model , FICO 8 , is being rolled out to lenders .
Unfortunately , it 's based mostly on loans made before the crisis .
And Paperno could not say when a newer model would replace it .
So , the assumptions behind these scores , until further notice , were not based on today 's reality .
As Greene of Fair Isaac suggests , we consumers no longer behave intuitively .
At least , not to the intuitions of FICO 's mathematicians .
" Credit scores were built in good times , " Wu said .
" It remains to be seen whether the mathematicians in FICO can adjust the models for bad times . "
A student working part - time in an Old Trafford catering kiosk has become the latest individual connected with Manchester United to claim he has felt the strength of the club 's backlash against protests targeting the Glazers .
Jerry Vyse , a first - year anthropology student at Manchester University , said he bought a green and gold scarf outside the ground and wore it during his half - time shift at last week 's Champions League match against Milan only to be sacked when he refused to remove it .
He said that supporters stocking up on half - time pies and Bovril cheered his stance and booed when his supervisor put the queue on hold and asked him to leave the kiosk , marching him to the office of the catering manager .
" I turned to the supervisor and asked him why I could not continue doing my job , " Vyse told Student Direct , the Manchester University newspaper and website .
" He said it was not because I was wearing a scarf because , if it had been a different colour , he would not have minded .
" MUFC will no doubt state that the decision was based on uniform policy – what he told me surely refutes that .
He said it was because it was ' anti- Glazer ' .
Does it not sniff a little bit like a dictatorship if not even the smallest of dissents can be made about an incredibly rich man who has more or less taken over the club ? "
The Champions League tie was largely seen as a triumph for the protesters targeting the Glazers and supporting a potential takeover bid from the self - styled Red Knights , with David Beckham donning a green and gold scarf as he left the pitch following loud protests during the game .
In an attempt to quell the dissent United have banned players from discussing the campaign , forbidden the inhouse TV channel MUTV from mentioning it and sacked a steward after 19 years ' service for attempting to return an anti-Glazer banner to its owners .
A spokesman for United said that Vyse did not comply with the club 's uniform policy and refused to remove the scarf when asked .
United 's chief executive , David Gill , today again defended the club 's business model as he unveiled its latest overseas sponsorship deal , with Turkish Airlines .
" People presuppose we have financial problems , " he said .
" We do not believe that is the correct situation .
We are very comfortable and we have a sensible business strategy that will continue for many years to come . "
The Glazers have hugely increased the club 's commercial revenues and plan to agressively target further expansion in overseas markets .
" We have 333 million followers and yesterday we celebrated 100 years at this great stadium , " said Gill .
" Our history and heritage means we can bring a lot to the table .
There is also a professionalism about us , so , whilst we are in an economic downturn , there are still many successful companies in the world who are investing in the future .
We are one of the quality partners big entities can still associate with . "
Looks like Apple 's going on the warpath , kids .
Just a few months after Cupertino got into it with Nokia over phone patents , Apple 's filed suit against HTC , alleging that the company is infringing 20 patents " related to the iPhone 's user interface , underlying architecture , and hardware . "
Steve , you have something to say ?
" We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions , or we can do something about it .
We 've decided to do something about it , " said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
" We think competition is healthy , but competitors should create their own original technology , not steal ours . "
We only learned of Apple 's actions based on your stories and Apple 's press release .
We have not been served yet so we are in no position to comment on the claims .
We respect and value patent rights but we are committed to defending our own innovations .
We have been innovating and patenting our own technology for 13 years .
put the full list of claims from the federal lawsuit below ,
Okay then .
We 're pulling the complaint filing now , we 'll let you know the exact details as soon as we learn them .
HTC just gave us a statement -- this is apparently coming totally out of the blue for them , since Apple has n't even served the complaint yet .
We mean it when we say this was all just filed in the past few hours -- it 's not yet in the court 's systems .
We just got the PDFs and but remember not to take the names of the patents literally or directly , since they do n't mean much .
We 'll poke each one apart and tease out what 's really at stake as we go along .
[ We 've now looked at each and every patent in both cases in - depth -- check it out here .]
We 've just learned that Apple submitted over 700 pages of exhibits to the District Court , which is a little nuts .
In addition , the ITC complaint lists a number of specific HTC handsets as exhibits , including the Nexus One , Touch Pro , Touch Diamond , Touch Pro2 , Tilt II , Pure , Imagio , Dream / G1 , myTouch 3G , Hero , HD2 , and Droid Eris .
That 's really a full range of HTC phones , running both Android and Windows Mobile , with and without Sense / TouchFLO .
Interestingly , the Android sets are specifically included because they run Android , while the WinMo sets are called out specifically for including DSP chips , not anything to do with Windows Mobile .
Dr. Andrew Erickson is a professor at the U.S. Naval War College ’s China Maritime Studies Institute and a Truman Security Fellow .
This is his first post for Danger Room ; these are solely his personal views .
Last week , Adm. Robert Willard , the head of U.S. Pacific Command ( PACOM ) , made an alarming but little - noticed disclosure .
China , he told legislators , was " developing and testing a conventional anti-ship ballistic missile based on the DF - 21 / CSS - 5 [ medium - range ballistic missile ] designed specifically to target aircraft carriers . "
What , exactly , does this mean ?
Evidence suggests that China has been developing an anti-ship ballistic missile , or ASBM , since the 1990s .
But this is the first official confirmation that it has advanced ( . pdf ) to the stage of actual testing .
If they can be deployed successfully , Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles would be the first capable of targeting a moving aircraft - carrier ( . pdf ) strike group from long - range , land - based mobile launchers .
And if not countered properly , this and other " asymmetric " systems – ballistic and cruise missiles , submarines , torpedoes and sea mines – could potentially threaten U.S. operations in the western Pacific , as well as in the Persian Gulf .
Willard 's disclosure should come as little surprise : China 's interest in developing ASBM and related systems has been documented in Department of Defense ( .pdf ) and National Air and Space Intelligence Center ( .pdf ) reports , as well as by the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) and the Congressional Research Service .
Senior officials – including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair ( .pdf ) and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead – have pointed to the emerging threat as well .
In November 2009 , Scott Bray , ONI 's Senior Intelligence Officer - China , said that Chinese anti-ship ballistic missile development " has progressed at a remarkable rate . "
In the span of just over a decade , he said , " China has taken the ASBM program from the conceptual phase to nearing an operational capability .…
China has elements of an [ over - the - horizon ] network already in place and is working to expand its horizon , timeliness and accuracy . "
When someone of Bray 's stature makes that kind of statement , attention is long overdue .
Equally intriguing has been the depiction of this capability in the Chinese media .
A lengthy November 2009 program about anti-ship ballistic missiles ( video ) broadcast on China Central Television Channel 7 ( China 's official military channel ) featured an unexplained – and rather badly animated – cartoon sequence .
This curious ' toon features a sailor who falsely assumes that his carrier ’s Aegis defense systems can destroy an incoming ASBM as effectively as a cruise missile , with disastrous results .
The full program is available in three segments ( parts 1 , 2 , and 3 ) on YouTube .
Skip to 7:18 on the second clip to view this strange , and somewhat disturbing , segment .
Likewise , Chinese media seem to be tracking PACOM 's statements about this more closely than the U.S. press .
The graphic above is drawn from an article on Dongfang Ribao ( Oriental Daily ) , the website of a Shanghai newspaper .
Beijing has been developing an ASBM capability at least since the 1995 - 96 Taiwan Strait Crisis .
That strategic debacle for China likely convinced its leaders to never again allow U.S. carrier strike groups to intervene in what they consider to be a matter of absolute sovereignty .
And China 's military , in an apparent attempt to deter the United States from intervening in Taiwan and other claimed areas on China 's disputed maritime periphery , seems intent on dropping significant hints of its own progress .
U.S. ships , however , will not offer a fixed target for China 's DF - 21D anti-ship ballistic missiles .
Military planning documents like the February 2010 Joint Operating Environment ( .pdf ) and Quadrennial Defense Review ( .pdf ) clearly recognize America ’s growing " anti-access " challenge , and the QDR – the Pentagon 's guiding strategy document – charges the U.S. military with multiple initiatives to address it .
In a world where U.S. naval assets will often be safest underwater , President Obama ’s defense budget supports building two submarines a year and investing in a new ballistic - missile submarine .
And developing effective countermeasures against anti-ship ballistic missiles is a topic of vigorous discussion in Navy circles .
The United States is clearly taking steps to prevent this kind of weapon from changing the rules of the game in the Western Pacific , but continued effort will be essential for U.S. maritime forces to preserve their role in safeguarding the global commons .

EXCLUSIVE
Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has been accused of sexual assault by a young woman in Georgia , TMZ has learned .
The alleged incident occurred early this morning at Capital City -- a club in Milledgeville , Georgia .
According to law enforcement sources , the alleged victim -- who has already been interviewed by police -- was treated at a local hospital and released .
We 're told in addition to the alleged victim , witnesses are being interviewed -- and one law enforcement source says they will attempt to interview Roethlisberger .
In addition to the Milledgeville Police Dept , we 've learned the Georgia Bureau of Investigations is also investigating .
As we previously reported , Roethlisberger is being sued by a Reno woman , Andrea McNulty , who claims the QB sexually assaulted her in 2008 .
UPDATE : We 're told Ben Roethlisberger has already been interviewed by police .
We 're also told no formal charges have been filed at this point .
UPDATE 3:30 PM EST : A rep from the Steelers tells TMZ , " We are gathering information on this incident - until then we have no further comment . "

The behavior of just a few molecules of hydrogen peroxide in your cells could give you cancer .
But scientists have difficulty tracking individual molecules emerging from your body .
That changed last weekend , and could transform cancer treatments .

A group of researchers at MIT have devised a sensor made from carbon nanotubes and collagen , which can track single molecules of hydrogen peroxide as they leave any cell .
A release from MIT explains , " When the nanotubes come in contact with . . . hydrogen peroxide , their fluorescence flickers .
By counting the flickers , one can obtain an accurate count of the incident molecules . "

The group performed their experiments by looking at the interaction between hydrogen peroxide and a cell receptor called EGFR , which involved in cell growth .
It is believed that hydrogen peroxide is involved in the cell growth process as well , including when growth goes awry in cancers .
Early results seem to bear this theory out , since the researchers discovered elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide molecules in skin cancer cells .
Chemical engineer Michael Strano , who worked on the sensor , said it could in the future become a common diagnostic tool .
He said , " You could envision a small handheld device , for example , which your doctor could point at some tissue in a minimally invasive manner and tell if this pathway is corrupted . "
In other words , you could use a future version of this sensor to figure out if your cells were emitting too many molecules of hydrogen peroxide - and possibly stop your cancer before it has a chance to start .

Into battle in the eco-war
FOR people who see stopping deforestation as the quickest climate - change win , Copenhagen seemed a success .
Although there is still work to be done on the initiative known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ) , the deal struck in Copenhagen made it into a real thing , not just an idea .
The notion of reducing net deforestation to zero was not explicitly mentioned , but it looks much more credible than it did two years ago .
As well as giving heart to the protectors of trees , this outcome is encouraging for people whose focus is not on forests but on fields .
Climate and agriculture matter to each other in several ways .
On the downside , farming is a cause of deforestation , and also emits greenhouse gases in its own right — perhaps 14 % of the global total .
On the upside , agriculture can also dispose of heat - trapping gases , by increasing the carbon content of soils .
And because farmers ( unlike say , coal - producers ) feel the effects of the changes their activities may be causing , they have a role in adapting to climate change .
Farms , particularly marginal ones , are the first to suffer when the climate shifts ; increase their resilience and you help a lot of people .
Whether the aim is adaptation to climate change or slowing it , there is an obvious need for more research on the benign contributions that agriculture can make .
For people who are seized of this need , there was a welcome boost on December 16th when 21 countries pledged $ 150 billion to a Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases .
One of the attractions of a focus on agriculture is that even poor countries have farms ; in some cases credits for carbon newly locked away in their soil may be a more plausible way of attracting money than rewards for low - carbon industrialisation .
A more remote possibility is that such countries will earn credits by hosting efforts to pump carbon dioxide out of the air and store it away .
Such “ geoengineering ” is still seen as far - fetched and in some circles misguided , but a reference to it was made in the Copenhagen documents .
It was cited as a possible future direction for the Clean Development Mechanism , which provides credits for carbon - saving projects in poorer countries .
In the aftermath of negotiations with a hint of slash - and - burn , new seeds may be taking root .
GMs Judit Polgar and Gregory Kaidanov , Photo courtesy Monroi.com
In last week 's Sicilian Theme Match in Hilton Head , SC , GM Judit Polgar narrowly edged GM Gregory Kaidanov in a blitz tiebreak .
All seven games were decisive .
Though the battles involved multiple
queens , queen sacrifices and blistering attacks , Black only managed to win the final game .
Kaidanov recounts the genesis of the match , another sisyphean theoretical task for Dragon players , and his early interactions with Polgar .
When Jeff Smith called me two months ago with an offer to play a match against Judit Polgar , I got very excited .
Being very busy teaching , I play rarely nowadays and this was a great opportunity to go back studying chess again .
Jeff did n't want us to play some kind of boring opening and after some consultations with Judit we decided to play the four sharpest Sicilian lines : Sveshnikov , Dragon , Najdorf and Scheveningen .
In every game we knew the position after five moves from which the play starts , though we still played those moves ourselves .
In order to determine colors Jeff flipped a coin , Judit made a guess and since her guess was wrong , I got White in the first game .
To know an opening ( and even a variation ! ) of every game two months in advance is a luxury , but when your opponent knows it as well , you know that you have no time to relax !
It turns out that preparing the Sicilian with Black is much harder , mainly because White can play many different systems against each of the four complexes .
It turned out that even two months is not enough to cover them all !
The conditions for the match were fantastic .
Jeff created generous prize fund and there was an additional incentive for a win in each separate game .
We stayed in a luxury Hilton Head Marriott with an ocean view and played in a Presidential suite of the same hotel .

Now let 's go to the chess content of the match .
Game 1 : The Sveshnikov
In the first game , I was hoping to surprise Judit with a relatively rare variation in which White sacrifices a piece for three pawns .
However , she was well prepared and surprised me !
4210
Position after 16...0-0
Her 16...0 - 0 was a novelty .
She bravely gave an exchange back for a chance to attack my king .
Fortunately , she looked only at 19 .Nf6 + but 19 .Ne7 + , which I played is better .
17.0–0 Bxf5 18.Qf3 Be6 19 .Ne7 +!
Qxe7 20 .
Qxa8 d5 21.a5 Nd7 22.Qa7 e4
Position after 22...e4
I was very well aware of Judit 's attacking powers , so when she played 22 ...e4 I had a feeling I am going to be crushed .
Somehow I managed to survive ...
23.a6 Qd6 24.Bxd7 ?!
24.Qb7 Ne5 25.a7 Nf3 + ( 25 ... Bh3 26 . Be2+-) 26.gxf3 Bh3 27.Kh1 ( 27.Ra6 Qf4 28.Qxd5 Be5 ) 27 ... Qf4 28 . Be2 exf3 29.Rg1 ( 29.a8Q Bg2 + 30.Kg1 fxe2 ( 30 ... Be5 31 . Qxf8 + Kxf8 32.Qb4++-) 31.Kxg2 Qg4+= ) 29 ... fxe2 30 .Qxd5 +-
24 ... Bxd7 25 .Qe3 f5 26 .Rfd1 Bc6 27.a7 Ba8 28.Qe2 Qc5 29 .Qa6 f4 30 .Ra5 Qe7 31 . Raxd5 e3 32.Qd6
32.Qc4 Kh8 33.Qc5
32...exf2 + 33.Kf1
Position after 33.Kf1
33 .... Qe3 ?!
If she played 33 ... Qe4 ( instead of 33 ... Qe3 ) , I had to find a way to draw the game by perpetual check .
To be honest I did n't see the correct move 37 .

Game 2 : The Dragon
The second game saw another novelty by Judit , this time an extremely powerful one .
4207
Technically , 20 .Qd2 ! was a novelty ( previously 20 .
Qe3 was played several times and Black was doing fine . )
Position after 20 .
Qd2 !
But the whole plan with Nce2 , followed by Ng3 was prepared by Judit at home .
Position after 25.Ng3
This time I WAS crushed without making any visible mistake .
The line we played was one of the main ( if not THE MAIN ) lines in Dragon and now the whole system is in jeopardy .
Of course over the years Dragon saw many " refutations " and I am sure Black players will come up with an improvement somewhere .
I wish them luck , because I 've had enough : )
Judit played brilliantly , sacrificed a knight and finished a game with a Queen sacrifice .
Final position after 36 .
Qd6 !
The queen is taboo because 36 .... Qxd6 37 . Rh8 + Kg7 R1 - h7 mate .
If 36 ... Qc3 , 37 . Qf6 ends things .
Game 3 : The Najdorf
In the third game I played a relatively rare 11 . Qh3 and this time Judit was not prepared well .
4208
As I said earlier , she had to look at a lot of different systems against Najdorf and considering that I never played 6 .Bg5 in a tournament game , it was hard to expect it .
Her 14 ... a5 ?! was too aggressive and I was able to conduct an attack on her king in the center .
Position after 14 ... a5
Game 4 : The Scheveningen
In the final game of the match we saw almost the same scenario .
4213
This time Judit played an opening system , which I did n't expect .
I struggled right from the opening and decided to grab a pawn to have at least something to struggle for .
Unfortunately for me this was kind of a position in which Judit is in her best .
Position after 24 .
Bxb7 !
Kaidanov played Rb8 but after Qxf7 Rxb7 fails to Nxd6 !
She played very energetically , and finished game in style with some precise calculation and spectacular tactics .

After move 26 , if I had played Nxb2 instead of Qb6 , Judit showed me a queen sacrifice line right after we finished the game .

Blitz Playoff
We played blitz games to break the tie .
I won the first one , Judit the second , both with White .
Finally , in Armageddon game she won on the black side !
Oh , did I forget to mention they all were Sicilians too ?

The atmosphere at the match was very friendly .
We had lots of conversations and a lot of memories to laugh about .
I first met Judit when she was 6 years old .
She and Sofia played against me in a simul in Moscow .
Then there was the time I visited Budapest , when I stayed for a few days in Polgar 's apartment .
I played a lot of blitz chess against all three sisters .
Though Judit was only 12 , she was already a very good blitz player .
And a very competitive one I have to add .
After losing one of the games she called me a Hungarian word .
Until now it remains the only Hungarian word I know .
It means " garbage man . "

Have you ever had an experience that suggested someone else was in your house , and just thought “ I do n’t wanna know ” and left it ?
Sometimes , fear of the unknown just seems like the preferable option than facing a real , concrete danger .
Normally it ’s nothing , though .
One time , the beeper function of my wireless housephone went off , when I was the only one home .
It could only be called from the living room .
Another time , I swear someone took some change from my desk .
They ’re all probably just slightly disconcerting tricks of the memory .
But what would you do when something truly suggestive happens ?
Would you run , or just ignore it , like I did ?
Last Monday was a normal day .
I got up , brushed my teeth , changed into school clothes …
All little parts of my morning ritual .
It seemed like it would be another totally un-noteworthy day , until I saw the strings .
There were three or four thick twine strings in my room .
They criss - crossed between the walls around my bed , one attached to the door .
No way would I have missed them before ; I should have tripped over them .
They were tied to pins in the walls , which had also not existed before ten seconds ago .
Nobody could have been in my room while I was in it , let alone set this up .
It was early , and my brain was n’t processing correctly .
I simply discredited the sight , untied the strings and left for school , leaving them balled up on my desk .
It did n’t get any better later .
Outside my house there were hundreds of them , tied between houses , around cars , across streets …
This had to be some super elaborate prank .
One of those hidden camera shows , or a comedy improv blog .
They had gotten everyone else to play along too ; passer - bys were tangled in them , tying them to objects they were walking towards and away from , as if they had been and were continuing to follow the course laid out for them .
I nervously continued my journey to school .
On the bus , every except me was tied to the door .
At school , groups of friends were tied to each other ; teachers were tied to their desks and boards .
Oddly enough , at this point all I could wonder was why I had been left out .
When my friend Lucy sat beside me in first period , she simply plonked her bag down on my lap and rested her chin in her hand , looking right past me to the window outside .
“ Hey Lucy . ”
No response .
“ Come on , I did n’t expect you to be in on this too . “
She sighed and started taking books from her bag .
All the books were tied to her hands .
I grinned , and yanked one of the strings off a book .
She did n’t seem to notice , instead simply disregarding the book completely , letting it drop to the floor without a moment ’s hesitation .
“ Um . ” I leaned down , picking up her book and placing it back on her desk .
She took no notice .
“ Well , if that ’s how we ’re gonna play it . ”
I smiled , trying to look playful , but really just trying to hide my nervousness .
I bundled all the strings attached to her together with one hand , then pulled them all free .
She blinked , turning to stare at me .
“ Holy crap , Martin .
You ’re like a ninja or something . ”
“ I ’ve been sitting here for maybe ten minutes . ” I smiled again , relieved my friend had finally “ noticed ” me .
“ Where did all these strings come from ? ? ”
She gasped , seemingly noticing for the first time .
“ I assumed you were all fucking with me … ”
She stood up , backing into a corner .
No one else in the class noticed .
“ They were n’t here just a minute ago !
Do you see them too ? ? ”
Her tone made it clear she was genuinely scared .
“ No . Did n’t you -. “ I was interrupted by my teacher slamming the door behind her .
Everyone except me and Lucy murmured a good morning , and still , no one seemed to pay either of us any notice .
“ People have been ignoring me all day . ” I said to Lucy , before turning to our teacher .
“ Hey ! Dumb b***h!
You ca n’t teach for s**t ! ”
No reaction .
“ I ’m getting away from all this s**t . ” Lucy pulled a few strings aside and left the class .
I followed , and surprise - surprise , no one else noticed .
We wandered the corridors , leaving and entering classes as we saw fit .
Whenever we untied a chair or book from someone else , it was like it suddenly did n’t matter to them .
It did n’t exist
I showed her the street outside ; there were more strings than when I came in this morning .
Twice as many .
We carefully picked our way through the tangle , making our way to a nearby coffee shop .
Not particularly grand , I know .
But what would you do in our situation ?
As I said , fear of the unknown sometimes seems like the safer option .
On a few occasions , I suggested we untie a few more people .
Lucy was opposed to it , remembering how terrified she ’d been .
In the coffee shop , we grabbed a couple of sandwiches and drinks from the fridge .
We found a table , untied all strings attached to the chairs , and sat down .
We both ate in silence , both of us too scared , both of us distracting ourselves by watching the strangers in the shop , oblivious to the strings .
After twenty minutes , Lucy spoke up .
“ Now she ’s gonna take that sandwich . ”
She said , pointing at a woman across the shop .
Sure enough , she walked to the fridge and took the plastic wrapped sandwich she was tied to .
“ She pays for it and leaves . ”
She did so , according to the prophecies of the strings .
“ That guy does n’t intend to pay . ” I watched as a man took his coffee and ran out of the store , the two servers just looking too exasperated to go after him .
“ This is horrible . ”
She whimpered .
“ Let ’s go .
Please . ”
Outside was n’t much better .
Everyone just followed the strings ’ instructions , going about their daily lives .
Lucy announced she was going home to sleep this off , and I agreed to walk her home .
She only lived ten minutes away .
Away from the busier part of town there were fewer strings .
It was nicer ; we could pretend it was n’t happening .
When we turned onto Lucy ’s street , she stopped , her mouth falling open .
“ What now ? ” I broke the silence , my voice sounding surprisingly small .
” Look . ”
She pointed outside one of her neighbours houses .
I saw it clearly , and I ’ll take my memory of that moment ‘ til the day I die .
A little dark imp , maybe three feet tall , walking along with its knuckles on the ground , almost like a monkey .
It had two bulbous yellow eyes taking up about half its face , and no mouth or any other facial features .
It was holding a hammer and a ball of twine , which it was letting out behind it .
It walked quickly and quietly from the front door of the house to the mailbox .
It stopped , hammered a nail into the side of the box , and tied it ’s string around it .
It turned to face us , and stopped when it spotted us .
My bottom fell out even further than it had already been , but it just stared with a look of surprise and curiosity .
You could almost say it was the more frightened one .
Suddenly , it beckoned to us with its tiny hand .
I looked at Lucy , she had n’t moved .
I looked back at the imp , which stared at me .
I halved the distance between us , and then halved it again .
This was n’t fear of the unknown anymore ; it was fear of this little guy .
Did n’t seem like anything to be scared of .
When I was a meter away from it , it extended its hand .
“ Uh. Hi . ” I shook it .
It nodded in approval , blinking its massive yellow eyes up at me .
“ So you ’re the ones in charge of the strings ? ”
It nodded eagerly .
I called Lucy over , but she stayed where she was .
“ There are more of you ? ” Another nod .
I wanted to ask it so many questions , about what it was and where it came from , but it seemed for now I was stuck with only yes or no questions .
“ Do we even have free will ? ”
It just looked at me , almost sadly .
I immediately felt sick to my stomach , and could n’t bear looking at the little monster anymore .
I grabbed Lucy , who had been listening to our exchange , and now sat on the curb with her head in her hands .
“ Come on . ”
We entered her house , and I made her a cup of tea .
When I found her in the living room , she had untied her dog and was curled up with it , crying .
I set the tea down and sat beside her .
“ I ’m so scared . ”
She whispered after a good ten minutes of sobbing .
I did n’t answer .
I could n’t .
“ I ’m going to sleep ” She mumbled suddenly , and was under within the minute .
Sleep was starting to sound pretty good all of a sudden , my eyelids suddenly felt like they were being weighed down .
I collapsed to the rug , and the last thing I heard before I fell asleep was the scurrying of several sets of little feet nearby .
I felt much better the next day , as if the whole affair had been a dream .
I ’d probably have believed that if I had n’t been awoken by Lucy ’s mother that morning , wondering what I was doing sleeping over without permission or something .
Over breakfast , Lucy asked me why I looked so pale and nervous .
I turned to her and smiled , mumbling something to her about feeling sick .
But the truth was , I was scared because I could n’t see any strings , and was wondering whether my actions were truly my own .

The notion that Asians and Jews are two shoots from the same cultural rootstock is an old but evergreen meme .
You see it in fringe theories about the Lost Tribes of Israel -- there 's an entire body of cryptoarchaeological canon that uses similarities between customs , language and naming convention to " prove " that the ancient vanished Jewish clans ended up in China , India or Japan .
( Japan 's 50,000 - member Makuya sect , which has as its central dogma that the Japanese are descendants of a lost Jewish tribe , keep kosher , speak Hebrew and use the seven - armed menorah as their symbol . )
You see it in more personal contexts as well , both casual and intimate :
In tongue - in - cheek stand - up and sitcom references to the Jewish love of Chinese food , especially when eaten on Christmas .
In wedding toasts at cross-cultural " Judasian " weddings , where the acknowledgment of Asian / Jewish similarity has become almost a traditional element .
And yes , you see it in the comparable circumstances our communities have faced as we 've woven ourselves into the social fabric of this nation :
We both know what it means to be alternately held up as examples of the American dream , scaling the generational ladder from poverty to professional success , and as major players in the American nightmare -- labeled as " parasites , " libeled as insular and self - serving , dismissed or demonized as exotic aliens and permanent outsiders .
But nowhere is the shared arc of the Asian and Jewish American journey so clear as in the area of education , that paramount priority of both communities .
The story of parents toiling to create academic opportunity for their offspring ( and using guilt , bribery and punishment to ensure that those kids take advantage of it ) is the same whether its narrator is named Josh Li or Joshua Leibowitz .
It 's no wonder , then , that the phrase " Asians are the new Jews " is most commonly used in an educational context -- most prominently in Dan Golden 's scathing investigation into the admissions practices of elite colleges , " The Price of Admission , " which dedicates an entire chapter to the challenges Asian American candidates face in getting into top schools .
The chapter 's name , naturally : " The New Jews . "
Admission impossible
In the book , Golden notes that Asian Americans are disproportionately harmed by current admissions standards , to the point where an effective quota system exists , capping the number of Asians admitted at a virtually fixed level Ð for private colleges , generally well south of 20 percent of the student body -- and forcing Asian applicants to compete for slots against other Asians .
In short , the environment Asian American candidates face is remarkably similar to that of Jewish applicants in the Fifties and Sixties , when Ivy League colleges had a policy of preventing an " excess " of Jews in their student body .
( As documented by Jerome Karabel in his equally stunning book , " The Chosen , " much of the effort was unspoken ; he cites a 1959 report by B'nai Brith 's Rabbi Richard Israel in which an anonymous , guilt - ridden Yale admissions officer admits that while there is " no quota as such ... they simply have a policy of ' conscious self - restraint . '
That is to say , they automatically turn down a ' suitable number ' of Jews . ' " )
Golden points his finger at donor and legacy preferences as the primary reason why Asian Americans , and other minorities as well , face limited opportunity ; he notes case after case of children of privilege with low scores and poor grades who nevertheless find their way into the hallowed halls of Harvard , Yale and Princeton , schools where legacy students , predominantly white and affluent , make up one out of five admissions .
The legacy preference is a recipe for demographic inertia :
By admitting the children of alumni , primarily to encourage giving to school endowments , it creates a system that 's self - replicating .
Barring the relatively small number of multiracial and adopted candidates , legacies applying to a school that 's 80 percent white are more likely than not white themselves .
And newer Americans , whose roots in the U.S. are just a generation deep , are almost guaranteed not to have the benefit of legacy status .
Legacy is one of a number of ways that colleges can continue the policy of ' conscious self - restraint ' to prevent a surplus of a particular population -- at one time Jews , and now Asians .
But as unfair as legacy preferences might seem , they pale before the more insidious filters applied to Asian Americans competing in the open applicant pool .
" Asian applicants have to overcome a particular stereotypical profile that amounts to overt discrimination , " says Jennifer Rubin , contributing editor for the conservative Jewish journal Commentary .
" The Department of Education did an investigation and uncovered the notes that admissions committee members put on the applications of Asian candidates .
And time after time , they found repeated references to them being ' grinds , ' ' shy , ' ' not well - rounded . '
These clearly reflected some kind of predisposition on the part of admissions officers .
And I 'm not sure that Jewish candidates were affected by a similar stereotype , even 50 or 60 years ago . "
The caricature of the one - dimensional , passive , hard - working but personality - free Asian American is indeed hard to reconcile with Jewish stereotypes ; as one Jewish friend commented , " Even the most anti-Semitic depictions of Jews never make us seem boring . "
But that 's the perceptual bias that Asian Americans do face , and in the hotly competitive world of elite college admissions , where committees are tasked with filling out their freshman classes with a vivid , dynamic mix of skills and personalities , that 's a dramatic handicap for Asians .
In a feature she wrote on Asian American college admissions for " The Weekly Standard " -- called , naturally , " The New Jews ? " --
Rubin offers up the following choice quote from Golden 's " Price of Admission " :
Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science tests .
Asked why Vanderbilt poured resources into recruiting Jews instead of Asians , a former administrator told me " Asians are very good students , but they do n't provide the kind of intellectual environment that Jewish students provide . "
Turning the tide
The fact that some private liberal arts colleges now recruit Jewish students , seeking them out to enrich their student cultures , is startling , given the stark anti-Semitism seen in secondary education just a half - century ago .
And yet , there 's no question that the narrative arc for Jews -- in education and in society -- has turned .
While Jews are still typified as smart , successful , hard - working , and yes , academically brilliant , they 're also seen as a creative , diverse and colorful community , excelling not just in the STEM fields -- the wonkalicious worlds of science , technology , engineering and mathematics -- but in arts , literature , media and entertainment .
This altered perception comes from a shift in priorities .
As Nicholas Lemann wrote in a feature for Slate , " Jews in Second Place " ( subtitled " When Asian - Americans become the ' new Jews , ' what happens to the Jews ? " ) , Jewish youth who were once upon a time pushed to spend all their spare time are now being encouraged by their parents to play ... hockey :
" Jewish kids and their parents have decided to devote endless hours of childhood to an activity with no career payoff .
Do you think they 're going to 6 a.m. practices for a shot at the National Hockey League ?
Of course not .
They 're doing it -- mastering hockey , and every conceivable other sport -- to promote ' growth , ' ' teamwork , ' ' physical fitness , ' ' well - roundedness , ' ' character , ' and other qualities that may be desirable in a doctor but do n't , as a practical matter , help you get into medical school . "
Lemann 's point is that Jews , comfortably ensconced in the mainstream , have lost the striver 's all - out hunger for achievement .
While Asian Americans are sending their kids to cram school and demanding the best , Jewish Americans are , more and more , letting their kids slide into the world of academic good - enough , distracted by athletics and other " unproductive activities . "
And yet , Jewish representation at elite colleges has hardly dwindled , with some estimates placing it at about 30 percent of all Ivy League students , nearly double the equivalent percentage of Asian Americans .
Gaming the system
According to James Chen , founder and principal of the Alameda - based college guidance firm Asian Advantage College Consulting , the success of Jewish applicants is due to the very phenomenon that provokes Lemann 's anxiety .
Like many other college consultants , Asian Advantage helps their clients with selecting the right college , writing applications , and even -- if a client comes on board early enough in his or her high school career -- designing their curricula and activities to optimize their chances of getting in .
What makes Asian Advantage unique is that it focuses exclusively on Asian Americans , seeking to promote a " level playing field in the college applications process , " while raising awareness of the " unique challenges " faced by Asian college candidates .
" Our whole focus is on helping Asian American high school students get into great colleges , " says Chen .
" And the biggest thing we have to address is that most of our clients come to us having been steered toward math and science , playing piano and violin , and hoping to become doctors or engineers .
That 's what their parents have pushed them towards . "
That only fuels the " quasi- robotic " perception that admissions officers have of Asian applicants , notes Chen .
" We struggle with ' Asian Robot Syndrome ' all the time .
It 's bad enough that the stereotype is there .
If you reinforce it with what you put on your application , you have no chance .
None . "
Which is why , he says , the first thing they tell their Asian American clients is to do the opposite of what most college counselors tell their charges .
" We always say : DON'T BE YOURSELF .
And by that we mean , break the Asian Robot mold .
If they 're young enough , we push them to get away from math clubs and science contests .
Choose things that are out of the box for Asian students .
Drama .
School musicals .
Go to Shakespeare Camp .
Join the newspaper .
And absolutely play a sport ! " -- even , says Chen , if you do n't excel .
" Playing a sport has a big impact at schools .
It 's a big nudge for your chances if you participate in athletics , no matter how good you are . "
And while " rounding out " a student is one rationale for Asian Advantage 's recommendations , it 's just part of a bigger objective : " At a very high level , what we tell clients is to create an application such that the reader upon looking at it , without knowing your name , would not imagine you as being an Asian person . "
Chen 's point is that , while it is impossible to hide ethnicity -- " Your name 's on the paper , your parents ' birthplaces " -- reinforcing it is a mistake .
" The way the admissions process works is , you as person end up boiled down into a few talking points .
They 'll use a catchphrase to describe you .
They 'll say , ' The next applicant is the Korean Piano Prodigy from Los Angeles -- what do we think ? '
And the first thing the rest of the committee is going to say is , ' Which one ? ' "
Far better to be the Korean rock climber , or the Chinese standup comedian , or yes , for all of Nicholas Lemann 's concerns , the Pakistani hockey player .
Chen 's business has grown to the point where he 's added two partners , and now manages 15 clients per cycle .
And while his focus is on teaching clients to play the game using the rules that admissions committees have already set , his larger agenda is to break them .
A staunch opponent of preferences of any kind , he believes that Asian Americans sell themselves short by embracing the tenets of affirmative action .
" I believe in equal opportunity for all -- based on merit , " he says .
" I 'm not interested in pseudo - feel - good , we - are - the - world racial harmony arguments .
Asian students are getting screwed by the process .
In the short run , we try to help clients individually .
But the only real fix is to change the system . "
Affirmative Reaction
But what does " changing the system " entail ?
What would the landscape at top colleges look like if all preferences were eliminated , if college admissions replaced " holistic " evaluation processes ( which look at many factors , including race ) with stricter grade , score and achievement - based ranking ?
One outcome is almost certainly a continued reduction in the percentage of already underrepresented groups -- blacks and Latinos in particular .
But another might well be a continued rise in the percentage of Asian Americans on elite college campuses .
And that sometimes places Asian American progressives in the awkward position of advocating for a larger social good that might have short - term negative implications for their own community .
" It 's obviously a challenge to steer a nuanced course , " says Vincent Pan , executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action .
" Sometimes you end up looking like you 're for Asians and against blacks and Latinos , or for affirmative action and against Asian Americans .
And I think that that 's misleading .
Yes , at some point there are zero - sum decisions , but when you get there , what you need is a thoughtful discussion at all the levels of impact . "
CAA fought against Proposition 209 , which eliminated affirmative action from the University of California system ; the net result of the bill has been a jump in Asian American freshman enrollment at UC - Berkeley from 37 percent in 1995 to 45 percent today .
UCLA and UC - San Diego have seen similar boosts , to 41 percent and 49 percent respectively .
On the other hand , CAA has taken the lead in fighting to roll back last year 's decision to eliminate SAT Subject Tests -- tests that cover specific academic topics that can be studied for , like language -- as a requirement for enrollment in the UC system , pointing to the fact that this change could end up reducing Asian American enrollment by as much as 12 percent , since Asian Americans score significantly higher on those tests than the more general SAT Reasoning Test .
Pan asserts that there is n't necessarily a discrepancy between the two agendas .
" We 're fixed on the long - term principle , that society works best if it works for everyone , " he says .
" In the long run , Asian Americans will not do as well in a society where other people do not have equal access .
We can't move forward at other groups ' expense , because it will come back to haunt us .
That kind of social injustice hurts America , just as it does if Asian Americans are limited from access . "
We might look to Jewish Americans as an example .
Adhering to the principle that all suffer when any suffer , Jews were among the earliest and most passionate supporters of equal rights for black Americans .
The NAACP was cofounded by Henry Moscowitz , alongside W.E.B. DuBois and other civil rights leaders ; Kivie Kaplan served as its national president from 1966 to 1975 .
Jewish philanthropist Julius Rosenwald 's generosity funded the creation of more than 2,000 primary and secondary schools in black neighborhoods and 20 black universities , including Howard , Dillard and Fisk , which collectively provided education for nearly four out of 10 blacks living in the South .
And the generation of Jewish Americans who came out of college in the Fifties and Sixties , facing and overcoming discrimination in admissions , went on to stand and march side by side with African Americans :
Over half of the young people who participated in the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964 were Jews .
But Pan ultimately cautions against the constant invocation of the Asian / Jewish connection , even in an inspirational context .
" It 's inappropriate to suggest Asians are the new Jews , just like it 's inappropriate to suggest that gays are the new blacks , " he says .
" Asians are Asians .
We deserve to have our own meme , not simply recycling someone else's .
But we wo n't get there without recognizing that we do n't just inherit the benefits of rights fought for by those who went before us -- we also inherit the responsibility to fight for those who come after us . "

As a child growing up in Shanghai in the late Forties , Pan Guang lived next door to one of the city 's rare handful of Jewish households , a family of Russian Jews who had fled to China to escape the rampant anti-Semitism of the early 1900s , and the close friendship he struck with his neighbors inspired in him a lifelong fascination with Jewish history and culture .
" That initial interest became academic interest , " says Pan , who is dean of Shanghai 's Center of Jewish Studies .
" It 's had a huge impact in my life .
I 've been to Israel many times .
I read a lot of Jewish books , Jewish history .
It 's almost my life . "
Pan will be in San Francisco next week for the formal opening of the landmark exhibition at the Presidio , " Jews in Modern China , " which features hundreds of photographs , documents and memorabilia he 's collected from China 's three waves of Jewish settlement -- the Sephardic Jews driven out by the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th century , the Russian Jews who sought refuge from the pogroms , and the European Jews who turned to Shanghai as a haven from Nazi terror .
The artifacts are from the collection Pan and the Center of Jewish Studies has amassed since its founding in 1988 .
The center has documented the history of China 's Jewish community , which at its peak numbered more than 40,000 .
China 's welcoming attitude toward Jews was , in Pan 's mind , the result of natural affinity between the two cultures ; he notes that on a stone monument erected in 1489 , the Jews of the city of Kaifeng , one of China 's ancient capitals , wrote the following inscription : " Our religion and Confucianism differ only in minor details .
In mind and deed both respect Heaven 's Way , venerate ancestors , are loyal to sovereigns and ministers , and filial to parents .
Both call for harmony with wives and children , respect for rank , and for making friends . "
The " Jews in Modern China " exhibition at the Presidio Officers ' Club ( 50 Moraga Avenue , 11 a.m. - 5 p.m. , free admission ) opened for previews yesterday , and runs through May 16 .
The formal opening event , however , takes place on March 2 , at 5:30 p.m. , featuring a one - on - one conversation between Pan and Professor Thomas Gold of UC - Berkeley .
I , too , am very , very anxious for the day to come when I can purchase a Fascination car with an EV Gray fuelless engine .
The Fascination Car was the brain child of Paul M. Lewis , of the Highway Aircraft Corporation .
It was developed with a standard engine , but he wanted to power it with ANYTHING that did n't burn gasoline .
He was in negotiations with Ed Gray for a while to use the EMA Engine , but that fell through .
He then approached Josef Papp for his plasma engine .
Ultimately , neither the engines or the car were ever produced .
Parallel Programming with OpenMP
The geek - chic OpenMP logo .
This is a brief intro to using OpenMP for parallel programming ( with what I 've discovered about it so far ) .
We 'll implement a Mandelbrot Set renderer that runs multicore , and throw in a couple aside - goodies as well ( basic supersampling and Mandelbrot continuous coloring ) .
First , let 's talk parallel programming .
The basic idea here is that we have some task that can be split up into parts , and we hand off each of these parts to different CPUs .
A real - life example might be this : you have a pile of 1000 envelopes that all need to be opened .
If you are by yourself , you just open one at a time until you are done .
But if you bribe your friend with pizza , he might come over to help you .
In that case , you split the envelopes into two piles , and both of you open them until you 've each done 500 , and then you are done .
It takes half the time .
Or , if you invite 10 friends over to open 100 envelopes each , it takes one - tenth the time .
Problems like this which parallelize easily are called embarrassingly parallel problems .
You throw N CPUs at the problem , and the time it takes to finish is divided by N. ( Practically speaking , you wo n't actually get that linear speedup .
See Amdahl 's Law . )
Of course , it 's not always that easy , at all .
For example , if you are baking cookies at home , you can invite 40 friends over , but the cookies wo n't be done baking in a much shorter time ( a little bit shorter , perhaps , as you can delegate a few minor tasks in the process , but certainly not 40 - times shorter ) .
It does n't matter if someone is ready to put the tray in the oven if the cookie dough is n't done being made !
Most people will be standing around idle most of the time .
( Actually eating the cookies once they 're baked , however , is an embarrassingly parallel problem , and your 40 friends will make short work of 40 of them in the same time it takes you to eat just one ! )
It 's the same with CPUs , except there are fewer cookies involved .
Now , there are many many ways of writing software that executes in parallel , and which way you choose really depends on the problem domain .
OpenMP is , from what I can tell , a fine choice for non-distributed programs that need to use more cores for , say , number crunching .
Some other locally - running programs might be better suited to use something like a thread pool .
OpenMP is just one option , but it can be appealing due to its ease - of - use .
For this demo , we 'll be looking at a Mandelbrot Set rendering program .
You can read my other post on how the Mandelbrot Set works , but the relevant recap is that we 're going to process each pixel of the image by running it through an algorithm to determine its color based on its position on the screen .
Each pixel is rendered independently of each other pixel , and it does n't matter in which order they 're processed ; there are no data dependencies — it is embarrassingly parallel .
We should be able to hand off pixels , or groups of pixels to each CPU and have them run at the same time , and get a speedup somewhat proportional to the number of CPUs that are put to work .
( Time to use that quadcore of yours for something ! )
For this , the OpenMP API can really help make it easy to write parallel programs .
Instead of spawning a thread , you tell the compiler which sections of code can be made parallel , and optionally tell it which variables can be shared between threads , which need to be private , and tons and tons of other optional stuff ( OpenMP is featureful ) , and the compiler generates the right code for you .
Single - threaded execution of a for - loop vs. multi- threaded execution on four cores via OpenMP with the " omp " # pragma .
Note that in this for - loop , each thread operates on its own pieces of data without overlapping other threads ... via the magic of OpenMP .
Here 's a non-parallel regular - old - run - of - the - mill standard example that will multiply every element in an array by 2 in C :
C int i ; int a [ 10 ] = { 3,6,3,1,7,9,5,6,9,1} ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) { a [ i ] *= 2 ; }
Normal enough , right ?
And you can see that it can be easily parallelized by letting different CPUs work on different parts of the code .
Now here 's the OpenMP variant :
C int i ; int a [ 10 ] = { 3,6,3,1,7,9,5,6,9,1} ; # pragma omp parallel for for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ ) { a [ i ] *= 2 ; }
Tada !
That is it !
With that one pragma , the for - loop will now execute in parallel on all cores .
( Assuming your compiler supports it ! )
You 'll probably also have to tell your compiler to use OpenMP : gcc : Pass the - fopenmp switch on the command line .
: Pass the switch on the command line .
Visual Studio :
Edit the project and add the / openmp switch .
: Edit the project and add the switch .
XCode : Edit the project and select at least GCC 4.2 or LLVM GCC 4.2 .
Check the " Use OpenMP " box .
: Edit the project and select at least GCC 4.2 or LLVM GCC 4.2 .
Check the " Use OpenMP " box .
For other compilers , search Google for your compiler and " openmp " and see what comes up .
And with that , I have to admit that I might have glossed over ( just a tad ) some of the incredible number of minute intricacies of multithreaded programming .
The Devil is , naturally , in the details , and problems are rarely as simple as this .
OpenMP has a wide variety of directives to help you through your multi- threading needs , but it really is possible to get yourself into trouble with race conditions and deadlock so on .
Here 's a bad example ( please ignore how contrived it is ) :
C int i , j ; int a [ 10 ] = { 3,6,3,1,7,9,5,6,9,1} ; # pragma omp parallel for for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) { // BADNESS !
race condition in here : j = a [ i ] ; j *= 2 ; a [ i ] = j ; }
It 's the same as before , except we 've put the value in a temp variable j to multiply by two before transferring it back .
So what 's the problem ?
The problem is that Thread A might set j to a [ 2 ] ( which is 3 ) , then Thread B sets j to a [ 5 ] ( which is 9 ) .
And then Thread A multiplies j by 2 , and comes up with 18 when it should have come up with 6 , and happily and wrongly stores 18 in a [ 2 ] .
The problem is that both threads are using j at the same time and stepping on each others ' toes .
They each need their own private version of j so it does n't conflict with other threads .
They can do it like this :
C int i , j ; int a [ 10 ] =
{ 3,6,3,1,7,9,5,6,9,1} ; # pragma omp parallel for private ( j ) for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) { j = a [ i ] ; j *= 2 ; a [ i ] = j ; }
And now they each get their own copy of j to mess with .
Another option to do the same thing is to declare j to be local to the block — this makes it automatically private :
C int i ; int a [ 10 ] = { 3,6,3,1,7,9,5,6,9,1} ; # pragma omp parallel for for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) { int j ; // j is private because it 's block - local j = a [ i ] ; j *= 2 ; a [ i ] = j ; }
With that in mind , let 's think about my OpenMP Mandelbrot renderer : goatbrot ( with source on github ) .
This thing is going to generate a color for each pixel of the image , and it 's going to write the result out in a file .
I 've run this program on Linux and OSX .
It should run on any Unix - like .
Modifications will need to be made to get it to build for Windows — these mods are noted in the README .
For this program , the output is written in PPM ( Portable Pixmap Format ) , a venerable format used since the olden days by the Netpbm library .
It consists of a very simple header followed by uncompressed RGB triplets , each channel stored as an 8 - bit unsigned value .
So 3 bytes per pixel , then .
Search for Netpbm for your platform if you do n't have something that can view these images already .
Mac users can get it from MacPorts .
Or you might already have the cjpeg tool for creating JPEGs .
Conversion to PNG or JPEG can be done on the command line like this : $ goatbrot -o foo.ppm $ pnmtopng - compression=9 < foo.ppm > foo.png or $ goatbrot -o foo.ppm $ cjpeg - quality 85 < foo.ppm > foo.jpg
For the curious , I selected this output format because it 's dead - simple , and does n't introduce any more library dependencies on the code .
A couple more notes :
The quickest way to a pretty render is with the -e switch to choose an example render ( 1 through 8 ) : goatbrot -e 3 - o foo.ppm
switch to choose an example render ( 1 through 8 ) : Give the -h switch for usage information
switch for usage information
Give the -t switch to choose the number of threads — default is the number of cores you have available
switch to choose the number of threads — default is the number of cores you have available
The -u option gives continuous coloring , and the - a option does simple anti-aliasing
option gives continuous coloring , and the option does simple anti-aliasing
There 's some theme support hastily hacked in there , too
So it'll loop through the row and columns as normal , except we 'll stick a # pragma omp before the loop so that it runs in parallel , and we 'll put all the thread - local variables inside the block so they 'll be private per-thread .
Here 's that snippet :
C #pragma omp parallel for for ( y = 0 ; y < height ; y++ ) { // declare thread - local variables in block here for ( x = 0 ; x < width ; y++ ) { // do heavy mandlebrot lifting // write output } }
So that 'll start a bunch of thread on a per-row basis .
( That is , it 's the row - oriented loop over variable y that 's being parallelized — the inner loop is not . )
I did an experiment and tried putting the # pragma omp in front of the inner loop ( which would parallelize on a per- pixel basis , instead of a per- row basis ) , and it slowed down the run considerably .
I did n't pursue it , but I figure it 's because the thread overhead is high compared to the cost of producing a pixel , but low compared to the cost of producing a row of pixels .
But since there are likely to be more rows in the image than you have cores at your disposal , it 's just fine to parallelize on rows .
Now it 's time to notice another wrench in the works , already shown above in the comment " write output " .
What happens to this output when we have a bunch of threads trying to write it at the same time ?
Here 's the short answer : Bad Things .
OpenMP does n't make any statement about I/O , and leaves it all up to the programmer .
( It 's a rather sane stance , I think . )
And that means it 's all up to us !
We could try to force all the threads to write the data in order , but that sounds like 1 ) a pain , and 2 ) a great way to slow things back down again .
It would be better if we could somehow allow all the threads to write the data out to disk at the same time .
But this means they either have to write to different files , or all somehow have random access to the same file .
I chose to implement the latter for this demo , giving all threads random access to the same file .
Since none of the threads are going to be overwriting each other 's data , I do n't have to lock the file , either .
How do we get that kind of random access to a file ?
We can use something called a memory - mapped file .
This is a file that has been mapped into memory and looks for all intents and purposes like a big array .
The first step is making a file big enough to hold all the data ( which I did with Unix 's ftruncate ( ) syscall ) .
The next step is to memory - map the file , and get a pointer to the data ( using the mmap ( ) syscall ) .
Once we have a pointer to the data , we just calculate the relative offset to the base pointer , and memcpy ( ) the data into place .
What are we giving up ?
Well , as any good Unix geek will tell you , pipelines make the world go around .
A common MO with Netpbm tools is to pipe on command into another , like this command to scale a JPEG image down and convert it to a grayscale PNG : djpeg example.jpg | pnmscale - xysize 400 400 | \ ppmtopgm | pnmtopng > output.png
And the problem is that if we 're writing to the file in different places from different threads , you can't linearly write it out .
That is , threads that are rendering the end of the image might finish before threads that are rendering the beginning of the image .
( Of course , you could save the file to a temp file , and then copy it to standard output when you 're done .
Since some of the files produced by this program could be huge , I decided not to do that behind the users ' backs , but it 's a matter of preference . )
Another option that occurred to me was to write out each thread 's data to a different file .
The records in these files could have the row number prepended to each bit of pixel data .
Then at the end of the run , the program could merge those records into the final image .
Finally , I feel like I should mention there could be a way to use the # pragma omp ordered construct to force the writing of the data to happen in the same order as the loop .
However , I was unable to get this to work in such a way that the CPU load was properly distributed — most of the threads just stayed idle .
I have more exploration to do there to figure it out .
So anyway !
One more thing I can mention is that OpenMP provides ways to control execution through sections where only one thread should be running at once — such areas are known as critical sections .
In the Mandelbrot program , I output a progress meter that shows the percentage complete .
And rather than having all threads just output whenever , I wrap that up in a # pragma omp critical construct — this forces that section to be executed by only one thread at a time .
A graph showing some relative runtimes for multiple threads :
Relative runtimes of the Mandelbrot renderer for various processors .
Lower is faster / better .
Notice that the hyperthreaded single core Atom gets an improvement with two threads , but it 's not a two - fold improvement .
The genuine dual - core processor actually halves its runtime .
And the single - core Athlon 64 is nothing if not consistent .
( And because I know you 're curious , the actual fastest - of - all runtimes from these three systems were 16 seconds , 41 seconds , and 5 seconds , respectively , for what it 's worth , which ain't much — remember it takes all kinds of things to make a system , and those things all influence end - performance .
( What 's with the funky high runtimes with odd numbers of threads ?
I do n't know for sure , but my reading around the web seems to indicate something to do with caching and / or scheduling .
The Atom is running Linux and the Duo is running OSX .
Any ideas ? )
So , there 's way more to OpenMP than I 've mentioned here — it 's a pretty big system with lots of features .
But , like I 've shown , it can be a really quick way to rip into embarrassingly parallel problems .

WHAT DO YOU get when you cross Apple , Siemens and Sisvel with the German police at CeBIT ?
Raids of course , with lots of police , lawyers , and people stripping booths clean of everything electronic .
Walking around Hall 17 at CeBIT a few hours ago , there were several German police walking hurriedly through the crowd , talking into walkie - talkies .
Where police are agitated , stories are likely to be found .
Sure enough , when the police got to their destination , there were about 15 more of their colleagues surrounding a 5 by 10 meter booth of a netbook and e-reader manufacturer who explicitly asked not to be identified .
Since we do n’t know the legalities surrounding taking photographs of the German police , we have blanked out their faces , and also the company name as requested .
Most of the police were moving among the crowd , and several were off the the right side of the booth .
There were at least two police officers for every booth employee .
How to put on a show with police backing
The police were keeping people out , with several unnamed individuals talking to some very agitated Chinese electronics vendors in the booth .
Most people had thick stacks of paperwork in their hands , you can see some in the police officer ’s hand above .
Once I started taking pictures , two police hurried over and then noticed my press badge and stopped .
They huddled and started talking hurriedly in German , the only word I got was “ press ” , then they turned and walked away .
The entire time , a man was methodically walking around taking everything off the shelves and boxing it up .
Booth teardown the Apple way
Asking the police what was happening got no answer , as did requests for who to contact later about the situation .
In all fairness , they probably did not know , but were likely just there to keep the crowds away .
Then again , they did n’t take my contact information for later contact .
One of the officers asked bluntly if my camera was on .
When I said yes , and pointed out that I was press , he scowled .
Message sent .
Pictures long since taken , I went on my merry way .
Nothing in stock , sorry
Coming back to the booth an hour later , the place was cleaned out .
The man pictured above took everything , including the personal computers of the booth staff .
The shelves were totally empty , but the employees were still trying to make a go of things , handing out literature to passer ’s by .
Asking what happened , one person in the booth said that yesterday , some lawyers came by and said that the company had something on its web site that violated some Apple , Siemens and Sisvel patents .
The company was asked to pay 10,000 Euros for this violation .
Representatives from the company claim they asked for specifics as to what products were in violation , and what was being violated .
They claim that such evidence was not given to them , and the lawyers left .
That was all they heard until the police raid today when their booth was cleaned out .
Although it is only one side of the story , it has all the hallmarks of a fear - inducing shakedown .
Anyone know who he is ?
While we were talking to the booth staff , a meeting started at one of the few things not taken , a table in the middle of the booth .
The man pictured above is said to be an Apple lawyer .
When asked for his card , he said “ No ” .
When asked to confirm that he was representing Apple , he said , “ No ” .
Then he turned away and started ‘ negotiating ’ with the firm again .
Although it is only anecdotal evidence , his warm attitude to the press is quite Apple like .
In the end , we have one side of the story , the manufacturer ’s .
The other side declined multiple requests for information , and would not give any contact information about who to talk to .
The only hard documentation we were able to see were some German legal papers that had the company ’s name on it , and Siemens ’ as well .
These were in a stack about three inches thick , and not shown explicitly to SemiAccurate , we just noticed them .
The company claimed several other Chinese manufacturers were raided as well , and we will attempt to find them later today .
We will also try and get the official word as to what happened , but given the utter reluctance of anyone on the other side to talk at all , we do n’t think there is much chance of that .
Stay tuned .
One open question is why CeBIT allows this kind of PR stunt raid to happen .
Last year , they annoyed several Taiwanese vendors , and now this year it is the Chinese .
One has to wonder if they are actively trying to drive vendors away .
If so , based on the attitudes of the Chinese contingent today , they are doing an exceptionally good job .

The space station design was unveiled on a live broadcast to celebrate the Chinese New Year .
China isaggressively accelerating the pace of its manned space program by developing a 17,000 lb. man-tended military space laboratory planned for launch by late2010 .
The mission will coincide with a halt in U.S. manned flight withphase - out of the shuttle .
The projectis being led by the General Armaments Department of the People 's LiberationArmy , and gives the Chinese two separate stationdevelopment programs .
Shenzhou 8 , the first mission to the outpost in early 2011 will be flown unmanned to testrobotic docking systems .
Subsequent missions will be manned to utilize the newpressurized module capabilities of the Tiangong outpost .
Importantly , China is openly acknowledging that the new Tiangong outpost willinvolve military space operations and technology development .
Also thefact it has been given a No. 1 numerical designation indicates that China maybuild more than one such military space laboratory in the coming years .
" The People 's Liberation Army 's General Armament Department aims to finish systemsfor the Tiangong - 1 mission this year , " says an official Chinese governmentstatement on the new project .
Work on a ground prototype is nearly finished .
The design , revealed to the Chinese during a nationally televised Chinese New Yearbroadcast , includes a large module with docking system making up the forwardhalf of the vehicle and a service module section with solar arrays andpropellant tanks making up the aft .
The conceptis similar to manned concepts for Europe 's Automated Transfer Vehicle .
While usedas a target to build Chinesedocking and habitation experience , the vehicle 's military mission has someapparent parallels with the U.S. Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory ( MOL ) program cancelled in 1969 before it flew any manned missions .
MOL 's objectiveswere primarily reconnaissance and technology development .
While U.S.military astronauts were to be launched in a Gemini spacecraft atop their MOLs , in China 's case , the module will operate autonomously and be visitedperiodically by Chinese astronauts , to perhaps retrieve reconnaissance imageryor other sensor data .
At least one unmanned Shenzhou was equippedwith a military space intelligence eavesdropping antenna array .
Along withlaunch of the outpost , China is also beginning mass production of Shenzhoutaxi spacecraft , says Zhang Bainan , the chief Shenzhoudesign manager .
All previousShenzhoushave been built as individual custom spacecraft for widely spaced missions .
But China is now moving to Shenzhouassembly line production to increase flight rates .
In additionto operational mission objectives the Chinese mission plans will provide apropaganda windfall in China and send a global geopolitical message relative todeclining U.S. space leadership .
The Tiangongvehicle 's debut in late 2010 , and increase in Chinese manned mission flightrates will coincide with the planned termination of the U.S. space shuttleprogram and a five year hiatus in American manned space launches .
The firstmanned NASA Orion / Ares manned mission to Earth orbit is not likely until 2015 with manned lunar operations no earlier than 2020 .
During thatperiod China can rack up multiple attention getting missions , while Americanslaunched in the Russian Soyuz will draw meager attention unless they areinvolved in an emergency .
Along withthe Tiangongannouncement comes another major revelation ?
that China now has two mannedspace station programs under development .
?
The new Tiangongseries , that can be launched on the same type Long March 2 F booster used tocarry Soyuz - type Shenzhoumanned transports .
?
And alarger 20 - 25 ton " Mir class " station that will follow by about 2020 launched on the new oxygen / hydrogen powered Long March 5 boosters .
The Chinesehave shown this editor numerous space station models and drawings during sixtrips to China over the last several years .
All of thoseconcepts looked very similar to the Soviet Mir with a core and add - on modules -- nothing like the Tiangongjust revealed in China .
The heavier Mir type design , however , is the one being pursued for launch on the new LongMarch 5 , Liu Fang , vice president of China Aerospace Science and TechnologyCorp . ( CASC ) told me during a visit to Beijing last April .
It will weigh twiceas much as the man tended military outpost .
The Tiangongdesign is designed for short tasks or limited overnight stays in a pressurizedshirtsleeve environment , while the heavier Chinese stations planned for severalyears from now will be for longer term habitation .
In additionto the manned program , the Chinese unmanned programhas also reached a major milestone with the Chang 'e lunar orbiter .
Thespacecraft ended its 16 month science mission March 1 when commanded to firethrusters to begin a 36 min. descent toward lunar impact at 0813 GMT .
The impactpoint was calculated to be at 1.50 deg. south latitude and 52.36 deg. eastlongitude .
onthe opposite side of the Moon from where the descent was begun .
Chang 'e - 1 began its retrofire maneuver for capture by lunar gravity at 0736 GMT under thecommand of two ground control stations , one at Qingdao in eastern Chinaand the other at Kashiin northwest China .
Thespacecraft had been launched from Xichang on board a Long March 3 on October24 , 2007 and used its imaging system to obtain mapping imagery of the entiremoon .
It was commanddeorbitedto provide Chinese engineers with experience in calculating and controlling thedescent of a spacecraft in lunar orbit .
Lunar " masscons " , subsurface concentrations of heavy materials , can affect lunar gravity fieldsand orbital trajectories involved in deorbit .
This relatesdirectly to China 's follow on plan to land a nuclear powered unmanned lunarrover by 2012 - 2013 followed by an unmanned sample return mission about 2017 .
In2010 - 2011 , before the rover and sample return missions are flown aChinese - technology mission may be sent to the Moon to further demonstratelanding technologies .
But the Chinese were not clear on whether it would go allthe way to the surface .
Ifsuccessful , these missions also could upstage U.S. lunar plans for a time .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) --
The Utah Senate has approved the use of eminent domain to take federal land in the state .
More than 60 percent of Utah is owned by the U.S. government , and policy makers here have long complained that federal ownership hinders their ability to generate tax revenue and adequately fund public schools .
Utah spends less per student than any other state and has the nation 's largest class sizes .
The goal of the bill approved Tuesday is to spark a U.S. Supreme Court battle that legislators ' own attorneys acknowledge has little chance of success .
But Attorney General Mark Shurtleff and other Republicans say the case is still worth fighting because if the state wins it could reap billions of dollars for state schools .

A billboard showing a somber Mary and Joseph laying in bed together with the caption " Poor Joseph .
God was a hard act to follow , " is controversial , but not obscene , according to a decision by New Zealand 's Advertising Standards Authorities .
The billboard , posted outside St. Matthew - in - the - city Anglican Church in Auckland , New Zealand , sparked outrage and vandalism by locals who " consider the sexually and suggestive illustration of the nativity to be degrading to individuals and Christian groups , " according to a complaint filed with the ASA regarding the billboard that was posted before Christmas last year .
The debate led to a slew of complaints being filed with the ASA over the nature of the billboard , to ensure it was not put up again .
" I consider it inappropriate for a child 's perceptive of Christmas to be distorted in a perverse and sexual manner , " the complaint said .
The billboard was put up in December , was vandalized , stolen and then put up again before being stolen yet again .
The two billboards were up for a total of less than 12 hours before they were both taken , according to the complaint .
Another two versions of the ad were later put up and also vandalized before being stolen , according to the complaint .
The church said while they know some people were offended by the billboard , others " found it amusing and thought - provoking but liberating as well . "
" The billboard , while outraging what I believe to be a minority has managed to bring a discussion of religion and theology to kitchen tables in 177 countries if our Web site statistics can be believed , " the church stated in its argument to the ASA .
Ultimately , the ASA agreed , saying because there were no naked people or sexual acts depicted on the billboard , while children could see it , they likely would n't understand it .
The ASA ruled there were no ethical problems with the billboard which had been prepared with a " due sense of social responsibility " so offended adults were likely more angry because the billboard conflicted with their views of faith - not because of anything offensive or obscene in the billboard .
What do you think of the billboard ?
Did the church cross a line with the advertisement or is it perfectly acceptable ?

The Purple People movement has drawn thousands onto the streets
Think of a world of politics without spin doctors , teleprompters , stage - managed conferences , party headquarters , manifestos , cynicism or even leaders .
One does exist .
It is the world of the Purple People .
They are not some strange , colour - corrected version of the Na'vi , found in Avatar .
They are human beings , they mostly live in Italy and they are angry - angry with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
They are called the Purple People because they have adopted the colour purple as a way of identifying themselves .
Why purple ?
" Because no other political party uses it , " says Ginevra Tosoni , an unemployed graphic designer who has found her way to this extraordinary new political movement by way of the internet .
Informal movement The Purple People organisation was founded somewhere on Facebook .
There are rumours about who started it a few months ago , but no - one is quite sure .
Italy 's official opposition is weak and divided and is not doing its job
Ginevra Tosoni
Purple People activist
It really does not have a leader .
It coalesces around ideas and a few hard - working fixers and is egalitarian , but not socialist .
It is a political movement outside of the political system .
Its only physical manifestations are the people who support it and a caravan , or to be precise , a tiny mobile home .
Where it is parked is central to what this is all about .
For two months it has been stationed in the heart of Rome 's political district .
It is a kind of mission control without a mission statement .
But it does have a message : Mr Berlusconi , we want you and your government out .
Not a very lofty premise for a political movement , you might think .
But it is one that has gained traction in the minds of tens , if not hundreds of thousands , of Italians .
Electronic messages
They appear to be a genuine cross-section of Italian society that has come to the conclusion that Mr Berlusconi is bad for Italy 's health .
Inside the mobile home , party machinery amounts to a single laptop .
From it and a host of cell phones , e-mails , tweets and texts are sent on their electronic way .
Protesters turn out festooned in purple
This newly - minted opposition summons its foot soldiers to rally after rally , protest after protest , through technology .
And all respond by turning up festooned in something purple .
Be it scarves , bags , coats , shoes or sweaters , the colour purple is the must - have season accessory for the politically disaffected .
" Italy 's official opposition is weak and divided and is not doing its job , " Ms Tosoni tells me .
" So we have to do it for them " .
The " job " in question is landing a blow on Mr Berlusconi , who has been at the centre of a spate of scandals , rows and controversies .
From an alleged dalliance with a former escort and an under - explained relationship with an 18 - year - old model , to a messy ( and probably expensive ) divorce from his wife and battles with the judiciary ( who he has likened to the Taliban ) , all have been paraded before an open - jawed , incredulous , public .
Yet Mr Berlusconi's poll ratings hover at levels other leaders would salivate over .
Millions upon millions of Italians continue to give him their confidence .
Missed deadline
The latest crowd - pleasing / upsetting event ( delete where applicable ) concerns one Alfredo Milioni .
Mr Milioni , a former bus driver , is the hapless official from Mr Berlusconi 's party who missed a deadline to hand in a list of candidates to fight regional elections later this month in the Lazio region that includes Rome .
Silvio Berlusconi has weathered a series of scandals
The excuses proffered in the Italian press range from Mr Milioni being physically barred by opposition party members , to him nipping out to buy a sandwich and forgetting the time .
Tragic for the candidates , lucrative for the lawyers , entertainment for the masses .
But whatever the truth , it is one more factor behind the rise of the Purple People .
They view it as further incompetence engulfing Mr Berlusconi 's administration and an additional reason why he should fall on his figurative sword .
Mr Berlusconi need not worry , yet , about their collective , electoral impact .
By their own definition , Purple Protesters are disillusioned with orthodox politics , so are unlikely to face him at the ballot box .
But nor can the prime minister afford to ignore them .
" They represent something , " says Senator Lucio Malan , a member of Mr Berlusconi 's ruling People of Freedom Party .
" If there are thousands turning up to their rallies , it means there are many more who are thinking like them , " he says .
" We understand the frustrations and we must address it , " he adds .
Colour co-ordinated political movements have been more revolutionary - minded in other countries .
Who can forget the Orange protesters in Ukraine ?
In Italy , the Purple People are noisy but conformist .

It 's the season of Fashion Week , from Bryant Park in New York last week to London this week , and Milan , Los Angeles and Tokyo next month .
As designers and their models gather to present their newest collections to the world , photographers are on hand to take thousands of pictures , most during the actual show - with a few photos from the backstage of each show sent across the wires as well .
I 've gathered a handful of those backstage glimpses from recent fashion shows , most taken in New York , and share them with you below .

When I was learning how to use mass - estimating relationships ( MERs ) at Georgia Tech , our focus was on reusable launch vehicles , and most of our MERs came from NASA Langley , where my professor had once worked .
When it came to much of the reusability aspects of the spacecraft , the MER tended to depend on the entry or landing mass of the spacecraft rather than the gross mass or the propellant mass , as I have previously defined .
Systems like thermal protection , wings , aerosurfaces , and landing gear all tended to scale with entry or landing mass .
So to capture these effects in order to help calculate performance of reusable vehicles , I introduce another non-dimensional term .
I use the letter epsilon to describe the entry - mass - sensitive mass items divided by the entry mass .
The difference between the entry mass and the dry mass depends mostly on whether or not the payload is intended to return with the spacecraft , so I include a jettison factor ( f jett ) whose value is one if all the payload is jettisoned and zero if none of the payload is jettisoned before entry .
The gross mass of the vehicle is simply the mass of all the propellant , all the payload , and the dry mass of the vehicle .
If the vehicle is a multi-stage vehicle , then we consider each stage individually , and all of the upper stages are payload for the first stage .
Using our mass - sensitive terms ( gross , propellant , and entry ) we can also express the dry weight of the vehicle in terms of these sensitivities .
The engines and thrust structure will be accommodated by the gross - mass - sensitive term , the tankage and feedlines will be accommodated by the propellant - sensitive term , and the wings , thermal - protection , landing gear , and other structures will be accommodated by the entry - mass - sensitive term .
The mass of the spacecraft at atmospheric entry is not the same as the dry mass .
It might be returning with some fraction of its payload .
Therefore we account for this fact by a simple process of elimination .
The entry mass is the gross mass , less the propellant , less the payload multiplied by a fraction that is jettisoned before entry .
If we mean to design the vehicle to be able to return with the payload ( like the Space Shuttle ) then the fraction of payload to be jettisoned would be zero .
By substituting equation ( 4 ) into equation ( 3 ) , we obtain :
I employ the now - familiar substitution for propellant mass :
And simplify :
Which as you can see is the same as the previous expressions
if epsilon is zero .
A simple way to understand this expression is to think about it in terms of one .
One is the most payload fraction you could have –if all of your spacecraft is payload .
But some fraction has to be propellant , according to the rocket equation .
So you start out with your final mass fraction ( FMF ) .
From that point , which will always be less than one , you subtract lambda times the propellant mass fraction .
Then you subtract your phi term , which depends mostly on your engines .
Finally you subtract epsilon times your final mass fraction .
If you have anything left over , you have a payload fraction .
If you were going to jettison your payload before reentry , then the denominator gets a little smaller than one and your payload fraction improves a bit .
But it can never improve a payload fraction that is less than zero .
If your payload fraction is less than zero , then you had better go change something to clean things up .
You better use a better Isp to improve final mass fraction , or better tankage or propellants to improve lambda , or better engines to improve phi , or better TPS or wings or landing gear to improve epsilon .
Because if the numerator of the payload fraction is less than zero , you ’ve got no reason to build your rocket .

If you can sign an electronic pad at the supermarket to pay your credit card bill , why can't you sign the touch - screen of your iPhone to sign a political petition ?
That question is now being put to the test by the Citizen Power Campaign in California , working with technology developed by a company called Verafirma .
The ballot initiative they 're working on aims to strip public employee unions of their ability to tap member dues for political activities ( a proposal that may not be constitutional ) but leave the politics aside ; the potential to open a new front in ballot petitioning is what 's important .
As far as anyone knows , this is the first time in the U.S. that ballot initiative signatures are being collected using the internet .
This initiative is an outgrowth of the Tea Party movement in the state , and so far is relying on volunteers for petition - gathering .
The Lincoln Club of Orange County , an older Republican organization founded by businessmen in 1962 is providing financial support .
They need about 700,000 verified signatures and are shooting to get their initiative on next November 's ballot .
The video below from Verafirma shows how the company 's iPhone app works :
The question , of course , is whether the California Secretary of State 's office and the courts will uphold this new method of signature gathering .
This white paper from Verafirma makes the legal case pretty clearly , though obviously election lawyers will take a closer look .

Previous news ( - 2010 )
The Tea Party is getting popular -- really popular , if you ask Dick Armey , a former House Republican leader whose organization FreedomWorks helped organize the fledgling group , which has used tea bags to symbolize its opposition to new taxes .
" This is the broad center of American politics , " he said in an interview with MSNBC .
" Look at the polling data .
Right now the Tea Party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats . "
The Democrats and Republicans have been around awhile , so we were a little skeptical that the new party had gained such ground .
We contacted FreedomWorks to find out which poll Armey was referring to and were told to check out a December 2009 NBC - Wall Street Journal poll .
The poll asked the following question :
" As you may know , this year saw the start of something known as the Tea Party movement .
In this movement , citizens , most of whom are conservatives , participated in demonstrations in Washington , D.C. , and other cities , protesting government spending , the economic stimulus package , and any type of tax increases .
From what you know about this movement , is your opinion of it very positive , somewhat positive , neutral , somewhat negative , or very negative ?
If you do not know enough to have an opinion , please say so . "
The poll found that 41 percent of respondents had a positive view of the Tea Party movement ( either somewhat or very positive ) , while only 23 percent saw it negatively and 21 percent were neutral and 15 percent did not have an opinion .
By contrast , 28 percent viewed the Republican Party positively , 43 percent saw it negatively and 27 percent were neutral .
The Democratic Party was seen positively by 35 percent , negatively by 45 percent and neutral by 19 .
But some political analysts have questioned whether the poll exaggerated the Tea Party 's favorable ratings because the group is not well known and because of the heavy coverage it gets from Fox News , a conservative news outlet .
About 76 percent of those who see the Tea Party movement favorably also said they get their news from Fox , according to an analysis on MSNBC's First Read .
On Meet the Press in response to Armey 's comments , NBC political editor Chuck Todd questioned whether the Tea Party was " in the center .
I mean , when we did our own polling on this , it 's clear that the Tea Party gets a big benefit because there 's one news organization that gives them a huge bump all the time .
I mean , their favorable rating among
Fox viewers is through the roof , and the rest of the country sort of does n't know a lot about these folks . "
PolitiFact interviewed Karlyn Bowman , a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , and she made the same point .
" We know from other polls that a lot of Americans do n't know what the Tea Party is , " she said .
Indeed , the same NBC - Wall Street Journal poll showed that only 7 percent of respondents know a great deal about the Tea Party and 22 percent know a fair amount .
Bowman also questioned the validity of comparing the parties because of the way the poll was worded .
The Tea Party question included information about the group 's activities such as " protesting government spending , " while there were no such labels for Republicans or Democrats .
" I think people were responding to deep concerns about government , " she said , not necessarily the Tea Party movement .
While it 's clear that Republicans and Democrats are not polling well -- and that the NBC - Wall Street Journal poll provides some useful information about the mood of the country -- it does n't show definitively that the Tea Party is the most popular party in the country , Bowman said .
We also spoke with Jay Campbell , vice president for Hart McInturff , the firm that conducted the poll .
For the same reasons outlined by Bowman , he told us Armey 's comments were not an accurate representation of the poll 's findings .
" The main problem with it is that they 're making a comparison that is not an apples - to - apples comparison at all , " Campbell said .
" If we had said that the Democratic Party was the party of the working class , they might have polled more favorably . "
His firm included the descriptions for the Tea Party because pollsters were concerned that respondents otherwise would not know what it is .
A December 2009 Rasmussen poll also contradicts Armey 's statement .
It found that in a three - way generic ballot , Democrats attracted 36 % of the vote .
The Tea Party candidate picked up 23 % , and Republicans finished third with 18 % of the vote .
Another 22 % are undecided .
And a Fox News poll released Jan. 21 , 2010 , demonstrated that President Barack Obama would beat a potential Tea Party candidate in a White House run .
So Armey is drastically overstating the group 's standing .
Yes , the Tea Party is viewed favorably by people who know about the group ( particularly those who get their news from Fox ) , but the pollsters who conducted the survey say it 's not accurate to say that the party is more popular than Democrats or Republicans .
Also , other polls contradict Armey 's statement and indicate that Democrats are more popular than Tea Party candidates .
So we find Armey 's claim to be False .
An herbicide that contaminates the tap water consumed by millions of Americans has been found to produce gender - bending effects in male frogs , " chemically castrating " some and turning others into females , a study shows .
Frogs in the experiment were exposed to amounts of the weedkiller atrazine that are comparable to the levels allowed in drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency , says lead researcher Tyrone Hayes of the University of California - Berkeley .
The study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
In Hayes ' earlier studies , atrazine caused male frogs to begin growing eggs in their testes .
In this experiment , 10 % of the males exposed to atrazine — one of the most commonly used herbicide in the world — actually changed sex ; some were able to breed and lay eggs .
Nearly all of the other males had low testosterone and sperm levels , which made them unable to reproduce , Hayes says .
The experiment can't tell scientists whether atrazine affects humans in a similar way , Hayes says .
But it does raise new questions about the safety of atrazine , which other studies have linked to human birth defects , low birth weight , prematurity and low sperm count .
The EPA said in October that it planned to reassess atrazine 's safety , including its cancer risk .
The European Union has banned the chemical .
About 75 % of stream water samples and 40 % of groundwater samples contain atrazine , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental advocacy group , detected atrazine in 90 % of tap water samples from 139 water systems .
Inexpensive faucet - top water filters can remove the chemical , says Jennifer Sass , a scientist with the group .
Several water systems in Illinois , where atrazine is commonly used on corn and other crops , are suing the chemical 's manufacturers , asking them to pay the cost of taking the herbicide out of drinking water .
The principal scientist for Syngenta Crop Protection , the leading manufacturer of atrazine , says the chemical is safe .
Company - sponsored studies that met rigorous EPA standards found atrazine has " no effect on frog sexual development , " Tim Pastoor says .
He criticized the new study and notes that Hayes tested only one dose of atrazine .
A stronger study would have exposed frogs to several doses and noted any trends , he says .
Given that atrazine has survived years of scrutiny by the EPA , Pastoor says , he sees no reason to re-examine atrazine 's safety now .
" As far as we 're concerned , it 's unnecessary , " he says .
Although scientists still have many questions about atrazine , Sass says , the chemical should be phased out as a precaution .

[ Game -> Update ] - News related to Top Story : Obsidian Acquires Fallout Series | More info on Company : Obsidian Entertainment | More info on Game : Fallout series
The press release says it all : Obsidian Entertainment Acquires Fallout Series , Hire Original Developers
March 31 , 2010 ( Irvine , CA ) -- Obsidian Entertainment® announced today that it has acquired exclusive ownership of the Fallout®series -- beginning with the release of the highly anticipated Fallout : New Vegas® role - playing game .
Obsidian purchased the rights to the Fallout® franchise from Bethesda Softworks in a deal that awards Obsidian exclusive worldwide rights to the Fallout® franchise on the PC , home consoles , handhelds , and other media .
“ We ’re extremely excited about this development and what it means both for Obsidian and for Fallout fans around the world , ” said Feargus Urquhart , CEO of Obsidian Entertainment .
“ Fallout is one the great RPG franchises .
Millions of Fallout games have been sold worldwide , and fans have been eagerly awaiting the release of Fallout : New Vegas .
Obsidian ’s proven expertise in this genre , building on our industry experience and the tremendous success we have enjoyed with our previous games and experience with the series , will enable us to create the next chapter of Fallout that is truly worthy of the franchise . ”
In addition , Obsidian announced that it has hired a number of original Fallout developers - including Tim Cain , Leonard Boyarsky , and Jason Anderson - to work on the series .
These developers will join the already large roster of staff at Obsidian who have previous experience with the series .
Obsidian has plans to open an exclusive Fallout division at the studio .
Originally released in 1997 , Fallout places a player in the role of a Vault - dweller , who ventures from his secluded , underground survival Vault into a post - apocalyptic world of mutants , radiation , gangs and violence .
The game has been widely hailed as one of the outstanding role - playing games and video games of all time with its unique gameplay , style , and setting .
Commenting on this development , Bethesda President Vlatko Andonov said , “ This is a good agreement for both companies and for gamers .
Although several parties had a high level of interest in purchasing Fallout , we are most impressed by Obsidian ’s execution of role - playing titles .
Obsidian is the ideal choice to take on the Fallout franchise . ”
Fallout : New Vegas is currently being developed by Obsidian under the direction of Lead Designer Josh Sawyer .
“ We are overjoyed , ” said Sawyer .
“ Fallout is one of the greatest games ever made , and we plan to take the series back to its RPG roots while delivering a high - quality visual experience .
We realize that a lot of fans are unhappy with the current state of affairs with the Fallout series - especially the lack of the true PnP style RPG elements that made the original Fallout such a wonderful game .
We want to bring these things back into the mainstream .
As game developers and RPG gamers , we know what makes a game great - and no marketing department is going to tell us any different . ” . . .
April Fools !....... or is it really a forecast of the future ?
Terrorists and racists are turning to online social networks and depending less on traditional Web sites , according to a new report on digital terror and hate speech .
The report , by the Simon Wiesenthal Center , found a 20 percent increase in the number of hate and terrorist - abetting Web sites , social network pages , chat forums and micro-bloggers over the last year , to a total of 11,500 .
“ The real growth is where it is for everyone : in social networks , ” said Rabbi Abraham Cooper , an associate dean at the center , a Jewish human rights group , which issued the report on Monday .
Longtime Web sites like Stormfront , which bills itself as a leading site of the “ White Nationalist Community , ” are still around and active , Rabbi Cooper said .
But such sites have become the old - line media of online racism .
The annual report is intended as a “ collective snapshot ” of the activities of hate groups and terrorists online , Rabbi Cooper said .
It is distributed as a CD - ROM , mainly to law enforcement agencies and nonprofit groups , instead of online because it includes terrorist tutorials , like video clips of bomb - making instructions .
“ We do n’t want to help the bad guys , ” Rabbi Cooper explained .
The report is part of the center ’s effort to raise awareness about hate groups , and the center urges Web users who encounter hate sites , videos or groups to e-mail links to ireport@wiesenthal.com .
The center then contacts Web companies or law enforcement agencies , as appropriate .
“ The goal is to get the collective genius of the Internet to help combat this problem , ” he said .

Lashknife ’s Quake Live Config Generator
Quake games have always been highly customizable by either executing configs or typing the cvars or commands straight into the console .
Quake Live is no different .
For new players or for those who come from other games , it seems as if the experienced players get an edge over them .
It must be said that config tweaking is not cheating in any way , because new players also have the option to tweak as much as they want .
However , the console is not the most user friendly place if you ’re not familiar with it , so I decided to provide an online Quake Live config generator to quickly adjust several ingame settings without having to go through all the available cvars and commands .
Remark : even though it seems most Quake 3 commands and cvars still exist in Quake Live , some are different .
It is therefore not advised to just execute your Quake 3 config because it has been reported it can lead to a game crash !
How to use :
Navigate through the available tabs to see what options you can set .
If you hover the mouse over a text field or checkbox , it shows a small explanation of what the ingame command looks like and what it does .
When you have set all options to your likings , or if you changed options after generating a config , just go to the Generate tab and press the Update button .
Some options require the video rendering system to restart , do this using the vid_restart command .
Download the config into your Quake Live home directory .
Once ingame , you can execute it using the command : / exec configname
the config generator has been discontinued

Welcome , new Cocoa or Cocoa Touch programmer .
Here are some things you will need to know .
Cocoa vs. Cocoa Touch Cocoa is the Mac development framework , principally consisting of Foundation , the Application Kit ( a.k.a. AppKit ) , and Core Data .
Cocoa
Touch is the iPhone development framework , principally consisting of Foundation , UIKit , and Core Data .
( “ iPhone ” here means devices running the iPhone OS , including the iPod touch and iPad . )
On Stack Overflow , please do n't tag your question cocoa unless it has to do with Cocoa .
It 's OK to put an iPhone question there as long as it's about something that exists on both platforms .
Tagging an iPhone - specific question “ cocoa ” is inaccurate , and wastes the time of Mac - only programmers like myself .
( You would n't want me to tag my Mac - specific questions “ cocoa - touch ” , would you ? )
Critically important things Memory management is based on ownership .
( These rules do n't apply under garbage collection .
If you 're using or supporting GC , see the Garbage Collection Programming Guide . )
If you create an object with a method whose selector contains the word “ alloc ” or “ new ” , or with a function whose name contains the word “ Create ” , then you own it .
If you make a copy of an existing object using a method whose selector contains the word “ copy ” , or from a function whose name contains the word “ Copy ” ( or obtain an object from such a function ) , then you own the copy .
Otherwise , you do n't own the object .
If you own an object , you are obliged to release it .
If you do n't own an object , but you want to , then you have two choices :
Take co-ownership of the object by retaining it .
Make a copy of the object , and own that .
Ignore the retainCount method and its Core Foundation equivalent .
They are practically useless and frequently misleading .
Instead , think about ownerships .
Does object A own object B ?
If so , then it should have either ( a ) created object B itself , ( b ) copied object B from some other object , or ( c ) retained object B upon receiving it from elsewhere .
If object A does not own object B , then in cases ( a ) and ( b ) , it should have autoreleased object B immediately after creating it , and case ( c ) usually should not happen at all .
If object A owns object B , but has not done ( a ) , ( b ) , or ( c ) , then object B is under - retained and may die while object A is holding on to it .
When object A goes to use it , you will crash .
If object A does not own object B , but does ( a ) , ( b ) , or ( c ) , then object B is over - retained , and , assuming that object A does not release it , object B will become a leak .
The definitive word on this subject is in the Memory Management Programming Guide for Cocoa and the Memory Management Programming Guide for Core Foundation .
Read both of those documents from start to finish .
Cocoa and Cocoa Touch are designed around Model - View - Controller .
Maintain the MVC separation at all times .
Failure to do so will make development harder , because you will be doing more work .
The framework can do a lot for you , but only if your app is properly factored into Model , View , and Controller .
Everything in C is exactly the same in Objective - C. Objective - C is a strict superset of C ; unlike C++ , there are no changes to existing aspects of C. C is a thorny language .
Concepts such as pointers and the preprocessor are alien to most languages , and to you if you 've never used a language that has them before .
Since these features exist in C , they exist in Objective - C , and you will use or at least encounter them .
So , learn C first , so that your first encounters with them will be ones of deliberate usage and not ones of confusion .
Core Data is not a relational ( SQL ) database .
It is not SQLite or any other .
More on this later .
If you want a relational database , such as SQLite , you can use SQLite .
Both Mac OS X and the iPhone include SQLite , so you can just use that directly ( or through a thin wrapper such as FMDB ) .
You 'll be giving up all of Core Data 's niceties , though , such as support for NSPredicates and ( on the Mac ) Cocoa Bindings .
Interface Builder is your friend .
If you 're coming from another platform , you 're used to writing your user interface in code .
You may even fear graphical GUI - design tools such as Interface Builder .
Do n't .
IB is your friend .
It will save you hours of tedious work writing UI code .
Embrace it .
When your app crashes , use the debugger .
If you 're new to programming , the debugger will mystify you .
Take the time to read the documentation about it , and maybe seek out some screencasts about it .
The debugger will tell you about why your app crashed — most times , all you need to do is read what it says .
Do n't forget to check the Debugger Console .
Often , the framework will dump useful information there .
Instruments is your friend .
Instruments will tell you , among other things :
Which things are retaining an object ( and which ones have not yet released it ) ( ObjectAlloc )
Which objects own which other objects ( ObjectGraph ; Mac-only )
Which objects and other allocations still exist , even though nothing knows about them anymore ( Leaks )
What your app is doing in processor time ( Sampler )
Any time the question “ why is XYZ slow ? ” or “ will XYZ be slow ? ” enters your head , or even a guess that XYZ will be slow , implement XYZ ( if you have n't already ) and then run Instruments .
Terminology Objective - C is a programming language .
Cocoa and Cocoa Touch are frameworks — collections of Application Programming Interfaces ( APIs ) .
You write your code in the Objective - C language , using the Cocoa / Cocoa Touch APIs .
All of the NS - prefixed ( and , on the iPhone , UI - prefixed ) classes , protocols , and categories you 'll use are part of the Cocoa and / or Cocoa Touch frameworks , not the Objective - C language .
In Objective -C : Instances have instance variables , not members .
Members are only for structures and unions ; Objective - C classes are not the same as C structures .
, not members .
Members are only for structures and unions ; Objective - C classes are not the same as C structures .
Classes do not have members , static or otherwise .
There are no class variables .
The closest thing is what C calls a static variable , in the class 's implementation file .
This is not the same thing :
A static variable at file scope is only visible within that file , and it is visible to everything in that file .
So , if you were to put multiple classes into that file , all of them would have access to the variable .
Conversely , if you were to split the one class into multiple files , only the part that was in the same file as the variable declaration would have access to it .
If you were to copy the declaration to all of the files , each file would have its own variable with the same name as all of the others — i.e. , you would have multiple variables with the same name .
Thus , “ static variables ” in C ( and , hence , Objective - C ) are not the same as “ static variables ” in certain object - oriented languages that are n't Objective - C.
However , in practice , the distinction is minor :
When you do need a class variable , a static variable in the implementation file ( as long as it's just one file ) works as a substitute .
Subclasses descend from or inherit from their superclasses .
This is what other languages call “ extends ” , but in Objective - C , that English verb more accurately describes categories .
Functions and methods are two different things .
Instances and classes have methods .
Functions , being a C feature , are not related to any class or instance , regardless of where you declare them .
Spelling notes
The IDE is spelled Xcode : Lowercase c , no hyphen .
The object modeling and persistence framework is spelled Core Data :
Two words , again with no hyphen .
( Not “ CoreData ” or “ Core - Data ” ) .
On Stack Overflow , use the core - data tag .
Similarly , Core Foundation , Core Graphics , etc .
Apple is not always consistent about this ( “ CoreGraphics ” and “ CoreImage ” are not uncommon ) , but outside of pathnames , including the space is never wrong .
On Stack Overflow , tags can't have spaces , so use a hyphen in place of the space : core- foundation , core - data , core - graphics , cocoa - touch .
“ cocoa touch ” , with a space , is two tags , “ cocoa ” and “ touch ” .
Core Data Core Data is : A modeling framework .
You lay out your app 's model graphically in Xcode .
At run time , the managed objects are your model objects .
An object persistence framework .
Core Data will handle major portions of reading objects from and writing them to long - term storage ( e.g. , disk ) for you .
Core Data is not : Just a wrapper of SQLite .
One of the storage formats you can choose is based on SQLite , but that is an implementation detail .
You have no direct access to the schema or to the database .
You cannot issue SQL queries , regardless of which store you 're using .
A relational database .
It is an object database .
There are no selects , no updates , no order by or limit clauses ; there are only inserts and fetches .
You do n't work with rows in tables , you work with objects , classed by entity .
Bindings ( Mac only )
It bears repeating : Make model objects .
Bindings will kick your ass if you use property - list objects ( e.g. , dictionaries ) as model objects .
It looks like less work at first , but it 's really not — in Cocoa , model objects pay off because you 're working with the framework , not against it .
The Bindings Inspector in Interface Builder distinguishes the Controller Key from the Model Key Path for a reason .
Consider the common example of binding a table column in a table view :
You bind the column 's value binding to a property of a controller ( typically arrangedObjects of an NSArrayController ) .
binding to a property of a controller ( typically of an NSArrayController ) .
The column asks the controller for the value of the Controller Key , and gets model objects .
Each row in the table view corresponds to one of these objects .
The column then asks each model object for the value of the Model Key Path , and gets a value object ( e.g. , an image , string , or attributed string ) to pass to the cell , and thus to display to the user .
Thus , the columns are subordinate to the rows :
Each row is a whole model object , broken down into columns , each of which shows part of the object .
In the other direction , if the user edits one of the rows , the cell 's value will change , and the table column / table view will set the new object as the model object 's new value for the Model Key Path .
This means that it is not possible to use cell editing to replace one object with another in the array , because those objects must be model objects , and the cell can only display and change the value of some property of each object .
There are two solutions to that : ( a) Make the model object able to update all of its other properties whenever one of its vital properties is changed ( which is fragile , because you will fall behind on the set of properties that need to be updated ) , or ( b ) Use a data source , not Bindings .
Bindings is great for certain common cases , but not for everything .
There is no shame in using a data source for things that are incompatible with the way Bindings work .
Just be sure you are n't doing something deeply wrong , such as not implementing a model layer .
Exceptions vs. errors
Never call an exception an “ error ” , nor an exception message ( printed in the Console ) an “ error message ” .
This is wrong .
Exceptions and errors are different things for completely opposite purposes .
Errors are things that have gone wrong that the user needs to know about , and possibly to handle .
Exceptions are the opposite :
Things that the user should never know happened .
Some exceptions ( arguably most ) should never happen at all , because they indicate that something has gone wrong inside your program .
You may use assertions to detect such cases ; when an assertion detects such a case ( i.e. , fails ) , the assertion failure is an exception .
In Cocoa , the Application Kit provides APIs to let you present errors to the user .
It provides no such features for exceptions , because that 's not what they 're for .
Whenever your app needs to handle a problem , do n't reach for exceptions immediately — think about whether the problem is an exception or an error , and use the one that 's appropriate .
Windows , plural
On the iPhone , your app normally only has one window , due to both screen size limitations and the current UI model .
( It 's not yet clear whether this restriction will disappear on the iPad . )
On the Mac , your application has multiple windows .
Even if you only create and manage one window , it has others , including the About , Font , Color , Find , and Spelling panels .
Even an application that provides no way to access the Font , Color , Find , and Spelling panels ( such as a game ) will still have an About panel .
So , your application does not have “ the window ” or “ its window ” .
It has multiple windows .
Get used to this ; it will matter sooner or later in your app 's lifetime .
When practicing with Cocoa , you may want to make a document - based application , at least as a toy app , in order to jump with both feet into the multiple - windows world .
What Cocoa calls “ the main window ” is the active window : the one that has the active appearance .
There 's also “ the key window ” , which is the window that receives key events .
These are not always the same window :
Thus , “ the main window ” ( the active one ) may not be what you consider the Main ( primary ) Window : The About panel , for example , can be main ( active ) while your Main Window is not .
A document - based app has no Main ( primary ) Window , but as long as it has at least one window , it has a main ( active ) window .
A window can be key even if it cannot become main , as demonstrated by the Inspector panel in the above screenshot .

For more information about FreeBSD release engineering activities please see :
Availability
FreeBSD 7.3 - RELEASE is now available for the amd64 , i386 , pc98 , and sparc64 architectures .
FreeBSD 7.3 can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the network .
The required files can be downloaded via FTP or BitTorrent as described in the sections below .
While some of the smaller FTP mirrors may not carry all architectures , they will all generally contain the more common ones such as amd64 and i386 .
MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO images are included at the bottom of this message .
The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as follows :
dvd1
This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD operating system , a collection of pre-built packages , and the documentation .
It also supports booting into a " livefs " based rescue mode .
This should be all you need if you can burn and use DVD - sized media .
disc1
This contains the base FreeBSD operating system and the xorg packages for CDROM - sized media .
There are no other packages on this image but there are more packages ( mostly Gnome and KDE ) on the disc2 and disc3 images .
If you choose to install packages post - install you should just need disc1 , you only need disc2 / disc3 if you want to install Gnome or KDE during install .
livefs
This contains support for booting into a " livefs " based rescue mode but does not support doing an install from the CD itself .
It is meant to help rescue an existing system but could be used to do a network based install if necessary .
bootonly
This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does not contain the support for installing FreeBSD from the CD itself .
You would need to perform a network based install ( e.g. from an FTP server ) after booting from the CD .
FreeBSD 7.3 - RELEASE can also be purchased on CD - ROM or DVD from several vendors .
One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD 7.3 - based products is :
BitTorrent
7.3-RELEASE ISOs are available via BitTorrent .
A collection of torrent files to download the images is available at :
FTP
At the time of this announcement the following FTP sites have FreeBSD 7.3 - RELEASE available .
However before trying these sites please check your regional mirror (s ) first by going to :
ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.
FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD
Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2 , ftp3 and so on .
More information about FreeBSD mirror sites can be found at :
For instructions on installing FreeBSD , please see Chapter 2 of The FreeBSD Handbook .
It provides a complete installation walk - through for users new to FreeBSD , and can be found online at :
Updates from Source
The procedure for doing a source code based update is described in the FreeBSD Handbook :
The branch tag to use for updating the source is RELENG_7_3 .
FreeBSD Update
The freebsd - update ( 8 ) utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases .
Systems running 7 .[ 012 ] - RELEASE , 7.3-BETA1 , or 7.3 - RC [ 12 ] can upgrade as follows :
# freebsd - update upgrade -r 7.3 - RELEASE
During this process , FreeBSD
Update may ask the user to help by merging some configuration files or by confirming that the automatically performed merging was done correctly .
# freebsd - update install
The system must be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before continuing .
# shutdown -r now
After rebooting , freebsd - update needs to be run again to install the new userland components , and the system needs to be rebooted again :
# freebsd - update install # shutdown -r now
Users of earlier FreeBSD releases ( FreeBSD 6.x ) can also use freebsd - update to upgrade to FreeBSD 7.3 , but will be prompted to rebuild all third - party applications ( e.g. , anything installed from the ports tree ) after the second invocation of " freebsd - update install " , in order to handle differences in the system libraries between FreeBSD 6.x and FreeBSD 7.x .
Support
The FreeBSD Security Team currently plans to support FreeBSD 7.3 until March 31st 2012 .
Users of FreeBSD 7.2 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to either FreeBSD 7.3 or FreeBSD 8.0 before the FreeBSD 7.2 End of Life on June 30th 2010 .
For more information on the Security Team and their support of the various FreeBSD branches see :

Greeks are bracing for a long and deep recession ahead as it begins to dawn on them that the cost of fixing the country ’s public finances will entail years of economic hardship and high unemployment .
In recent public opinion polls , but also in the media , the business community , and even in ordinary dinner conversation , the feeling is that it will take several years for the Greece to emerge from its economic crisis and that there is much pain to come before things improve .
“ I have no doubt that we will remain in recession in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 and that the recession will deepen .
It wo n’t be until the first half of 2013 that we will see a recovery , ” said Yanos Gramatidis , president of the American - Hellenic Chamber of Commerce .
“ And I think most people have grasped that . ”
The medical records of more than 18,000 patients of at least five Torrance doctors were potentially accessed by cyber - thieves on a single day in September , but this is probably the first you ’re hearing of it .
Although a new federal law requiring greater disclosure of medical - data security breaches was passed a year ago , it was n’t until recently that the Department of Health and Human Services began posting specific incidents online .
And the feds are n’t exactly being generous with details about people ’s confidential medical info being hacked or going astray .
In the Sept. 27 Torrance cases , for example , were the doctors in the same office ?
Were they in the same building ?
Did they share a single computer ?
Did they share office staff ?
Or was it just a fluke that five local doctors ’ offices were hit by cyber - thieves on the same day ?
More to the point , were people ’s Social Security numbers involved ?
What about billing information ?
The Health and Human Services database does n’t include this information .
Nor does it identify the doctors involved .
“ All we know is that there was unauthorized access involving one or more desktop computers at one or more doctors ’ offices in Torrance on the same day , ” said Linda Foley , co-founder of the Identity Theft Resource Center , a San Diego advocacy group .
Although individual patients affected by the breaches were presumably notified by the various doctors , details of the incidents would certainly be of interest to anyone else shopping around for a physician , or to investigators seeking patterns in security violations .
Foley has been keeping tabs on the government ’s efforts to disclose information about medical data breaches .
Until last week , she said , the Health and Human Services site offered no such info , even though the new law requires disclosure of hacked or lost medical data .
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act includes rules for disclosure of security breaches in cases involving more than 500 patients , as well as use of medical data for marketing and patients ’ electronic access to their own information .
“ We ’re finally getting some disclosures , ” Foley said .
“ But what we ’re seeing raises more questions than it answers . ”
For example , Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program reported that about 15,500 California patients were potentially affected by the theft of a “ portable electronic device ” on Dec. 1 .
What kind of device ?
What sort of patient information was involved ?
What were the circumstances of the theft ?
None of that is made clear in the Health and Human Services database .
Nor do we know much about the 5,900 patients potentially affected by the theft of a laptop from City of Hope in Duarte .
That incident happened the same day the Torrance security breaches occurred .
Coincidence ?
Related ?
Who knows .
In the Kaiser case , a company spokeswoman said the data had been on an external storage device that was stolen from an employee ’s car in Sacramento .
The employee was subsequently fired .
A City of Hope spokeswoman said the laptop in that case was also stolen from an employee ’s car and contained only “ limited information . ”
Georgina Verdugo , director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights , which oversees privacy matters for the agency , said it ’s taken this long to get breach notices online because the new law gave doctors , hospitals and others a six - month grace period before they had to start reporting wayward data .
Then there was another grace period allowing medical facilities an additional 60 days to report any cyber - trouble after an incident occurred .
Then HHS staff had to verify the reported incidents before word could be passed along to the general public .
“ The main point of the law is not to put notices up on the website , ” Verdugo said .
“ It ’s to trigger a regulatory investigation . ”
OK .
But one problem with the seemingly endless string of security breaches involving people ’s personal data -- medical and otherwise -- is a lack of accountability for those entrusted with our info .
Detailed public disclosure of such incidents provides a strong incentive for businesses and service providers to improve their security measures .
It also helps the public remain well informed about how vulnerable we all are to privacy violations .
“ This is certainly cause for concern , ” Verdugo said of people ’s medical data falling into the wrong hands .
“ It ’s a serious act . ”
Not that you could tell from the HHS website .
That free cruise
I wrote last week about an apparent scam involving a free Caribbean cruise .
The sales pitch included a variety of businesses that had no knowledge of the offer , not to mention a cruise ship that ’s been sold for scrap and now lies rusting on an Indian beach .
The scheme typically involves having to give your credit card number to secure the free cruise booking .
I received a call from a “ cruise coordinator ” the other day congratulating me on having been awarded a free trip to the Bahamas for having completed a consumer survey .
He identified himself as “ Mr. Charles ” and said I could look forward to three days and two nights of all - expenses - paid cruising .
I ’d just need to give him a credit card number to cover $ 59 per person in port taxes .
What if I did n’t give the number ?
What if I just sent a check instead to the port authorities ?
“ No , ” Mr. Charles replied , “ you have to give us a credit card number .
If you do n’t , we ’ll offer your free cruise to the next person on our list . ”
How do I know this is n’t a scam ?
Mr. Charles laughed .
“ If this was a scam , ” he said , “ the government would have closed it down . ”
There .
I told Mr. Charles I ’d have to think about it .
He told me not to think too long -- it ’d be a shame if I did n’t get my free cruise .
Actually , I ’ve been resigned to that for a while now .

Oxygen for ethanol oxidation is supplied through breathing , the stomach , and the skin .
There is a great deal of genetic and environmental variability in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol absorption , distribution , metabolism , and elimination .
A new study has found that increasing dissolved oxygen concentrations in alcohol may help to reduce alcohol - related side effects and accidents .
Results will be published in the May 2010 issue of Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research and are currently available at Early View .
" Ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde , then further oxidized to water and carbon dioxide in the body after consumption , " explained Kwang -il Kwon , a professor in the college of pharmacy at Chungnam National University and corresponding author for the study .
" These oxidation reactions occur primarily via hepatic oxidation and are governed by the catalytic properties of alcohol - metabolizing enzymes , including the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system ( MEOS ) , alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ) , and aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) .
Ethanol oxidation by ADH , ALDH , and MEOS requires oxygen , and a higher oxygen uptake increases the rate of ethanol oxidation . "
" Several studies have indicated that high - oxygen water can enhance the survival ability of mice , fatigue recovery , and anoxia endurance function , " added Hye Gwang Jeong , a professor in the department of toxicology in the college of pharmacy at Chungnam National University .
" It can also increase energy storage .
However , the influence of dissolved oxygen concentration on alcohol pharmacokinetics has not previously been described .
This manuscript is the first to investigate the influence of dissolved oxygen concentrations on the pharmacokinetics of alcohol in healthy human subjects . "
Kwon and his colleagues performed three experiments with 49 healthy volunteers ( 30 men , 19 women ) , with a mean age of 27.2 years .
Experiment one compared 8 ppm and 20 ppm dissolved oxygen concentrations in 240 ml of 19.5 percent alcoholic beverage .
Experiment two compared 8 ppm and 20 ppm dissolved oxygen concentrations in 360 ml of 19.5 percent alcoholic beverage .
Experiment three compared 8 ppm and 25 ppm dissolved oxygen concentrations in 360 ml of 19.5 percent alcoholic beverage .
Results showed that elevated , dissolved oxygen concentrations in alcoholic drinks can accelerate the metabolism and elimination of alcohol .
For example , the time to reach 0.000 percent blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) for the 240 ml of 19.5 percent alcoholic beverage with 20 ppm dissolved oxygen concentration was 20.0 min faster than with 8 ppm ( 257.7 min ) .
The time to reach 0.000 percent BAC for the 360 ml of 19.5 percent alcoholic beverage with 20 ppm ( 334.5 min ) and 25 ppm ( 342.1 min ) dissolved oxygen concentration was 23.3 min and 27.1 min faster than with 8 ppm , respectively .
" The oxygen - enriched alcohol beverage reduces plasma alcohol concentrations faster than a normal dissolved - oxygen alcohol beverage does , " said Kwon .
" This could provide both clinical and real - life significance .
The oxygen - enriched alcohol beverage would allow individuals to become sober faster , and reduce the side effects of acetaldehyde without a significant difference in alcohol 's effects .
Furthermore , the reduced time to a lower BAC may reduce alcohol - related accidents . "
Both Kwon and Jeong noted that alcoholic drinks with a higher oxygen concentration already exist in Korea , but they lack scientific support .
" It seems that these drinks can maintain a high dissolved - oxygen concentration for about 10 to 20 days before the stopper is removed , and for 70 minutes after removing the stopper , respectively , at room temperature , " said Kwon .
Both scientists suggested that future studies look closer at dissolved - oxygen concentrations on specific enzymes of alcohol metabolism , such as ADH , ALDH , and MEOS .
FDIC Chief Says Biggest Banks Must Increase Lending , or Recovery Will Stall U.S. banks last year registered their steepest decline in lending in 67 years .
March 8 , 2010  --
The biggest banks in the United States should suffer under the glare of the public spotlight if they do not increase lending to businesses and consumers , a key U.S. banking regulator said Monday .
" A light needs to be shined on this and explanations need to be made where credit is not being provided , " Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief Sheila Bair said at an economists ' conference just outside Washington , D.C .
U.S. banks last year registered their steepest decline in lending in the last 67 years , with total \outstanding loans plunging by 7.5 percent .
While easy credit to unworthy borrowers was one of the culprits of the recent financial crisis , tight credit could now hinder the country 's economic recovery .
The country 's biggest banks , Bair said , are currently not lending as much as their smaller counterparts .
" If you cross the line , " she said , " and get into a situation where regulators are starting to order banks to lend , the history of that is n't good .
But I do think shining a public spotlight on it and maintaining public pressure is something we can do . "
Bair spoke at a conference in Arlington , Va. , hosted by the National Association of Business Economists .
In a survey released by the group Monday , 63 percent of economists said they anticipate the Federal Reserve will raise its key interest rate soon , while 80 percent expressed concern that the country 's soaring deficits will eventually result in higher borrowing costs for the country .
Doug Elmendorf , director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office , warned in a speech to the conference that U.S. budget deficits are on " an unsustainable path " and at this pace will pose " a growing risk to the recovery . "
Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) was on Fox News this morning and called reconciliation a way to “ railroad the American people and the Congress . ”
This is the same Judd Gregg who took to the Senate floor in 2005 to defend reconciliation as merely a “ rule of the Senate ” that allows for a simple majority vote .

GlaxoSmithKline intimidates scientists
Analysis :
What does it all mean ?
( Natural News ) GlaxoSmithKline , maker of the diabetes drug Avandia , knew the drug was linked to tens of thousands of heart attacks but went out of its way to hide this information from the public , says a 334 - page report just released by the Senate Finance Committee .
( http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2010/...
This report also accuses the FDA of betraying the public trust , explaining that FDA bureaucrats intentionally dismissed safety concerns found by the agency 's own scientists .
The report says that Big Pharma 's drugs " put public safety at risk because the FDA has been too cozy with drug makers and has been regularly outmaneuvered by companies that have a financial interest in downplaying or under - exploring potential safety risks . "
Sales of Avandia were $ 3.2 billion ( yes , billion ) in 2006 .
According to a statistical analysis in the report , if all the diabetics currently taking Avandia were put on a " safer " drug , it would avert 500 heart attacks and 300 cases of heart failurein the United States alone .
Presently , hundreds of thousands of Americans are still taking this drug , and hundreds will continue to die each month as a result , according to the report estimates .
This report , championed by U.S. Senators Grassley and Baucus , is the result of investigators pouring through more than 250,000 pages of documentation gathered from GlaxoSmithKline and the FDA .
The document reveals some rather startling facts about the dangers of Avandia , including evidence from the FDA 's own scientists who concluded that This investigative report also reveals that GSK engaged in the intimidation of physicians , saying : " GSK executives attempted to intimidate independent physicians , focused on strategies to minimize or misrepresent findings that Avandia may increase cardiovascular risk and sought ways to downplay findings that a competing drug might reduce cardiovascular risk . "
" Patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives , and GlaxoSmithKline abused that trust . " said Sen. Baucus .
( Gee , really ?
Is anyone really surprised that GSK put its own financial interests ahead of a few thousand human lives ? ) A separate letter sent to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg by Senators Baucus and Grassley added , " the totality of evidence suggests that GSK was aware of the possible cardiac risks associated with Avandia years before such evidence became public . "
The FDA 's own research also showed Avandia to be associated with a significant increase in heart attack risk , yet the FDA did nothing to protect the public .
The agency 's own scientists wrote in 2008 , " There is strong evidence that rosiglitazone [ Avandia ] confers an increased risk of [ heart attacks ] and heart failure compared to pioglitazone [ a rival drug on market ] . "
This evidence went completely ignored at the FDA .
The FDA 's famous Dr David Graham -- the key whistleblower on the Vioxx scandal -- concluded from his own research , " Rosiglitazone should be removed from the market .
" Even the American Medical Association -- a long - time defender of Big Pharma 's drugs -- admitted Avandia was dangerous .
Its journal , JAMA , wrote in 2007 : " Among patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes , rosiglitazone use for at least 12 months is associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure , without a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality .
" The New England Journal of Medicine also warned about the safety of the drug in an article published in 2007 .
Despite these multiple warnings , an FDA panel voted 22 - 1 in favor of keeping Avandia on the market .
This is no surprise , of course , to those who know how the FDA really operates ( and where its priorities really lie ) .
Are you kidding me ?
A drug company hid data that its high - profit drug was linked to increased risk of heart attacks ?
A drug company intimidated physicians and got away with hoodwinking the public while raking in billions of dollars in sales for a drug that the FDA 's own scientists said should be pulled from the market ?
Sounds likeat the FDA , the " sweep it under the rug " division of the pharmaceutical industry .
Once again , Dr David Graham turns out to be the sharpest guy in the room while having the courage to tell the truth even when surrounded by an agency full of morons and criminals .
The drug industry must hate this guy .
But they can't get rid of him because he's one of the very few scientists in the FDA who is actually committed to .
Gee , what a concept , huh ?
The FDA as a whole abandoned that idea so long ago that virtually nobody there even remembers what it means .
Protect the public ?
What do you mean ?
As in , by banning dangerous drugs that just happen to be making big money ?
That 's unthinkable at the FDA as we know it today .
The agency exists , not to limit their sales just because a hundred thousand people happen to drop dead each year from taking FDA - approved drugs .
When it comes to safety vs. profits , the FDA chooses profits for Big Pharma time and time again .
Do the math on this :
If Avandia is linked to 83,000 heart attacks , and if roughly 50 % of those are fatal ( that 's just an estimate ) , then Avandia could conceivably be the cause of .
The terrorist attacks of 9/11 killed roughly 3,000 Americans , and yet just one drug that has been mysteriously kept on the market by the FDA appears to have killedSo what does that make the FDA ?
More dangerous than the terrorists , of course !
So why is the FDA still allowed to operate in America if it 's such a dangerous organization that 's killing so many American citizens ?
There 's one thing that 's true about both WAR and MEDICINE :
As long as the right corporations are making money , it really does n't matter how many people die in the process .
And for all those diabetic Americans struggling to find improved health right now , there 's something you desperately need to know :
There 's a price to putting your faith in the FDA , the drug companies and your pill - pushing doctor .
That price may very well be your own life .
Diabetes has a cure , you know .
You can reverse it in as little as four days by changing your diet .

Here 's the full report from the U.S. Senate ( PDF ) : CNNNY TimesPharmaTimes
As I 've been digging deeper into the data I 've gathered on 210 million public Facebook profiles , I 've been fascinated by some of the patterns that have emerged .
My latest visualization shows the information by location , with connections drawn between places that share friends .
For example , a lot of people in LA have friends in San Francisco , so there 's a line between them .
Looking at the network of US cities , it 's been remarkable to see how groups of them form clusters , with strong connections locally but few contacts outside the cluster .
For example Columbus , OH and Charleston WV are nearby as the crow flies , but share few connections , with Columbus clearly part of the North , and Charleston tied to the South :
Some of these clusters are intuitive , like the old south , but there 's some surprises too , like Missouri , Louisiana and Arkansas having closer ties to Texas than Georgia .
To make sense of the patterns I 'm seeing , I 've marked and labeled the clusters , and added some notes about the properties they have in common .
Stayathomia
Stretching from New York to Minnesota , this belt 's defining feature is how near most people are to their friends , implying they do n't move far .
In most cases outside the largest cities , the most common connections are with immediately neighboring cities , and even New York only has one really long - range link in its top 10 .
Apart from Los Angeles , all of its strong ties are comparatively local .
In contrast to further south , God tends to be low down the top 10 fan pages if she shows up at all , with a lot more sports and beer - related pages instead .
Dixie
Probably the least surprising of the groupings , the Old South is known for its strong and shared culture , and the pattern of ties I see backs that up .
Like Stayathomia , Dixie towns tend to have links mostly to other nearby cities rather than spanning the country .
Atlanta is definitely the hub of the network , showing up in the top 5 list of almost every town in the region .
Southern Florida is an exception to the cluster , with a lot of connections to the East Coast , presumably sun-seeking refugees .
God is almost always in the top spot on the fan pages , and for some reason Ashley shows up as a popular name here , but almost nowhere else in the country .
Greater Texas
Orbiting around Dallas , the ties of the Gulf Coast towns and Oklahoma and Arkansas make them look more Texan than Southern .
Unlike Stayathomia , there 's a definite central city to this cluster , otherwise most towns just connect to their immediate neighbors .
God shows up , but always comes in below the Dallas Cowboys for Texas proper , and other local sports teams outside the state .
I 've noticed a few interesting name hotspots , like Alexandria , LA boasting Ahmed and Mohamed as # 2 and # 3 on their top 10 names , and Laredo with Juan , Jose , Carlos and Luis as its four most popular .
Mormonia
The only region that 's completely surrounded by another cluster , Mormonia mostly consists of Utah towns that are highly connected to each other , with an offshoot in Eastern Idaho .
It 's worth separating from the rest of the West because of how interwoven the communities are , and how relatively unlikely they are to have friends outside the region .
It wo n't be any surprise to see that LDS - related pages like Thomas S. Monson , Gordon B. Hinckley and The Book of Mormon are at the top of the charts .
I did n't expect to see Twilight showing up quite so much though , I have no idea what to make of that !
Glenn Beck makes it into the top spot for Eastern Idaho .
Nomadic West
The defining feature of this area is how likely even small towns are to be strongly connected to distant cities , it looks like the inhabitants have done a lot of moving around the county .
For example , Boise , ID , Bend , OR and Phoenix , AZ all have much wider connections than you 'd expect for towns their size :
Starbucks is almost always the top fan page , maybe to help people stay awake on all those long car trips they must be making ?
Socalistan
Sorry Bay Area folks , but LA is definitely the center of gravity for this cluster .
Almost everywhere in California and Nevada has links to both LA and SF , but LA is usually first .
Part of that may be due to the way the cities are split up , but in tribute to the 8 years I spent there , I christened it Socalistan .
Californians outside the super - cities tend to be most connected to other Californians , making almost as tight a cluster as Greater Texas .
Keeping up with the stereotypes , God hardly makes an appearance on the fan pages , but sports are n't that popular either .
Michael Jackson is a particular favorite , and San Francisco puts Barack Obama in the top spot .
Pacifica
The most boring of the clusters , the area around Seattle is disappointingly average .
Tightly connected to each other , it does n't look like Washingtonians are big travelers compared to the rest of the West , even though a lot of them claim to need a vacation !
So that 's my tour through the patterns that leapt out at me from the Facebook data .
This is all qualitative , not quantitive , so I 'm looking forward to gathering some numbers to back them up .
I 'd love to work out the average distance of friends for each city , and then use that as a measure of insularity for instance .
If you 're a researcher interested in this data set too , do get in touch , I 'll be happy to share .
Update - I was n't able to make the data - set available after all , but if you liked this map , you can now build your own with my new OpenHeatMap project !
Lithium is found in trace amounts in many places , but it is being produced commercially mainly by two methods .
One is through mining and processing , a relatively expensive method that produces the metal mostly for glass , ceramics and the manufacturing of television tubes .
The more economical and significant method is through evaporation of lithium - containing brines , mostly in salt flats in the highland areas in South America and western China .
Lithium reservoirs have been formed over millions of years in highland bowls , after rivers and hot springs washed over lithium - laden rocks and leached the mineral from them .
Producers drill wells into the salt flats and pump the brine into evaporation ponds .
With the removal of water , the lithium content in the brine increases to a level where it can be collected and shipped to a chemical plant for processing .
The industry leader in this method of production is Sociedad Química y Minera , a Chilean fertilizer company in which the Potash Corporation , a Canadian fertilizer giant , holds a major stake .
The other important producers in Latin America include FMC Corporation and Chemetall , a subsidiary of Rockwood Holdings , which also operates a small brine reserve in Nevada .

Recycling of lithium from used batteries could become an important source , in which case “ the demand for virgin material would be reduced , ” said R. Keith Evans , a geologist who serves as a consultant to lithium producers .
Up to 50 percent of the lithium in used batteries may be recycled in the future .
But Mr. Evans added , “ The big question is the timing of demand .
Are you going to build a plant before a market has developed ? ”
By the standards of traditional gold and copper booms , the increase in interest in lithium is still muted among big mining companies .
Supplies of lithium are plentiful for now , and the price of lithium chemicals actually declined at the end of last year because of the economic slowdown .
The price for lithium carbonate , the basic lithium compound used in batteries , had been around $ 5,000 a ton for the last five years or so , and has leveled at about $ 4,000 since October .
A college education may not be worth as much as you think .
For years , higher education was touted as a safe path to professional and financial success .
Easy money , in the form of student loans , flowed to help parents and students finance degrees , with the implication that in the long run , a bachelor 's degree was a good bet .
Graduates , it has long been argued , would be able to build solid careers that would earn them far more than their high - school educated counterparts .

Note : this post really concerns statically typed languages , but my little bits of example code are in Ruby since that ’s the MVC implementation I know best .
I like MVC - ish - ness for web applications
The MVC - ish aspect of Rails is much clearer than the ASP / PHP - ish world ’s chaos , so I ’m bought into MVC - ish as a better way .
Separating the request processing into MVC generally gets me into the right mindset when I ’m looking at individual bits of code .
That said , Rails ’ MVC still falls to satisfy fully my cravings for a web framework .
I do n’t like the lack of type - safety
As Curt and I were discussing over in my last post , I am bothered by the lack of type - safety in MVC web frameworks .
In most MVC frameworks , type - safety is ignored or broken , e.g. :
Rails is basically not typed and Views can access the Controller ’s instance variables ;
ASP.NET uses an object called ViewState to pass data from Controllers to Views , but you have to cast ViewState to the right type in the View [ yes , I ’m treating ASP.
NET as MVC … ] ;
Turbinado copied ASP.NET ’s ViewState and inherits its issues .
I ’d like to figure out a way to maintain type - safety within my web application .
In the case of dynamic languages ( e.g. Ruby ) , I ’d like “ type- clarity ” so that I ’m _nearly_ guaranteed of having the right type in the right place .
For example [ using Ruby syntax ] :
The header of a web app might have a account section which behaves differently whether or not a User has been loaded into @user in the Controller .
It ’s easy enough to have the section behave differently based on whether @user.nil ? , but I ca n’t guarantee that , if the @user is not nil , @user is of type User .
* I* can certainly check the class of @user , but that leaves me open to errors at runtime when I _do_ change the type of @user and forget to update all of my type checks .
I want to be able to set the @user variable to a User in the Controller and have that type information enforced at compile time in the View .
Given an MVC - ish system , there seems to be two ways to do this :
Use different data types for each view and piece of a view .
This would be a nightmare since you ’d have to define hundreds of separate types , build them differently and then send the right type to the right view .
Only ever create the values in question right near their usage , but this pushes Model fiddling and request params access down into the View , so does n’t fit the web MVC style …
A Slight Modification to Rails ’ MVC-ish - ness
Even if it is n’t the Rails MVC Way , it seems as though a reasonable way to maintain type safety would be to :
Do n’t use Controller to set up variables for use in Views .
Mix more of the Controller functionality into the Models so that Models can manage creation of themselves .
Have Views use Models directly ( and have Models cache / memo- ize themselves as necessary ) .
Use Controllers * only * for validation and routing .
Have Views play directly with the Models they require .
Currently , Rails ’ MVC works something like the following :
--- some_controller.rb class SomeController < ApplicationController def index @user = User.find ( params [ :user_id ] ) end end --- some_view.html.erb <= HEY !
Is @user ** really * * a User ?
Log in ! ---
--- some_controller.rb class SomeController < ApplicationController def index end end --- some_view.html.erb <= HEY !
That 's almost guaranteed to work .
Log in !
--- user_model.rb Class User < ActiveRecord :: Base def self .
from_request find ( params [ : user_id ] ) <= the models is accessing the Environment ... end end
This is wrong , right ?
Instead , how about giving the Model access to the params and letting it use its business rules to set itself up :
Per Terrence Parr in Enforcing Strict Model - View Separation in Template Engines [ PDF ] :
[ … ] there is widespread agreement that keeping the view as simple and free from entanglements with model and controller as possible is a worthwhile ideal to strive for .
[ …]
Strictly separating model and view is an extremely desirable goal because it increases flexibility , reduces maintenance costs , and allows coders and designers to work in parallel .
But I think Parr ’s point is really that business logic should n’t appear in Views not that UserModel access should n’t be done in a View .
Or is there some horrible breakdown that would occur if Models had access to request parameters and Controllers did n’t set up Models ?
An issue that does arise with this modification is increased testing complexity when the Environment is accessible to Models .
Whereas now Models take a few parameters and then pass or do n’t pass the test , allowing Models to access the Environment would mean that tests would have to set up request parameters , cookies , etc .
Simple , little , lovely Unit tests suddenly get larger and potentially uglier …
Type-safety + MVC
~= peanut butter & chocolate
Is type - safety a worthy goal to try to attain in MVC - ish web frameworks ?
If so , how is the best way of doing so ?
In Rails , judicious application of filters and good naming schemes can get you “ type- confident ” , but you ’re never type - safe .
Perhaps Rails has just the right blend for an MVC - ish web framework …
If MVC - ish web frameworks are n’t the way to go , what organization is better ?
Templating systems that only allow template markup / commands seem pretty safe , but I ’d seriously miss the simplicity of mixed markup / code .
ASP.NET compiles the template and then the “ code behind ” gets well - typed access to the XML , but I really prefer MVC to that organization .

Flannery O’Connor
RAFAEL PI ROMAN , correspondent :
Even at the end of her short life , when it became harder and harder for her to walk , Flannery O’Connor went to Mass nearly every day at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Milledgeville , in central Georgia .
She lived with her mother in an old plantation house surrounded by 1500 acres of pasture and woods .
In her room after church she would write all morning , facing the back of a tall chest so that she would see no distractions .
Her output was not massive — two short novels , two collections of short stories , a number of essays , and a lot of letters .
But today many consider her one of America ’s greatest writers .
Since O’Connor ’s death , more than 50 books have been written about her , one of them by Ralph Wood of Baylor University .
PROFESSOR RALPH WOOD ( Author of Flannery O’Connor and the Christ - Haunted South ) : Flannery O’Connor is the only great Christian writer this nation has produced .
That is an astonishing fact .
Emerson , Thoreau , Hawthorne , Melville , Twain , Emily Dickinson , Frost , Stevens : not one of them Christian , at least not orthodoxly Christian .
She is a Southerner and a Catholic , she ’s not at the center of American culture , and yet she is our only great Christian writer .
Prof. Ralph Wood
ROMAN : What makes her increasing popularity even more surprising in these secular times is the fact that O’Connor was a self - proclaimed orthodox Catholic whose subject , in her words , was “ the action of grace in territory held largely by the devil . ”
O’Connor was the only child in a respected and well - off family .
She was fascinated by birds of all kinds , and when she was a little girl a newsreel cameraman came down to film a chicken Flannery claimed could walk backwards .
Later on , her hobby centered on peacocks , a bird she saw as her personal symbol , according to her biographer , Brad Gooch .
BRAD GOOCH ( Author of Flannery : A Life of Flannery O’Connor ) : I think she liked it because it was a comic and gawky bird , like herself .
It ate her mother ’s flowers and kept everyone awake all night , and then at a certain transfigurative moment tails would open , and here was all this beauty which she saw as a symbol of the way her fiction worked , and also in the Middle Ages the peacock was the symbol of Christ and the church so , you know , it all lined up for her and the peacocks .
ROMAN : As a young woman , O’Connor went to the Iowa Writers Workshop , to the exclusive Yaddo artist ’s colony in Saratoga Springs , and then to New York City and Connecticut , writing all the way .
Then , at the age of 25 , she was forced to return home because , like her father before her , she was dying of lupus .
It was back in Georgia in the 1950s that she discovered the characters for her stories .
WOOD : Not the cotton belt , not the tobacco belt , but the ugly word the Bible belt , and for O’Connor that was the glory of her region .
These were the emarginated people on the sidelines of southern life in small , out of the way places .
ROMAN : She wrote that her Christ - haunted characters are so cut off from orthodox Catholicism that they do n’t have a guide and that they are actually involved in a do - it - yourself religion that is kind of comical , sadly comical .
WOOD : She said , look , these are my brothers and sisters .
They are as unlike me as they can be when it comes to the church and its sacraments , but they are a whole of a kind of sweated gospel , a gospel that takes God and God ’s world with the utmost seriousness , and therefore I ’ve got to attend to them .
I cannot dismiss them , saying these are people after my own heart , and I want to write about them sympathetically .
ROMAN : Father Thomas Joseph White is a Dominican priest whose conversion to Catholicism was influenced by O’Connor ’s fiction .
FATHER THOMAS JOSEPH WHITE , OP ( Theology Instructor , Dominican House of Studies ) :
You do n’t have baptism , confession , and the Mass , which she says are , you know , the center of her life .
You have instead odd and grotesque , historically surprising events where people encounter the grace of God .
Father Thomas Joseph White
ROMAN : From these people her stories emerged .
In “ Wise Blood ” and “ The Violent Bear It Away , ” and in twenty short stories , she told dark tales of murder and bigotry and madness , of a preacher of the Church without Christ who puts out his own eyes .
Some have asked , is this Christian ?
WOOD : She says most sins are committed by acts of immoderation , of excess , but she says there is one and only one quality that can never be sufficiently immoderate , and that is the love of God , and she saw in these backwoods , southern , I call them folk Christians more than fundamentalists , that kind of completely radical love of God in their own way .
ROMAN : Talk about the importance of grace and mystery in her work .
WOOD : Mystery does not mean for her a kind of a fuzzy , foggy , gooey something or other .
It ’s a very specific term for her .
For her the word mystery means that which is inexhaustible in our knowledge of God , that the deeper we go in understanding who the self - declared , self - revealed God is , the more there is yet to understand , so that the greater our knowledge of God also the greater our ignorance of God , so that we know only a thumbnail of what and who God is .
ROMAN : As the civil rights movement changed attitudes and language , O’Connor was sharply criticized for using the N word in her writing .
Brad Gooch , author of Flannery : A Life of Flannery O’Connor
GOOCH : She could n’t change that word because that ’s the way those people speak .
WOOD : For Flannery O’Connor , race was indeed the curse of the south in the sense that it was the single - most important test which we as white Christians failed .
For O’Connor , the mistreatment of black people is a violation of their being creatures made in the image of God .
ROMAN : In recent years , O’Connor has become a favorite not only of writers and scholars but of artists and entertainers of all stripes , including Bruce Springsteen , Bono , the Coen brothers , and even Conan O’Brien and the creators of the hit TV series “ Lost . ”
Professor Bruce Gentry teaches at O’Conner ’s alma mater , Georgia College and State University , and edits the Flannery O’Connor Review .
PROFESSOR BRUCE GENTRY ( Editor , Flannery O’Connor Review ) :
She always talks about waking people up to the mystery of the world , and I think that puts her in a position that is similar to a lot of people in popular culture .
You know , they want to create something substantial , but they also want to do it for a popular audience .
ROMAN : In the process of writing his biography of Flannery O’Connor , Brad Gooch says he came to admire her discipline and determination , particularly during the final months of her life .
GOOCH : She was staying alive through writing , and you see it at the end of her life , where it becomes a real race with death .
She ’s working on stories which she keeps under her pillow in the hospital so the doctor wo n’t take them away from her .
She ’s editing one story after she ’s had last rites .
So all of this seems to me a very clear kind of sense that this is what ’s keeping her alive , or why she ’s alive .
ROMAN : O’Connor ’s admirers wonder what her legacy will be in years to come .
Some say that will depend on whether future readers will understand a writer who saw “ the action of grace in territory held by the devil . ”

Since 1985 the University of Louisville has administered the annual Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition , a prize that carries a large purse  the last one was $ 200,000  and ample prestige .
To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the award , the university fielded a large , flexible faculty ensemble , the Grawemeyer Players , and on Tuesday evening at Weill Recital Hall the group made its New York debut with a program of works by prizewinners ( though not the winning works , which are mostly orchestral scores ) .
Except for a short cello work by Witold Lutoslawski , the first Grawemeyer recipient , the program focused on recent winners , starting with Gyorgy Kurtag ( who won in 2006 ) and including Sebastian Currier ( 2007 ) , Peter Lieberson ( 2008 ) , Brett Dean ( 2009 ) and this year ’s winner , York Höller .
A listener handicapping the award jury ’s tastes , based on this sampling , might conclude that composers who write in an accessible , traditional style  not aggressively dissonant but not facile either  have a distinct edge .
But that would be incorrect : the award has also gone to composers like Pierre Boulez and Harrison Birtwistle , at the thorny end of the spectrum , and John Adams and Tan Dun , representing post -Minimalism and world - music hybrids .

Mr. Kurtag ’s music typically veers toward corrosive modernism , but the acidic side of his harmonic language was tempered in “ The Little Predicament ” ( 1978 ) .
Scored quirkily for piccolo , trombone and guitar , this comic piece parodies Mussorgsky and Stravinsky before moving on to a flighty , pointillistic scherzo and a calm , sober finale that seemed almost out of place after the antics of the first three movements .

Physicists may have glimpsed a particle that is a leading candidate for mysterious dark matter but say conclusive evidence remains elusive .
A 9 - year search from a unique observatory in an old iron mine 2,000 feet underground has yielded two possible detections of weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs .
But physicists , who include two University of Florida researchers , say there is about a one in four chance that the detections were merely background noise -- meaning that a worldwide hunt involving at least two dozen different observatories and hundreds of scientists will continue .
" With one or two events , it 's tough .
The numbers are too small , " said Tarek Saab , a UF assistant professor and one of dozens of physicists participating in the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search II , or CDMS II , experiment based in the Soudan mine in Northern Minnesota .
A paper about the results is set to appear February 11 in Science Express , the journal Science 's Web site for selected papers that appear in advance of the print publication .
Scientists recognized decades ago that the rotational speed of galaxies and the behavior of galaxy clusters could not be explained by the traditional forces of gravity due to the mass of visible stars alone .
Something else -- something invisible , undetectable yet extremely powerful -- had to exert the force required to cause the galaxies ' more - rapid - than - expected rotational speed and similar anomalous observations .
What came to be known as " dark matter " -- dark because it neither reflects nor absorbs light in any form , visible or other -- is now estimated to comprise as much as 23 percent of the universe .
But despite abundant evidence for its influence , no one has ever observed dark matter directly .

There are several possibilities for the composition of this mysterious , omnipresent matter .
Particle physics theory points toward WIMPs as one of the most likely candidates .
WIMPs are " weakly interacting " because , although their masses are thought to be comparable to the masses of standard atomic nuclei , they have little or no effect on ordinary matter .
Among other things , that makes them extremely difficult to detect .
However , scientists believe WIMPs should occasionally " kick " or bounce off standard atomic nuclei , leaving behind a small amount of energy that should be possible to detect .
The CDMS II observatory is located a half - mile underground beneath rock that blocks most particles , such as those accompanying cosmic rays .
At the observatory 's heart are 30 hockey - puck - sized germanium and silicon detectors cryogenically frozen to negative 459.58 Fahrenheit , just shy of absolute zero .
In theory , WIMPs would be among the few particles that make it all the way through the earth and rock .
They would then occasionally kick the atoms on these detectors , generating a tiny amount of heat , a signal that would be observed and recorded on the experiment 's computers .
advertisement
Durdana Balakishiyeva , a postdoctoral associate in physics at UF , and Saab have participated in the analysis of data produced by the experiment as well as simulations of the detectors ' response .
Beginning in 2007 they have helped to test many of the detectors at the UF campus in Gainesville which are being used in the successor SuperCDMS experiment .
The UF tests involved cooling and operating the detectors just as they are operated in Minnesota to verify that they were up to par .
The 15 institutions participating in CDMS II gathered data from 2003 to 2009 .
Observers recorded the two possible WIMP events in 2007 , one on Aug. 8 and the second on Oct. 27 .
Scientists had estimated that five detections would be sufficient to confirm WIMPs -- meaning that the two fell short , according to the CDMS .
But while the two detections may not be conclusive , they do help to set more stringent values on the WIMPs ' interaction with subatomic particles .
" Up until now , not only us , but everybody was operating without statistics -- we were blind in that sense , " Balakishiyeva said .
" But now we can speak of statistics in some way . "
At the very least , the finding helps to eliminate some theories about dark matter -- raising the profile of the WIMP and potentially accelerating the race to detect it .
" Many people believe we are extremely close -- not just us , but other experiments , " Saab said .
" It is expected or certainly hoped that in the next five years or so , someone will see a clear signal . "
The company that locked out a large group of its unionized workers Wednesday at the Vancouver airport said it had no choice but to deny those employees access to their jobs .
HMS
Host refused to let a group of 300 employees back to work after they staged a one - day job action outside the facility yesterday .
Members of Unite Here Local 40 voted 90 per cent in favour of strike action Feb. 12 , saying weeks of negotiations to increase wages and job security with their employer fell apart .
They say 60 Milestones employees , who will be out of work when the franchise closes after the Olympic Games , were promised jobs at a new White Spot restaurant opening at the airport – but HMS Host has reneged on the offer and everyone is set to be laid off after the Paralympic Games .
Some employees have worked at the restaurant for a decade .
In a statement issued to media Wednesday afternoon , HMS Host said it is prepared to allow employees to return to their jobs if the union agrees to postponing job action until the end of the Games .
In the absence of that commitment , the company says the lockout will remain in effect .
" We must attempt to minimize this impact to customer service .
Intermittent job action is very disruptive to our customers , " the statement said .
Lynn Flandera of Unite
Here told ctvbc.ca most of the group are new immigrants who work for low wages .
" Many have to work two jobs to support their families so this hardship is pretty devastating , " she said .
" We very much want to get back to work as soon as possible and avoid further disruption but we 're not willing to give up our legal right to job action to do that . "
Host previously issued a lock - out threat to the union on January 4 .
Jim Sinclair , President of the BC Federation of Labour , joined workers on the picket line yesterday .
He says HMS Host appeared more interested in provoking a lockout than finding a resolution with employees .
" When the Olympics are over , people still have to make a living .
These workers face mass firings because their employer wants to bring in non-union workers to do their jobs .
They have to resolve this now -- after the Olympics will be too late . "
Vancouver City Councillor Geoff Meggs also joined employees on the picket line .
He told ctvbc.ca it 's unacceptable that the workers can't secure a long - term job commitment .
" You can't treat workers like some kind of paper towel you wipe your hands with and then throw away , " he said , adding most of the striking group is made up of women and new immigrants .
" To have a successful economy in a city that is so dependent on tourism and entertainment , you need a strong and appropriately compensated work force . "
The lockout affects 16 restaurants and coffee shops at the airport , including Harvey 's , Milestones and several Tim Hortons outlets .
The locations accounts for less than half of HMS Host outlets at the airport .
Another 140 non-unionized hospitality facilities , many run by HMS Host , remain open .

How could you resist ?
And yet many do resist such highly automated and powerful productivity tools and continue to favor Emacs or other text editors and command lines for their development .
Ruby , the fastest growing language ecosystem , has evolved primarily without IDE tool support .
What explains this love / hate relationship with the IDE among developers and the companies that make them ?
Will we ever all get on the same page ?
There 's general agreement on the productivity benefits of the modern IDE : more structured code editing and navigation , import and dependency management , and real time syntax checking .
Code quality improves with semantic analysis , which can detect uninitialized and unused variable errors .
Code readability improves with richer syntax highlighting that helps differentiate between static , instance , and local variables .
Big software wants your inputs
But lighter - weight tools offer a more rapid edit / test cycle with less waiting time .
The command line remains one of the most powerful and fastest ways to interact with your system .
Emacs , Vim , and other editors have basic syntax highlighting and code navigation for an even broader set of formats despite the fact that they lag behind IDEs in features .
Though IDEs offer impressive plug - in capabilities , traditional script and config files seem easier to learn and use and ultimately more flexible .
Command line workflows offer a more flexible , less integrated and less guided approach to development .
You learn how to use them one tool at a time .
Development and adoption of new tools is usually easier as you are not tightly coupling tools into one complex user interface .
Admins , analysts , and designers use command line tools , making it easier for them to work with developers when the IDE is not front and center .
The IDEs themselves have warts .
Writing an IDE plug - in is a rather involved process specific to each IDE .
Configuration is stored in opaque proprietary formats managed by labyrinthine UIs .
IDEs also fail as crossover tools for administrators , analysts and designers .
It 's no surprise that Microsoft , IBM , Oracle and other members of " big software " promote IDEs strongly .
If you write code in their midst , more than likely you 've been using one as your primary tool for a long time .
You might even be required to use a particular tool on a particular project .
From a marketing perspective , the IDE helps with lock - in , product bundling , and perception that each vendor is a one - stop shop for development productivity .
But developers tend to resist lock - in , are wary of bundling , and shun brittle or overly - complex corporate standards .
Just look at the Ruby ecosystem as an example of the backlash against all things Java or C# .
The White House is launching a political counterattack to fend off escalating congressional criticism of its proposals to outsource U.S. manned space missions to private industry .
Facing bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill and lacking prominent champions of such unprecedented space ventures among most large aerospace contractors , the administration hopes to regain momentum on the issue with a personal appeal from President Barack Obama .
The White House said the president would outline his plans for space exploration at a conference in Florida on April 15 .
The event will give him a forum to defend his proposed cancellation of existing National Aeronautics and Space Administration projects intended to take astronauts back to the moon and deeper into the solar system .
The bid to outsource many of NASA 's current manned exploration programs has sparked opposition partly because of the job losses critics say it would entail .
State and local officials in Florida , an important swing state for the 2010 and 2012 federal elections , have projected more than 9,000 job losses statewide from the proposed program cancellations , combined with the planned retirement of the space - shuttle fleet by early 2011 .

Dear Mr. Pulsinelli ,
I am an artist residing in New York City whose goal is to create conceptual artworks ; works that disregard stereotypical art mediums so as to focus attention on the idea rather than materiality .
My request is directed to you because I believe you are the most appropriate of contacts listed on the Prospect Park Zoo Contact website to field my inquiry .
I noticed that of all New York City - based zoos Prospect Park is the only one to have a kangaroo , specifically the Western Gray Kangaroo .
In short : I propose that any current unnamed baby or adult kangaroos or one future kangaroo , born in or brought to the Prospect Park Zoo , be officially named “ Joey Syta ” , which is my name .
I am unfamiliar with the naming process of animals that make their way into zoos but figured that my name is especially appropriate on a literal level and also a metaphorical , arguably spiritual level , based on the following reasoning :
When naming someone ( human , animal ) or something ( object , artwork ) automatic subjective associations are created by the interpreter and projected onto that named thing .
By naming a kangaroo “ Joey Syta ” , and in doing so realizing an artwork , the kangaroo would become me and in a way I would become a kangaroo and the zoo would subsequently transform into an art venue .
This transference of the self could be interpreted as a premature reincarnation of sorts while also satisfying my goal as an artist to translate everyday or commonplace activities and environments into art - making and viewing environs .
As far as I envision my project should not actually interrupt or affect the life of the chosen kangaroo in any negative way .
This project would only hopefully bring positive attention to the Prospect Park Zoo and possibly establish it and the Wildlife Conservation Society as organizations that attract and support the greater artistic community .
If my project was to be realized I would only ask that some sort of certificate of authenticity be provided by the zoo establishing that the name of the chosen kangaroo is in fact “ Joey Syta ” and that at some point after this official naming I am granted permission to take photographs and / or video of Joey Syta ( the kangaroo ) .
Please understand that this proposal is completely serious although I am conscious of the elements of absurdity and humor that possibly arise in interpreting such a proposal .
I greatly look forward to your response .
If you believe that someone else working within the Prospect Park Zoo or Wildlife Conservation Society is better suited to respond to this proposal I would greatly appreciate if you forwarded our correspondence to any and all appropriate parties .
Here is a link to my website that documents some of my completed works :

Thank you and hope to hear back from you soon .

For those who feared that Barack Obama did not have any Lyndon Johnson in him , the president 's determination to press ahead and get health - care reform done in the face of Republican intransigence came as something of a relief .
Obama 's critics have regularly accused him of not being as tough or wily or forceful as LBJ was in pushing through civil rights and the social programs of his Great Society .
Obama seemed willing to let Congress go its own way and was so anxious to look bipartisan that he would n't even take his own side in arguments with Republicans .
Those days are over .
On Wednesday , the president made clear what he wants in a health - care bill , and he urged Congress to pass it by the most expeditious means available .
He was also clear on what bipartisanship should mean -- and what it can't mean .
Democrats , who happen to be in the majority , have already added Republican ideas to their proposals .
Obama said he was open to four more that came up during the health - care summit .
What he 's ( rightly ) unwilling to do is give the minority veto power over a bill that has deliberately and painfully worked its way through the regular legislative process .
Republicans , however , do n't want to talk much about the substance of health care .
They want to discuss process , turn " reconciliation " into a four - letter word and maintain that Democrats are " ramming through " a health bill .
It is all , I am sorry to say , one big lie -- or , if you 're sensitive , an astonishing exercise in hypocrisy .
In an op - ed in Tuesday 's Post , Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) offered an excellent example of this hypocrisy .
Right off , the piece was wrong on a core fact .
Hatch accused the Democrats of trying to , yes , " ram through the Senate a multitrillion - dollar health - care bill . "
No .
The health - care bill passed the Senate in December with 60 votes under the normal process .
The only thing that would pass under a simple majority vote would be a series of amendments that fit comfortably under the " reconciliation " rules established to deal with money issues .
Near the end of his column , Hatch conceded that reconciliation would be used for " only parts " of the bill .
But why did n't he say that in the first place ?
Hatch grandly cited " America 's Founders " as wanting the Senate to be about " deliberation . "
But the Founders said nothing in the Constitution about the filibuster , let alone " reconciliation . "
Judging from what they put in the actual document , the Founders would be appalled at the idea that every major bill should need the votes of three - fifths of the Senate to pass .
Hatch quoted Sens. Robert Byrd and Kent Conrad , both Democrats , as opposing the use of reconciliation on health care .
What he did n't say is that Byrd 's comment from a year ago was about passing the entire bill under reconciliation , which no one is proposing .
As for Conrad , he made clear to The Post 's Ezra Klein this week that it 's perfectly appropriate to use reconciliation " to improve or perfect the package , " which is the only thing that Democrats have proposed doing through reconciliation .
Hatch said that reconciliation should not be used for " substantive legislation " unless the legislation has " significant bipartisan support . "
But surely the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts , which were passed under reconciliation and increased the deficit by $ 1.7 trillion during his presidency , were " substantive legislation . "
The 2003 dividends tax cut could muster only 50 votes .
Vice President Dick Cheney had to break the tie .
Talk about " ramming through . "
The underlying " principle " here seems to be that it 's fine to pass tax cuts for the wealthy on narrow votes but an outrage to use reconciliation to help middle - income and poor people get health insurance .
I 'm disappointed in Hatch , co-sponsor of two of my favorite bills in recent years .
One created the State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
The other , signed last year by Obama , broadly expanded service opportunities .
Hatch worked on both with his dear friend , the late Edward M. Kennedy , after whom the service bill was named .
It was Kennedy , you 'll recall , who insisted that health care was " a fundamental right and not a privilege . "
That 's why it 's not just legitimate to use reconciliation to complete the work on health reform .
It would be immoral to do otherwise and thereby let a phony argument about process get in the way of health coverage for 30 million Americans .

How long do you expect the books on your shelves to last ?
The oldest book I own is a Victorian - era edition of The Collected Poetical Works of Samuel T. Coleridge , purchased from a street vendor for $ 15 some years ago .
It ’s an absolute beauty : a heavy little volume , solidly constructed , cloth - bound in bright blue with hand - painted vines and gold lettering on the front .
The paper is thick and smooth , and — this is what I find most remarkable about it — hardly discolored by time .
Well over a hundred years after publication , the paper is a bright and even cream .
I fully expect that this book will outlast me .
I can see no reason why it should n’t persist for another century or far longer .
I do n’t , of course , expect this kind of longevity of all my books .
I recently pulled my copy of Michael Ondaatje ’s The English Patient down from the shelf for the first time in some years , and was surprised to discover that the pages had gone yellow .
I ’m used to thinking of yellowed pages as a sort of pre-existing condition among books of my acquaintance , something I ’d expect to find in the 1965 editions of books picked up in second - hand stores .
But for all that , the yellowing and increasing brittleness were n’t entirely unreasonable : my copy of The English Patient is a trade paperback , and while trade paperbacks occupy something of a gray area in terms of paper quality — typically nicer than a mass market paperback , but in most cases not as nice as a hardcover — one does n’t really expect them to last forever .
Hardcover books are a different matter .
I ’ve been buying a fair number of first edition hardcovers recently , one every two or three months .
I happen to know a few people who are in the habit of publishing novels and I feel very strongly about supporting writers , so I often find myself buying first editions at readings and book launches .
This is an expensive habit , and I tell myself that if I did n’t know the authors in question I ’d just wait for the paperback , but I ca n’t say that the expenditure bothers me — hardcovers are beautiful , and they look so solid on my shelves .
They look like they should last forever .
But a few months ago I purchased a book that rattled this assumption .
An acquaintance published his debut novel with one of the major New York houses , and I acquired it at a book launch party .
When I picked it up in the store , I was startled by how light it was : a hardcover with the weight of a paperback .
Later , flipping through the book at home , I discovered why this was .
The paper was so thin that I could read the words “ Chapter One ” through the title page .
For all intents and purposes , the book was printed on tracing paper .
I had essentially purchased a disposable first edition hardcover , and it made me a little angry .
Aside from the obvious — I ’d just spent $ 26.95 for a book that will turn yellow and become brittle in a matter of years — I found that I was angry on the writer ’s behalf .
He ’d spent years of his life on his novel , a book lauded as an astounding debut , but his publisher did n’t value him highly enough to print his book on paper that might reasonably be expected to outlast him .
In another decade or so , perhaps sooner , the pages of his book will be as yellowed as the paperback of The English Patient that my aunt gave me for Christmas when I was fourteen .

I spoke recently with Melissa Klug on the subject of paper quality .
Melissa is a director of marketing at Glatfelter , a paper manufacturer with locations on three continents , and she ’s involved with their Permanence Matters initiative .
I met her online a year and a half ago or so , when I ventured nervously onto Twitter to promote my first book , and we ’ve run into one another in person a few times since .
She ’s one of my favorite people online , an avid reader , and she ’s the person I vent to in private when I buy an expensive book that turns out to have been printed on tracing paper .
The Millions : How did you wind up in the paper business ?
Did you always have an interest in the field ?
Melissa Klug : I grew up in a small town called Chillicothe , Ohio , where the major industry of the town was , and still is today , a large paper mill .
At the time I was growing up it was a part of a company called Mead ( which most people know from school supplies like my childhood favorite , the Trapper Keeper . )
It is such an integral part of the community that people called it “ The Mead . ”
For readers of The Millions , it might be most interesting to know that the paper mill is about 5 miles away from the setting of Knockemstiff , and the author of that book , Donald Ray Pollock , was a papermaker at the mill for several decades before becoming published .
At the end of college I had interviewed at a lot of places , and was deciding on the path my life might take .
I had offers that would take me in different directions , but the one that felt the most right was to become an employee at the paper mill .
I sold paper in New England for two years , and after that went back to Ohio to the mill and have been in several different positions since then , mostly in the sales and marketing field .
In 2006 , the paper mill in Chillicothe was purchased by Glatfelter , who has been making paper for books since the 1800’s .
As a result of that , we began making book paper in Ohio , and I was fortunate to become the Director of Marketing for several lines , including the one closest to my personal love — books .
TM : I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about the Permanence Matters initiative .
MK : Eight years ago we started to notice the shift in buying patterns from free - sheet Permanent Paper to groundwood paper for hardcover books .
Groundwood is the type of paper used in newspapers and mass market paperbacks , and its production is such that it is much lower - quality and degrades more quickly than traditional book publishing paper — this is called free - sheet , or what we at Glatfelter term Permanent Paper .
Groundwood is certainly an acceptable paper for some categories of publishing — few people would expect a $ 6 mass - market paperback to look pristine for years .
However , what we began to notice around eight years ago was a shift to the use of groundwood for first edition hardcover books .
This has accelerated with the decline in newspaper print sales — the paper mills which used to manufacture newsprint for papers now have a tremendous amount of open capacity that has to go into something , and they ’ve shifted to groundwood publishing papers .
In 2008 , we decided that we wanted to take a more public stand about this issue .
We launched the Permanence Matters campaign to educate and activate the literary community about the rapid degradation of the quality of books .
While we realize that much of the publishing industry is moving their attention to e-books , we still believe there is an important place for print books in the future of publishing , and want people to recognize that e- and p- books are not an either / or proposition , but rather an “ and . ”
TM : It ’s an interesting issue .
It seems to me that most people do n’t really notice the paper quality in the books they buy , unless the quality ’s either exceptionally good or exceptionally bad , but we expect our books to last a long time .
How pervasive has this problem become ?
MK : Many people know about the “ acid paper crisis ” which got a lot of publicity in the late 1980 ’s and early 1990’s .
Many authors and other publishing industry notables banded together , and publishers lobbied for paper mills to produce only acid - free paper .
After this , people felt comfortable that books would endure because the paper mills began producing only alkaline paper ( which allowed the paper to endure much longer . )
But as I mentioned , approximately eight years ago we started to notice a shift in order patterns , as more publishers were moving some titles to groundwood .
As the years progressed , more and more titles began to shift from free - sheet Permanent Paper to groundwood , until now , when well over 50 % of the New York Times hardcover bestseller list is now printed on groundwood .
Someone recently challenged me on this , saying that the New York Times list is n’t necessarily what literary people would consider the most important works of current literature .
This degradation in paper quality is n’t only happening to non-literary works — many award - winning works , including many of the 2009 National Book Award nominees and one of the major category winners , are also not printed on free - sheet Permanent Paper .
This is what I know professionally .
But personally I am , first and foremost , a reader .
I have noticed a marked decline in the quality of the paper in the books I ’m reading personally ( almost all hardcover books , first or second editions . )
In the past six months , I have had a number of books whose paper is so flimsy feeling and looking that I was extremely frustrated to have spent money on it .
I read a book on vacation in March which was literally almost see - through — words from the opposite pages showed through ( by the way , major bestselling author , big five publisher . )
My personal feeling is , as publishing turns its head increasingly to e-books , the physical production values of print books will decline even more ( all the attention will go to e , few will be paying attention to physical print copies . )
This is saddening both personally and professionally .
TM : As you see it , what is at stake here ?
MK : I truly believe that we are at a critical crossroads in publishing .
As the attention , bandwidth and energy of publishing turns to e-books , we are concerned that what is currently a trend toward lesser quality print versions of books will then become a landslide .
Our stance in a world of e- and digital , very simply , is :
If you are going to print a book , it should be on permanent paper .
Our concern is the longevity of print books in the future — if many book editions will be digital , this is less permanent than a print version — as our CEO recently said , “ My last laptop lasted 3 years ” — and if a print version itself is not permanent , these words will not endure .
Digitization is not a fail - safe answer to preservation , especially as formats change almost constantly .
Print is still the most enduring way to preserve a work .
As we see it , it ’s the future of the printed word .
I also do n’t want to lose sight of the “ book as object ” or “ book as art ” — I believe it ’s important to still view important works as permanent artistic objects .
I get an email each day from the Metropolitan Museum of Art with the “ piece of the day ” which I enjoy looking at–but I still wish to know that I could go see it in person to gain the nuances of that work .
Books are no different .
TM : Have publishers been receptive to the Permanence Matters message ?
Have you encountered any resistance ?
MK : We do try to be careful and walk a bit of a tightrope on the initiative , as we are a paper supplier to both major publishers as well as smaller publishers , and it is not our goal to alienate or upset them — they are incredibly important to us .
One of our goals is to educate publishing employees as well — to help them make thoughtful decisions about the print production of books , and to start a dialogue with them .
TM : What ’s next for Permanence Matters ?
MK : We launched a new website at Book Expo America , www.permanencematters.com, one that will have more educational components rolling out this summer .
One of the great aspects of the new site is a video interview with the director of book conservation at Johns Hopkins University , and we have educational components about the true costs of print books , among many other features .
Additionally , we are launching a blog called “ Gutenberg Girls ” which will be co-written by myself and a coworker , which will allow us to more casually discuss issues within the book publishing industry as well as write about the books we ’re reading .
Although we are in the business of making and selling paper , I can tell you that we have many employees who are extremely avid readers and are troubled by this issue , and thus Permanence Matters is much more a personal passion than a business initiative .
Also , we are not the only company that makes free - sheet book publishing paper , and we support the shift back to permanent paper whether we are the beneficiary or not .
TM : Has the decline in paper quality impacted your buying habits at all ?
I know you ’re an avid reader , and given your line of work , I imagine you must find yourself noticing the quality of the paper in all the books you buy .
I ’m wondering if you ever find yourself hesitating to buy a first edition hardcover because you can tell it wo n’t last .
MK : It has absolutely changed my buying habits .
Professional hazards make me more cautious about what I buy — often , when I know a book is on groundwood , I will either wait for it to come out in paperback , or I will get it on audiobook instead of spending the money to buy a book which will yellow and degrade on the shelf .
I buy a lot of books , so there is a financial impact of me choosing to shift what would have been hardcover purchases to either a library lend of an audiobook or a paperback purchase .
Based on comments I ’ve heard from book buyers , and an increasing number of articles I come across on the internet about book quality , I believe we may be on a precipice of people starting to change their purchases based on the poor quality of the finished product .
3 .
An interesting facet of all of this is that we ’re not talking about enormous cost differentials here : according to the Permanence Matters website , the savings a publisher might expect to realize by printing a book on groundwood rather than higher - quality paper amounts to about ten cents a book .
And yes , in the current publishing environment every cent counts , but I ’d like to respectfully suggest here that some things are worth paying for .
The day after our interview , Melissa sent me some photographs .
The below images , courtesy of Permanence Matters , show what happens to a book printed on groundwood when it ’s left out in the sun for a mere two days .
A sticky note was left on the page for the entire two - day period to show contrast .
I think our books deserve better .
De facto segregation is alive and well in public schools in virtually every state , but is more common in charter schools - an educational option increasingly endorsed in state and national reform efforts , according to a national study released Thursday .
The trend is particularly severe for African American students , the UCLA researchers found .
Nearly 3 out of 4 black students who attend charters are in " intensely segregated " schools with student populations that are at least 90 percent minority , according to the study by the UCLA Civil Rights Project .
That 's twice the rate of regular public schools .
Almost a third of those black students are in what the researchers called " apartheid schools , " where 0 to 1 percent of their classmates are white .
Charter schools in the Bay Area and California have similar rates of racial isolation .
These are " the very kind of schools that decades of civil rights struggles fought to abolish in the South , " researchers said .
Unlike forced segregation in the South before the civil rights movement , de facto segregation is often a product of the demographics of the community in which the school exists .
Charter schools , however , are not considered neighborhood schools and are open to all students regardless of where they live .
The study looked at traditional and charter school data from 40 states and the District of Columbia , focusing on metropolitan areas with large numbers of charter schools .
Charter schools were " havens for white re-segregation " in some cases , but predominantly white student bodies occur more often in traditional public schools , the researchers found .
Study criticized
State charter school advocates quickly denounced the study .
" The civil rights issue here is the persistent achievement gap and high dropout rates for these students when they are left to languish in traditional schools that fail to meet their academic needs , " said Jed Wallace , CEO and president of the California Charter Schools Association , in a statement .
" Parents and students , who have lost faith in the system , choose to enroll in charter schools . "
Charter schools have become increasingly popular across the country over the last decade , with the Obama administration pushing the alternative public school option in its Race to the Top reform efforts .
California jumped on that bandwagon , recently eliminating a cap on the number of charter schools allowed in the state .
In 2008 , more than 238,000 California students , or about 4 percent of public school enrollment , attended charter schools , up from about 112,000 in 2001 .
Nationally , research is mixed on the academic success of charter schools compared with traditional schools .
State education officials , who support Race to the Top efforts , noted that the report does n't address student achievement within charter or traditional schools .
There are successes and failures among both types of public schools , said Department of Education spokeswoman Hilary McLean .
" While this study raises interesting issues , we must remain focused on our goal by supporting those schools that are delivering results and improving those that are not making the grade , " she said .
Remedies called for
The Civil Rights Project report called on federal and state officials to address segregation in charter schools by enforcing civil rights standards of equity , and creating policies that encourage and monitor enrollment .
One suggestion was to tie federal funds to charter schools that offer transportation and achieve diversity .
California law requires charter school petitions to include how its student population would reflect the general population of the local school district , state officials said .
Yet at the Achieve Academy charter school in Oakland , nearly 90 percent of the 224 students are Latino .
The school is part of the Education for Change network made up of three Oakland charter schools .
Achieve Academy posts higher test scores on average than those of Latino students statewide .
Like all charter schools , Achieve offers equal access to any family that wants their child to attend the school .
Latino families flock to the school .
Others do n't .
" It is not particularly usual for people who have a certain level of income to travel into poor communities to integrate the schools , " said Education for Change founder and CEO Kevin Wooldridge .
" I think to say that charter schools are not diverse enough is essentially targeting schools for societal problems .
To lay that problem at our feet is not particularly realistic . "
Yet many charter schools set up shop in specific neighborhoods hoping to serve a specific subset of children - often at - risk , low - income , minority students .
That might sound like a noble goal , but it is not one that adheres to the fundamental promise of equity in a public education , said UCLA Professor Gary Orfield , co-director of the Civil Rights Project .
" You ca n't decide to just serve one group of kids , " Orfield said .
" If you 're taking public funds , you 're subject to civil rights laws . "
In these days of social distancing , game developers and content creators all over the world are working from home and asking for help using Windows Remote Desktop streaming with the OpenGL tools they use .
NVIDIA has created a special tool for GeForce GPUs to accelerate Windows Remote Desktop streaming with GeForce drivers R440 or later .
Download and run the executable ( nvidiaopenglrdp.exe ) from the DesignWorks website as Administrator on the remote Windows PC where your OpenGL application will run .
A dialog will confirm that OpenGL acceleration is enabled for Remote Desktop and if a reboot is required .
After missing their original target of transitioning to Intel Gallium3D by default for Mesa 19.3 as the preferred OpenGL Linux driver on Intel graphics hardware , this milestone has now been reached for Mesa 20.0 .
The Khronos Group announces the release of the Vulkan 1.2 specification for GPU acceleration .

Dubai 's police chief did not specify what measures would be used to identify Israelis Dubai will use stricter screening measures before admitting Israeli dual citizenship holders into the country , its police chief said .
Israeli citizens are banned from travelling to the United Arab Emirates , which includes Dubai .
But dual nationals can use alternative passports to enter the country .
Many Israelis hold dual nationality .
The move follows the assassination of a Hamas commander , Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , in Dubai on 20 January .
The Israeli secret service has been implicated in the killing , though Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement .
Dubai 's police chief Lt Gen Dahi Khalfan Tamim said that in future , the UAE would " deny entry to anyone suspected of having Israeli citizenship " .
" Earlier , Israeli dual citizens could easily enter the country even if officials recognised them as Israelis from their accents and traits .
But from now on they will be carefully scrutinised , regardless of what passport they hold , " he said .
" We will not allow those who hold Israeli passports into the UAE no matter what other passport they have , " he added .
Speaking at a security conference on Monday Lt Gen Tamim said , " Israel must not carry out its assassinations on our land .
When it has a conflict with another country , Israel should deal with it on their land or the other country 's but not here on our land . "
" It is disgraceful how the killers abused European and other passports and UAE soil to assassinate " , he added .
' Develop skills '
Lt Gen Tamim did not expand on which specific measures would be used to identify Israeli travellers .
But the police chief said that security forces would " develop skills " to recognise Israelis by " physical features and the way they speak " .
It is unclear whether the screening would also apply to Israeli athletes and officials attending events in the UAE .
Last month Israel 's Shahar Peer played in a tennis tournament in Dubai .
Many Israelis hold dual nationality , allowing them to travel to countries without diplomatic relations with Israel .
This includes all Arab countries except Egypt and Jordan .
Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , 50 , was the founder of the Izzedine al - Qassam Brigades , the military wing of Hamas and was reportedly involved in weapons procurement .
He was found dead in a Dubai hotel room on 20 January .
On Sunday Dubai officials said that Mr Mabhouh 's killers used a quick - acting muscle relaxant to help make the death appear " natural " .
Dubai has identified 26 suspects in the murder and said they used British , Irish , French and Australian passports .
The countries say the passports used by the murder suspects were forged .

BEIJING — Prime Minister Wen Jiabao sharply defended China ’s currency and trade policies on Sunday against what he called foreign “ finger pointing , ” charging instead that developed countries seek to force unfair changes in those policies “ just for the purposes of increasing their own exports . ”
Mr. Wen ’s remarks , which echoed a rebuke on Thursday by one of China ’s central bankers , were perhaps the sharpest yet in a brewing disagreement between the Chinese and American governments over their economic positions .
In a news conference that lasted more than two hours at the close of China ’s annual legislative session , Mr. Wen repeated that China would keep its currency , the renminbi , “ basically stable ” despite calls by the United States and other developed nations to let its value increase .
He also repeated the concerns he voiced a year ago , at China ’s past legislative session , that the United States was failing to rebuild its own economy and maintain the value of the dollar , which has fluctuated since the global economic crisis began in late 2008 .
Protecting the dollar is a matter of “ national credibility , ” Mr. Wen said .
Some of these pages are quite technical .
You might like to look at the first section on transformations of the plane , then skip to the section on the 17 plane symmetry groups to get an idea of the different kinds of patterns .
The sections on lattices , on transformation groups and symmetry , and on history are more technical and , perhaps , most appropriate for college - level readers .
The concept of " group " is one of the most important concepts in mathematics , and a nice examples of groups are the wallpaper groups .
We 're not really talking about wallpaper here .
We 're interested in any planar repeating pattern .
In fact , the actual pattern is n't as much interest to us as the symmetries of the pattern .

Some more of that Fox News fairness and balance was on display today as President Obama held an event on health care reform that was covered by all three cable networks , but only two thought that it was important enough to show the entire event to their viewers .
Jon Scott of Fox News cut in and called the President ’s event a pep rally and cut away to a press conference from John Boehner .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

Apparently , the suits at Fox could not let their political message be tarnished by actual news events because while Obama was telling sharing a story about someone who needs health care reform , Fox News anchor Jon Scott cut into the coverage and said , “ I described it before it began as a pep rally and you can kind of see that ’s what it is .
The President doing everything he can to try and get the American people behind his health care reform plans . ”
Scott suggested the Fox audience finish watching Obama ’s event on the internet if they were so inclined and then cut to Boehner for “ the opposition point of view . ”
What was the important breaking news that FNC cut the President of the United States off for ?
An urgent press conference by the conservative corn flake , House Minority Leader John Boehner , who tried to claim that the health care bill will get less popular after it passes .
No one should be surprised that Fox News cut off the president and replaced him with a Republican talking point , but this is why it is obvious to all that journalism is not a concern for FNC .
They are there to push the Republican message , and there is no space on their network for news that could contradict with ideology that they are selling .
Fox News proved once again today that they have no interest in reporting the news .
The network had no problem with carrying every single heavily scripted and filtered pep rally the George W. Bush held during his presidency , yet because they disagree with Obama ’s positions on the issues , this president ’s events are , “ pep rallies ” that do not deserve full coverage .
I think Fox News needs to be reminded that the airwaves do n’t belong to them .
They belong to the American people .
This is not the way that a true news organization should ever operate .

Cocaine users were last night accused of helping to make global warming worse .
MPs on the home affairs select committee said the drug was devastating Colombian rainforests because trees are knocked down to grow coca plants .
Group chairman Keith Vaz said : " We were horrified to learn for every few lines of cocaine snorted in a London club , four square metres of rainforest is destroyed . "
Un Office on Drugs and Crime chief Antonio Maria Costa added : " Europeans know they should n't buy blood diamonds or clothes made by slaves in sweatshops .
" Yet with cocaine the opposite occurs .
Worse still , models who would n't dare to wear a tiger fur coat show no qualms about flaunting their cocaine use . "
The MPs also warned that more people in Britain were dying from the drug - cocaine caused 235 sudden deaths in 2008 .
The committee said that it led to heart disease , the erosion of brain function and could be " extremely toxic " when mixed with alcohol .
Members called for police to get tougher on users with more hand - held drug tracing machines in public .
And they said the operation against drugs bosses was " woefully inadequate " with only about 12 % of coke coming to the UK being confiscated .
Mr Vaz added that the perception of the white powder as safe was a " myth " .

Birthers , deathers , now , apparently , there are Antichristers on the Obama warpath .
The Daily Beast ’s John Avlon writes , “ On the heels of health care , a new Harris poll reveals Republican attitudes about Obama : Two - thirds think he ’s a socialist , 57 percent a Muslim — and 24 percent say ‘ he may be the Antichrist . ' ”
Avlon , author of the book Wingnuts : How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America , offers the poll as proof that “ Obama Derangement Syndrome — pathological hatred of the president posing as patriotism — has infected the Republican Party . ”

57 percent of Republicans ( 32 percent overall ) believe that Obama is a Muslim 45 percent of Republicans ( 25 percent overall ) agree with the Birthers in their belief that Obama was “ not born in the United States and so is not eligible to be president ” 38 percent of Republicans ( 20 percent overall ) say that Obama is “ doing many of the things that Hitler did ” Scariest of all , 24 percent of Republicans ( 14 percent overall ) say that Obama “ may be the Antichrist . ”
These numbers all come from a brand - new Louis Harris poll , inspired in part by my new book Wingnuts .
It demonstrates the cost of the campaign of fear and hate that has been pumped up in the service of hyper - partisanship over the past 15 months .
We are playing with dynamite by demonizing our president and dividing the United States in the process .
What might be good for ratings is bad for the country .
The poll , which surveyed 2,230 people right at the height of the health - care reform debate , also clearly shows that education is a barrier to extremism .
Respondents without a college education are vastly more likely to believe such claims , while Americans with college degrees or better are less easily duped .
It ’s a reminder of what the 19th - century educator Horace Mann once too - loftily said : “ Ignorance breeds monsters to fill up the vacancies of the soul that are unoccupied by the verities of knowledge . ”
Alibi.com blogger Erin McCullough writes , “ Are you a Republican who is mostly non-crazy ?
( Leaving the belief that most taxes are bad aside . )
Then , hey :
Um , tell your fellow party members to stop being so batshit . ”
The blogger adds ,
It ’s hard for Democrats to want to make concessions with sane Republicans ( Olympia Snowe , and , hold on … I ’ll get back to you ) when dingholes like Texas Rep .
Neugebauer ( the latest in what ’s becoming a trend of grown men who yell inappropriate things at work , which I can tell you from experience is not a luxury most of us have .
His shout ; “ baby killer ” ) stinking up the wings .
Anyway .
Craziness .
There were plenty of people spouting crazy theories about Bush Jr. during his presidency , but most of those people were sitting outside of Winnings coffee , not in Congress .
Sigh .
The poll seems to reveal that many Republicans share beliefs with the radical Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka , Kansas .
The church run by Fred Phelps has been roundly criticized for picketing funerals of troops killed in the war on terror .

It was in this newspaper that we first revealed how Pachauri has earned millions of pounds for his Delhi - based research institute Teri , and further details are still emerging of how he has parlayed his position into a worldwide business empire , including 17 lucrative contracts from the EU alone .
But we should not expect the truth to break in too suddenly on this mass of vested interests .
Too many people have too much at stake to allow the faith in man-made global warming , which has sustained them so long and which is today making so many of them rich , to be abandoned .
The so - called investigations into Climategate and Dr Michael " Hockey Stick " Mann seem like no more than empty establishment whitewashes .
There is little reason to expect that the inquiry into the record of the IPCC and Dr Pachauri that is now being set up by the UN Environment Programme and the world 's politicians will be very different .
Howard Stern unleashed the fury all over Jay Leno this morning , brutally tearing into the " Tonight Show " host on a segment for the " CBS Early Show . "
One day after Leno returned to late night , CBS asked Stern for his thoughts , which went like this : " The mere mention of Jay Leno 's name makes me wanna vomit .
I do n't like this guy . "
Stern , who has a long gestating hatred of the talk show host , also referred to Leno as a " lap dog " and a " thief " ... once again accusing Jay of stealing material from himself , Letterman and even people in England .
Long story short -- do n't expect Stern on " The Tonight Show " anytime soon .
Should Pope Benedict XVI be held responsible for church abuse scandals ?
An escalating scandal over clerical sexual abuse in Europe is heightening calls for greater transparency in the Vatican and a zero - tolerance policy toward abusive priests that would mirror the approach adopted by the U.S. Catholic Church .

Pete Stark will let Sander Levin take the Ways and Means chairmanship .
Stark hands off gavel
Rep. Sander Levin will take over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee after Rep. Pete Stark , who held the gavel for a day , stepped aside .
The dominoes fell after Rep. Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) resigned the chairmanship of the powerful tax - writing panel Wednesday as Republicans and many Democrats were moving to oust him following an ethics committee ruling that found he violated House gift rules .

Levin , who had been chairman of the trade subcommittee , will helm the panel through the end of this Congress — barring the unlikely return of Rangel .
Officially , Stark stepped aside to keep the gavel of the panel 's health subcommittee .
But lawmakers and aides said Stark faced a rebellion within the committee and the caucus over his sometimes bizarre behavior and penchant for making offensive comments .
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Chris Van Hollen told Stark at a Ways and Means Committee meeting Wednesday that his stepping aside would be in the best interests of the party , according to a Democratic aide familiar with the meeting .
Panel members voted unanimously in favor of recommending Levin for the post once Stark stepped aside , according to Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D - Texas ) .
“ Under the circumstances , I could not think of anyone who could serve the country , the Congress and our committee better than Sandy Levin , ” Rangel said .
Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee would have preferred Rep. Richard Neal ( D - Mass. ) to ascend to the chairmanship because Levin is seen as fiercely partisan , a House GOP aide said .
Levin is also said to be less willing to negotiate with Republicans on free trade — one potential area of agreement between Republicans on Ways and Means and the Obama administration .
Neal was seen by Republicans as bipartisan and more open to negotiations .
Stark , 78 , was in trouble from the beginning with his potential chairmanship .
He was ensnared in an ethics investigation into claims he tried to obtain a tax exemption for Maryland residents though his main residence is in California .
In an interview with the Office of Congressional Ethics , Stark alternatively denied and admitted that he had applied for the tax exemption .
He was eventually absolved by the ethics committee .
He has also long been known to grab the spotlight with bizarre and often offensive comments .
He called former Connecticut Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson a “ whore for the insurance industry ” and said she got her information from “ pillow talk . ”
He said Jewish members of Congress were a cause of the Gulf War .
More recently , he accused Republicans of sending soldiers to Iraq “ to get their heads blown off for the president ’s amusement . "
Stark , in a Thursday morning statement , said he wanted to oversee the implementation of health care reform from his subcommittee chair .
“ Once we pass health reform , it will take careful oversight to make sure that it is being implemented correctly , ” Stark said .
“ I have chosen to remain Chair of the Health Subcommittee and look forward to working with my colleagues on these vital priorities . ”

Eggs have long been studied but only now is their DNA being isolated Researchers have found that eggshells of extinct bird species are a rich source of preserved DNA .
An international team isolated the delicate DNA molecules of species including the massive " elephant birds " of the genus Aepyorni .
The Proceedings of the Royal Society B research demonstrated the approach also on emu , ducks and the extinct moa .
The team says that the technique will enable researchers to learn more about ancient birds and why they died out .
" Researchers have tried unsuccessfully to isolate DNA from a fossil eggshell for years , " said Charlotte Oskam at Murdoch University in Western Australia , who authored the research .
" It just turned out that they were using a method designed for bone that was not suitable for a fossil eggshell . "
The team has obtained DNA from the shells of a variety of species , most notably the elephant bird Aepyornis , which at half a tonne was heaviest bird to have ever existed .
The elephant bird 's eggs could make 30 omelettes Aepyornis looked like an outsized ostrich , standing three metres tall ; most of them died out 1,000 years ago .
Archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson at the University of Sheffield hopes that an analysis of the bird 's DNA will shed more light on why the bird became extinct .
The extinction coincided with humans arriving at Aepyornis 's natural habitat in Madagascar .
The mystery , according to Professor Parker Pearson , is that there 's no evidence that the bird was hunted by humans .
" There 's not even evidence that they ate the eggs - even though each one could make omelettes for 30 people , " he told BBC News .

The elephant bird may be at the root of legends about giant birds .
Marco Polo claimed erroneously that these giant birds could fly .
There are also tales of birds that could pick up elephants in 1001 Arabian Nights .
There are complete skeletons of the elephant bird , but by analysing its DNA researchers hope to build up a more detailed picture of the creature and discover why it went extinct .

March 18 , 2010 -- Extreme obesity has reached ' ' alarming ' ' levels among children , according to a new study that looked at the weights and heights of more than 710,000 children aged 2 to 19 .
'' The prevalence of extreme obesity was much higher than we thought , " says the study ’s lead author , Corinna Koebnick , PhD , a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California , a large prepaid health plan .
'' Seven percent of boys and 5 % of girls -- that is scary , " she tells WebMD .
That was the overall prevalence of extreme obesity she found .
Before the study findings , Koebnick says , she would have expected perhaps 3 % to 5 % .
And the 7 % and 5 % figures are overall .
For some ethnic groups , the prevalence of extreme obesity was much higher -- up to nearly 12 % .
Regular readers know of our affinity for NHL Equivalency as developed by the marvelous Gabriel Desjardins .
From our regular feature on the NHLE progress of the Oilers ' prospects , to the look at Mats Zuccarello - Aasen , to our statistical breakdowns in our Top 25 under 25 , the Copper & Blue loves the NHLE metric .
From the link , we know the conversion values , so it 's interesting to note the IIHF 's rankings of the European leagues .
The rankings below were taken from the IIHF website .
1. Kontinental Hockey League - Russia
2. SM - liiga - Finland
3. Extraliga - Czech Republic
4. Elitserien - Sweden
5. Extraliga - Slovakia
6. Nationalliga A - Switzerland
7. Deutsche Eishockey - Liga - Germany
8. Belarusian Vysshaya Liga - Belarus
9. Latvijas hokeja liga - Lativa
10 . AL - Bank Ligaen - Denmark
11 . Erste Bank Eishockey Liga - Austria
12 . Kazakhstani Championship - Kazkhstan
13 . GET - ligaen - Norway
14 . Ligue Magnus - France
15 . Slohokej Liga - Slovenia
16 . Serie A - Italy
17 . OB I. Bajnokság - Hungary
18 . Polska Liga Hokejowa - Poland
19 . Eredivisie - Netherlands
20 . Vyscha Liha - Ukraine
21 . Elite Ice Hockey League - Great Britain
22 . Liga Nationala de hochei - Romania
I could n't find an explanation for any methodology behind the rankings , so the what the IIHF is doing here is a mystery .
The rankings disagree with Gabe 's conversion factors to a great extent .
Sweden 's Elitserien has dropped two spots from the previous year to fourth overall this year and the Nationalliga A in Switzerland has moved up one spot .
The rankings were more meaningful for the kickoff of the short - lived Champions Hockey League which may resume play next year ( I 'd love to watch this * AHEM * VERSUS ) , but it 's interesting to look at them anyway when considering draft prospects and foreign free agents .
Since Galileo first pointed a telescope at the sky 400 years ago , a myriad of technological advances have allowed astronomers to look at very faint objects , very distant objects , and even light that 's invisible to the human eye .
Yet , one aspect usually remains out of reach - the benefit of a 3 - D perspective .
Our telescopes show the Milky Way galaxy only as it appears from one vantage point : our solar system .
Now , using a simple but powerful technique , a group of astronomers led by Armin Rest of Harvard University has seen an exploding star or supernova from several angles .
" The same event looks different from different places in the Milky Way , " said Rest .
" For the first time , we can see a supernova from an alien perspective . "
The supernova left behind the gaseous remnant Cassiopeia A .
The supernova 's light washed over the Earth about 330 years ago .
But light that took a longer path , reflecting off clouds of interstellar dust , is just now reaching us .
This faint , reflected light is what the astronomers have detected .
The technique is based on the familiar concept of an echo , but applied to light instead of sound .
If you yell , " Echo ! " in a cave , sound waves bounce off the walls and reflect back to your ears , creating echoes .
Similarly , light from the supernova reflects off interstellar dust to the Earth .
The dust cloud acts like a mirror , creating light echoes that come from different directions depending on where the clouds are located .
" Just like mirrors in a changing room show you a clothing outfit from all sides , interstellar dust clouds act like mirrors to show us different sides of the supernova , " explained Rest .
Moreover , an audible echo is delayed since it takes time for the sound waves to bounce around the cave and back .
Light echoes also are delayed by the time it takes for light to travel to the dust and reflect back .
As a result , light echoing from the supernova can reach us hundreds of years after the supernova itself has faded away .
Not only do light echoes give astronomers a chance to directly study historical supernovae , they also provide a 3 - D perspective since each echo comes from a spot with a different view of the explosion .
Most people think a supernova is like a powerful fireworks blast , expanding outward in a round shell that looks the same from every angle .
But by studying the light echoes , the team discovered that one direction in particular looked significantly different than the others .
They found signs of gas from the stellar explosion streaming toward one point at a speed almost 9 million miles per hour ( 2,500 miles per second ) faster than any other observed direction .
" This supernova was two - faced ! " said Smithsonian co-author and Clay Fellow Ryan Foley .
" In one direction the exploding star was blasted to a much higher speed . "
Previous studies support the team 's finding .
For example , the neutron star created when the star 's core collapsed is zooming through space at nearly 800,000 miles per hour in a direction opposite the unique light echo .
The explosion may have kicked gas one way and the neutron star out the other side ( a consequence of Newton 's third law of motion , which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction ) .
By combining the new light - echo measurements and the movement of the neutron star with X - ray data on the supernova remnant , astronomers have assembled a 3 - D perspective , giving them new insight into the Cas A supernova .
" Now we can connect the dots from the explosion itself , to the supernova 's light , to the supernova remnant , " said Foley .
Cassiopeia
A is located about 16,000 light - years from Earth and contains matter at temperatures of around 50 million degrees F , causing it to glow in X - rays .
A 3 - D computer model of the remnant is online .
The Mayall 4 - meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory was used to locate the light echoes .
Follow - up spectra were obtained with the 10 - meter Keck I Telescope .
The journal paper describing this discovery is available online .

Downing Street has rejected an offer from the US to help the UK and Argentina resolve their latest dispute over the Falkland Islands .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the offer after renewed tensions were triggered by a UK decision to drill for oil near the islands .
A spokesman for Gordon Brown said he welcomed her comments but did not think her direct involvement was necessary .
Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falklands , which it calls the Malvinas .
It has been angered by the UK 's decision to begin drilling for oil under a seabed off the islands .
Mrs Clinton said the row should be resolved between the two , but " if we can be of any help in facilitating such an effort , we stand ready to do so " .
' Drilling is legitimate ' However Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's spokesman responded to the offer by saying : " We do n't think that 's necessary .
" We welcome the support of the secretary of state in terms of ensuring that we continue to keep diplomatic channels open but there is no need for that ( direct involvement ) . "
He stressed that " self - determination of Islanders is the key issue " and emphasised that Britain and Argentina have a strong ongoing working relationship .
We 're not interested in and have no real role in determining what they decide between the two of them .
But we want them talking
Hillary Clinton
However the spokesman also said the UK believed the oil drilling was " both the right thing to do and is entirely legitimate " .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband emphasised the point , saying the drilling companies are " wholly within their rights " under international law .
Mr Miliband told MPs at Commons question time : " The government has made it clear it has no doubt about the UK 's sovereignty of the Falkland Islands .
" There can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until such time as the Falkland Islanders so wish it and they have made clear they have no such wish .
Earthquake " The companies are acting wholly within their rights and wholly within the legality of international law , " he added .
Ms Clinton spoke about the situation before she met Argentine President Cristina Fernandez as part of a tour of Latin America .
She is also due to visit Chile - reeling from a massive earthquake which killed more than 700 people - Brazil , Costa Rica and Guatemala .
The AP news agency reported that at the meeting , Argentina asked for US help in resolving the dispute .
" What we have requested is mediation as a friendly country of both Argentina and the United Kingdom , " it quoted Ms Fernandez as saying .
After the meeting , Mrs Clinton said the US wanted to encourage dialogue but was not offering to act in a mediating role .
Diplomatic offensive " We 're not interested in and have no real role in determining what they decide between the two of them .
But we want them talking and we want them trying to resolve the outstanding issues between them , " she said .
" We recognise that there are contentious matters that have to be resolved and we hope that they will do so . "
Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana last week claimed that by drilling in the disputed waters , Britain was a committing a unilateral act contrary to international law .
He asked United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to bring the UK into talks over the sovereignty of the islands .
The UK government says the islands have a " legitimate right " to develop an oil industry within their waters .
Britain has exercised sovereignty in the Falklands since 1833 .
The islanders are almost all of British descent .
Argentina says it has a right to the islands because it inherited them from the Spanish crown in the early 1800s .
It invaded the islands in 1982 , prompting the UK to seize back control in a seven - week war that claimed the lives of 649 Argentine and 255 British service personnel .
The current Argentine government has ruled out any military action over the islands , but is stepping up a diplomatic offensive to try to pressure London into negotiations .

Ludwig von Mises was quite possibly the most uncompromising , consistent , and principled defender of classical liberalism and the free - market economy in the 20th century .
His great works on The Theory of Money and Credit , Socialism , Liberalism , Critique of Interventionism , Epistemological Problems of Economics , Bureaucracy , Human Action , Theory and History , and Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science , for example , show him to be that unique , grand theorist dealing with the sweeping issues and problems of the human condition : the general logic and structure of human action and choice ; the nature of different economic institutional orders — capitalism , socialism , and interventionism ; the workings of the competitive market process and the role of the entrepreneur ; the importance of the monetary order for economic calculation and market coordination ; and the interconnections between time , money , production , and the occurrence of the business cycle .
This is certainly the side of Mises 's thought and writings that often carries a timeless quality with continuing relevance and application , because it deals with the general and universal aspects of man , mind , markets , and society .
But we should also remember that Ludwig von Mises did not make his living as a grand economic theorist or social philosopher for most of the years before he came to the United States as a refugee from war - ravaged Europe in 1940 .
For almost a quarter of a century , from 1909 to 1934 ( except during the First World War ) , Mises worked as an economic - policy analyst and advisor to the Vienna Chamber of Commerce .
From the ages of 28 to 53 ( when he moved to Geneva , Switzerland to accept his first full - time academic position , at the Graduate Institute of International Studies ) he spent his working day as a " policy wonk . "
And I mean a " policy wonk " — someone immersed in the factual details and economic policy specifics of , first , the old Austro - Hungarian Empire and , then , the Austrian Republic between the two World Wars .
His statistical knowledge of " the facts " relating to Austrian fiscal policy , regulatory legislation , and monetary institutions and policy was precise and minute .
This became very clear to me while I worked through those " lost papers " of Ludwig von Mises that were recovered by my wife and myself from a formerly secret KGB archive in Moscow in 1996 .
Indeed , it helped me to better understand that much of Mises 's conception of the general economic order , its workings and requirements , and the institutional and policy " rules " that would help establish and maintain freedom and prosperity did not arise from a pure , a priori , deductive spinning out of implications from the " action axiom . "
They are , in many cases , the general theoretical insights and conclusions , and the social - institutional and economic - policy " wisdoms " derived from living through , acting within , and the lessons learned from those momentous and often catastrophic events that shook Europe in the first half of the 20th century .
And they were amplified due to the particular everyday reality of Austrian political and economic life that Mises experienced and worked within during this time .
An appreciation of this aspect of Ludwig von Mises 's life and thinking comes out when reading through Mises 's policy writings from this period .
Liberty Fund of Indianapolis has been publishing a three - volume series under the general title , Selected Writings of Ludwig von Mises , for which I have served as the editor .
The volumes contain many of Mises 's articles , essays , and Vienna - chamber memoranda and speeches on these themes from this time .
They have been appearing in reverse chronological order .
Thus , the last of the three volumes , which should appear in print in the very near future , is actually volume 1 .
It deals with Monetary , Fiscal and Economic Policy Problems Before , During , and After the Great War , and includes many of Mises 's earliest writings as an economist .
Here Mises analyzes issues surrounding the politics of establishing the gold standard in Austria - Hungary in the early 1890s ; legal gold redemption by the Austro - Hungarian Bank in the decade before the First World War ; the growing fiscal imbalances developing in the old Habsburg Empire due to the patterns of government spending and taxing policies in the first decade of the 20th century ; and the reasons behind the economic crisis that hit Austria - Hungary in the years immediately before the start of the Great War .
Here , too , we see Mises analyzing during the war the motives behind German and Austro - Hungarian trade policy ; the impact and significance of emigration from the Austrian Empire ; the effects from the monetary inflation used to fund the government 's war expenditures ; and the pros and cons of financing those war expenditures through taxation versus borrowing by the issuance of war bonds .
After the war , Mises explained the distorting effects from the new Austrian government 's control and rationing of foreign exchange for imports and exports ; the impact on the Austrian foreign exchange rate due to monetary expansion to finance the government 's huge deficit spending ; a specific policy agenda to bring the country 's financial house back into order , and the need for cooperation from both businesses and labor unions if this was to be achieved without Austria 's currency collapsing into a hyperinflation ; the claims that holders of bank notes of the old Austro - Hungarian Bank could make on the new Austrian National Bank in the postwar period ; Austria 's fiscal problems in the period after the end of the inflation ; and the lessons for banking reform after the collapse of several banks in 1931 .
( An appendix to the volume includes a talk that Mises delivered at his famous private seminar in the spring of 1934 on the methodology of the social sciences shortly before he moved to Geneva , Switzerland ; and the curriculum vitae that his great - grandfather , Mayer Rachmiel Mises , prepared for the Habsburg Emperor in 1881 as part of his ennoblement that gave him and his heirs the hereditary title of " Edler von . " )
It is in the second volume of the Selected Writings ( 2002 ) , Between the Two World Wars : Monetary Disorder , Interventionism , Socialism , and the Great Depression , that the reader will find a large collection of Mises 's many articles and policy pieces from the 1920s and 1930s dealing with the Great Austrian Inflation , fiscal and regulatory mismanagement by the government , and the negative effects of numerous forms of government intervention and controls before and during the Great Depression ; the volume also includes his critiques of socialist central planning and his defense of praxeology , the science of human action .
The third volume of the Selected Writings ( 2000 ) focuses on Mises 's writings mostly from the first half of the 1940s on the theme of The Political Economy of International Reform and Reconstruction .
In the midst of the Second World War , Mises lectured and wrote on the pressing issues of how Europe , small nations , and underdeveloped countries could recover from war and poverty and start on the path to economic renewal and prosperity .
Each volume begins with an introduction in which I try to explain the historical context of the period in which Mises wrote the pieces included in that particular volume .
I have also tried to assist the reader with annotated footnotes explaining some of the ideas , persons , events , and geographical locations to which Mises refers in the texts .
What comes out from reading Mises 's policy writings from this period of his European career is that if you had asked him a fiscal , or monetary , or regulatory - policy question in the context of his role as analyst at the Chamber of Commerce , he would not have said , and did not simply say , " laissez - faire " — abolish the central bank , deregulate the economy , and eliminate taxes .
In the give - and - take of everyday Austrian politics and policy decision - making , Mises accepts that there are certain institutional " givens " that must be taken for granted , and in the context of which policy options and decisions must be worked out .
Though he never expresses it explicitly , Mises seemed to usually think with three policy " horizons " in his mind .
The first , and the more distant , horizon , concerned the most optimal institutional and policy arrangements in society for the fostering of the classical - liberal ideal of freedom and prosperity , based on the knowledge that he thought sound economic theory could provide .
This is captured most frequently in the books and articles he was writing outside of his narrow role as Vienna Chamber of Commerce economist , such as The Theory of Money and Credit ( 1912 ; revised ed. , 1924 ) ; Socialism ( 1922 , revised ed. , 1932 ) ; Liberalism ( 1927 ) ; Monetary Stabilization and Cyclical Policy ( 1928 ) ; Critique of Interventionism ( 1929 ) ; and Causes of the Economic Crisis ( 1931 ) .
The second horizon was closer to the actual circumstances of the present , but focused on the intermediary goals that would be leading in the direction of that more distant , " optimal " horizon .
For example , the need for ending a paper money inflation and reestablishing a gold - based monetary system for general economic stability , without which the market order and economic calculation cannot properly function .
Or the need to shift Austrian fiscal policy in a direction that would reduce the burden and incidence of the tax structure to end capital consumption and instead foster private - sector investment and capital formation .
I should mention that as a policy analyst thinking in terms of a classical - liberal normative framework , Mises does not advocate " tax neutrality " — that is , a low tax structure that would fund those minimal , limited - government functions , but would not attempt , outside of this , to " influence " the behavior or choices of the market participants .
He believes that such a low tax system should be structured in such a way that it does foster and generate incentives for investment and capital formation .
The tax structure , in his view , should be designed to stimulate production , not current consumption .
And the third horizon in the context of which Mises analyzes and proposes economic policies , is the current situation and the immediate future .
In other words , how do you design the concrete bylaws and rules for a central bank to prevent it from following an inflationary monetary policy , including the transition to and implementation of specie redemption , and the policy tools it should then use to maintain the exchange rate and convertibility ?
" What comes out from reading Mises 's policy writings is that if you had asked him a fiscal , or monetary , or regulatory - policy question , he would not have said , and did not simply say , ' laissez - faire ' — abolish the central bank , deregulate the economy , and eliminate taxes . "
In the 1970s , Murray Rothbard once criticized Milton Friedman for advocating " indexation " of prices and wages as a method to reduce some of the negative effects from an ongoing inflation .
But in 1922 , during the worsening Great Austrian Inflation , Mises actually proposed " indexation " of wages and prices , as well as government revenues and expenditures to reduce deficit fiscal pressures , maintain real standards of living for many in the society , and eliminate some of the inflationary distortions on economic calculation — as a part of a specific policy agenda to bring the inflation to an end .
And he explained how the indexation should be implemented and linked to the international value of gold .
Likewise , Mises did not just say , " Cut bureaucracy and its spider 's web of regulatory controls . "
He first explains what was inefficient and unnecessary in the three - tiered Austrian bureaucratic system of federal , provincial , and municipal regulators and taxing authorities .
Then he explains what specific reforms should be introduced , how they could be " experimented " with in some of the smaller regions of Austria to see how they worked before extending them to the rest of the country , and how best to overcome the resistance of those in the bureaucracy fearful of losing their jobs .
In designing a new fiscal order for Austria , Mises proposed eliminating all income taxes and many — but not all — corporate and business taxes .
But how , then , do you finance the costs of government ?
He presents an agenda for implementing indirect taxes on a wide variety of consumption items , and especially what today would be called " sin taxes " and " luxury taxes . "
Government welfare - state expenditures were not going to just disappear .
So , employers would be taxed to cover existing social - insurance expenditures .
But overall , his fiscal policy plan for a reconstructed and reformed Austria was all meant to foster capital formation through predominately consumption taxation to cover government expenditures .
And in a lengthy monograph that he wrote during the Second World War devoted to economic reform in an underdeveloped country like Mexico , he took as " given " that the politics of Mexican society was not ready to fully privatize , say , the national railway system or the oil industry .
So as a " second best , " Mises proposed transforming the railway system into a government - owned but privately managed corporation with strict rules and procedures to assure it was run in a relatively " business - like " manner with the least likelihood of political interference .
He even supported limited and temporary subsidies to assist poor Mexican farmers to establish themselves as more - successful private enterprisers .
And on tariffs , he did not propose immediate abolition of trade barriers in Mexico .
He accepted that there were many industries that had grown up behind the tariff walls , and that they would resist immediate repeal of trade protectionism .
So , instead , he advocated " incrementalism , " i.e. , a gradual reduction of the tariff barriers over several years .
He even supports the use of limited " trade retaliation " against countries that have raised their import taxes against the goods of one 's own nation ; this was meant as a means of nudging that trading partner back to a freer trade policy .
To give one more indication of Mises 's thinking on specific policy alternatives and choices , there is a passage in Human Action in which he says , rather cryptically in passing , that there may be good reasons under certain circumstances to fund some government spending through short - term borrowing .
One only understands what he meant by this by reading a lecture he delivered in 1916 on the problem of funding the costs of the government 's war expenses .
In this lecture , which is included in the forthcoming volume 1 of the Selected Writings of Ludwig von Mises , he praises the military successes of the Austrian army and the industriousness of Austrian businessmen in providing the manufactured goods required to fight the war .
Mises reminds his listeners that borrowing does not enable the current generation to shift any part of the costs of a war to a future generation .
Current consumption could only come out of current production , and this applied no less to consumption of finished goods designed for and used in war .
Whether the war was financed by taxes or borrowing , the citizenry paid for it today by foregoing all that could have been produced and used if not for the war .
Then he explains to his audience what today often is referred to as the Ricardian equivalence theorem , named after the early 19th century British economist , David Ricardo .
In his 1820 essay on the " Funding System , " Ricardo argued that all that the borrowing option entailed was a decision whether to be taxed more in the present or more in the future , since all that was borrowed now would have to be paid back plus interest at a later date through future taxes ; therefore in terms of their financial burden the two funding methods can be shown to be equivalent , under specified conditions .
Ricardo , however , also pointed out that due to people 's perceptions and evaluations of costs in the present versus the future , they were rarely equivalent in their minds .
But Mises raised a different point in favor of certain benefits to debt financing for the government 's war expenditures .
Many who would not have the liquid assets to pay lump - sum wartime taxes would either have to sell off less liquid properties to pay their tax obligation , or would have to borrow the required sum to pay the tax .
In the first case , a sizeable number of citizens might have to liquidate properties more or less all at the same time to improve their cash positions , which would put exceptional downward pressure on the market prices of those assets .
This would impose a financial loss on those forced to sell these properties and assets to the benefit of those who were able to buy them at prices that would not have been so abnormally low if not for the war and the need for ready cash to pay the tax obligation .
Secondly , to the extent that some citizens would need to borrow to cover their wartime tax payments , the private individual 's creditworthiness undoubtedly would be much lower than that of the government's .
As a consequence , the rates of interest these private individual 's would have to pay would be noticeably higher than the rate at which the government could finance its borrowing .
Thus , the interest burden from government borrowing that would have to be paid for out of future taxes would be less for the citizenry than the financial cost from them having to borrow the money in the present to cover all the costs of war through current taxation .
Hence , it was both patriotic and cost - efficient , Mises said to those listening to his lecture , to buy war bonds in support of the war effort .
Thus , we find Ludwig von Mises explaining why , given the reality of government spending , under certain circumstances government deficit spending may be more desirable ( from the taxpayers ' perspective ) than a fully tax - funded balanced budget !
I have summarized and analyzed many of Mises 's policy views and prescriptions during this period from before the First World War through the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s , and into the years of the Second World War in several of the chapters in my recently published book , Political Economy , Public Policy , and Monetary Economics : Ludwig von Mises and the Austrian Tradition ( Routledge , 2010 ) .
In earning a living at the Vienna Chamber of Commerce in the Austria of his time , Mises could not simply propose and advocate a desired vision of what he considered to be the free and prosperous classical - liberal society of tomorrow .
Given the ideologies and politics guiding , and the economic policies being implemented by , the Austrian government in the first four decades of the 20th century , Mises had to articulate detailed and specific alternative policy prescriptions that he surely first had to win support for within the Vienna Chamber of Commerce , and then make the case for in the wider arena of Austrian public opinion and policy decision making .
Even as that uncompromising and principled proponent of individual liberty and the free market , Mises was called upon in his role as policy analyst and advocate to sometimes devise " second - " and " third - best " policy proposals in an imperfect world dominated by collectivist and interventionist ideas and practices .
Separate from the " pros " and " cons " of each of the actual and specific monetary , fiscal , and regulatory policy changes and reforms that he presented during those years , what stands out most clearly is the guiding idea that implicitly runs through all of them .
This guiding idea was Mises 's attempt to think about and construct them in a way that if implemented and successful would move the society away from the abyss of socialist and interventionist destruction , and back in the direction of a freer and a more prosperous classical - liberal society .
That Mises was not able to fully succeed in his attempts to do this in the Austria of his time was not his fault .
As he explains in his Memoirs , written shortly after he arrived in the United States , he tried to be the liberal " conscience " of his country .
He did help to prevent Austria moving in a totally socialist direction in the years immediately after the First World War , and he did assist in ending Austria 's Great Inflation in 1922 –1923 .
But the tide of nationalist , socialist , and racialist collectivism was too powerful in those years to reverse its course .
As Mises mournfully says in his Memories , the final destroyer of interwar Austria came from outside in the form of the Nazi annexation of the country into Hitler 's Greater German Reich in March of 1938 .
So what can we learn from Mises 's extensive and detailed policy analyses on a wide variety of issues from those earlier decades of the 20th century ?
I would suggest that , first of all , we can gain an insight into the interaction between " theory " and " practice " at work in the mind of Ludwig von Mises .
We can get a better understanding of how theory guided him to in thinking about and devising policy proposals , and how the practical policy affairs of everyday Austrian life during this time clearly challenged Mises 's own thinking about the nature and working of the market order and the effects when the state throws sand in the machine through its various forms of interventionism and government planning .
And , second of all , for those who have sometimes asked , " Well , but how do you apply Austrian Economics to the ' real world ' of public policy ? " here is the answer by the economist who has been considered the most original , thoroughgoing , and uncompromising member of the Austrian School over the last one hundred years !
His policy analyses provide us with warning signs and guideposts to assist us in thinking about and designing better policies for our own time .
Friedrich A. Hayek once remarked , when looking back at the events in Austria and Ludwig von Mises 's place in the decades before the Second World War , " That they had one of the great thinkers in their midst the Viennese have never understood . "
Mises 's body of writings — on theory and policy — from this period enables us to appreciate what the Austrians , to their great misfortune , did not .
Fury as Google puts the SAS 's secret base on Street View in 'very serious security breach '
Military chiefs and MPs blasted internet giant Google today after its Street View service included detailed pictures of the headquarters of the SAS .
Internet users can peer around the entrance to Credenhill , Herefordshire , which has never before appeared on maps for security reasons .
The base is even marked as ' British SAS ' on the website and offers users a detailed 180 degree view of the perimeter boundary .
MPs and military top brass have demanded Google removes the pictures , claiming it makes the SAS a target for terrorist attacks .
Google Street View captured detailed images of the SAS base in Hereford
Lib Dem Hereford MP
Paul Keetch said : ' The footage is simply not acceptable during a time of perceived terrorism .
' There needs to be a certain degree of restraint shown by people like Google .
' I would n't want a terrorist to be inspired by these pictures and it would be appalling if any help at all was given to our enemies .
' We all know where the Palace of Westminister is , we all know where the SAS camp is , but the issue is if you 're going into such detail in such a way that you can undermine the security of that building , that could be a problem . '
An Army insider added : ' Military chiefs have had concerns with Google Street View for some time .
' It is highly irresponsible for military bases , especially special forces , to be pictured on the internet .
' Google claims it blurs faces and number plates to avoid people being identified but one mistake could be very dangerous weapon for a terrorist .
' The question is , why risk a very serious security breach for the sake of having a picture on a website ? '
Residents living near the base also expressed shock at the pictures .
One man , who did not want to be named but has links with the base , said : ' The SAS conducts operations where secrecy is absolutely vital to their success .
' It beggars belief that the base has been made vulnerable by having such detailed pictures published on the internet .
' Terrorists could potentially use their home computers to plot an attack capable of dire consequences on the base .
That 's frightening .'
The images - all taken within the last six months - show a military ambulance and a police car at the gates of the base along with three guards .
Separate satellite pictures on Google Earth also show the layout of the buildings and even makes and models of cars in the car park .
The MoD has never made the exact details of the base public but the location of the nearest village is available online .
Google yesterday defended the pictures and said they had no plans to take them off their site .
Spokeswoman Laura Scott said : ' One in five people already use Google Street View for house hunting and the scheme has previously launched in 20 countries without any breach of security issues .
' Google only takes images from public roads and this is no different to what anyone could see travelling down the road themselves , therefore there is no appreciable security risk .
' We 're happy to discuss any concerns as they arise . '
An MoD spokesman said : ' We never confirm where any of our special forces are based . '

ABC News reporter Jonathon Karl tried to get Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) to answer questions about his one man filibuster an extension of unemployment benefits .
Bunning told Karl he was not talking to anyone and on his way to elevator , before the cameras arrived , gave ABC the finger .
Bunning may have thought that he was only flipping off the media , but he was really flipping off every unemployed person in America .
Here is the video courtesy of ABC News :

Here is how Karl described Bunning ’s behavior before the cameras got to him , “ Senator Bunning was even more expressive before the cameras arrived , using a little sign language .
When Senate producer Z. Byron Wolf spotted Bunning exiting his office , Bunning said , “ I ’m not talking to anybody . ”
When Wolf asked him to stay and talk to our cameras , Bunning walked toward the elevator and shot the middle finger over his head . ”
If Sen .
Bunning has nothing to hide , then why is he dodging the media ?
If Bunning is proud of his filibuster should n’t be in front of the camera ’s talking about it , instead of running away , and making obscene gestures ?
Bunning should be ashamed not only of his behavior today , which is no way for a sitting senator to conduct themselves , but also for his one man filibuster .
I ca n’t recall when I have even seen such a cynical and cold political gambit that is designed to inflict pain on the very citizens that Bunning is supposed to be representing .
He has no sound reason for blocking the unemployment benefits extension .
His sole motive is to make sure that nothing gets out of the senate that could improve the electoral climate for November .
The message here is damn the people , we have an election to win .
ancient Greek Cynic philosopher from Sinope
Diogenes ( dy - OJ - in-eez ; Ancient Greek : Διογένης , romanized : Diogénēs [ di.oɡénɛ͜ɛs ] ) , also known as Diogenes the Cynic ( Διογένη ς ὁ Κυνικ ός , Diogénēs ho Kynikós ) , was a Greek philosopher and one of the founders of Cynic philosophy .
He was born in Sinope , an Ionian colony on the Black Sea coast of modern day Turkey , [ 1 ] in 412 or 404 BC and died at Corinth in 323 BC . [ 2 ]
Diogenes was a controversial figure .
His father minted coins for a living , and Diogenes was banished from Sinope when he took to debasement of currency .
[ 1 ]
After being exiled , he moved to Athens and criticized many cultural conventions of the city .
He modelled himself on the example of Heracles , and believed that virtue was better revealed in action than in theory .
He used his simple lifestyle and behaviour to criticize the social values and institutions of what he saw as a corrupt , confused society .
He had a reputation for sleeping and eating wherever he chose in a highly non-traditional fashion , and took to toughening himself against nature .
He declared himself a cosmopolitan and a citizen of the world rather than claiming allegiance to just one place .
There are many tales about his dogging Antisthenes ' footsteps and becoming his " faithful hound " . [ 3 ]
Diogenes made a virtue of poverty .
He begged for a living and often slept in a large ceramic jar , or pithos , in the marketplace . [ 4 ]
He became notorious for his philosophical stunts , such as carrying a lamp during the day , claiming to be looking for an honest man .
He criticized Plato , disputed his interpretation of Socrates , and sabotaged his lectures , sometimes distracting listeners by bringing food and eating during the discussions .
Diogenes was also noted for having mocked Alexander the Great , both in public and to his face when he visited Corinth in 336 BC . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Diogenes was captured by pirates and sold into slavery , eventually settling in Corinth .
There he passed his philosophy of Cynicism to Crates , who taught it to Zeno of Citium , who fashioned it into the school of Stoicism , one of the most enduring schools of Greek philosophy .
No writings of Diogenes survive but there are some details of his life from anecdotes ( chreia ) , especially from Diogenes Laërtius ' book Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers and some other sources . [ 8 ]
Life [ edit ]
Nothing is known about Diogenes ' early life except that his father , Hicesias , was a banker . [ 9 ]
It seems likely that Diogenes was also enrolled into the banking business aiding his father .
At some point ( the exact date is unknown ) , Hicesias and Diogenes became involved in a scandal involving the adulteration or debasement of the currency , [ 10 ] and Diogenes was exiled from the city and lost his citizenship and all his material possessions . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
This aspect of the story seems to be corroborated by archaeology : large numbers of defaced coins ( smashed with a large chisel stamp ) have been discovered at Sinope dating from the middle of the 4th century BC , and other coins of the time bear the name of Hicesias as the official who minted them . [ 13 ]
During this time there was much counterfeit money circulating in Sinope . [ 11 ]
The coins were deliberately defaced in order to render them worthless as legal tender . [ 11 ]
Sinope was being disputed between pro-Persian and pro-Greek factions in the 4th century , and there may have been political rather than financial motives behind the act .
In Athens [ edit ]
According to one story , [ 12 ]
Diogenes went to the Oracle at Delphi to ask for her advice and was told that he should " deface the currency " .
Following the debacle in Sinope , Diogenes decided that the oracle meant that he should deface the political currency rather than actual coins .
He traveled to Athens and made it his life 's goal to challenge established customs and values .
He argued that instead of being troubled about the true nature of evil , people merely rely on customary interpretations .
This distinction between nature ( " physis " ) and custom ( " nomos " ) is a favourite theme of ancient Greek philosophy , and one that Plato takes up in The Republic , in the legend of the Ring of Gyges . [ 14 ]
Diogenes arrived in Athens with a slave named Manes who escaped from him shortly thereafter .
With characteristic humor , Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying , " If Manes can live without Diogenes , why not Diogenes without Manes ? " [ 15 ]
Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency .
He found the figure of a master who could do nothing for himself contemptibly helpless .
He was attracted by the ascetic teaching of Antisthenes , a student of Socrates .
When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him , Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly " eventually beat him off with his staff " .
[ 1 ]
Diogenes responds , " Strike , for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you , so long as I think you 've something to say . " [ 1 ]
Diogenes became Antisthenes ' pupil , despite the brutality with which he was initially received . [ 16 ]
Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] but he surpassed his master in both reputation and the austerity of his life .
He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors .
This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly , pretence , vanity , self - deception , and artificiality of human conduct .
The stories told of Diogenes illustrate the logical consistency of his character .
He inured himself to the weather by living in a clay wine jar [ 4 ] [ 20 ] belonging to the temple of Cybele . [ 21 ]
He destroyed the single wooden bowl he possessed on seeing a peasant boy drink from the hollow of his hands .
He then exclaimed : " Fool that I am , to have been carrying superfluous baggage all this time ! " [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
It was contrary to Athenian customs to eat within the marketplace , and still he would eat there , for , as he explained when rebuked , it was during the time he was in the marketplace that he felt hungry .
He used to stroll about in full daylight with a lamp ; when asked what he was doing , he would answer , " I am just looking for an honest man . " [ 24 ]
Diogenes looked for a human being but reputedly found nothing but rascals and scoundrels . [ 25 ]
According to Diogenes Laërtius , when Plato gave the tongue - in - cheek [ 26 ] definition of man as " featherless bipeds , " Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato 's Academy , saying , " Behold !
I 've brought you a man , " and so the Academy added " with broad flat nails " to the definition . [ 27 ]
In Corinth [ edit ]
According to a story which seems to have originated with Menippus of Gadara , [ 28 ]
Diogenes was captured by pirates while on voyage to Aegina and sold as a slave in Crete to a Corinthian named Xeniades .
Being asked his trade , he replied that he knew no trade but that of governing men , and that he wished to be sold to a man who needed a master .
Xeniades liked his spirit and hired Diogenes to tutor his children .
As tutor to Xeniades 's two sons , [ 29 ] it is said that he lived in Corinth for the rest of his life , which he devoted to preaching the doctrines of virtuous self - control .
There are many stories about what actually happened to him after his time with Xeniades 's two sons .
There are stories stating he was set free after he became " a cherished member of the household " , while one says he was set free almost immediately , and still another states that " he grew old and died at Xeniades 's house in Corinth . " [ 30 ]
He is even said to have lectured to large audiences at the Isthmian Games . [ 31 ]
Although most of the stories about his living in a jar [ 4 ] are located in Athens , there are some accounts of his living in a jar near the Craneum gymnasium in Corinth :
A report that Philip was marching on the town had thrown all Corinth into a bustle ; one was furbishing his arms , another wheeling stones , a third patching the wall , a fourth strengthening a battlement , every one making himself useful somehow or other .
Diogenes having nothing to do — of course no one thought of giving him a job — was moved by the sight to gather up his philosopher 's cloak and begin rolling his tub - dwelling energetically up and down the Craneum ; an acquaintance asked , and got , the explanation : " I do not want to be thought the only idler in such a busy multitude ; I am rolling my tub to be like the rest . " [ 32 ]
Diogenes and Alexander [ edit ]
Alexander the Great Visits Diogenes at Corinth by W. Matthews ( 1914 ) by W. Matthews ( 1914 )
It was in Corinth that a meeting between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is supposed to have taken place . [ 33 ]
These stories may be apocryphal .
The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius recount that they exchanged only a few words : while Diogenes was relaxing in the morning sunlight , Alexander , thrilled to meet the famous philosopher , asked if there was any favour he might do for him .
Diogenes replied , " Yes , stand out of my sunlight . "
Alexander then declared , " If I were not Alexander , then I should wish to be Diogenes . "
" If I were not Diogenes , I would still wish to be Diogenes , " Diogenes replied . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
In another account of the conversation , Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones .
Diogenes explained , " I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave . " [ 34 ]
Death [ edit ]
There are conflicting accounts of Diogenes ' death .
His contemporaries alleged he had held his breath until he expired ; although other accounts of his death say he had become ill from eating raw octopus ; [ 35 ] or to have suffered an infected dog bite . [ 36 ]
When asked how he wished to be buried , he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body .
When asked if he minded this , he said , " Not at all , as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away ! "
When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness , he replied : " If I lack awareness , then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead ? " [ 37 ]
In the end , Diogenes made fun of people 's excessive concern with the " proper " treatment of the dead .
The Corinthians erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble . [ 38 ]
Philosophy [ edit ]
Cynicism [ edit ]
Along with Antisthenes and Crates of Thebes , Diogenes is considered one of the founders of Cynicism .
The ideas of Diogenes , like those of most other Cynics , must be arrived at indirectly .
No writings of Diogenes survive even though he is reported to have authored over ten books , a volume of letters and seven tragedies . [ 39 ]
Cynic ideas are inseparable from Cynic practice ; therefore what we know about Diogenes is contained in anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources .
Diogenes maintained that all the artificial growths of society were incompatible with happiness and that morality implies a return to the simplicity of nature .
So great was his austerity and simplicity that the Stoics would later claim him to be a wise man or " sophos " .
In his words , " Humans have complicated every simple gift of the gods . " [ 40 ]
Although Socrates had previously identified himself as belonging to the world , rather than a city , [ 41 ]
Diogenes is credited with the first known use of the word " cosmopolitan " .
When he was asked from where he came , he replied , " I am a citizen of the world ( cosmopolites ) " . [ 42 ]
This was a radical claim in a world where a man 's identity was intimately tied to his citizenship of a particular city - state .
An exile and an outcast , a man with no social identity , Diogenes made a mark on his contemporaries .
Diogenes had nothing but disdain for Plato and his abstract philosophy . [ 43 ]
Diogenes viewed Antisthenes as the true heir to Socrates , and shared his love of virtue and indifference to wealth , [ 44 ] together with a disdain for general opinion . [ 45 ]
Diogenes shared Socrates 's belief that he could function as doctor to men's souls and improve them morally , while at the same time holding contempt for their obtuseness .
Plato once described Diogenes as " a Socrates gone mad . " [ 46 ]
Obscenity [ edit ]
Diogenes taught by living example .
He tried to demonstrate that wisdom and happiness belong to the man who is independent of society and that civilization is regressive .
He scorned not only family and socio-political organization , but also property rights and reputation .
He even rejected normal ideas about human decency .
Diogenes is said to have eaten in the marketplace , [ 47 ] urinated on some people who insulted him , [ 48 ] defecated in the theatre , [ 49 ] and masturbated in public .
When asked about his eating in public he said , " If taking breakfast is nothing out of place , then it is nothing out of place in the marketplace .
But taking breakfast is nothing out of place , therefore it is nothing out of place to take breakfast in the marketplace . " [ 50 ]
On the indecency of his masturbating in public he would say , " If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly . " [ 50 ] [ 51 ]
Diogenes as dogged or dog - like [ edit ]
Many anecdotes of Diogenes refer to his dog - like behavior , and his praise of a dog 's virtues .
It is not known whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet " doggish " and made a virtue of it , or whether he first took up the dog theme himself .
When asked why he was called a dog he replied , " I fawn on those who give me anything , I yelp at those who refuse , and I set my teeth in rascals . " [ 20 ]
Diogenes believed human beings live artificially and hypocritically and would do well to study the dog .
Besides performing natural body functions in public with ease , a dog will eat anything , and make no fuss about where to sleep .
Dogs live in the present without anxiety , and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy .
In addition to these virtues , dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe . [ 52 ]
Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped , dogs will give an honest bark at the truth .
Diogenes stated that " other dogs bite their enemies , I bite my friends to save them . " [ 53 ]
The term " cynic " itself derives from the Greek word κυνικός , kynikos , " dog - like " and that from κύων , kyôn , " dog " ( genitive : kynos ) . [ 54 ]
One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called dogs was that Antisthenes taught in the Cynosarges gymnasium at Athens . [ 55 ]
The word Cynosarges means the place of the white dog .
Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage , as a later commentator explained :
There are four reasons why the Cynics are so named .
First because of the indifference of their way of life , for they make a cult of indifference and , like dogs , eat and make love in public , go barefoot , and sleep in tubs and at crossroads .
The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal , and they make a cult of shamelessness , not as being beneath modesty , but as superior to it .
The third reason is that the dog is a good guard , and they guard the tenets of their philosophy .
The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies .
So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy , and receive them kindly , while those unfitted they drive away , like dogs , by barking at them . [ 56 ]
As noted ( see Death ) , Diogenes ' association with dogs was memorialized by the Corinthians , who erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of Parian marble . [ 38 ]
Contemporary theory [ edit ]
Diogenes is discussed in a 1983 book by German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk ( English language publication in 1987 ) .
In Sloterdijk 's Critique of Cynical Reason , Diogenes is used as an example of Sloterdijk 's idea of the " kynical " – in which personal degradation is used for purposes of community comment or censure .
Calling the practice of this tactic " kynismos " , Sloterdijk theorizes that the kynical actor actually embodies the message he is trying to convey and that the kynical actor 's goal is typically a false regression that mocks authority – especially authority that the kynical actor considers corrupt , suspect or unworthy . [ 57 ]
There is another discussion of Diogenes and the Cynics in Michel Foucault 's book Fearless Speech .
Here Foucault discusses Diogenes ' antics in relation to the speaking of truth ( parrhesia ) in the ancient world .
Foucault expands this reading in his last course at the Collège de France , The Courage of Truth .
In this course Foucault tries to establish an alternative conception of militancy and revolution through a reading of Diogenes and Cynicism . [ 58 ]
Diogenes syndrome [ edit ]
Diogenes ' name has been applied to a behavioural disorder characterised by apparently involuntary self - neglect and hoarding . [ 59 ]
The disorder afflicts the elderly and is quite inappropriately named , as Diogenes deliberately rejected common standards of material comfort , and was anything but a hoarder . [ 60 ]
Depictions [ edit ]
Art [ edit ]
Both in ancient and in modern times , Diogenes ' personality has appealed strongly to sculptors and to painters .
Ancient busts exist in the museums of the Vatican , the Louvre , and the Capitol .
The interview between Diogenes and Alexander is represented in an ancient marble bas -relief found in the Villa Albani .
Among artists who have painted the famous encounter of Diogenes with Alexander , there are works by de Crayer , de Vos , Assereto , Langetti , Sevin , Sebastiano Ricci , Gandolfi , Johann Christian Thomas Wink [ de ] , Abildgaard , Monsiau , Martin , and Daumier .
The famous story of Diogenes searching for an " honest man " has been depicted by Jordaens , van Everdingen , van der Werff , Pannini , Steen and Corinth .
Others who have painted him with his famous lantern include de Ribera , Castiglione , Petrini , Gérôme , Bastien - Lepage , and Waterhouse .
The scene in which Diogenes discards his cup has been painted by Poussin , Rosa , and Martin ; and the story of Diogenes begging from a statue has been depicted by Restout .
In Raphael 's fresco The School of Athens , a lone reclining figure in the foreground represents Diogenes . [ 61 ]
Diogenes has also been the subject of sculptures , with famous bas - relief images by Puget and Pajou .
Comics [ edit ]
In The Adventures of Nero album Het Zeespook ( 1948 ) Nero meets a character who claims to be Diogenes .
Two scenes in the comic depict famous anecdotes of Diogenes ' life , namely the moment when he was looking for a human and the moment when he asked Alexander to get out of his sun .
He is also portrayed living in a barrel . [ 62 ]
In the Suske en Wiske album De Mottenvanger Suske and Wiske travel back to ancient Greece , where they meet Diogenes . [ 63 ]
Literature [ edit ]
A 17th century depiction of Diogenes
Diogenes is referred to in Anton Chekhov 's story " Ward No. 6 " ; William Blake 's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell ; François Rabelais ' Gargantua and Pantagruel ; Goethe 's poem Genialisch Treiben ; Denis Diderot 's philosophical novella Rameau 's Nephew ; as well as in the first sentence of Søren Kierkegaard 's novelistic treatise Repetition .
The story of Diogenes and the lamp is referenced by the character Foma Fomitch in Fyodor Dostoevsky 's " The Friend of the Family " as well as " The Idiot " .
In Cervantes ' short story " The Man of Glass " ( " El licenciado Vidriera " ) , part of the Novelas Ejemplares collection , the ( anti - ) hero unaccountably begins to channel Diogenes in a string of tart chreiai once he becomes convinced that he is made of glass .
Diogenes gives his own life and opinions in Christoph Martin Wieland 's novel Socrates Mainomenos ( 1770 ; English translation Socrates Out of His Senses , 1771 ) .
Diogenes is the primary model for the philosopher Didactylos in Terry Pratchett 's Small Gods .
He is mimicked by a beggar - spy in Jacqueline Carey 's Kushiel 's Scion and paid tribute to with a costume in a party by the main character in its sequel , Kushiel 's Justice .
The character Lucy Snowe in Charlotte Brontë 's novel Villette is given the nickname Diogenes .
Diogenes also features in Part Four of Elizabeth Smart 's By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept .
He is a figure in Seamus Heaney 's The Haw Lantern .
In Christopher Moore 's Lamb : The Gospel According to Biff , Christ 's Childhood Pal , one of Jesus ' apostles is a devotee of Diogenes , complete with his own pack of dogs which he refers to as his own disciples .
His story opens the first chapter of Dolly Freed 's 1978 book Possum Living . [ 64 ]
The dog that Paul Dombey befriends in Charles Dickens ' Dombey and Son is called Diogenes .
Alexander 's meeting with Diogenes is portrayed in Valerio Manfredi's ( Alexander Trilogy ) " The Ends of the Earth " . [ 65 ]
William S. Burroughs has been described as " Diogenes with a knife and gun . " [ 66 ]
The many allusions to dogs in Shakespeare 's Timon of Athens are references to the school of Cynicism that could be interpreted as suggesting a parallel between the misanthropic hermit , Timon , and Diogenes ; but Shakespeare would have had access to Michel de Montaigne 's essay , " Of Democritus and Heraclitus " , which emphasised their differences : Timon actively wishes men ill and shuns them as dangerous , whereas Diogenes esteems them so little that contact with them could not disturb him . [ 67 ] " Timonism " is in fact often contrasted with " Cynicism " : " Cynics saw what people could be and were angered by what they had become ; Timonists felt humans were hopelessly stupid & uncaring by nature and so saw no hope for change . " [ 68 ]
The philosopher 's name was adopted by the fictional Diogenes Club , an organization that Sherlock Holmes ' brother Mycroft Holmes belongs to in the story " The Greek Interpreter " by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle .
It is called such as its members are educated , yet untalkative and have a dislike of socialising , much like the philosopher himself [ citation needed ] .
The group is the focus of a number of Holmes pastiches by Kim Newman .
In the Rodgers and Hart musical The Boys From Syracuse ( 1938 ) , the song Oh Diogenes ! — which extols the philosopher 's virtues — contains the lyrics " there was an old zany / who lived in a tub ; / he had so many flea - bites / he did n't know where to rub . "

Bernie Madoff had his nose broken by another inmate in December , Dionne Searcy and Amir Efrati of the WSJ report , citing three people familiar with what happened .
The Bureau of Prisons denies the incident , as does Madoff ( who presumably does n't want to get beaten up again for being a snitch ) .
Mr. Madoff was treated for a broken nose , fractured ribs and cuts to his head and face , according to a felon currently at Butner serving time on drug charges who was familiar with his condition at the time .
The details of the injuries could n't be independently verified ...
The former inmate said the dispute centered on money the assailant thought he was owed by Mr. Madoff .
Separately , Madoff is said to give ( good ) investment advice in the prison library * and hang out with a 56 year old pharmacist from Wappingers Falls named John Mancini who is in jail for distributing 5 million tablets of the painkiller hydrocodone .

Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch claims that the company 's ubiquitous Flash plug - in does n't ship with any known crash bugs .
One can only assume that he has never used the software .
As Adobe representatives exhibit an increasingly dismissive attitude about Flash 's technical deficiencies , the browser vendors have stepped up to address the problems and are finding ways to insulate their users from Flash 's poor security and lack of stability .
Several mainstream browsers isolate Flash and other plug-ins in separate processes in order to prevent an unstable plug - in from crashing the entire browser .
Mozilla is preparing to introduce a similar feature in the next version of Firefox .
A developer preview that was recently made available to users offers an early look at the new plugin crash protection .
It 's part of a broader Mozilla project called Electrolysis that seeks to eventually bring full support for multiprocess browsing to Firefox .
Electrolysis will make it possible for a browser crash to be isolated to a tab or group of tabs rather than affecting the entire browser .
Similar functionality is already available in Internet Explorer and Chrome .
Although Mozilla has already taken major steps towards implementing holistic multiprocess browsing , the plugin isolation is the only part that will land in the next release .
As we explained last year when we first covered Electrolysis , Mozilla has adopted parts of Chrome 's interprocess - communication ( IPC ) implementation .
In the latest developer preview build , it is used to facilitate interaction between the isolated plugins and the rest of the browser .
Mozilla created its own protocol , called IPDL , that is used to define the messages that are passed between the processes through the IPC layer .
For more details about IPDL , you can refer to the introductory tutorial that has been published at the Mozilla developer website .
In the developer preview , a plug - in that crashes will be replaced with a warning message .
It will automatically transmit a crash report to Mozilla .
You can resurrect the crashed plug - in by reloading the page .
In the current implementation , each plug - in operates in its own process that runs separately from the rest of the browser .
For example , when you load up pages that have Flash and Silverlight content , Flash and Silverlight will each have their own process .
Individual plug - in instances are not isolated from each other .
A crashed Flash instance in the Firefox developer preview
As a result of this design , a single crashed plug - in instance will cause all other instances of the same plug - in to terminate , but will not affect content that is rendered by other plug-ins .
A Flash crash will not affect running Silverlight content , and vice versa .
For example , if I have a Silverlight demo in my first tab , a Flash video of the Internet 's latest fad in my second tab , and I load Matthew Dempsky 's Flash Crash demo in a third tab , both instances of the Flash plug - in will terminate but the Silverlight demo will continue running .
The trololo man 's magnificent song of ineffable wordless joy will be brutally silenced by Flash 's ignominious inadequacy .
Oh the humanity !
In soviet Russia , Flash trolololos you
Mozilla is looking for users to help test the new feature and make sure that it works reliably .

Adam Kennedy 's recent post on threads in Padre reminded me to post about an experiment of mine .
Last year I learned some Erlang .
I really liked their model of multi- threading : many threads that share no data at all and communicate through message queues .
A lot of other things where really annoying though , specially their crappy support for strings and lack of libraries in general .
I kept thinking I want perl with these threads , so I started implementing it .
And thus threads : : lite was born .
The main difference between threads : : lite and threads .pm is that t::l starts an entirely new interpreter instead of cloning the existing one .
If you 've loaded a lot of modules , that can be significantly quicker and leaner than cloning .
As an optimization , it supports cloning itself right after module loading , so you can quickly start a large number of identical threads .
Threads can be monitored , so that on thread death their send an exit code to their listeners .
Every thread has it's own message queue .
Every thread can send messages to any thread whose thread - id it knows .
Any kind of data that can be serialized using Storable can be send , including coderefs .
Receiving messages is done on basis of pattern matching ( based on smart matching ) .
This can range from a simple null - pattern ( matches anything , so returns the front message on the queue ) to complex tables of patterns .
I 've started building some high level abstractions on top of it , most notably a implementation of a parallel map and grep .
I 'd like to do a map - reduce , but that 's for a later stage .
This is very much an experimental module .
I 'm still not sure perl is really suitable for true erlang style threading : I suspect perl interpreters are to heavy to have a 100000 of them in one process , but it would be interesting to try
A popular slogan of the Italian Fascists under Mussolini was , “ Tutto nello Stato , niente al di fuori dello Stato , nulla contro lo Stato ” ( everything for the state , nothing outside the state , nothing against the state ) .
I recall this expression frequently as I observe the state ’s far - reaching penetration of my own society .
What of any consequence remains beyond the state ’s reach in the United States today ?
Not wages , working conditions , or labor - management relations ; not health care ; not money , banking , or financial services ; not personal privacy ; not transportation or communication ; not education or scientific research ; not farming or food supply ; not nutrition or food quality ; not marriage or divorce ; not child care ; not provision for retirement ; not recreation ; not insurance of any kind ; not smoking or drinking ; not gambling ; not political campaign funding or publicity ; not real estate development , house construction , or housing finance ; not international travel , trade , or finance ; not a thousand other areas and aspects of social life .
One might affirm that the state still keeps its hands off religion , but it actually does not .
It certifies certain religious organizations as legitimate and condemns others , as many young men discovered to their sorrow when they attempted to claim the status of conscientious objector during the Vietnam War .
It assigns members of certain religions , but not members of others , as chaplains in its armed services .
Besides , is n’t statism itself a religion for most Americans ?
Do they not honor the state above all else , above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace ?
If their religion tells them “ thou shalt not murder , ” but the state orders them to murder , then they murder .
If the state tells them to rob , to destroy property , and to imprison innocent people , then , notwithstanding any religious strictures , they rob , destroy property , and imprison innocent people , as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so - called Drug War in this country will attest .
Moreover , in every form of adversity , Americans look to the state for their personal salvation , just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence .
When the state produces unworkable or unsatisfactory conditions in any area of life , and therefore elicits complaints and protests , as it has for example in every area related to health care , it responds to these complaints and protests by making “ reforms ” that heap new laws , regulations , and government bureaus atop the existing mountain of counterproductive interventions .
Thus , each new “ reform ” makes the government more monstrous and destructive than it was before .
Citizen , be careful what you wish for ; the government just might give it to you good and hard .
The areas of life that remain outside the government ’s participation , taxation , subsidization , regulation , surveillance , and other intrusion or control have become so few and so trivial that they scarcely merit mention .
We verge ever closer upon the condition in which everything that is not prohibited is required .
Yet , the average American will declare loudly that he is a free man and that his country is the freest in the world .
Thus , in a country where more and more is for the state , where virtually nothing is outside the State , and where , aside from pointless complaints , nothing against the State is permitted , Americans have become ideal fascist citizens .
Like the average German during the years that Hitler ruled Germany , most Americans today , inhabiting one of the most pervasively controlled countries in the history of the world , think they are free .

Crabs and other scavengers put nutrients back into the marine ecosystem
There is a recent and rather macabre addition to the marine biologist 's toolkit .
Scientists in Canada are using the bodies of dead pigs , diverted from the butcher 's shop , in their undersea laboratory .
By ending up in ocean experiments ( rather than on the dinner table ) , the pigs have provided scientists with some intriguing new data .
" The dead pigs were not my idea , " says Dr Verena Tunnicliffe , professor of marine biology at the University of Victoria in Canada .
She explained that she and her colleagues were " piggybacking " on forensics research in order to study low - oxygen zones , sometimes known as " dead zones " , in the ocean .
A lot of people [ when they die ] end up in the ocean - either accidentally or through foul play
Professor Vernea Tunnicliffe , University of Victoria
The pigs are used by forensics researchers because - strange as it might seem - we humans are remarkably pig - like in our anatomy .
We share their relatively hairless skin , are similar in size , and our flesh has a similar make - up .
And these things are important when you are trying to find out what happens to a human body if it ends up in the ocean .
Because another unpleasant reality is that many bodies - particularly in a coastal area like British Columbia - are discovered there .
" The ocean is a big place and there are a lot of people who work at sea and a lot of people who live on the coast .
As a result , a lot of people [ when they die ] end up in the ocean , " says Professor Tunnicliffe .
" Either accidentally or through foul play .
" If you need to know how long it 's been since death , if you 're looking at the remains and there are marks on them , you need to find out - how did those marks come about ? "
Looking at what happens to the pigs enables forensics researchers to better understand those processes .
Deep sea pigs
This grisly research gave Professor Tunnicliffe the opportunity to study seafloor scavengers .
" This big hunk of meat on the seafloor represented a good food source for these marine creatures , " she says .
" Scavengers are very important in the world .
They 're what allow things to restore . "
So she and her team used the pigs to investigate the increasing problem of oxygen depletion in coastal areas .
Low - oxygen ( hypoxic ) zones are caused by the nutrient - rich run-off from agricultural land .
This feeds algae in the ocean .
When this algae dies , sinks and decomposes , it consumes most of the vital oxygen supply in the water .
At its worst , this can lead to a dead zone - an area of seafloor that is so low in oxygen that all of the marine animals either die or , if they can survive the move , are forced into habitats in shallower water .
The scavengers know something 's there and they arrive almost immediately and set up residence
Professor Verena Tunnicliffe
One dramatic example is the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico .
Here , nutrient - laden water runs out into the Gulf from the Mississippi River causing one of the world 's largest dead zones .
The zone , which is continually contracting and expanding , has been estimated to average approximately 16,000 sq km .
Almost nothing , apart from bacteria , can live there .
So Professor Tunnicliffe and her team set out to find out " how low marine scavengers would go " , in terms of oxygen , for a free lunch .
They placed three pigs into very oxygen - poor zones in the Saanich Inlet , which is off the coast British Columbia .
Each pig was lowered with a camera and oxygen - measuring equipment .
Scientists could operate the cameras from shore thanks to an experimental undersea observatory called Venus ( The Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea ) .

Advertisement " We could put the pigs down and observe the scavengers as they arrived , " explains Professor Tunnicliffe .
" On day one , we lowered the pig , " she says .
" By day two , we 've had crabs and shrimp , then octopus .
Then sea stars arrive .
" They 've had to travel across the bottom .
They know something 's there and they arrive almost immediately and stay there . "
At levels down to almost 7 % oxygen in the water - well below what scientists predicted would be tolerable - the animals still coped .
" They know something 's there " " The oxygen levels are well into what the chemists tell us would cause severe hypoxia ( oxygen shortage in the animals ' bodies ) .
" Yet they stay there day after day - the same individuals .
They take up residence . "
All of these marine animals need oxygen in their blood .
Ideally , they want 100 % of their blood cells to be loaded with life - giving oxygen to feed their organs .
" When the outside water only has 7 % oxygen , and you want 100 % in your blood , you have to pump that oxygen against a tremendous gradient - that 's pretty tough and that 's what these crabs have to do , " says Professor Tunnicliffe .
But there were limits to their tolerance .
" The third pig we put down there - for three months nothing touched it , " said Professor Tunnicliffe .
The oxygen there was below that severe level , so even these hardy scavengers had reached their limit .
" That means nothing 's getting recycled on the seafloor .
It 's just stuff lying there waiting for bacteria to do a very slow decomposition , " says Professor Tunnicliffe .
" These scavengers get the carbon cycle back .
We have to get the nutrients back in the system and start this restoration process . "
She says that this provides insight into how marine ecosystems can recover from hypoxia - and that it gives scientists some hope .
" Think of a dead zone that 's killed off a whole bunch of animals , " the professor explains .
" The dead zones occurring off the west cost of America are coming up from below - pushing the animals up [ from the seafloor ] .
" If some of these animals can survive , with a little bit of oxygen coming in , perhaps they can get down there and start that clean - up .
There 's lots of food down there now . "
Pig vs shark
This combination of the pigs along with the Venus observatory , which is operated via a fibreoptic cable on the seafloor , has allowed researchers to record footage of much more elusive creatures in the suffocating depths .
Dr Richard Dewey , also from the University of Victoria , and one of the researchers leading the Venus project explains : " We install a node - or an internet hub - into which we can plug in instruments , " explains Dr Dewey .
" This gives us high bandwidth access to all the instruments .
" We pan and tilt , zoom and focus on the subject - all from a remote point on the shore . "
He says the pigs have been down " in relatively deep water for these coastal environments " - 100 m to 300 m .

Advertisement " Even at those depths we 've seen seals swimming across the film .
" And in the most recent experiment in February , we put down a pig at 300 m in the Strait of Georgia ; and we saw six - gill sharks having a feast on the carcass . "
Dr Dewey explains that there is very little data about six - gill sharks , partly because they live in deeper waters than their more famous cousins , the white sharks .
" We now have footage of them working together , " he says .
" And they arrived at the carcass within 12 hours .
" We have evidence of four or five that are maybe eight feet ( 2.4 m ) in size . "
Some of the footage may be gruesome , but it continues to unveil the lives of these ecosystems .

STOCKHOLM - A gas company building an underwater pipeline in the Baltic Sea has found a dozen centuries - old shipwrecks - some of them unusually well preserved .
The oldest wreck probably dates to medieval times and could be up to 800 years old , while the others may be from the 17th to 19th centuries , Peter Norman of Sweden ’s National Heritage Board said yesterday .
“ They could be interesting , but we have only seen pictures of their exterior .
Many of them are considered to be fully intact .
They look very well preserved , ’’ Norman said .
Thousands of wrecks - from medieval ships to warships sunk during the world wars of the 20th century - have been found in the Baltic Sea , which does n’t have the ship worm that destroys wooden wrecks in saltier oceans .
The latest discovery was made during a search east of the Swedish island of Gotland by the Nord Stream consortium , which is building a 750 - mile pipeline between Russia and Germany .
The 12 wrecks were found in a 30 - mile - long , 1.2 - mile - wide corridor , according to a Nord Stream spokeswoman .
The Heritage Board said three have intact hulls and are upside down at a depth of 430 feet .
It ’s unclear whether any of them will be salvaged , but the board said it hopes divers will explore them ..

Gran Turismo fans were gutted when Sony delayed the release of the fifth installment of the game a few months ago .
One of the reasons behind the delay could have been releasing two of the most highly anticipated exclusives , GOW III and GT5 , in the same quarter .
Well , the release of God of War III is only days away and along with Kratos you will also be treated to the GT5 Night Racing trailer which is included in the disc .
Sony has released the trailer before the release of God of War III and it shows why GT5 has a $ 60 million budget : Trailer in 1080 p HD
A Navy captain turned the Pacific into the world ’s strangest drag strip — ordering two warships to stage a bizarre race that one sailor said nearly ended in tragedy , a high - ranking military official told The Post yesterday .
“ Multiple witnesses interviewed by the [ inspector general ] and the commanding officers of both ships all stated that the ships were racing , ” said Pacific Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Jeff Davis .
Capt .
Holly Graf of the 10,000 - ton guided missile cruiser Cowpens , the senior officer at the scene , was forced to walk the plank after her high - seas hot - rodding .
She was relieved of command after the incident , one of the strangest in naval history .
One sailor who was aboard the Cowpens on Feb. 12 , 2009 , told the Web site militarycorruption.com , which first reported the incident , that both the cruiser and the 8,200 - ton destroyer John McCain were plowing through the waves at “ full throttle . ”
The McCain is named for Sen. John McCain ’s father and grandfather , both admirals .
“ At one point we nearly hit the McCain ’s fantail when the ships came within 300 feet , ” the shaken sailor , whose name was withheld , told the Web site .
“ I held my breath and prayed to God we would n’t collide because many sailors could have been killed and at least one Navy warship sunk at sea . ”
The sailor said the Cowpens ’ bridge crew was about to sound a collision alarm at one point , but Graf ordered them not to .
It was not clear how fast the ships had been going , but both have maximum speeds of more than 30 knots — about 35 mph .
The race was investigated late last year , along with allegations that Graf bullied her crew .
“ What is unsubstantiated is the allegation that [ the race ] constituted . . . improperly hazarding a vessel , ” Davis said .
But Graf , the first woman ever to command a guided - missile cruiser , was separately found guilty of “ cruelty and maltreatment ” of her crew and conduct unbecoming an officer .
She was issued a “ punitive letter of reprimand ” on Jan. 13 by Rear Adm.
Kevin Donegan , commander of Carrier Strike Group Five .
Graf was due for a normal transfer within the month , but Donegan ordered her to be replaced immediately .

B. , a loyal MR reader , asks me the following ( and he also manages to send me a paragraph which for whatever reason wo n't indent properly ) :
" I 've been struggling with an economics issue lately that I think is universal : How much do I value my free time ?
I usually estimate it at about $ 50 or so per hour , but what happens to that as I have less and less of it due to work ?
And by how much should my salary increase for this corresponding decrease in the amount of time I have to enjoy that time ?
I 've taken a crude stab at answering this on my blog ( http://meanderingwoods.blogspot.com/2009/06/how-much-is-free-time-worth.html) but I 'm no economist – actually I 'm a psychologist by study and a risk consultant by trade .
I would imagine that there is some literature on this but I was unable to locate much through Google .
I would appreciate it if you could point me toward something or maybe bleg about it . "
As usual , the correct answer is " it depends , " but here are a few principles :
1 . Do n't value your time by your implicit wage rate , no matter what your Econ 101 text says .
For most jobs you are assigned some lumpy tasks and you do n't control your work hours at the margin as much as you might like to .
The key question is whether the overall pattern of your time is an enjoyable one and marginal calculations are n't always a good way to make that estimation .
2 . Ask the simple question : at what valuation of my time will I maximize the amount I look forward to each day , defined over the next five years ?
If your next five years are not so tolerable , reexamine what you are doing and that includes revaluing your time .
For instance you might be an irrational workaholic or a lazy bum .
3 . Look to the economics literature on " golden rule " and " steady - state " path comparisons to address this problem .
If need be utter the word " Flow " and try to remember how to spell that guy 's name so you can google it .
4 . What do you want time for anyway ?
When is your time ever " free " ?
If you choose to work more for money , is n't that time " free " too ?
Only if your job is a total drudge should you frame the choice this way .
5 . Focus on defining the experiences you value most , and how to get more of those experiences , and wise money / time choices will flow from that approach .
Readers , do you have better … dare I call it …advice ?

Perhaps selling out major venues from coast to coast by word of mouth , or playing festivals from Lollapalooza to Red Rocks is a sign that your electro - freak mashup outfit is doing well , but probably not as much as being endorsed by the Queen of avant electro herself ; Bjork was spotted at one of their recent shows at The Roxy in Los Angeles .
Making their SXSW debut , The Glitch Mob are set to play 3 Austin events before heading over to key slots at this year ’s Coachella and Winter Music Conference gatherings .
And this May , they embark on their first full nationwide tour in support of The Glitch Mob ’s debut album release Drink the Sea ( due May 25 on the band ’s own Glass Air label ) .
Following years of triumphant official remixes for the likes of TV On The Radio and Ed Banger —
The Glitch Mob and its members even held the top two spots on XLR8 R ’s “ 50 Best MP3s of 2008 ” over the likes of Hercules and Love Affair and the Kills — and solo releases on tastemaker labels like Planet Mu , Drink The Sea represents a musical sea change for the band .
Across the album , the trio of producer / instrumentalists Justin Boreta , Ed Ma , and Josh Mayer artfully craft new , futuristic sounds that take influence from numerous genres , but land in none .

Themis Trading 's Joe Saluzzi once again points out the flaws in the all clear psychology , and that if only we can break 1,150 on the S&P ( which we just did ) , we are headed straight to 36,000 on the Dow ( although as we are now in a fully blown melt up as we pointed out last week , we very well might ) .
As Saluzzi says , we find ourselves in a " A momentum driven , fragmented equity market .
What we see is a very lite volume morning normally , jacked up really fast by a couple of programs that come in , and then you get this churn most of the day .
There is not a lot of conviction out there . "
And the reason why the market closed above 1,150 ( 1,150.24 on the last print to be specific - what a computer programmed joke ) today as a last minute buy program ramps up : " This market is built on lies and rumors . " ( a topic previously discussed on Zero Hedge ) .

According to Saluzzi , this observation has lead to a new nickname : this is now " the Jason Bourne market , because when he goes into a room , the first thing he checks for is where the three exits are .

!Tell us what 's what , Glenn Stanton , director of Family Formation Studies for Focus on the Family ( WTF ? ! ) :
" They need help , they need guidance of what that looks like .
It 's important to teach our children that gender distinction is very healthy .
" Why ?
BECAUSE GOD SAYS SO , THAT'S WHY , YOU FILTHY HEATHENS !
Our last expert to opine on the international crisis of a three - year - old 's gender presentation is parenting coach Karen Deerwester , who says : " Giving preschool - age children the freedom and flexibility to experiment with how they want to be seen in the world is a wonderful gift .
" Wow .
How eminently sensible .
In addition to , and inextricably tied up with , the transphobia at work here , there 's also the familiar stank of misogyny , and the curling stench of homophobia , all stewing in the fetid pot of gendered heteronormativity :
And though it 's not explicit , there is also an element of racism underlying the insistence that Jolie is " ruining " her white ( biological ) daughter by " turning her into a boy , " an objection that was n't raised when her Asian ( adopted ) sons have had longer ( " feminine " ) hair , or when her African - American ( adopted ) daughter has worn her older brothers ' hand - me - downs , as does Shiloh .
Further , we have yet another example of a child 's agency being denied , or treated like it does n't even exist .
Maybe Shiloh asked for that haircut .
Maybe she likes dressing up like a boy , like lots of little girls with opposite - sex parents do , because it makes them feel close to their dads .
Maybe she asked to be called " John " because it 's her grandfather 's name .
Or maybe zie asked for that haircut and dresses up like a boy and asked to be called John becauseAnd lucky enough to have parents who respect hir as an individual .
Either way , it 's none of our goddamned business .
And I resent being obliged to put an alternative to this shit out into the universe .
Because it reallymy business — but the notion that a child who does n't conform to hir birth gender is somehowcertainly is .

They were also able to access some corporate servers used to store confidential data , including one used for processing credit - card payments .
Companies reportedly attacked include Paramount Pictures , Merck , Juniper Networks and Cardinal Health in the US , but affected computers in more than 200 countries including Egypt , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Turkey .
The Wall Street Journal reported that Merck and Cardinal Health said they had isolated and contained the problem , and Merck said " no sensitive information was compromised " .
NetWitness 's Alex
Cox uncovered the botnet while installing monitoring software to help a large corporation deal with cyberattacks .
He found a 75 GB cache of data generated by the botnet , which NetWitness has called Kneber after a username linking the infected systems .
NetWitness said in a statement : " Disturbingly , the data was only a one - month snapshot of data from a campaign that has been in operation for more than a year . "
The PCs in question , almost all running Microsoft Windows XP or Vista , had been compromised by a new variant of the well - known ZeuS Trojan , which is one of the " top five " in its class .
Cox told the SearchSecurity.com site that the variant used in the latest attacks had a detection rate of less than 10 % among antivirus software .
The botnet communication was also shielded from detection by existing intrusion detection systems .
" This is not about a single piece of malware on 75,000 machines , it 's about how bad the security industry is responding to these incidents and how bad the problem is , " said Cox .
SearchSecurity.com said " the cybercriminals exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash as well as holes in Adobe Reader and Acrobat using malicious PDF applications in spear phishing attacks , according to Cox .
They also used exploit kits to set up drive - by attacks to infect victims . "
The discovery of the Kneber botnet follows publicity about attempts to penetrate Google and other companies , dubbed Operation Aurora .
In this case , the botnet command centre appears to have been in Germany , while ZeuS appears to be mainly the work of cybercriminals based in Eastern Europe .
ZeuS is often used to collect data from online forms , including names , dates of birth , and account names and passwords , and one special feature is that it can work with the Firefox web browser .
Amit Yoran , chief executive of NetWitness and former Director of the National Cyber Security Division , said : " While Operation Aurora shed light on advanced threats from sponsored adversaries , the number of compromised companies and organizations pales in comparison to this single botnet .
These large - scale compromises of enterprise networks have reached epidemic levels .
Cyber criminal elements , like the Kneber crew quietly and diligently target and compromise thousands of government and commercial organizations across the globe .
Conventional malware protection and signature based intrusion detection systems are by definition inadequate for addressing Kneber or most other advanced threats . "
NetWitness also said that " over half the machines infected with Kneber also were infected with Waledac , a peer to peer botnet . "
This suggests some level of co-existence if not active cooperation between cybercriminals , where a PC could continue to operate in one botnet even if the other was found and removed .
Earlier this month , there was a small " botnet war " after the upstart Spy Eye appeared with a feature called Kill Zeus .
This aims to remove ZeuS from the victim's PC , giving Spy Eye exclusive access .
However , by far the biggest and best botnet is still Conficker , with more than 5 m PCs .

" We could not charge for something that others gave away for free . "
Back in January 2009 , as Vodafone was preparing to close a £ 20 million ( $ 30 million ) deal to buy Swedish mapmaker Wayfinder , it was seen as a bold move from a carrier intent on entering the apparently lucrative market for location based services .
Fast forward to the present day -- past the bit where free Google Maps Navigation destroyed TomTom and Garmin share prices , and past the introduction of free turn - by - turn navigation to Nokia 's Ovi Maps -- and you 'll find Wayfinder gently sobbing into a handkerchief as it permanently closes up its doors .
Vodafone 's Anna Cloke gives us the reason for it with devastating concision :
So there we have it , the paid navigation services deathwatch has its first fatality , and it's the unfortunate nature of the beast that plenty of others will be following suit , unable to resist the destructive effects of the free and ubiquitous services now on offer .

The chief executive of Arm has given the strongest hint yet that the company 's technology is inside Apple 's iPad .
The Cambridge - based technology group - whose microchip designs are to be found in more than nine out of every 10 mobile phones sold across the world - already has chips in the iPhone and iPod .
That has led intense speculation that Apple 's A4 chip , which powers the iPad , incorporates an Arm Cortex - A9 MPCore - the same processor as Qualcomm 's Snapdragon chip , which powers Google 's Nexus One .
In an interview with the Guardian , Arm 's chief executive , Warren East , hinted that the mystery would soon be over .
" I would doubt whether anybody other than Apple has taken the iPad to bits yet , " he said .
" But in a month or so it will be available and somebody other than Apple will take it to bits - and then we will know . "
Famously coy about the destination of the company 's technology , East hinted that the iPad was powered by Arm designs – but refused to confirm outright that the A4 chip is based on the company 's intellectual property .
" I have seen all the same speculation that you have seen and I can point out the fact that they [ Apple ] publicised the fact that it runs Apple iPhone and iPod Touch applications straight off and from that you can do some inferring , " he teased .
" But I can not possibly confirm anything . "
When a new gadget is released , analysts can be relied upon to pull it apart and spot the firm 's handiwork .
They have yet to get their hands on an iPad , however .
There had been concerns that Apple 's $ 275 m ( £ 148 m ) acquisition of Californian chip designer PA Semi in 2008 would see Arm slowly pushed out of Apple 's products .
But the A4 chip - the first piece of silicon to emerge since that takeover - suggests there is still a very definite role for Arm to play .
East was speaking after the company announced a better than expected set of fourth quarter results .
It has benefited from the boom in sales of smartphones from the likes of Apple , Nokia and RIM , maker of the BlackBerry .
As these devices have become more complex , meanwhile , Arm has been able to install more of its chip designs in individual gadgets - covering everything from the handset 's microprocessor to Wi -Fi , Bluetooth or GPS connections .
While revenues in the three months to end December were down 10 % , at £ 85.2 m , that was a better performance than the City had predicted and a lot better than the 20 % drop recorded by some of its rivals .
In the quarter , the company sold a record 1.3 billion chips .
Annual sales of £ 305 m were up 2 % , while profits of £ 96.8 m were down 4 % .
In its results statement , ARM said it is generally anticipated that the semiconductor industry will see improving conditions in 2010 compared to 2009 , but warned that " the rate of improvement is still unclear as it will be influenced by consumer confidence and the broader macro-economic environment " .
East cautioned that the industry 's expectations for growth of 15 % to 20 % this year , may be over - optimistic .
His own prediction is for Arm to grow at 13 % , with the rest of the industry seeing more modest growth .
Kevin Doyle was stabbed to death at his house in 2008 A Belfast woman who killed her husband by stabbing him during a heated row has been jailed for three years .
Roisin Doyle , 27 , from Henderson Avenue was originally charged with murdering her husband Kevin at their home in Twinbrook in September 2008 .
But last month , the prosecution accepted the mother - of - four 's guilty plea to manslaughter .
Mr Doyle 's mother said afterwards that her family were happy with the sentence which was " something for Kevin " .
Chest
The court was told that after she returned from a night out with friends , Doyle discovered that her husband , from whom she was separated , had come to the house and sent a babysitter home .
The couple started to argue and Doyle got a steak knife from the kitchen and tried to cut her own wrist .
She then claimed she threw the knife at her husband but later admitted to police that she struck him in the chest with it .
He died in hospital several hours later .
Last month on the morning her trial was due to start , the mother - of - four pleaded guilty to his manslaughter .
The plea to the lesser charge was accepted by the Crown who said that while she intended to harm her husband , there was no evidence she had intended to kill him .
There are no winners here , it is just sad all round
Kevin Doyle 's sister , Joanne Kevin Doyle 's mother Margaret said the only thing which saddened her about the case was the apparent lack of remorse shown by her daughter - in - law .
" Had Roisin shown me one bit of remorse , it would have gone a long way with me , " she added .
" Had she done that I would have stood up for her and would have asked for even more leniency for her . "
Kevin 's sister , Joanne Doyle echoed her mother 's views at the outcome of the case .
" There are no winners here , it is just sad all round , " she said .
On Friday , Mr Justice Treacy told Craigavon Crown Court , sitting in Belfast , that it was one of the most tragic cases he had ever encountered .
He added that it was " one which posed a significant challenge to me in seeking to reach a disposal which does justice to everyone in this sad situation . "
Abusive
The judge said the couple 's relationship which had initially been a happy one had become " destructive and turbulent " .
" The relationship was consistently and , I suspect , mutually abusive . "
The judge said Mr Doyle 's death had been " unexpectedly tragic " because the knife had entered his body at a precise point where it severed his mammary artery and , if the wound had been half an inch to either side , he would almost certainly have survived .
" The disintegration of this marriage and all that flowed from it has brought great harm and suffering especially to the parties to the marriage but also to their sons and extended families .
" It is right that a period of penal retribution should be served so that the families may feel that a price was paid for the unlawful killing of Kevin Doyle . "
Doyle agreed to complete two years on probation after her release from jail .

His image is now the stuff of legend : Ghyslain Raza , the Star Wars kid , aged 15 , got the attention and ridicule of the Internet — especially its geek contingent — when footage of him wielding a golf ball retriever and fending off a horde of invisible vicious enemies surfaced .
Granted , we geeks were a little less harsh .
But unfortunately for Ghyslain , the sudden — and often cruel — Internet fame was far from intended .
His performance became an Internet phenomenon after four of his schoolmates uploaded his video for the world to see .
It has since inspired thousands of remixes .
By November of 2006 , the video had been viewed over 900 million times .
But now that eight years have passed , have you ever wondered what happened to the famed Star Wars Kid ?
Here ’s a bit of a timeline to fill in the years since the video went public :
In July 2003 , Ghyslain ’s family filed a $ 250,000 lawsuit against the families of his schoolmates , mainly to pay for psychiatric therapy for their son due to the derision he received at the hands of a very unforgiving public .
Although the suit was dropped in April of 2004 , it was settled out of court .
However , these days , Ghyslain certainly is having the last laugh .
After climbing what must surely have seemed like an insurmountable mountain , he is currently completing his law studies at Montreal ’s McGill University and recently took a position of president of Patrimoine Trois - Rivière , an organization that aims to defend Trois - Rivière ’s historical real estate against the city ’s frenetical urban expansion .
The Force is surely strong with this one .
So , if you ever find yourself in a similar situation someday — your most private fantasies aired to the world ( something which is becoming more and more likely in this age of instant news and technology ) — consider Ghyslain ’s amazing journey .
Though things may seem desperate , though you may feel as if the whole world is laughing at you , there is always hope at the end of the tunnel .
And through hard work and persistence , it ’s attainable for anyone .
Here ’s to you , Ghyslain .
For nostalgia ’s sake , here are a few of the best remixes of the famed Star Wars Kid .
We hope that someday Ghyslain can smile when he sees these , too .
Because really , he ’s just one of us .

That set - top box from Google ( Nasdaq : GOOG ) is getting closer to your living room .
The New York Times is reporting that Google has teamed up with an all - star constellation that includes Sony ( NYSE : SNE ) , Intel ( Nasdaq : INTC ) , and Logitech ( Nasdaq : LOGI ) to bring a fully Web- enabled and Android - powered box to consumers .
The newspaper 's anonymous sources claim that this project has been brewing " for several months , " and that this is the technology that DISH Network ( Nasdaq : DISH ) is helping Google test right now .
" The partners envision technology that will make it as easy for TV users to navigate Web applications , like the Twitter social network and the Picasa photo site , as it is to change the channel , " the article says .
The platform can be worked into set - top boxes or directly into TV sets , and Logitech 's custom remote control will probably include a full QWERTY keyboard for seamless searching and browsing .
I would also expect that gadget to work like a Nintendo ( OTC BB : NTDOY .PK )
Wii controller , which lets you navigate on - screen environments by pointing the remote at the screen .
This four - way partnership breaks new ground in many ways .
Sony hopes to steal a march on its rivals in consumer electronics by being first to market with hyper - connected media players and TV sets -- though heavyweight rivals like Motorola ( NYSE : MOT ) , Toshiba , and Samsung are part of Android 's Open Handset Alliance and could be working on their own Android applications for the living room as we speak .
Intel hopes to push its
Atom chips into new markets , and Logitech is simply firing slapshots from its wheelhouse at the blue line , doing what the company already does best .
Google has a two - pronged objective : Expand Web surfing into the living room with the commensurate extra ad clicks , and provide a natural platform on which to build a mechanism that serves personalized TV ads based on your browsing history .
Some might call that an evil invasion of your privacy , but I call it smart business and the obvious way forward for Google and for an advertising industry that seems short on real innovation .
So there you have it , folks : A Google TV box or Google - powered TV set is coming to a Best Buy ( NYSE : BBY ) near you .
We do n't know exactly when , though the Times believes that " products based on the [ Android TV ] software could appear as soon as this summer . "
We 're standing at a cusp of a new era in entertainment and information history .
Will the sea change be good or bad for consumers and investors ?

[ UPDATE : We ’ve added in a reference to DC bureau chief David Corn ’s Sunday night dispatch , which highlights the incendiary remarks David Frum made about health care politics as Republicans ’
“ Waterloo ” — possibly the remarks that led to his ouster from the conservative fold . ]
David Frum , the enigmatic young mandarin of the GOP who speechified many of George W. Bush ’s most manichaean lines , just dropped a bomb over on his blog :
He ’s been dumped by his significant other of seven years , the right - wing American Enterprise Institute .
And it does n’t sound like it was a pleasant breakup .
Said Frum :
“ I have been a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute since 2003 .
At lunch today , AEI President Arthur Brooks and I came to a termination of that relationship .
Below is the text of my letter of resignation . ”
Dear Arthur ,
This will memorialize our conversation at lunch today .
Effective immediately , my position as a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute is terminated .
I appreciate the consideration that delays my emptying of my office until after my return from travel next week .
Premises will be vacated no later than April 9 .
I have had many fruitful years at the American Enterprise Institute , and I do regret this abrupt and unexpected conclusion of our relationship .
Very truly yours , David Frum
So what gives ?
How could one of the best - known fellows at one of the best - known Beltway opinionators end up on the outs ?
Well , back in December , our own Kevin Drum said that Frum “ has been estranged from the hard - right wing of the Republican Party for a while . ”
And on Monday , the MoJo blog reported that Frum ’s recent activities had included a poll that exposed the general ignorance of Tea Partiers about US politics and taxes , which could n’t have sat well with his overseers at AEI .
They do loathe them some health care reform and love them some irate patriots .
But perhaps most damningly , as MoJo ’s DC bureau chief David Corn reported Sunday , was an incendiary Frum blog post describing health care as the GOP ’s Waterloo .
Corn writes :
He noted that “ it ’s a good bet that conservatives are over - optimistic about November ” because “ by then the economy will have improved and the immediate goodies in the healthcare bill will be reaching key voting blocs . ”
Frum ’s j’accuse !
blamed “ conservatives and Republicans ourselves ” for making a poor strategic decision : “ We would make no deal with the administration .
No negotiations , no compromise , nothing … We followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement , and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat . ”
Republican legislators who wanted to cut a deal , he notes , were trapped and pinned down by “ conservative talkers on Fox and talk radio . ”
Strong stuff — and Frum did n’t back away from it the next day in his commentary to the New York Times on GOP political nihilism :
David Frum , a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , the conservative research organization , said Republicans had tried to defeat the bill to undermine Mr. Obama politically , but in the process had given up a chance of influencing a huge bill .
Mr. Frum said his party ’s stance sowed doubts with the public about its ideas and leadership credentials , and ultimately failed in a way that expanded Mr. Obama ’s power .
“ The political imperative crowded out the policy imperative , ” Mr. Frum said .
“ And the Republicans have now lost both . ”
“ Politically , I get the ‘ let ’s trip up the other side , make them fail ’ strategy , ” he said .
“ But what ’s more important , to win extra seats or to shape the most important piece of social legislation since the 1960s ?
It was a go - for - all - the - marbles approach .
Unless they produced an absolute failure for Mr. Obama , there was n’t going to be any political benefit . ”
But wait !
There ’s more :
Indeed , most Americans with insurance are unlikely to see any immediate change in their coverage , and several Republicans warned that the party could pay a price for that .
“ When our core group discover that this thing is not as catastrophic as advertised , they are going to be less energized than they are right now , ” Mr. Frum said .
He warned that the energy Republicans were finding now among base voters would fade .
This may be hard for some on the left to take , given how they ’ve vilified Frum for his neoconservatism and war - hawking in the past .
But it surely looks like he was thrown overboard by fellow conservatives for calling it like he saw it .
Is this further evidence the GOP and its ilk plan to go more paleo with their paleoconservatism ?
That remains to be seen .
But one thing ’s certain :
Whatever the prevailing conservative narrative becomes — and however much it seems to contradict reality — nobody in the flock had better question that dogma .
Well that was quite the 72 hours .
On Monday afternoon came news of the departure of Denis Grebeshkov and the disc problems of Ladi Smid ; on Tuesday prospect Cody Wild was sent packing ; and today two more high priced defencemen left town while a third has developed a troubling medical condition .
In return the Oilers acquired two maturing defencemen , three draft picks , a whole bunch of cap room , and possibly the worst defensive crew in the National Hockey League .
Oh yeah , and a physical forward picked up on waivers .
Not to mention a very welcome show of the long - rumoured but rarely - seen Katz Bucks .
The transactions :
Monday
Recall G Devan Dubnyk , D Taylor Chorney , and D Theo Peckham from Springfield Falcons
Announce D Ladislav
Smid is out indefinitely with a bulging disc in his neck
Trade D Denis Grebeshkov to Nashville Predators for a 2010 2nd rounder
Tuesday
Trade D Cody Wild to Boston Bruins for F Matt Marquardt
Wednesday
Claim F Ryan Jones off waivers from Nashville
Trade D Lubomir Visnovsky to Anaheim Ducks for D Ryan Whitney and a 2010 6th rounder
Trade D Steve Staios to Calgary Flames ( !!! ) for D Aaron Johnson and a 2010 3rd rounder
Announce D Sheldon Souray is out for the rest of the season with a post - surgery infection in his hand
Recall D Johan Motin and D Mean Dean Arsene from SF
***
Analysis after the jump ...
Of the 6 - man defensive unit that all agreed was the Oilers ' strength heading into this season , three have been traded and two shelved with bad medical news since Monday .
The early result will be that tonight the Oilers will likely ice the worse defensive unit that has hit the ice for an NHL team since late in the 2006 - 07 season , when the Oilers ( natch ) had to use the likes of Dan Syvret , Bryan Young , Sebastien Bisaillon , and Toby Petersen on the blue .
Assuming neither Whitney nor Johnson makes it to Chicago on time , the Oilers will ice four guys who were in the AHL last Sunday .
The Hawks , meanwhile , will ice four guys who played in the Olympic Gold Medal Game on Sunday .
It gets worse when you consider that putative 7th man Jason Strudwick is on the top pairing .
" Mr. Reliable " has over 2/3 of the combined NHL experience of tonight 's defensive group !
Including the goalie !!
Only purge - survivor Tom Gilbert can be considered a bona fide NHL defenceman as the Oil line up against the powerful Hawks .
Two helpful tips :
Take the " over " on the Oilers game .
And take the " way over " on the next Springfield game .
Of all the times they could have used Cody Wild ...
Of course the short term is the very least of Oilers concerns right now , and a cup o' coffee might be a beneficial thing for Arsene and Motin .
Presumably it will be just the one game and Whitney and Johnson will be put to work as soon as they arrive .
Chorney and Peckham on the other hand appear to be here for the duration given the bad medical news on Smid and Souray .
In the process the Oilers created some $ 6 MM in cap space , more than all of it on the blue .
Gone are Visnovsky 's $ 5.6 MM cap hit , Grebeshkov 's $ 3.15 , Staios ' $ 2.7 ; in their place are Whitney 's $ 4.0 and Johnson 's $ 0.54 , and up front , Jones ' $ 0.975 .
Most of the Katz Bucks were spent on the biggest transaction of the day .
Both Visnovsky and Whitney have three years to run on their long - term pacts .
Oddly , although Visnovsky 's remaining cap hit is about $ 5 MM more than Whitney 's , due to the unbalanced structure of both their contracts it is the latter who will be earning more actual money over that span .
Visnovsky 's contract was front - loaded with two years - his time here in other words - at $ 7.0 MM ; then $ 6.0 , $ 5.0 , and $ 3.0 which is all Anaheim needs to pony up .
Whitney 's contract was just the reverse , paying him $ 2.5 , $ 3.0 , and $ 3.5 in the time before he got here , but scheduled to jump to $ 4.5 , $ 5.0 , and $ 5.5 over the three years that remain .
Mr. Katz picked up the heavy end of both deals , outspending the actual cap hits by more than $ 5 million .
A further half a mill Katz Bucks were spent in the trade that unloaded sent Steve Staios to Calgary Flames of all teams .
Staios was thought to be a tough move with another year to run on his $ 2.7 MM cap hit .
That his actual salary was only $ 2.2 in another front - loaded deal might have made it a little easier to move , which they did for Johnson and a third rounder .
A more than decent return .
Johnson is a career 6/7 blueliner with a contract to match (! ) , although in Edmonton he will likely slip right into the top 4 .
UFA at season 's end , he should be anxious to make a good impression , and I 'm hopeful he might be a decent fit here .
I anticipate we will find a surprisingly serviceable defenceman , with 206 NHL GP under his belt and a career +19 rating , all of it earned in 38 games in Chicago last season before the arrival of Niklas Hjalmarsson pushed him aside .
Otherwise he 's been a break even 14 minute a night guy for mostly crappy teams ( CBJ , NYI , Calgary :) .
Speaking of Calgary , this was indeed the very first ever trade between the two clubs .
Certainly there have been a number of guys who played for both squads over the years - Grant Fuhr , Steve Smith , Kent Nilsson , Frank Musil , Fred Brathwaite - but the only time I ever remember a player proceeding directly from one team to the other was this guy , who was cut by the Flames and given a brief tryout by Glen Sather on a whim .
Needless to say if he was n't good enough to make the Flames he certainly was n't good enough to make the 1983 - 84 Edmonton Oilers , so in a week or so was on his way home to Finland .
If anybody can think of another example of a player who went directly from the Flames to the Oilers or vice versa please mention him in the comments ... they do n't get much more obscure than Kari Jalonen , and he 's all I got .
Unless you want to count Curtis Glencross , I suppose .
And all that said , best wishes in ( inhale ) Calgary ( exhale ) to Steve Staios , a warrior if I ever saw one , a guy that gave everything he had pretty much every shift he played as an Edmonton Oiler .
On the talent front that was n't as much as demanding fans would like some nights , but on the effort meter I have nothing but respect and admiration for Steady Steve .
For all that huge flurry of activity on the blue line - 12 different blueliners listed in those transactions !
- precious little was done up front .
There was no subtraction whatsoever , while Marquardt was brought into the farm system and Jones into the NHL roster .
He has a year to run at $ 975 K but cost nothing in the way of assets , and brings a few things the Oilers forward corps sorely needs , including size and aggression .
Indeed , size and relative youth was the common denominator of all of Edmonton 's acquisitions .
Jones , 25 , is 6 '1 , 206 ; Johnson , 26 , is 6'1 , 211 ; Whitney , 27 , is 6 ' 4 , 219 .
The three have 87 , 206 , and 335 GP respectively of NHL experience .
Marquardt , described as a " project " at 22 , is 6 '3 , 222 .
The Oilers did n't dump any smurfs other than Vis I guess , but they certainly did n't add any new ones .
Moreover , they actually added a few pieces who are somewhere close to the middle of their careers , while seeing the backs of two guys whose best years are certainly behind them .
Sad to see both go , but it's hard to argue with making the team younger , bigger , and cheaper .
The draft picks do n't hurt either .
I 'm still somewhat baffled by the Grebeshkov deal and will definitely have to , uh , evaluate Ryan Whitney before declaring that trade a win , but overall there at least seems to be some semblance of a plan , albeit concentrated in one position .
Overall I give Steve Tambellini a solid B - minus for his work this week .

ORLANDO , Fla . –
At a closed two - hour meeting of the AFL - CIO ’s executive council today , many of the nation ’s union leaders expressed anger and frustration with the Obama administration for what they say is its lack of bold action on job creation , health care and labor law reform , and for its support of the mass firings of teachers at a Rhode Island high school .
“ I was sitting in the room when we discussed Biden ’s speech , ” said Gerald McEntee , president of the American Federation of State , County and Municpal Employees , referring to Vice President Joe Biden ’s address to the union leaders yesterday .
“ There were a lot of discouraged people .
They believed it was a speech they had heard a number of times before . ”
In the vice president ’s speech , his second to the AFL - CIO in 13 months , he urged patience with the administration on its economic program .
According to McEntee , union leaders were angered by Biden ’s statement that the administration would not support a second stimulus program .
McEntee said that when he asked Biden about a second stimulus , he received “ a flat out no for an answer . ”
Biden also drew the union leaders ’ ire when he hugged Randi Weingarten , president of the Teachers ’ union , after telling her the administration would not reverse its support of the mass firings of teachers in Rhode Island , McEntee said .
“ Telling us that the stimulus saved 300,000 education jobs does not get around two days straight of Obama making a direct attack on hard working , dedicated teachers , ” the AFSCME leader said .
McEntee , who is also chair of the AFL - CIO ’s political action committee , said that things boiled over at the closed - door meeting “ because many union leaders represent people who have real angst and anger over jobs , health care , the stimulus and the health care excise tax . ”
Another union leader reported that AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka told the executive council he would take their concerns to the White House as soon as he returned to Washington .
Trumka reportedly said , “ We have to speak with one voice , rather than 57 , and the message will be ‘ unless they [ the administration ] get off their ass , we are going to sit on our hands ' ” at election time .
“ The problem is that people will either sit on their hands or say we are being taken for granted , ” one state federation president said .
Vince Panvini , legislative director of the Sheet Metal Workers , said the focus of anger extends beyond the White House .
“ My union is so mad at the refusal of conservative Democrats to back the Employee Free Choice
Act that we , already last year , suspended all contributions to political candidates and will focus on pushing our issues , ” he said .
Union leaders are feeling the heat from members angry about high unemployment and all the rest of the pressures resulting from the economic crisis .
McEntee himself was one of several labor leaders who recently negotiated improvements in the health care reform bill passed by the Senate .
Those improvements reduce and delay the excise tax on workers ’ health care benefits .
“ Workers do n’t want to hear that , ” McEntee said .
“ They do n’t understand why they should have to pay any kind of tax on their health care benefits , and frankly I agree with them even though we did our best to negotiate improvements . ”
Some of the union leaders who attended the meeting today said their consciousness about the urgency of action was raised at a public forum on jobs held in Orlando last night .
At that event they heard gripping testimony from workers who had lost jobs , like Barbara Medina , a recently unemployed single mother who is now the new receptionist at the Painters union hall where the forum was held .
It was difficult for many in attendance to hold back their tears when Medina , crying , testified how “ the worst part after my layoff was having to look at my four beautiful children and tell them that I could no longer afford to take care of them and that they had to go to Puerto Rico to live with their grandparents . ”
“ Barbara is one of our heroes , ” Trumka said .
“ She never gave up hope and kept fighting .
This labor movement must and will do the same . ”

Beginning Shotshell Reloading By Chuck Hawks
As the title states , this article is about how to get started reloading shotgun shells .
I 'm going to assume that you already want to reload , and have some idea of the advantages of so doing .
( If not , see my article " Introduction to Reloading " on the General Firearms Information Page . )
Most shotgun shooters find that the greatest benefit to reloading is lowered ammunition expenses .
Reloads are cheaper than factory loads , so you can shoot more for the same amount of money .
If you have just reached the point where you have decided to take the plunge and begin reloading your own shotgun shells , right now it probably seems a complicated and difficult process .
However , with only a little practical experience you will discover that reloading is simple .
Care and attention to detail are required to produce safe and reliable ammunition , but the process has only a few steps and is basically repetitive .
A reloading press is the basic tool used to reload shotshell ammunition .
What the press basically does is hold the dies that reform , prime , and eventually reload the shell and provide the mechanical leverage that allows the operator to accomplish these tasks .
Shotshell reloading presses are generally pretty much self - contained , and come complete with all the dies , bushings , charge bars , and accessories required to load one gauge of shotshells .
Even entry level presses usually have powder and shot reservoirs , and allow the operator to sequentially perform the steps required to reload a shotgun shell without recourse to other tools .
Some of the relatively inexpensive shotshell loading machines usually chosen by beginning ( and many experienced ) reloaders are ordinarily designed to reload only one gauge of shell .
So if you want to reload , say , both 12 and 20 gauge shells , you will need to purchase a 12 gauge press and a 20 gauge press .
This in not as much of a hardship as it may initially seem , as your can then leave each machine set - up with the powder , shot , and bushings required for loading that gauge shell without having to change everything over each time you reload the other gauge .
Changing powder and shot bushings , for example , may require emptying and refilling the powder and shot hoppers , which can be a messy job .
Paper hulls can be reloaded once or twice , but plastic cases are so much more durable that it is pointless to buy any other kind of shells .
Buy only one piece , compression formed shells if they are to be reloaded , such as the Federal Gold Medal , Winchester AA , and Remington Premier STS brands .
The first step in reloading a batch of shotgun shells is to inspect the fired hulls .
Make sure the shell is completely empty .
Look closely at the case mouths , as this is the area most likely to be damaged or show splits .
Also look for cracks or incipient separation above the brass head of the hull .
Discard any cases that are not perfect .
About seven pulls of the press handle are required to resize the case and remove the fired primer , prime the shell , drop a powder charge , seat a wad , drop the shot , start the new crimp , and complete the crimp .
After those seven steps are completed , a fired hull has been transformed into a loaded shell .
All operations are performed on a single shell before starting over with the next shell , usually by moving it from station to station on the reloading press .
My suggestion is to buy a basic and relatively inexpensive shotshell loading press , which ordinarily includes the basic necessities required to begin reloading , and then acquire additional accessories if and when you need them .
I started with a 12 gauge Lee Load - All ( discount priced at about $ 40 in 2003 ) , used it for about 5 years , then switched to a pair of MEC Sizemasters in 12 and 20 gauges , which I have used ever since .
There are die sets available for the Sizemaster from .410 bore to 10 gauge ( about $ 60 per set ) , but I simply find it more convenient to have a separate press for each gauge .
I 'd recommend purchasing a MEC Sizemaster ( discount priced around $ 150 ) , or something similar , to really get started right .
For the shooter on a tighter budget , the similar MEC 600 Jr. Mark V is discount priced at about $ 105 .
It lacks the automatic primer feed of the Sizemaster , and the Sizemaster 's more advanced resizing method .
The E - Z Prime V primer feed can be added later to a 600 Jr. press for about $ 27 .
Extra die sets are available for the 600 Jr. at a discount price of about $ 40 .
For shotshell reloading , only a few accessories are really necessary .
The most important of these is one or more shotshell reloading manuals ( the more reloading data the better - - always follow published data exactly ) .
Another useful accessory is an accurate powder scale .
This can be used to set up and check the shot and powder charges actually being dispensed .
( The powder bushing guides that come with the reloading presses are sometimes pretty conservative . )
Something along the lines of an RCBS 505 reloading scale will do fine ( discount priced at about $ 70 ) .
While not absolutely required to start reloading , a solid and dedicated reloading bench is a practical necessity .
Presses can be clamped to breadboards or kitchen tables , but these temporary set -ups are rarely completely satisfactory .
Many shooters enjoy reloading as a hobby in itself ; to others it is merely a necessary chore that they must finish before the next shoot .
But anyone who does much shotgunning , and particularly if they get involved in one of the clay target sports such as trap , skeet , or sporting clays , is probably going to eventually become a reloader .

Jan. 16 , 2010 :
Despite denials by FirstEnergy Corp. , documents show the utility did indeed promise owners of all - electric homes that they would receive discounted rates forever .
Those and other documents obtained by The Plain Dealer reveal a vigorous marketing campaign by Ohio Edison and the Illuminating Co. to persuade developers to build all - electric homes and then to discourage owners from switching to gas when they had a chance .
" This rate will be guaranteed for you as long as you wish to utilize it , " an Ohio Edison salesman wrote to a Canfield resident in 1988 , confirming a new heat pump rate .
FirstEnergy 's representatives have denied for weeks that the company or its predecessors ever guaranteed permanently discounted rates to developers or homeowners .
FirstEnergy 's assertions have continued in the face of widespread protest from thousands of the more than 100,000 families whose bills have soared since the utility eliminated the discounts last year .
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio this week ordered FirstEnergy to restore the discounts by March 17 on an emergency basis while a permanent discount is negotiated .
FirstEnergy spokeswoman Ellen Raines said it was no secret that the utilities marketed all - electric homes .
But she declined to comment specifically on any of the documents .
" This is now the subject of litigation , " she said , referring to a lawsuit by state Sen .
Tim Grendell on behalf of the homeowners .
" It 's not appropriate for me to discuss it . "
Grendell said he has many documents showing that FirstEnergy promised permanent discounts .
Documents obtained from Grendell and other sources include :
A two - page letter from The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. in 1986 to owners of all - electric homes .
CEI feared that Columbia Gas of Ohio was soliciting the homeowners to switch to gas .
The letter argued that the annual cost of electric heat was " virtually identical " with gas and that converting to gas appliances would , including interest on a five - year loan , cost a homeowner up to $ 6,000 .
A 1996 contract with Bob Schmitt Homes , a North Ridgeville contractor who has built more than 3,500 all - electric homes over more than 30 years , often in partnership with a FirstEnergy company .
The company is building two all - electric homes in North Ridgeville because there are no gaslines in that neighborhood .
But 400 homes in an adjacent development will be heated by gas , the company said .
In the 1996 contract signed by Ohio Edison regional manager C.E. Jones , Ohio Edison agreed to give the company up to $ 59,150 , including advertising costs and $ 350 per home , up to 135 homes .
Schmitt Homes in turn agreed to reimburse Ohio Edison $ 350 for each house built if its workers installed a non-electric appliance of any kind , or if the company failed to build at least 100 homes .
A March 13 , 2000 , letter to Bob Schmitt , principal of Bob Schmitt Homes , offering up to $ 44,000 cash per year for every 100 homes built .
The proposal included extra cash directly to homeowners if they installed geothermal systems , which extract heat from the earth .
" I am excited about continuing the working relationship that was started between our companies in the 1970s and has continued into the new millennium , account executive Michael Challender wrote .
" Project Assistance is good for both companies , and our customers benefit by having lower energy costs , perhaps the lowest in the state . "
Challender made the offer even as FirstEnergy attorneys were preparing plans to " transition " into deregulation , as the state 's 1999 law demanded .
Deregulation , which became a reality finally in 2009 , was the key to stripping away the discounts .
But FirstEnergy never told Bob Schmitt Homes about what was coming , said Kevin Corcoran , vice president and general counsel for the developer .
Corcoran said he first heard about the end of discounts in 2006 , when he read a Plain Dealer article .
" They were still leading us down the path , " he said .
" Then FirstEnergy notified customers after the PUCO ruling .
Why did n't they tell us before - hand ?
Did n't they want public comment ? "
Almost two years before the deadly Fort Hood shooting by a radicalized Muslim officer , the U.S. Army was explicitly warned that jihadism — Islamic holy war — was a serious problem and threat to personnel in the U.S. , according to participants at a major Army - sponsored conference .
The annual Army anti-terrorism conference in Florida in February 2008 included presentations on the threat by counterterrorism specialists Patrick Poole , Army Lt. Col. Joseph Myers and Terri Wonder .
The meeting was organized by the Army ’s provost marshal general and included more than 350 force protection and anti-terrorism professionals who came from major Army installations and commands from around the world , according to participants .
Mr. Poole , a counterterrorism specialist and adviser to government and law - enforcement agencies , said his presentation and that of the other two counterterrorism experts “ attempted to instruct these anti-terrorism and force protection professionals not just in the indicators of Islamic jihadism , but also the strategic deficiencies in the military comprehension of the overall jihadist threat . ”
The shooting at a recruiting center in Little Rock , Ark. , in June and the November shooting at Fort Hood , Texas , that killed 13 people have exposed the problem of the Army ’s deficiencies in understanding the nature of the domestic Islamic terrorist threat , Mr. Poole said .
The incidents have raised questions about whether the Army made any effort to “ operationalize ” the threat warnings from the 2008 conference and develop policies to counter the threats .
“ The answer quite clearly is no , ” Mr. Poole said .
Col .
Myers said in an interview that he was a key speaker at the annual conference and spoke there based on his role as a force protection instructor - trainer .
He also had conducted an organizational review of the Pentagon ’s Anti-Terrorism Operations Intelligence Cell , a group that provides strategic threat warnings to the Army .
“ I noted that because of our lack of understanding of Islamic doctrines , Islamic Jihad and my view that our counterintelligence function is broken , outdated and being usurped in some cases by public affairs and equal opportunity officials , we were going to get soldiers killed in America , on our own bases for that professional ignorance , ” he said , adding that his comments were his personal views and not those of the service .
Col .
Myers said he told the conference that senior military and defense officials were involved in outreach programs to “ organizations affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and snapping pictures with its foundational leaders in our country . ”
“ The Muslim Brotherhood , also known as the Ikhwan al Muslimeen , is a global jihad organization that fundamentally shares the same objectives as the ‘ combat jihad ’ groups like al Qaeda , but orients on ‘ cultural jihad ’ — subversion , infiltration and proselytization , ” he said .
“ By its own long - standing strategic documents , … they say they exist in America to destroy our civilization and replace it with an Islamic one . ”
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Nathan Banks declined to comment on the specifics of the Army conference .
However , “ in light of the Fort Hood tragedy , we are currently reviewing potential vulnerabilities and methods of combating external and internal threats , ” Col .
Banks said .
The Pentagon - wide review led by former Army Secretary Togo West and retired Adm. Vern Clark , former chief of naval operations , as well as an Army review “ have been focused on identifying those vulnerabilities and developing ways to mitigate those threats , ” Col .
Banks said .
Mr. Poole said the Pentagon ’s outreach program to some Muslim groups , including photographs of senior defense officials associating with questionable domestic Muslim leaders and groups , gave “ legitimacy ” to some of the organizations promoting the ideology embraced by Maj .
Nidal Hasan , the suspect in the shooting rampage at Fort Hood that killed 13 people .
“ These embarrassing photo - ops occur because the military is not well - schooled on the jihadist threat in America , and because fundamentally the national security establishment does not have a fully elaborated threat model for the global and domestic jihad , ” Mr. Poole said .
“ In many instances , relationships and events with terror - tied Islamic groups and leaders are organized by public affairs flacks and never vetted by counterintelligence agencies . ”
Mr. Poole said an example was a lecture on Islam that was given to U.S. troops at Fort Hood by Louay Safi as the troops were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan .
Mr. Poole said Mr. Safi had been captured on FBI communications intercepts talking to a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader in the U.S. Additionally , Mr. Safi ’s office had been raided by the FBI in 2002 as part of a terrorism finance probe .
“ Amazingly , a Fort Hood spokesman later claimed that Safi had been fully vetted , ” Mr. Poole said .
“ If thats true , who was doing the vetting and what standards were they using ? ”
Ms. Wonder , a third speaker at the conference , also presented several case studies showing indicators and warnings of mosques in the U.S. that were taken over by Islamic radicals , many linked to the Muslim Brotherhood .
The mosques are being used as “ hubs ” and support systems for active terrorist cells , she told the conference .
Col .
Myers said his presentation in 2008 represents a failure to strategically understand the full nature of the threat facing the United States in the war on terrorism .
“ Unfortunately , such strategic failings at senior leader levels cannot help but result in tactical failings , such as the Fort Hood terrorist attack , ” he said .
“ It demonstrates that we do n’t get it . ”
Mr. Poole noted the case of Army Sgt. Hasan Karim Akbar , who killed two fellow soldiers in Kuwait in 2003 .
Akbar was sentenced to death for the killing .
“ Our conclusion was that ignorance and inaction keeps our troops vulnerable , ” Mr. Poole said .
“ But our warnings were ignored and no policies were changed .
And in 2009 , 13 soldiers and one civilian employee paid with their lives . ”
Col .
Myers said the Army ’s recent report on the Fort Hood shooting , like much of current military doctrine , focused on capabilities and deficiencies , process and procedures but failed to address the threat .
“ We continue to act and talk as though we do n’t understand it and that there is a level of ‘ uncertainty ’ — a word overused today in military parlance — as to who our enemy is and at this point , that can no longer be tolerated , ” he said .
“ All federal and commissioned officers take an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic , and that mandates a duty to be clear on who the enemies of our Constitution are , and a failure to know is a failure of duty . ”

How Did Chile Estimate the Earthquake Damage So Fast ?
Within hours of Saturday ’s devastating 8.8 - magnitude earthquake , Chilean officials were already tallying up the damage .
The Chilean minister of housing , Patricia Poblete , estimated Sunday that the earthquake had damaged 1.5 million homes .
And in public statements on Sunday , officials said that the quake had damaged 500,000 homes and 1 million total buildings , displacing 1.5 million people .
How do countries come up with these numbers so quickly ?
They do it through the analysis of aerial photographs and estimates from sophisticated models — and in Chile ’s case , likely both .
In the past , before satellites and modeling programs , countries suffering from earthquakes would assess structural damage by extrapolating from on - the - ground estimates .
For instance , a local government official would estimate the percentage of buildings destroyed in his neighborhood , and a regional or state office would collect the data to produce an estimate of aggregate destruction .
Later , damage - assessment teams would refine the tally by hand .
All that could take weeks .
But today , particularly in relatively wealthy and earthquake - prone countries — like Chile , Japan , and the United States — there is no need for such spit - balling .
Governments use sophisticated modeling systems , such as the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency ’s HAZUS , to produce accurate damage estimates within minutes of a terremoto .
Earthquake - system engineers start with electronic maps and satellite photographs , inputting geographical data on built structures , geographical features , and fault lines .
Then they add in other variables , like what construction materials buildings use , how high they are , and population density .
The system engineers can also include information about electricity sources , phone lines , dams , rivers , and other physical resources that might be damaged or disrupted by earthquakes .
When even a tremor hits , the systems use its precise location and strength to extrapolate what kind of damage it might have caused .
Some earthquake - prone areas , like Kobe , Japan , now even incorporate 3 - D versions of cities into models — both to help engineers find problem zones and enact prudential measures before earthquakes strike , and to more accurately determine an earthquake ’s damage .
Additionally , governments generally do not develop the systems themselves .
Natural disaster damage forecasting has become an industry — with multinational companies , insurance giants , and governments all clients .
In Chile ’s case , the 500,000 house , 1 million building , and 1.5 million person displaced numbers were likely flash estimates from computerized systems at Chile ’s National Office of Emergencies , or ONEMI — the Chilean equivalent of FEMA .
For a more in - depth analysis of the extent of the damage , Chile has called in the services of the Global Earth Observation and Catastrophe Assessment Network ( GEOCAN ) — an umbrella group of earthquake experts founded in the wake of the Haiti earthquake by the World Bank and the Global Facility of Disaster Reduction and Recovery .
GEOCAN obtains highly detailed satellite images of the afflicted area .
Then civil engineers , architects , and other earthquake experts volunteer their time to help analyze and mark the images — crowdsourcing to get an accurate assessment of downed buildings , damaged roads , and off - line utilities .
But the computer models and satellite research do n’t provide the granular detail that on - the - ground earthquake assessment teams can — what surgical units might be salvaged quickest , for instance .
For that , Chile is relying on government officials , under ONEMI ’s leadership , performing disaster assessments .
It has also called in the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , which is sending in back - up teams .
Thanks to Stephanie Bunker of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance , the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute , and GEOCAN .

Introduction to paper below :
Do glaciers tell a true atmospheric CO2 story ? by Prof Z Jaworowski , Prof T V Segalstad and N Ono
There is something seriously amiss with the CO2 records from ice cores .
NOAA publish the above graph that shows CO2 levels in ice cores , as well as other data .
The CO2 level is shown as being around 200 ppm for a considerable period of time .
Yet this picture of seedlings shows clearly what happens to plant growth at this level of CO2 : plants can hardly grow at all .
The full geological records of temperature and CO2 .
Present CO2 levels are extremely low compared with really early CO2 levels .
Note how global temperatures stay within boundaries .
Al Gore 's Ice Hockey Stick .
Less than 1/600 of total Earth history .
Al misleads : ( 1 ) red is CO2 not temperature - the recent pale - blue temp .
rise disappears beside the Ice Age changes ( 2 ) the recent scale is wrong - all post - splice measurements are vertical ( 3 ) it 's unclear that CO2 always follows temp .
Ice Hockey Stick in IPCC AR4 .
Splice Point between ice records and current records is neither declared nor explained .
The " Ice Hockey Stick " ( red line ) is seen here with Al Gore in a shot from An Inconvenient Truth .
Al Gore presented a " seamless " CO2 graph that suddenly rises catastrophically .
But this is misleading , it is actually two very different records spliced together .
Current records have been spliced onto the ice core records , in the belief that the ice core measurements of CO2 are accurate .
But there are many problems with measuring CO2 in ice cores , and there is a likelihood that the ice core CO2 levels are far lower than the atmospheric CO2 levels from the times the ice cores represent .
This likelihood is supported by stomata records ( another proxy for past CO2 levels ) .
Also ( 1 ) CO2 is said to rise together with an " alarming " recent temperature rise .
But in fact , the recent temperature rise in this picture is so completely dwarfed by the temperature variations of the ice ages , that it simply does not show !
Only with the much shorter , proven - to - be - false " Hockey Stick " temperature record does " alarming recent warming " appear .
( 2 ) Warmists say that whereas in the recent ice ages , temperature changes preceded CO2 changes , now the CO2 rise is manmade and is leading a global temperature rise .
There is no actual evidence for this .
Ice core records of temperature ( delta 18O proxy ) and CO2 ( direct measurements ) going back 800,000 years through the recent Ice Ages .
The paper below concludes that there is no good evidence for allowing as much as this 83 - year " gas age " which enables the ice core record to be neatly spliced with the Mauna Loa record .
The paper below by Jaworowski , Segalstad and Ono challenges the ice cores ' CO2 accuracy .
Jaworowski was an expert in ice studies , and became appalled at what he regarded as unacceptably bad science , verging on fraud at times .
He maintained the ice core CO2 record was not trustworthy , and in particular , a " gas age " as big as 83 years was unjustified .
Later assertions and further research notwithstanding , I believe this paper 's conclusion still stands , and I believe this paper is important .
It discusses all the practical problems in coring , extracting , transporting , storing , handling , and testing the ice core samples ; also many relevant details of the firnification process .
All these could result in a comparative lowering , or uncertainty , of the CO2 levels recorded .
If the ice core CO2 records are consistently too low ( even by a constant fraction ) this completely upsets the notion that there have been " unprecedented " CO2 rises recently .
This would collapse a key pillar upon which the whole warmist thesis depends .
This may well be Jaworowski's best paper .
It is pure detailed science - whereas the science in his later papers becomes a little diluted by his righteous and passionate indignation .
Anyone challenging the official ice CO2 record has to be able to answer Ferdinand Engelbeen - which was where I started .
I realized I needed to check back carefully with Jaworowski's attacker Some Are Boojums ( here and here etc ) .
After studying this paper and Engelbeen , the inadequacy of his criticisms finally became transparent .
A worthy challenger , however .
Do glaciers tell a true atmospheric CO2 story ?

Z Jaworowski , T V Segalstad , & N Ono , 1992 227-284 Science of Total Environment ABSTRACT | INTRODUCTION | EARLY STUDIES | THE PERIOD OF HIGH CO2 READINGS | THE PERIOD OF LOW CO2 READINGS | SHALLOW CORES | DEEP CORES | MACRO - AND MICRO - CRACKS | CONTAMINATED DRILLING FLUIDS | CONTAMINATED ICE CORES | DISCREPANCIES IN DEEP CORE DATA | AGE OF AIR IN ICE | CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF TRAPPED AIR | LIQUID IN ICE | STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROCESSES | CONCLUSIONS | ADDENDUM ABSTRACT
Until 1985 most studies of CO2 in gas inclusions in pre-industrial ice indicated that CO2 concentrations ( up to 2450 ppm ) were higher than the current atmospheric level .
After 1985 , lower pre-industrial CO2 values were reported , and used as evidence for a recent man-made CO2 increase .
The errors in these revised values , however , are of a similar magnitude to the apparent increase in atmospheric CO2 level .
The assumptions used in estimating lower CO2 values in past atmospheres have been : no liquid phase in polar ice ; younger age of air than of ice due to free gas exchange between deep firn and the atmosphere ; and no change in composition of air inclusions .
These assumptions are shown to be invalid .
Liquid saline water exists in ice at low temperatures , even below - 70 ºC ; airtight ice layers are ubiquitous in Antarctic firn ; and more than 20 physico - chemical processes operating in situ and in ice cores contribute to the alteration of the chemical composition of air inclusions .
The permeable ice sheet with its capillary liquid network acts as a sieve which redistributes elements , isotopes , and micro-particles .
Thirty - six to 100 % of air recovered from old ice is contaminated by recent atmospheric air during field and laboratory operations .
The value of - 290 ppm , widely accepted from glacier studies for the pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 level , apparently results from : invalid assumptions ; processes in ice sheets ; artifacts in ice cores ; and arbitrary rejection of high readings .
To date , glaciological studies are not able to provide a reliable reconstruction of either the CO2 level in pre-industrial and ancient atmospheres or paleoclimates .
Instead these studies have led to a widely accepted false dogma of man-made climatic warming .
This dogma may have enormous negative impact on our common future .
INTRODUCTION
More than 50 years ago , Callendar ( 1938 ) revived the hypothesis of greenhouse warming due to man 's activity , proposed by Arrhenius ( 1896 ) four decades earlier .
Callendar 's was a pioneering paper posing questions which have now become the subject of intense discussion .
Among these questions are those related to changes in global temperature , the natural carbon cycle , and man 's contribution to both .
Callendar may truly be regarded as the father of the current paradigm on man-induced global warming .
In support of this hypothesis , Callendar ( 1938 , 1940 , 1958 ) used his estimate of an increase in atmospheric CO2 from a 19th century level of 292 ppm to about 325 ppm by 1956 .
He claimed that both this increase and a 0.33 ºC rise in global surface temperature between 1880 and 1935 were caused by fossil fuel burning .
A set of 19th century data compiled by Fonselius et al ( 1956 ) indicated that CO2 concentrations ranged from about 250 to 550 ppm ( Fig 1 ) .
Callendar accepted an average concentration of 292 ppm for the 19th century data by application of a selection method questioned by Slocum ( 1955 ) , who demonstrated that without such selection these data average 335 ppm .
Slocum ( 1955 ) pointed out that , from a set of twenty - six 19th century averages , Callendar rejected 16 that were higher than the global average of 292 ppm , and only two that were lower .
On the other hand , from the 20th century set Callendar rejected three averages that were lower than his global average of 317 ppm , and none that was higher .
This shows a bias in the selection method .
Five decades later the Callendar CO2 estimates are still used and their reliability discussed ( see eg Stanhill 1982 ; Waterman 1983 ; Wigley 1983 ) .
Fig 1 .

Bottom area enlarged , detail RHS .
It is interesting to note that a tendency to select low values for the CO2 concentration in the 19th century atmosphere still exists .
This is because the carbon cycle model simulations , which are based on an assumption that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is due only to man 's activity , require starting concentrations even lower than 290 ppm to agree with current CO2 observations at Mauna Loa ( Keeling et al 1976 ; Wigley 1983 ; Siegenthaler and Oeschger 1987 ) , an active and strongly CO2 emitting volcano ( Jaworowski et al 1990a ) .
Wigley ( 1983 ) claimed that " the most compelling support for a ( low ) 270 ppm pre-industrial CO2 level comes from direct measurements of CO2 in the ice cores " , and cited Neftel et al ( 1982 ) in support of this statement .
But no such evidence was presented by Neftel et al ( 1982 ) .
Their data indicate rather a decreasing trend during the last 2000 years .
They found that CO2 concentrations in air bubbles from 150 - year - old ice ranged from 300 to 2350 ppm .
Ironically , those who found CO2 concentrations of between 270 and 390 ppm in 280 - year - old ice also preferred values close to the lower end of the range , because these were " within the range of the estimated ( by Callendar ) pre-industrial atmospheric content of 290 ppm " ( Berner et al 1978 ; for similar statements see also Raynaud and Barnola 1985 , and Pearman et al 1986 ) .
Because of uncertainties in 29th century air measurements , studies of CO2 in glacier ice became a cornerstone of the current greenhouse warming edifice , and a basis for studies of the global carbon cycle ( eg Broecker et al 1985 ; Bolin et al 1989 ) .
It is astonishing that these studies have been so credulously accepted ( eg IPCC 1990 ) , and were never critically evaluated , except by Jaworowski et al ( 1990a ) .
Thorough validation of these studies is much required in view of the enormous cost which may unduly be imposed on society by incorrect interpretation of their results .
In this paper we present a more detailed discussion of the reliability of these determinations .
Glaciers are often thought of as the cleanest parts of the Earth 's surface , providing a unique chemical record of past atmospheric environments .
Falling snow flakes collect atmospheric aerosols containing particulate and gasious components of the atmosphere .
Deposited on the surface of glaciers , they are covered each year by consecutive layers of snow , and form an annual ice stratification .
The air is trapped within snow crystals , in liquids at their surfaces , and in the voids of the porous firn structure .
The pores close , and after transition of firn into ice , form completely occluded air bubbles .
But before this stage , the air in the firn is isolated from the atmosphere by dense layers of ice .
Such ice layers , sandwiching the firn into airtight pockets , are ubiquitous both in temperate glaciers and in polar ice sheets .
These characteristics of glaciers enable us to study changes in atmospheric composition during the past hundreds and thousands of years , provided that the concentrations of chemical species recovered from the snow or ice samples are directly proportional to their original atmospheric concentrations .
Atmospheric components associated with insoluble particulates usually meet this condition , but gases may not .
The validity of current reconstructions of pre-industrial and ancient atmospheres , based on CO2 analyses in polar ice , depends on three speculative assumptions :
(1 ) that the age of the gases in the air bubbles is much lower than the age of the ice in which they are entrapped ( eg Oeschger et al 1985 ) ;
( 2 ) that " the entrapment of air in ice is essentially a mechanical process of collection of air samples , which occurs with no differentiation of gas components " ( Oeschger et al 1985 ) ; and
( 3 ) that the original air composition in the gas inclusions is preserved indefinitely .
The main argument in support of the last two assumptions is another assumption that no liquid phase occurs in the polar ice at a mean annual temperature of - 24 ºC or less ( Berner et al 1977 ; Raynaud and Barnola 1985 ; Friedli et al 1986 ) .
This is why , after initial research in the 1950s and 1960s , CO2 glacier studies were conducted exclusively on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets where such low temperatures exist .
Over time the sampling sites were transferred to increasingly cooler regions .
As will be seen in the discussion below , all these assumptions are invalid in view of the following : ( 1 ) the ubiquitous presence of ice layers in Antarctic snow , making the age of the entrapped air similar to the age of the ice ; ( 2 ) the presence of liquid water in polar ice even at the lowest Antarctic temperatures ; and ( 3 ) the occurrence of physical and chemical phenomena in glacier ice .
Due to these phenomena , entrapment of air in ice is not just a mechanical process , but one that leads to substantial chemical and isotopic changes ( Segalstad and Jaworowski , in prep ) in the composition of gas inclusions .
EARLY STUDIES
Determinations of CO2 in snow and ice were initiated at a small glacier in Norway ( Coachman et al 1956 , 1958a , b ) , and then the studies were continued in Greenland and Antarctica ( Table 1 ) .
In the first Antarctic study of Matsuo and Miyake ( 1966 ) an elegant method of 13C isotopic dilution was used for CO2 determinations .
The precision of these determinations , with an analytical error of +/- 0.002 % , was never matched in later studies , which reported errors usually ranging between +/- 0.2 and 3 % .
TABLE 1
Two important observations were made in these early studies .
It was found that the CO2 content of the air trapped in pre-industrial and ancient ice is rather high , and has a very wide concentration range of about 100 - 7400 ppm ( Table 1 ) .
Even more important was the finding that several physical and chemical processes ( such as melting , the presence of liquid brines in the capillary - like interstitial voids , the presence of carbonates , over - pressure in the air bubbles , and solid deposition of super - cooled fog , combined with large differences in the solubility of different gases in cold water , and mobility of CO2 in ice ) lead to differentiation of the original atmospheric ratios of N2 , O2 , Ar , and CO2 , and to depletion or enrichment of CO2 in the ice ( Coachman et al 1958 ; Hemmingsen 1959 ; Scholander et al 1961 ; Matsuo and Miyake 1966 ; Raynaud and Delmas 1977 ) .
In these early studies it was recognized that the liquid water in glaciers may be the most important factor in this differentiation , because the composition of atmospheric air ( 78.08 % nitrogen , 20.95 % oxygen , 0.93 % argon , and approximately 350 ppm by volume , carbon dioxide ) is different from the composition of air dissolved in cold water .
It was known at that time that , in such air , at 0 ºC and ambient pressure , the concentration of oxygen is 67 % higher than in the atmosphere ( Scholander et al 1961 ; Hodgman et al 1962 ) .
This is because the solubility of oxygen in cold water is 2.1 times higher than that of nitrogen .
Argon has 2.4 times higher solubility than nitrogen , and CO2 73.5 times higher ( Weast et al 1989 ) .
This explains why the air extracted from melt layers in polar firn has extremely high concentrations of about 12,000 ppm CO2 ( Stauffer et al 1985 ) .
This is also why the air bubbles contain much lower concentrations of CO2 than the ice which encompasses them .
Three different methods of gas extraction were used , and they produced different results .
This is illustrated in Fig 2 .
It can be seen that in air from the same section of a pre-industrial ice core , after 7 hrs " wet " extraction of melted ice , the CO2 concentration was up to about 1000 ppm , and it was 1.5 - 4.5 times higher than after [ just ] 15 min " wet " extraction .
The " dry " extraction , consisting in crushing or shaving the ice samples at about - 20 ºC , produced results similar to the 15 min " wet " extraction .
The short " wet " and " dry " extractions recovered about a half or less of the total CO2 present in the ice .
Later papers showing the recent increase in CO2 atmospheric level ignored or played down these early findings .
It was tacitly assumed in these papers that no exchange exists between the ice matrix rich in CO2 and the gas occluded in the air bubbles .
THE PERIOD OF HIGH CO2 READINGS
After 1980 most of the studies of CO2 in glaciers were carried out on Greenland and Artarctic ice by Swiss and French research groups ; one core was studied in an Australian laboratory .
A striking feature of the data published until about 1985 is the high concentrations of CO2 in air extracted from both pre-industrial and ancient ice , often much higher than in the contemporary atmosphere ( Table 1 ) .
Fig. 2 . Concentration of CO2 in a 90 - cm long section of a Camp Century ( Greenland ) ice core .
The lower curve represents 15 min. " wet " extraction from melted ice and " dry " extraction ; the upper curve 7 hours " wet " extraction .
Redrawn after Stauffer et al ( 1981 )
For example , in 11 samples of about 185 - year - old ice from Dye 3 ( Greenland ) an average CO2 concentration of 660 ppm was measured in the air bubbles ( using the " dry " extraction method ) , with a range of 290 - 2450 ppm ( Stauffer et al 1985 ) .
In a deep ice core from Camp Century ( Greenland ) , covering the last 40,000 years , Neftel et al ( 1982 ) found CO2 concentrations in the air bubbles ranging between 273 and 436 ppm ( average 327 ppm ) .
They also found that in an ice core of similar age from Byrd Station ( Antarctica ) these concentrations ranged between 257 and 417 ppm .
Both these deep cores were heavily fractured and contaminated with drilling fluid .
Neftel et al ( 1982 ) arbitrarily assumed that " the lowest CO2 values best represent the CO2 concentrations of the originally trapped air " .
Using the same dry extraction method , in the same segment of an ice core from a depth of 1616.21 m in Dye 3 ( Greenland ) , Neftel et al ( 1983 ) found a CO2 concentration of 773 ppm in the air bubbles .
Two years later , Stauffer et al ( 1985 ) reported only about half of this concentration ( 410 ppm ) .
It appears from Table 1 that the change from high to low CO2 values reported for polar ice occurred in the middle of 1985 .
THE PERIOD OF LOW CO2 READINGS
Since 1985 , low concentrations , near a value of 290 ppm or below , started to dominate the records .
They were interpreted as indicating " the CO2 increase during the last 150 years " and " overlapping or adjacent to results from direct measurements on Mauna Loa started in 1958 " ( Stauffer and Oeschger 1985 ) .
Except for a cursory description of a few measurements in Greenland and Antarctica ( Stauffer and Oeschger 1985 ) , there were six cores analyzed for CO2 , all from Antarctica , and in all of them much lower values of CO2 were reported for pre-industrial and ancient ice than during the previous Antarctic studies ( Table 1 ) .
In all these cores the CO2 contents were determined only in gas extracted by the " dry " method from primary air bubbles or secondary air cavities , a few months to 19 years after drilling .
No information was given on the total CO2 contents of the ice itself .
A striking feature of these studies is that the sampling was started deep below the surface , and no data were presented on the recent concentration of CO2 in firm and ice deposited in the twentieth century .
The results from these younger strata are essential for estimates of temporal changes of COw levels , because they could demonstrate whether the air trapped in the firm contains the original atmospheric concentrations of CO2 .
The only study in which frozen firn samples were sealed in airtight containers before analysis demonstrated that this is not the case ( Raynaud and Delmas 1977 ) .
In the top 0 - 1 m layers of firn from Vostok Station ( mean annual temperature about - 57 ºC ) and Pionierskaya ( mean annual temperature - 37.6 ºC ) , which represent contemporary precipitation , the authors found a CO2 concentration in the interstitial air of 240 and 160 ppm respectively ( Table 1 ) .
This is much lower than in the present atmosphere , and similar to concentrations in air recovered from Antarctic ice of pre-industrial and ancient age .
These lwo CO2 concentrations are due to various processes in the ice sheet ( discussed below ) or in the firn samples .
A serious flaw of the Antarctic studies discussed here is a scanty description of the cores , and the disregard of the methodological details which bear on the interpretation of the analytical results .
We do not learn whether the cores were drilled thermally or mechanically ( Neftel et al 1985 , 1988 ; Raynaud and Barnola 1985 ; Barnola et al 1987 ) .
Even the diameters of the cores are not indicated .
This diameter is changing with time ; first it increases due to relaxation of the load pressure , and then shrinks cue to sublimation of the core during the long time that elapses between its collection and analysis .
Up to 30 % shrinking of the volume was reported for an ice core stored for 16 years at a temperature of - 20 ºC ( Ng and Patterson 1981 ) .
Information on the structure , texture and history of the cores is not presented .
Outstanding in this respect is a paper by Neftel et al ( 1985 ) in which no information at all is given on the collection of a South Pole core .
Some such flaws are discussed below .
Important information on the temperature changes during collection of the cores , their transportation from Greenland , Antarctica , or storage facilities in the United States , to laboratories in Europe or Australia , and during their long storage , are not given at all .
That such temperature changes occur may be inferred from Pearman et al ( 1986 ) who found that parts of the Law Dome core exhibited " post - coring melting " .
The Law Dome samples exposed to melting yielded significantly lower CO2 concentrations in air extracted by the " dry " method from the air bubbles .
This indicates that a proportion of the CO2 from air bubbles was dissolved in meltwater , and by subsequent refreezing ( at - 80 ºC ) of this water , was eliminated from the bubbles .
According to Etheridge et al ( 1988 ) the Siple core drilled during the Antarctic summer of 1983 / 84 and used by Neftel et al ( 1985 ) was exposed to melting , but the latter authors did not mention this in their paper .
Other cores from Siple also " melted partially during shipment " ( Alley and Bentley 1988 ) .
Increasing the temperature of polar ice cores during transportation and handling to near the melting point is probably not a rare phenomenon and was often reported ( eg Ng and Patterson 1981 ; Boutron and Patterson 1983 ; Legrand et al 1988 ) , but not by CO2 students except Etheridge et al ( 1988 ) .
Two types of Antarctic cores were analyzed in the " low readings period " : three shallow cores representing pre-industrial ice , and two deep cores reaching the ice layers deposited about 160,000 ( Vostok core ) and 50,000 ( Byrd core ) years ago .
( We do not discuss three 2 - cm long sections of the South Pole core . )
Most of these cores were drilled many years before analysis , and all were exposed to ambient atmospheres and physical and chemical changes during drilling and storage .
The results of these five studies have been used as proof of the recent increase in atmospheric CO2 and for reconstruction of its long - term variations ( eg IPCC 1990 ) .
They deserve closer examination .
SHALLOW CORES
Samples from three approximately 108-473 m long cores of pre-industrial ice were analyzed by Neftel et al ( 1975 ) , Friedli et al ( 1986 ) , Raynaud and Barnola ( 1985 ) , Pearman et al ( 1986 ) and Etheridge et al ( 1988 ) .
The samples were collected at the Siple Station ( average annual temperature - 24 ºC ) , D - 57 ( average temperature - 32 ºC ) and Law Dome - 5 ( average temperature - 22 ºC ) , from various depths starting at 68 , 89 and 72 m respectively , below the surface of the ice sheet ( Table 2 ) .
From the precipitation rate , Neftel et al ( 1985 ) estimated the age of the ice in the Siple core at 68 m to be 1890 AD , but they assumed that the air was trapped in this ice during 1962 - 1983 ( ie the air was about 90 years younger ) .
In the D - 57 core , Raynaud and Barnola ( 1985 ) found , at a depth of about 50 m , sulphur deposition from the Tambora ( Indonesia ) volcanic explosion in 1815 .
The corresponding precipitation rate was calculated to be 18 cm of ice equivalent .
Therefore the age of the ice at 89 m depth was abpit 1680 AD , but the authors assumed that the air in this ice was trapped in 1940 AD ( ie it was 260 years younger than the ice ) .
For the Law Dome - 5 core , Pearman et al ( 1986 ) and Etheridge et al ( 1988 ) gave neither the depth at which ice samples were collected nor the age of the ice .
According to a private communication by Etheridge ( 1990 ) the youngest ice was collected at - 72 m depth , and it was deposited about 1896 AD .
But they assumed that the age of air in this ice was 70 years younger ( ie it was trapped in 1966 AD ) .
The validity of these assumptions is discussed below .
The CO2 concentrations recovered from these three cores at the starting depths were 328 , 288 and 325 ppm respectively , and they were more or less systematically decreasing with increasing depth and pressure in the ice .
This is most clearly seen from the data for the Siple core ( Fig 3 ) and for the Law Dome - 5 core ( Etheridge et al , 1988 ) .
Only one explanation for these observations was offered : fossil fuel burning , although the ice samples were not from the twentieth century .
The results were interpreted as indicating " a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 ... during the second half of the nineteenth century or early twentieth century " ( Pearman et al 1986 ) , " the increase in atmosphericCO2 due to burning of fossil fuels and probably due to the anthropogenic influence on the biosphere over the nineteenth and twentieth century " ( Raynaud and Barnola 1985 ) , and that " atmospheric CO2 concentration around 1750 was 280 ppmv and had increased since , essentially because of human factors , by 22.5 % to 345 ppmv in 1984 " ( Neftel et al 1985 ) .
Another explanation for the concentration gradient decreasing with depth is considered more plausible .
As may be seen in Fig 3 , the CO2 concentration in gas recovered from air bubbles in the Siple core , between a depth of 68 and 187 m depth , where the age of the ice was 173 and 322 years BP respectively .
At a similar depth interval of 126 to 250 m in the Vostok core ( age of ice 4050 and 9320 years BP ) a similar decrease in CO2 concentration of about 8 % occurred .
The decrease in the CO2 content of ice of completely different age but exposed to similar changes in load pressure id due to three factors : differential diffusion and solubility , clathrate formation of air components in the ice sheet , and micro- fracturing of ice cores with increasing depth ( see below ) .
Different diffusion rates of CO2 into the ice lattice and liquid veins versus other air components is related to the lower molecular volume and lower gas viscosity of CO2 than for N2 , O2 and Ar. Differential diffusion occurs both in the ice sheet and in the ice cores in which the post - drilling structure disturbances are related to the depth from which the cores were recovered .
The pressure in air bubbles in cores recovered from below about 100 m depth is less than the load pressure in the ice sheet ( see section Structural Changes and Physico - chemical Processes ) .
The total gas contents in these cores were about >= 25 % lower than in those from shallower depths .
This is due to gas release from air bubbles via micro-cracks developed in ice cores recovered from below 100 m depth .
Below 100 m the frequency of cracks increases with depth .
CO2 may escape through these micro-cracks at a different rate than other gases .
Disturbances in the ice structure are associated with redistribution of the liquid phase and of the gases , which leads to differentiation of the gas composition of the air bubbles .
The solubility of CO2 in cold water increases with decreasing temperature , and at a faster rate than the solubilities of N2 and O2 increase .
At higher pressure more CO2 than other air components dissolves in the intercrystalline liquid ( Enns et al 1965 ) .
Siegenthaler et al ( 1988 ) found that the oxygen in CO2 gas inclusions of ice from three Antarctic stations had exchanged isotopes and was close to isotopic equilibrium with the ice .
They calculated that a 10 - molecular - layers thick shell of H2O around each gas inclusion permits rapid equilibration between CO2 and H2O .
This mechanism is also valid for the firn and ice strata discussed here .
In the region of load pressure between 5 and 9 bars the CO2 concentration decreases more rapidly than at greater depths ie between 9 and 15 bars .
The first steep decrease is probably due to the formation of CO2 clathrate ( solid - state hydrate : CO2+5.75H2O , which at temperatures below - 15 ºC is expected to form at a pressure of 5 bars or lower ( Takenouchi and Kennedy 1965 ) .
We assume that the location of CO2 clathrate is related to the presence of liquid water and vapour in the ice structure , because free water molecules are needed for its formation .
N2 and O2 need much higher pressures than CO2 ( above 70 and 100 bars respectively ) to enter the clathrate phase at low temperatures ( Miller 1969 ) .
When the pressure increases above 5 bars , CO2 starts to enter the clathrate form , long before N2 and O2 .
Thus differential diffusion , solubility , clathrate formation , and cracking of ice makes depletion of CO2 from the air bubbles in shallow ice cores roughly proportional to increasing pressure .
As mentioned before , the core samples studied by Pearman et al ( 1986 ) were exposed to post - coring melting , and then to a temperature of - 80 ºC .
This certainly changed the composition of the gas inclusions , making determinations unreliable for estimates of past atmospheric CO2 levels .
Raynaud and Barnola ( 1985 ) and Neftel et al ( 1985 ) observed totally different concentrations of CO2 in air bubbles from ice at the starting depths , ie lower and higher , respectively , than in the present atmosphere .
However , both groups reached the same conclusion : that their results demonstrate an anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 .
This suggests that there is bias in the interpretation of analytical results .
Jaworowski et al ( 1990a ) compared the range of analytical uncertainties with the temporal differences in CO2 concentrations in ice used in support of claims discussed above that the level of this gas has increased in the atmosphere due to man 's activity .
This " CO2 glacier signal " was in the case of Raynaud and Barnola ( 1985 ) 17 ppm , in the case of Neftel et al ( 1985 ) 49 ppm , and in the case of Pearman et al ( 1986 ) 13 ppm ( Fig 4 ) .
According to Oeschger et al ( 1985 ) the " errors " ( at assumed 68 % probability ) of single measurements of CO2 in air trapped in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica range between 11 and 24 ppm .
At an assumed 95 % probability , the " errors " of measurements reach about 47 ppm ( Fig 4 ) .
Thus the claimed signals of man-made CO2 increase are of the same magnitude as the range of uncertainty of measurements .
In air bubbles from neighbouring 1.5 cm thick slices of an Antarctic ice core , representing 6 months precipitation , the CO2 concentrations differed by 32 ppm and by 25 ppm in the same slice ( Barnola et al 1983 ) ( see discussions below ) .
It is clear from this comparison that the claims of a recent increase in atmospheric CO2 content , based on glacier studies , are not justified by the available data .
DEEP CORES
Carbon dioxide concentrations were studied in two deep cores from Antarctica collected at the Vostok station ( 126.4 - 2077.5 m below the surface ) ( Barnola et al 1987 ) and at the Byrd station ( ~600 to ~ 1900 m below the surface ) ( Neftel et al 1988 ) .
The assigned age of the ice in these cores spanned from 4050 to 159,690 years BP .
The same assumptions as for shallow cores with respect to the stability of the gas composition and air age were accepted in these studies .
The conclusions in these papers were based on an unverified assumption that the CO2 variations observed in the cores reflect the real changes in composition of the ancient atmosphere .
We challenge this assumption because new evidence indicates that the ice in the polar sheets is not a single , solid - state phase with bubbles in which the air composition is preserved indefinitely , and because the elemental and isotopic composition of air in the gas inclusions is changed by many physico - chemical processes in the ice sheets and in the ice cores .
For the Vostok core , Barnola et al ( 1987 ) provided no information as to how it was decontaminated from the drilling fluid , how deep this fluid and meltwater penetrated the core , what was the vertical and radial distribution of the micro- and macro-cracks and how the authors countered this problem , which might seriously influence their CO2 determinations .
Instead , a general statement on " the good core quality " is offered .
This statement is in disagreement with the reports of De Angelis et al ( 1987 ) and Petit et al ( 1990 ) on the poor quality of this core .
There is also a lack of important information on the time elapsed between the collection of the Vostok core and the CO2 analysis .
No information is provided on the post - drilling history of the core samples , how they were preserved , how their temperature changed during transportation , storage and analysis , and how much their volume decreased due to sublimation and evaporation .
The diameters of the sections of the Vostok core analyzed by Boutron et al ( 1988 ) of 9.1 and 10.5 cm were different than the original diameters reported for various core depths by Kudryashov et al ( 1984a ) of 8.8 and 11.1 cm.
Sublimation leads to an important loss of mass of the cores stored for longer times at about - 20 ºC .
This loss is neither controlled nor recorded , but is easily seen in the form of hoar covering the surface of the cores and deposited inside their envelopes .
Sublimation will seriously influence the isotopic composition of the ice ( Segalstad and Jaworowski , in preparation ) .
There is neither information on the disappearance of air bubbles in the ice sheet , reported at Vostok to occur below 800 m depth ( Korotkevich et al 1978 ) , nor on their re-appearance as secondary cavities in the bubble - free part of the core after its collection and decompression ( see discussion below ) .
This , among other effects , led to mixing of the gas from primary air bubbles with much larger amounts of CO2 enclosed in the ice itself .
There is no evidence for the expectation that the gas entering the secondary cavities may have the same composition as the gas in the primary bubbles , or the original ancient atmospheric composition .
Most of this criticism is valid for descriptions of other cores studied in Antarctica since 1985 .
For the Byrd core , Neftel et al ( 1988 ) presented neither information on , nor a reference to , the analytical methods used , preparation of samples , and the effects of storage of the unsealed core sections for 19 years " at different places " ( Friedli et al 1984 ) .
The data of Neftel et al ( 1988 ) show a maximum value for the CO2 concentration in air recovered from this core of about 290 ppm .
In a previous paper , much higher concentrations were reported for the same core ( Neftel et al 1982 ) .
The high readings recorded by Neftel et al ( 1982 ) in the upper part of the Byrd core of 417 and 325 ppm are omitted in the Neftel et al ( 1988 ) paper .
Figure 5 demonstrates this selection of the results .
A criterion for such data selection was the high CO2 concentration , and its discussion by Neftel et al ( 1982 , 1988 ) is rather fuzzy .
They stated that " in the larger samples ( 300g ) contamination [ with drilling fluid ] is almost inevitable and the measured CO2 concentrations tend to be higher than the air [ sic ! ] originally included in the ice " .
However , they did not measure CO2 in the air bubbles and secondary gas cavities from such larger samples , but only from 1g samples .
These small samples were used to " avoid samples with visible internal cracks " .
They stated that , in the case of small ( ~1g ) samples , their " small size meant that [ they were ] probably uncontaminated and we conclude that the lowest CO2 values best represent the CO2 concentrations of the originally trapped air " .
But they recorded both the high and the low CO2 concentrations in 1g samples , so their conclusion is neither based on analytical evidence nor logical arguments .
As discussed below , 1g ice core samples may contain about 5 healed macro-cracks .
Visual inspection is not sufficient to distunguish contaminated samples from uncontaminated ones , because invisible micro-cracks containing drilling fluid are present in the inner parts of the cores where no visible cracks were observed ( Gow and Williamson 1975 ; see also the section Macro - and Micro- cracks ) .
It is not possible to distinguish between contaminated and uncontaminated samples on the basis of their size .
Neftel et al ( 1988 ) claimed that their data revealed 30 % lower CO2 values during glacial periods than during interglacial periods .
However , the lower values are from parts of the core where many melt layers and important ice structure changes occurred ( Gow 1970 ) .
The decrease in CO2 concentrations started at 1200 m depth , where all original air bubbles disappear in the ice sheet .
Here the number of secondary cavities , an artifact appearing in the relaxed ice cores , reached its maximum .
It is from these secondary cavities and not from the original air bubbles that the gas samples with the lowest CO2 content were collected by Neftel et al ( 1988 ) .
Neftel et al ( 1988 ) stated that , in the core , " no melt features were observed " , quoting Gow ( 1968a ) in support .
ButGow ( 1970 ) found many " layers of variable thickness of refrozen meltwater up to 10 mm thick " in this core .
Apart from this , a distinctive ice crust layering ( up to about 10 layers per meter ) was observed in the firn strata , and below down to a depth of 240 m .
The formation of ice crusts involved local radiational melting ( Gow 1970 ) .
The Byrd core was contaminated with a drilling liquid composed of a mixture of trichloroethylene and diesel oil ( Gow 1971 ) and with meltwater from thermal drilling .
Neftel et al ( 1982 , 1988 ) did not mention any attempt to decontaminate the core .
This drilling liquid contaminated the core even more than the Vostok liquid ( Boutron et al 1987 ) .
Pollutants enter deep into the core through the micro- fractures , even in parts at the depth at which no visible cracks were reported ( Boutron et al 1987 ) .
Several papers provide evidence for serious contamination of deep Antarctic cores with metals and major ions ( see below ) .
The factors that caused this contamination also influenced the gas composition of the cores .
The contamination occurred along the natural capillary netowrk of liquid veins , and along a network of micro- and macro-cracks .
MACRO - AND MICRO - CRACKS
The cracks in the ice are first formed by sheeting in the bottom of " dry " and " wet " boreholes due to partial release of the load pressure ; then due to vibration or thermal shock during drilling and later due to pressure relaxation of the cores .
Macro - and micro-cracks occur in ice cores from all depths below about 100 m .
The volume of micro-cracks in deep ice cores reaches atoub 10 % of the volume of gas inclusions ( Gow 1971 ) .
It was reported that large parts of the Vostok core were " badly fractured " ( De Angelis et al 1987 ) , and that " the upper part of the core ( above 1000 m ) shows many cracks ... which may have been contaminated by drilling fluid " ( Petit et al , 1990 ) .
Between 125 and 700 m depth the core was extremely fractured ( Legrand et al 1988 ) .
This is the region where dramatic decreases in CO2 concentrations , and changes in stable isotope ratios , were observed .
In the classical papers on CO2 and stable isotopes in the Vostok core , the possibility that this decrease and these changes may be related to post - drilling effects were not considered .
To prevent the breaking of ice due to fracturing , the temperature of the Vostok core sections was increased in the laboratory to - 3 ºC for 24 hrs before analysis ( Legrand et al 1991 ) .
Such treatment of the cores must lead to redistribution of their chemical components due to thermal gradients ( Jaworowski et al 1990 b ) and the increase in volume of the liquid phase .
Deep drilling in ice sheets involves extremely brutal treatment of the ice samples .
This procedure leads to dramatic changes in the recovered cores .
We will describe here such changes using the Vostok core as an example , and the technical data on thermal drilling from Kudryashov et al ( 1984a , b, c ) and Zotikov ( 1986 ) .
The thermal drills at the Vostok station operated at working temperatures of - 60 to +120 ºC .
The power flux per unit area of the heaters was about 20 W / cm^2 , and the power consumption was 4.5 - 6 kW per heater .
The body of the heaters was made of copper and aluminium .
The speed of drilling was about 8.5 cm/min , and during 1 min about 700 ml of ice was melted .
The meltwater was mixed with a rapid stream of a hydrophobic drilling fluid .
The fluid was forced by a special device through the openings in the heater to the bottom of the borehole , and pumped out via heated tubes operated at 350 W of power per running meter length , ie a total of 600 kW for the 2000 m borehole , to avoid refreezing of the meltwater .
Due to these operational conditions , with the heater at a temperature close to the boiling point of water , the hot mixture of meltwater with the hightly contaminated drilling fluid penetrated the core via macro- and micro-cracks .
This penetration occurred at the moment of passing the heater through the bottom ice , and then in the " inner tube " of the drill , filled with the drilling fluid .
Some of its components ( eg ethylene glycol monoethl ether ) are excellent solvents for metals , and dissolve aluminium and copper from the heaters during operation at high temperatures .
The total amount of drilling fluid in the 2000 -m deep Vostok borehole was about 28 metric tons .
The drilling fluid was used to counter the load pressure on the borehole .
This , however , was never achieved completely , because the fluid level was maintained 200- 300 m below the surface of the ice sheet .
The difference between the cryostatic pressure and the drilling fluid pressure in the Vostok borehold , at any depth below 200 or 300 m , can be calculated from the densities of firn and ice between the surface and a depth of 300 m ( given by Barkov et al 1975 ; and Korotkevich et al , 1978 ) , and from the average density , 0.924 g/cm^3 , of the drilling fluid ( Kudryashov et al 1984a ) .
At a drilling fluid level of 200-300 m depth this pressure difference will be between about 15 and 24 bars , respectively .
Such a pressure difference is sufficient to cause horizontal sheeting of the ice in the bottom of the borehole , before drilling a new portion of the core .
Thus the drilling head penetrates ice which is already fractured or preconditioned for fracturing .
Cracking is also likely to be induced by thermal shock , caused by a rapidly formed steep thermal gradient , which may reach about 150 ºC across the 1.5 - cm thick ice between the surface of the heater and the ice core interior ahead of the drill ( Zotikov 1986 ) .
Sheeting is a well - known phenomenon in geology , and usually designates horizontal fracturing due to stress - releases within a rock mass .
The fractures occur approximately perpendicular to the volume extension .
Sheeting is caused by elastic relaxation of compression , which proceeds rapidly in ice .
After just a few minutes , this accounts for about a 0.2 % volume increase of ice cores ( Gow 1971 ) .
Volume changes of the order of tenths of a percent may form such stratified sheeting cracks ( Hobbs et al 1976 ) .
Sheeting also occurs in relaxed ice cores ( Jones and Johari 1977 ) , in which the volume increase may reach 0.6 % , and the ice density decreases by 2 - 9.5 kg/m^3 ( Nakawo 1986 ) or more .
Typical horizontal sheeting " stratifications " were observed in cores , starting at a depth just below 100 m , where the pressure relaxation was about 8 bars .
Narita ( 1978 ) presented photographic evidence of dense horizontal stratification comprised of thin layers in ice cores from the Mizuho station ( East Antarctica ) drilled thermally without a hole - retaining fluid .
These layers appeared below a depth of 108.25 m and were observed down to the bottom of the core at 145.35 m.
A similar " stratification " due to cracks was observed by Nakawo and Narita ( 1985 ) in samples from a 413.5 m deep Mizuho core , 1 - 2 days after core recovery .
After 2 days storage the cracks were partly healed .
Micro-cracks were revelaed by the microscope in a thin piece of specimen taken from in between two macro-cracks .
This fracturing is presented schematically in Figure 6 . Nakawo and Narita ( 1985 ) found that , below a depth of 110 m , where the samples were rich in cracks , the bubble pressure was much lower than the load pressure .
This difference was due to gas release through the cracks .
A similar pressure reduction was recorded in ice cores from various sites ( Langway 1958 ; Gow 1968 b ; Gow and Williamson 1975 ) .
In the Mizuho core the cracks were associated with up to a ~ 40 % decrease in the gas content of the ice ( Nakawo and Narita 1985 ) .
For the same Mizuho core , Narita and Nakawo ( 1985 ) reported pressure - cracked bubbles , with " brims " which might be caused by thermal shock and pressure release .
Similar crack rings , and a fissure - like distortion of the ice structure , were observed in and around relaxed air bubbles by Shoji and Langway ( 1983 ) .
Narita and Nakawo ( 1985 ) observed a substantial difference in the ice structure of cores examined within 1 month , and 1 year after recovery .
The most important textural change was in the crystal size , increasing with time , due to recrystallization .
They found that this effect was quite large , even in shallow cores from a depth of < 100 m .
An important implication of this finding is that the observations on crystal size in ice cores stored for several years before analysis represent post - drilling processes rather than the temporal distribution of crystal size in the ice sheets , which was interpreted as being related to climatic changes ( Duval and Lorius 1980 ; Petit et al 1987 ) .
One of us ( Z.J. ) observed horizontal stratification in Mizuho cores from 105.97 , 356.03 and 657.69 m depth , but not at a depth of 79.39 m .
The observation was carried out 7 - 19 years after collection of the cores , which were stored at - 20 ºC .
The horizontal strata were densely distributed throughout the whole length of the cores .
The cores revealed no macroscopic cracks when inspected on a light - table .
The strata appeared at about 2 - 5 mm intervals and were associated with delicate horizontal corrugations of the surface .
The rugae reached a depth of 0.5 - 1 mm .
The tint of the striations was different from that of the enclosing ice .
When successive concentric 1 cm thick veneers of ice were removed from each of these cores , the deformations produced at the surface were evident throughout the whole cross-section of the cores ( Fig 7 ) .
This horizontal stratification is a remnant of old cracks , completely healed by regelation .
Such cracks , before they were healed , are shown schematically in Figure 6 .
The same remnants of the old cracks are clearly visible in a photograph of the Vostok ice core published by Schneider ( 1989 ) .
The visible and invisible cracks , both in the shallow and deep cores , are an important factor influencing the CO2 content and isotopic composition of gases recovered from the gas inclusions .
CONTAMINATED DRILLING FLUIDS
In a clasic paper on the CO2 content of the Vostok core there is no information given on the method of drilling , and on its eventual effects on the state of the ice core ( Barnola et al 1987 ) .
The reader is not informed that the core was thermally drilled with a hydrocarbon liquid used in the borehold as a wall - retaining fluid ( Kudryashov et al 1984 b ) .
This " drilling fluid " consisted of a mixture of a regular military airplane fuel " TS - 1 " and a " loading material " composed of trichloroethylene , tetrachloroethylene and " Khladon - II " added for density regulation and antifreeze purposes ( Kudryashov et al 1984a ) .
According to Gielo - Klepacz ( 1991 ) , " Khladon - II " is the ethyl ether of ethylene glycol ( CH3-- CH2--O--CH2--CH2--OH ) , heavily contaminated with Zn ( dissolved from containers ) , and " TS - 1 " fuel is contaminated with resins , sulphates , inorganic acids , alkalis ( NaOH and KHO ) , traces of metals and suspended particulates .
About 0.3 mg KOH per 100 ml is usually needed to neutralize the acidity of the " TS - 1 " fuel .
As may be inferred from Koudelka ( 1964a , b ) , due to the highly increased solubility of CO2 in mixtures of organic solvents , the drilling fluid is probably enriched in CO2 from the atmosphere .
This fluid , mixed with meltwater , transferred external pollutants into the Vostok core .
CONTAMINATED ICE CORES
The traces of hydrocarbon drilling fluids contained in the macro- and micro-cracks of the ice cores may be counted as CO2 in the gas chromatograph in which a flame ionization detector converts CO2 to methane ( Stauffer et al 1981 ) .
A proportion of the hydrocarbons entering the sample chamber will be converted to methane by cracking .
This methane will mix with the methane formed from the CO2 and give apparently higher readings .
The solubility of CO2 in mixtures of water and organic solvents present in the drilling fluid is even higher than in the pure solvents ( Koudelka 1964a , b ) .
Therefore one may expect both decreases and increases of CO2 in air recovered from the ice cores , depending on the spatial patterns and history of contamination with drilling fluid .
Some of the cracks in the Vostok core , even when annealed , were identified because they contained traces of drilling fluid ( De Angelis et al 1987 ) .
These authors tried to decontaminate the core , first by an ultrasonic bath with acetone at - 15 ºC , and then by rinsing the samples with ultrapure water " until all fractures were removed " .
Legrand et al ( 1988 , 1991 ) reported that 50 - 90 % ( sic ! ) of the ice core were eliminated during a " cleaning " procedure in which the temperature of the water was about 20ºC .
As indicated by field and laboratory observations , such a procedure must lead to a dramatic redistribution and removal of the bulk of impurities from the ice samples with the meltwater .
Up to 80 % of H+ , nitrates , sulphates and heavy metals may be contained in the first 30 % fraction of water releasing some ions more quickly than others ( Gjessing et al 1976 , 1991 ; Gjessing 1977 ; Johannessen et al 1977 ; Davies et al 1982 ) , and will lead to dramatic changes in the stable isotope ratios of the remaining ice ( Segalstad and Jaworowski , in preparation ) .
The analytical results from such cores , subjected first to contamination by highly polluted drilling fluids and then to such cleaning procedures , were often used for paleo - climatological interpretations ( eg Legrand et al 1988 ; Petit et al 1990 ) .
However , they cannot be regarded as representing the original chemical composition of the ice .
An indication of the magnitude of drilling effects on the chemical composition of ice cores is the finding that Pb and Zn concentrations in the Vostok core decreased by a factor of about 10,000 and 400,000 respectively , between the surface and the centre of the core ( Boutron et al 1987 , 1990 ) .
The concentrations of Pb and Zn in surface East Antarctic snow are similar and low ( Table 3 ) .
But in the Vostok core the concentrations of Pb were found to be one to two orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations of Zn , and were 1000 and 10,000 times higher than in surface snow .
In the core sections from about 2026 m depth the concentrations of Pb were found to be 31,400 pg/g , and those of Zn 300,000 pg/ g .
Even ~3 cm inward from the surface of the Vostok core the Pb content was more than 1000 times above the level at its centre ( Boutron et al 1987 ) .
In some Vostok core sections the Pb concentrations were decreasing towards the centre of the core without showing plateaus ( Boutron et al 1988 ) .
According to Boutron et al ( 1988 ) " contamination has penetrated to the very centre of the Vostok core either during drilling , transport and storage and / or during mechanical decontamination in the laboratory " .
Other cores from shallower depths , recovered without drilling fluid , were less contaminated with Pb and Zn than the Vostok core ( Table 3 ) .
Non-heavy - metal pollutants also contaminated the Vostok core .
Even in its central parts the concentrations of SO4^2- , Na , and Al were one to two orders of magnitude higher than in the surface snow , as seen in Table 4 .
The highest contamination of the inner parts of the Vostok core with Pb , Zn , Al and Na were reported by Boutron et al ( 1987 , 1990 ) for a depth around 500 m , from where extensive cracking was reported ( Legrand et al 1988 ) ; and for a depth near 2000 m , where no visible fractures were found ( Boutron et al 1987 ) , but where micro-cracks are larger and more numerous ( Gow 1971 ) .
This indicates that contaminants penetrated via the micro-fractures or the natural capillary network of liquid at the moment of drilling or soon after , ie during pulling of the core and before the fractures were " healed " .
The high Al content at these two depths of the Vostok core were regarded by De Angelis et al ( 1987 ) , Petit et al ( 1990 ) and Jouzel et al ( 1990 ) as a dust index ( they assumed that Al represents 7 % of dust composition ) , and interpreted as indicating climatic changes .
In the light of the foregoing discussions such an interpretation does not hold , as it is obvious that the Al content was due to contamination of the cores .
Dramatic decreases in CO2 content were reported to occur at the same two depth regions of the Vostok core .
Such a distribution of metal concentrations in the cores is obviously caused by contamination from drilling fluid and mechanical devices .
However , radial redistribution of impurities in ice cores may also occur due to thermal gradients developing during drilling , transportation , storage , and handling of the cores in the laboratory .
During thermal drilling at the Vostok station , the original temperature of the ice in the core ranged between - 35 and - 57 ºC , but the core surface was exposed to a temperature near +100 ºC ( Kudryashov et al 1984a ) and then cooled again to about - 57ºC .
Post - drilling operations may increase the temperature of cores close to 0 ºC or more ( Boutron and Patterson 1983 ; Pearman et al 1986 ) .
Thus the total thermal gradients in the Vostok core may reach up to about 150ºC !
Redistribution of major ions , acids and several inorgainc radioactive tracers was observed in firn and ice samples exposed to a thermal gradient of - 21 to - 1 ºC ( Jaworowski et al 1990 b ) .
Also , Satow and Watanabe ( 1985 ) observed substantial changes in the isotopic composition of oxygen in a block of Antarctic firn after it was exposed to a small thermal gradient in the laboratory .
This discussion indicates that attempts to find the " true " concentration of gases , metals , or other substances in deep ice cores , must be regarded as a very difficult and rather unreliable exercise .
The reason is that all deep ice cores have been exposed to high contamination , thermal gradients and structural disturbances .
DISCREPANCIES IN DEEP CORE DATA
The CO2 concentrations found in air bubbles and in secondary air cavities of deep Vostok and Byrd cores range between 178 and 296 ppm ie much below the current atmospheric level .
These values were interpreted as representing the real composition of the ancient atmosphere and past climatic changes .
This would mean that the current level of the gas , about 350 ppm , is a new and unique phenomenon , and that during the past 160,000 years the atmospheric C02 level never approached the current value , not even some 65,000 and 110,000 years ago when the global sea-surface temperature was 2 - 3 º
C higher than now ( Shackleton and Opdyke 1973 ; Ruddiman 1985 ; Ruddiman and Raymo 1988 ) , or 6000 years ago when the air temperature between 60 and 75 ºN was 4.5 ºC higher than now ( Zubakov and Borzehkova 1990 ) .
If this low ancient C02 atmospheric level were true , it would mean that this gas had no influence on past climatic warmings , and that these warmings did not increase its atmospheric level by , for example , degassing from a warmer ocean .
There are numerous contradictions between the isotopic and CO2 records from deep Antarctic and Greenland ice cores .
For example , glacier isotopic data have been taken to indicate that the present warmer period occurred in Antarctica several thousand yers earlier than in the Northern Hemisphere ( Radok 1985 ) .
This is obviously not a realistic estimate .
The rapid variations of CO2 concentrations of 50 - 70 ppm , observed by Stauffer et al ( 1984 ) in Dye 3 and Camp Century ( Greenland ) ice cores from a period 30,000 to 40,000 years BP , are not similar to the much smaller variations in the Antarctic Byrd cores ( Neftel et al 1988 ; Oeschger et al 1988 ) or Vostok cores ( Barnola et al 1987 ) .
13C/12C ratio in the carbon dissolved in the deep ocean was lower during the glacial than interglacial times , suggesting higher atmospheric CO2 content during the glacial time ( Shackleton 1977 ) .
This is contrary to the ice core data indicating that the atmospheric level of CO2 was substantially lower in the glacial period than today .
To increase the CO2 content from 200 ppm in the glacial period to 275 ppm in the interglacial by warming the surface ocean would require a 10 ºC increase in sea surface temperature .
However the faunal record in ocean sediments indicate that the interglacial sea surface temperature warming was only 1.7ºC ( Broecker and Peng 1986 ) .
We agree with Broecker and Peng 's statement that " one way out of this dilemma would be to challenge the validity of the ice - core - based glacial to interglacial atmospheric CO2 change " .
The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 during the last glaciation , deduced from ice core measurements , was explained by more efficient " biological pumping " of carbon into deep oceanic waters , due to increased bioproductivity of the ocean ( Martin 1990 ) .
However , records of the accumulation rates of diatom shells , the ration of germanium to silicon in diatomaceous opal , and the carbon isotope ration in foraminiferal carbonate indicate lower productivity during the last glaciation ( Mortlock et al 1991 ) .
According to Barnola et al ( 1987 ) the levels of CO2 in the global atmosphere during many tens of thousands of years spanning 30,000 to 110,000 BP were below 200 ppm .
If this were true then the growth of C3 plants should be limited at the global scale because their net photosynthesis is depressed as the CO2 concentration in air decreases to less than ~250 microbar ( less than ~ 250 ppmv ) ( McKay et al 1991 ) .
This would lead to the extinction of C3 plant species .
This has , however , not been recorded by paleobotanists ( Manum 1991 ) .
Stauffer et al ( 1984 ) noticed a serious discrepancy in their own analytical results from Dye 3 ( Greenland ) : a lack of lag between their CO2 and delta - 18O data which should be observed if the results were representing the ancient atmosphere .
According to Fairbanks ( 1990 ) the assertion based on the delta - 18O anomaly in the Dye 3 ( Greenland ) ice core that the climate during the Younger Dryas ( 10,000 to 11,000 years BP ) rapidly shifted ( within less than a century ) into and out of " glacial conditions " has been repeated so often that many believe it has been firmly established .
This author , however , found from corrected 14C data that the end of the delta - 18O anomaly in Dye 3 is neither correlative with the end of the Younger Dryas climatic event identified in pollen records as marking vegetation changes is Europe , nor with its dating based on marine faunal indices .
Also , data from the Byrd core ( Antarctica ) do not show the rapid delta - 18O changes indicating warm periods ( Oeschger et al 1988 ) .
Robin ( 1985 ) pointed out that the paleotemperature changes reconstructed from the Vostok ice dated 106,000 to 116,000 BP do not agree with other ice , marine and terrestrial data .
Perhaps even more serious is the discrepancy in CO2 data for Antarctic cores from the Byrd and Vostok stations .
The first important decrease in CO2 concentrations occurred in the Byrd core between about 500 and 600 m depth ( Neftel et al 1982 ) , and in the Vostok core at a similar depth of about 400 m .
But the assigned age of the ice in both these cores is totally different : 1500 - 1600 years BP in the Byrd core , and 18,000 years BP in the Vostok core .
The second CO2 decrease , of about 50 ppm , occurred in the Byrd core in a region between 950 and 1200 m depth , where the age of the ice was about 8000 to 14,000 years BP .
In the Vostok ice of this age ( at about 250 - 300 m depth ) , CO2 concentrations were rather stable , and in the ice deposited 12,000 to 16,000 years ago were higher by about 60 ppm than in the Byrd core .
On the other hand , at a depth of about 1100 - 1150 m the CO2 concentrations were similar in the Byrd and Vostok cores ( about 235 ppm ) , although the assigned age of the ice differed by about 65,000 years .
An ad hoc attempt to explain some of these discrepancies by Oeschger et al ( 1988 ) by : ( 1 ) " a process which has not yet been identified " , ( 2 ) wrong modelling , and ( 3 ) " not overlapping time intervals , perhaps due to rheological irregularities " is ambiguous and inconclusive .
All these similarities and differences are rather fortuitous , as they are due to artifacts in the ice sheets and in the ice cores .
In some cases these artifacts have a random distribution , but they may also depend on processes related to depth in the ice sheet , and therefore show some regularities .
AGE OF AIR IN ICE
The validity of the hypothesis that the age of the occluded air is younger than that of the ice matrix is of crucial importance for the estimates of CO2 levels in the pre-industrial atmosphere .
This hypothesis was proposed by Berner et al ( 1980 ) who assumed that for Greenland the typical age difference is 200 years .
The hypothesis was then accepted by Craig and Chou ( 1982 ) who assumed that the air trapped in ice at 68 m depth at Dye 3 ( Greenland ) is 90 years younger than the age of the ice .
Schwander and Stauffer ( 1984 ) elaborated the hypothesis and estimated the age difference for eight Greenland and Antarctic sites ranging from 90 to 2800 years .
It should be noted that the hypothesis is purely speculative , neither based on experimental nor empiric evidence , and has an ad hoc flavour .
The hypothesis was based on the assumption that the air in the porous firn strata is well mixed with the atmosphere at least down to the beginning of the firn-ice transition .
Furthermore , is was assumed that air trapped in the ice sheets is isolated from the atmosphere only after a complete enclosure of air bubbles , at an ice density of 0.83 g/cm^3 .
At the Antarctic ice sheet this density is reached between about 50 and 100 m depth ( Gow 1968a ; Watanabe et al 1978 ; Barnola et al 1987 ) .
To satisfy this assumption the condition is needed that the whole firn column , down to the density level of 0.83 g/ cm^3 , is devoid of layers impermeable to air .
It was believed that this condition can be met at the cold Antarctic sites with mean annual temperatures of about - 24 ºC , where , as was assumed , no summer melting occurs .
This supposition is not true , as radiational melting was observed in Antarctica even at locations with summer temperatures near - 20 ºC ( see section Liquid in Ice ) , and the existence of thick melt layers and thin ice crusts was reported from many Antarctic localities ( the Siple , Byrd , Mizuho and Vostok stations ) with mean annual temperatures ranging from - 24 to about - 57ºC .
At the Siple station ( mean annual temperature - 24 ºC ) , Neftel et al ( 1985 ) reported the existence of one 10 - mm thick melt layer at a depth of 7 m .
But from the Siple Coast ( mean annual temperature - 26.5 ºC )
Alley and Bentley ( 1988 ) reported nine melt layers , some of them more than 20 mm thick , distributed randomly in a 100 m deep core .
At the Byrd station , hundreds of thin ice layers were reported from several cores by Gow ( 1968a ) .
At this site , layers of bubble - free ice , up to 1 mm thick , were reported to occur in the firn with a frequency ranging from one to eight layers per metre .
These ice crusts could be identified in cores from as deep as 240 m ( Gow 1968a ) .
Several refrozen melt layers up to 100 mm thick were observed in the Byrd core at between 1300 and 1700 m depth ( Gow 1970 ) .
One of the proponents of this hypothesis stated that " the ice layers do not cover a large region continuously but are more or less frequently interrupted by holes or dislocations .
According to my knowledge , there exist no extensive investigations on the geometry of ice layers " ( Schwander 1989 ) .
But meticulous Japanese studies , covering a vast Antarctic region , indicate the opposite .
At the Mizuho station , Watanabe et al ( 1978 ) observed ice layers with a frequency of about 5 to 15 per metre down to a depth of 110 m .
A stratigraphic study of several metres thick upper firn strata at 38 sites in Enderby Land ( Northeastern Antarctica ) was carried out by Watanabe ( 1977 ) along a traverse reaching about 1200 km inland and an altitude up to 3382 m , where the average annual air temperature is - 48 ºC .
This study demonstrated that ice layers are ubiquitous within the Antarctic ice sheet .
They form a complex multilayer structure in which merging neighbouring layers separate firn in horizontal pockets ( Fig 8 ) .
Watanabe ( 1977 ) found that the ice layers maintain their continuity along the whole studied cross-section of firn , and that they continue horizontally for at least several tens of kilometers ( Watanabe 1978 ) .
In a 6 m deep snow and firn layer at the Vostok station , eight sun ice crusts and 19 wind crusts were found by Kotlyakov ( 1961 ) .
A well - defined stratification was also observed in the Vostok core down to several tens of metres below the surface ( Korotkevich et al 1978 ) .
In the top 200 cm of firn at a site at Dronning Maud Land ( Antarctica ) , where the mean annual temperature is about - 19.2
ºC ( Orheim et al 1986 ) , Repp ( 1978 ) found several 1 - 2 cm thick ice layers , some of them clustered together to a total thickness of 6 cm .
In very cold regions , thin sun ice crusts , about 1 mm thick , form near the surface of the firn due to insolation and refreezing of water vapour , evaporated or sublimated from ice crystals below .
The vapour migrates upwards along the decreasing temperature gradient , and condenses in the interstices between grains of cold snow at the surface or below a less permeable glaze or sublimation crust .
These processes are discussed in detail by Gow ( 1968a ) and illustrated in Figure 9 .
The changes in the state of H2O in these processes have an important impact on the stable isotope , elemental and molecular composition of ice and of air entrapped in it .
The load pressure in the firn forces the air up through the leaks in the thin ice layers .
This permanent upward stream of air prevents atmospheric air from penetrating downwards through the laminated structure of firn .
As proof of the " age of air " hypothesis , Schwander and Stauffer ( 1984 ) cited measurements of radioactive atmospheric trace gases in polar ice cores of Loosli ( 1983 ) , and stated that " 39 A r measurements provide evidence that the air in the open pore volume is well mixed at least down to the beginning of the firn- ice transition " .
However , the results in Loosli's ( 1983 ) paper indicate the opposite .
At 70 m depth at Dye 3 ( Greenland ) , the age of natural racioactive 38 Ar gas trapped in air bubbles was about 70 years , ie the same as the age of the ice determined by other methods .
Also , at a depth of about 100 m at the Byrd station ( Antarctica ) the age of the air measured by the 39 Ar method was the same as the age of the ice estimated from the precipitation rate ( Oeschger et al 1977 ) .
However , all these argon age determinations were highly uncertain , because Loosli ( 1983 ) found that all ice samples were contaminated by ambient air , and even in the 3000 years old ice of high density , the total measured 39 Ar activity has to be attributed to contamination by atmospheric air during field and laboratory processing .
By measuring 85 Kr , a radioactive gas produced in nuclear reactors and bomb explosions , Loosli ( 1983 ) demonstrated that up to 36 % ambient air was found in gas samples extracted from ice cores .
These cores were stored for about 8 - 13 years before analysis , and exposed to the ambient atmosphere .
This finding has an important implication .
It indicates that unsealed ice cores , such as those used for CO2 and stable isotope measurements , are contaminated by ambient air .
Some of these cores were even exposed to cigarette smoke ( Jaworowski et al 1990a ) , which indicates that contamination problems are not seriously considered in gas analysis of ice cores .
Discussing the age of entrapped air , Schwander ( 1989 ) did not quote Loosli ( 1983 ) , and stated instead , incorrectly , that " at present no data from [ radioactive atmospheric ] tracer methods are yet available " .
He also , rightly , did not quote the circular argument of Neftel et al ( 1985 ) that the same concentrations of CO2 found in the recent South Pole atmosphere and in air bubbles trapped in nineteenth century Antarctic ice prove that air from bubbles is 82 years younger than the ice .
This finding suggests rather that the atmospheric CO2 concentration 82 years ago was the same as now .
Craig et al ( 1988a ) revoked their earlier assumption that trapped air at Dye 3 is 90 years younger than the ice in which it is sealed ( Craig and Chou 1982 ) .
They stated that results of their isotopic measurements of methane recovered from the Greenland ice " preclude such a large difference in age " .
Craig et al ( 1988b ) observed enrichments of 15N and 18O isotopes and of N2 and O2 in air trapped in polar firn strata effects resulting from molecular diffusion and other processes .
This strongly indicates that the air in porous firn is protected from convective and other motions .
The above discussion demonstrates that the hypothesis that entrapped air is much younger than the ice enclosing it disagrees with glaciological evidence .
In polar ice sheets , the air in firn is isolated from the atmosphere by several hundred thin ice layers , before the firn pores close off completely at the firn-ice transition .
This means that the age of the gas in a primary air bubble is approximately the same as the age of the ice that encloses it .
This hypothesis was posed at the time when the CO2 concentration in air bubbles from ice deposited in the nineteenth century or earlier was found to be similar to the current atmospheric level .
The ad hoc hypothesis was needed to make this finding consistent with the man -made global warming paradigm .
This is shown in Figure 10a , which illustrates that the CO2 concentrations in pre-industrial ice from Antarctica were made to overlay exactly the recent atmospheric concentrations at Mauna Loa ( Hawaii ) ( Siegenthaler and Oeschger 1987 ) .
Figure 10a was prepared in connection with " model calculations that are based on the assumption that the atmospheric [ CO2 ] increase is due only to fossil CO2 input " and other human activities .
The curve in this figure is gased on data of Neftel et al ( 1985 ) and Friedli et al ( 1986 ) from the Siple ice core , which was partially melted during transportation .
The overlaying was done after assuming that the age of the air is 95 years younger than the ice .
However , as shown in Figure 10b , without this speculative assumption the Mauna Loa and Siple data do not overlay .
Rather than representing past atmospheric changes , the ice CO2 concentrations in the Siple core decrease with increasing load pressure up to about 15 bars , due to clathrate formation , differential dissolution of gases in the liquid water at the surface of ice crystals , and other processes in the ice sheet and in the ice core .
As discussed above , studies at other locations , carried out before 1985 , recorded higher CO2 levels in air from pre-industrial ice than in that from both the Siple core and at Mauna Loa .
Figure 10a was reproduced in countless publications and used as proof that the burning of fossil fuels , deforestation and changing land use by man have changed the global carbon cycle very significantly during the last two centuried .
The figure was used as the basis for other speculative estimates of changes in the global carbon cycle ( eg Bolin et al 1989 ) .
It is in this context that one should not that Figure 10a does not represent real CO2 changes in the global atmosphere , but rather processes in the ice sheets , artifcacts in the partially melted ice core , and unsubstantiated assumptions on the age of air inclusions .
It is astonishing that such non-representative and misleading data have been so widely and uncritically accepted .
CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF TRAPPED AIR
The trapping of CO2 in glaciers starts in the atmosphere when this gas associates with snowflakes by dissolution in water droplets prior to freezing , and in a liquid present at the surface of the flakes , and by adsorption onto crystal surfaces .
A liquid containing sulphuric acid is incorporated into snow crystals as a film on a solid nucleus or added by riming , and it is expected to remain as a liquid on the outside of the ice grain crystals ( Wolff et al 1988 ) .
About 2 - 3 % ( by weight ) of supercooled liquid water may be mixed within the entire mass of snowflakes ( Matsuo and Miyake 1966 ) .
The mechanisms of in - cloud and below - cloud scavenging of gases by supercooled water were reviewed by Davidson ( 1989 ) .
The presence of liquid water in polar ice sheets is supposedly the main factor involved in suppressing the seasonal acidity peaks in Pleistocene ice ( Hammer et al 1985 ) , and in rapid smoothing in the upper strata and obliteration of deltaD and delta18O short - term variations in ice older than 10,000 years ( eg Langway 1967 ; Dansgaard 1977 ; Johnsen 1977 ; Grootes et al 1990 ) .
Dissolution and adsorption of CO2 continues after deposition of snow on the glacier .
Due to large solubility differences of particular air gases , the composition of air trapped within snow changes at this early stage and during firnification .
At high pressures deep in the ice sheets , the equilibrium pressures of gases dissolved in water increase at different rates , and are higher for CO2 than for other air gases ( Enns et al 1965 ) .
Therefore , one may expect that the composition of the air trapped in firn and ice will be different from that in the atmosphere : the air bubbles will be depleted in CO2 ; and the O2 / N2 and Ar / N2 rations will be changed in the whole ice and in the air bubbles .
Several in situ processes in the ice sheets and in the cores cause changes in the composition of entrapped gases .
Both types of processes depend on pressure and temperature varying with depth in the ice sheets .
Therefore , on may expect that these changes should reveal some regularities at a greater vertical or temporal scale .
At a smaller vertical scale , or the order of a few metres or centimeters , and also at the same horizons , one should expect a random distribution of these changes .
These processes usually lead to a low CO2 content of voids in the firn and bubbles in the ice .
They were also reflected in large local fluctuations in CO2 concentrations in air bubbles collected from a 30 cm long ice core from Dome C ( Antarctica ) , where annual precipitation is 3.6 cm water equivalent .
The precision of determinations was 3 % .
The ice samples ( 1 - 2 g ) were taken from 1.5 cm thick slices of core , ie about two slices per year of ice accumulation .
The concentration of CO2 fluctuated by more than 13 % ( 32 ppm ) between neighbouring slices , and by about 10 % ( 25 ppm ) in the same slice ( Barnola et al 1983 ) .
As mentioned before , these fluctuations are twice as high as the " CO2 glacier signal " used in support of claims of anthropogenic increase of this gas , and they certainly do not reflect the atmospheric fluctuations in the same year .
Oeschger et al ( 1985 ) stated that various processes could lead to insignificant CO2 enrichments in ice of not more than 10 ppm , and that " the analysis of the N2 / O2 / Ar ratios in ice originating from very cold areas with no summer melting shows that , within experimental uncertainty , the measured ratios agree with those in air " ( Raynaud and Delmas 1977 ) .
But Raynaud and Delmas ( 1977 ) interpreted their analytical results from the Pionerskaya and Vostok stations differently : " par rapport a la composition atmospherique ... les effets observes sont donc faibles mais significatifs et indiquent un appauvrissement relatif des teneurs en O2 et Ar " .
In the interstitial air pumped from the upper firn layer at these two stations , Raynaud and Delmas ( 1977 ) found negative enrichment , corresponding to delta O2 / N2 , and delta Ar / N2 values of - 5.3 and - 0.11 %o [ permil ] in comparison with the free atmosphere .
As mentioned before , they also found CO2 depletion of about 90 ppm in interstitial air from recent firn at Vostok and 170 ppm at Pionierskaya .
Large negative and positive enrichments of heavy gases ' ( O2 and Ar ) ratios to N2 were reported by Craig et al ( 1988b ) in air recovered from Antarctic and Greenland cores .
The values for deltaO2 / N2 ranged from - 14 to +3.5 %o [ permil ] and those for delta Ar / N2 from - 7 to +4.2 %o [ permil ] .
The authors suggested that differential capillary flow during the loss of gas from core samples via micro-cracks is responsible for this effect .
In the early studies it was found that the concentration of O2 in ice from Greenland and Antarctica decreases with depth , and that the concentration of N2 increases ( Lorius et al 1968 ; Alder et al 1969 ) .
This may be due to gravitational separation of heavier and lighter gas molecules ( O2 , mol . wt .
=31.9988 ; N2 , mol. wt. = 28.0134 ) in the porous firn .
Also , Horibe et al ( 1985 ) found negative enrichment for delta O2 / N2 and deltaAr / N2 in an ice core from Camp Century ( Greenland ) .
These authors reported depletion of oxygen by up to 1.5 % in air bubbles trapped in the 20,000 years old ice , in comparison with the ambient atmosphere ; the depletion increased with depth in the ice sheet between 559 and 1248 m .
The results of measurements of N2 , O2 , Ar and CO2 trapped in ice , compiled in Table 5 , indicate that the composition of air in the whole ice and in the air bubbles differs greatly from that in the atmosphere , both in temperate glaciers and in polar ice sheets .
LIQUID IN ICE
Faraday ( 1850 ) postulated that a thin water layer exists on ice surfaces at temperatures below the melting point .
Later it was found that snow and ice consist of crystals , separated by thin films of intercrystalline brine , which contains soluble impurities ( Buchanan 1908 ) .
But it was only recently recognized that this phenomenon also occurs at very low temperatures .
Large numbers of under-ice puddles of meltwater were found in Antarctica at a depth of 10 - 20 cm below the surface of sea ice .
The puddles , up to 70 cm deep , were formed at a mean air temperature of - 2 ºC , and the temperature of meltwater under the ice cover in the puddles reached up to +10 ºC .
The mode of formation of the puddles suggested that the cause of their formation was sun radiation absorbed in the interior of the ice ( Endo 1970 ) .
In Dronning Maud 's Land ( Antarctica ) a firn layer , soaked with liquid water , was observed at a site where the average annual temperature is about - 19 ºC ( Repp 1978 ) .
Large amounts of meltwater were also found in ponds at a depth of about 1 m under the ice surface in Dronning Maud Land , at an altitude of about 1200 m , where the summer air temperature was below - 20
ºC ( Hagen 1991 ) .
This phenomenon may contribute to the formation of impermeable layers in the firn in very cold regions of Antarctica and to the redistribution of CO2 .
Field observations have shown the existence of unfrozen water in porous media at temperatures between - 30 and - 50 ºC ( Anderson and Morgenstern 1973 ) .
This has been attributed to various mechanisms , including diploar forces , density variations and pressure melting of ice ( Dash 1989 ) .
Thermodynamic models suggested that a layer of a definite thickness , with properties similar to those of the surface of liquid water , exists at the surface of ice crystals to a temperature of - 15 ºC ( Fletcher 1973 ) .
Nye and Frank ( 1973 ) proposed that liquid water in ice is located at the triple junctions between the crystals which form an interconnecting network in the ice .
The presence of a quasi - liquid layer on the surface of ice crystals at a temperature of about - 35 ºC was postulated by Orem and Adamson ( 1969 ) on the basis of N2 adsorption studies .
Alsok Ocampo and Klinger ( 1982 ) deduced from CO2 adsorption onto ice that the ice surface is covered by a quasi- liquid layer at temperatures above - 35 ºC .
The existence of a quasi - liquid in ice was detected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy .
With this method Kvilidze et al ( 1970 ) , Bell et al ( 1971 ) and Kvilidze et al ( 1974 ) demonstrated that liquid water is present in ice down to temperatures of about - 13 ºC .
Photoemission studies with ultraviolet radiation ( Nason and Fletcher 1975 ) provided evidence for the presence of a water - like layer on the surface of ice down to - 160 ºC .
This layer becomes progressively thinner as the temperature decreases .
The thickness of this layer was estimated to range between a few nanometers and a few tens of nanometers ( Golecki and Jaccard 1978 ) .
We postulate that such a layer covers the inner surfaces of air bubbles in ice sheets and the secondary gas cavities in ice cores , and that it contibutes to the depletion of CO2 from the gas inclusions and to isotopic equilibration of gases with the ice .
This is in agreement with the observed oxygen isotope equilibration between CO2 gas inclusions in ice and H2O observed by Siegenthaler et al ( 1988 ) .
These authors asked the question whether this could be due to the existence of a liquid - like layer at the air - bubble - ice interface .
Maccagnan ( 1981 ) and Maccagnan and Duval ( 1982 ) proposed , on the basis of direct current conductivity measurements , that the liquid in polar glacier ice is a water - sulphuric / nitric acid mixture , located at the ice grain boundaries .
A model study by Wolff and Paren ( 1984 ) suggested that these mixtures are located at triple junctions between ice crystals .
This vein system may provide a means of draining liquids out of ice sheets .
Liquid sulphuric acid in deeply frozen glacier ice was discovered by Mulvaney et al ( 1988 ) .
By scanning electron microscopy and X - ray spectra they found that high concentrations of sulphuric acid are located at the triple junctions , but they could not rule out the presence of some liquid in films at two - grain boundaries .
This study , performed on 125 - year - old ice from the Antarctic Peninsula , indicates that the concentration of sulphuric acid in the veins may range between 2.5 and 4.9 M .
At this higher concentration the acid - water mixture may remain liquid down to the eutectic temperature of - 73 ºC .
Sulphuric and nitric acids are common impurities in polar ice sheets .
Studies by Wolff and Paren ( 1984 ) and Mulvaney ( 1988 ) indicate that most of these impurities are eliminated from the ice crystal lattice and located as a highly concentrated brine in the intercrystalline veins .
As may be seen from a photograph in the paper by Mulvaney et al ( 1988 ) the air bubbles are intersected by these veins and films .
This provides conditions for diffusion of gas from bubbles to or from the intergranular liquid .
When alkaline dust neutralizes acids in the liquids contained in ice , the resulting salt - H2O mixtures may cause freezing point depressions .
The extent of the freezing depression is dependent on the types and concentrations of salts in the intercrystalline brines ; polyvalent ions will generally depress the freezing poinf further than monovalent ions ( Shepherd et al 1985 ) .
For example , the experimentally determined freezing point depression for the NaCl - CaCl2 - H2O system was found to reach - 51 ºC at 30.59 % salinity ( Oakes et al 1990 ) .
From a low salinity water - salt solution , pure H2O ice will precipitate with decreasing temperature , hence decreasing the volume and increasing the salt concentration of the brine .
In sea ice , for a temperature range of - 0.1 to - 54 ºC , a brine volume decreas by a factor of 320 was found by Assur ( 1958 ) .
From nuclear magnetic resonance and chemical analyses it has been found that such a brine can maintain its liquid state down to - 70 ºC ( Nelson and Thompson 1954 ; Richardson and Keller 1966 ; see also review by Weeks and Ackley 1982 ) .
One may expect that , at greater depths in the Antarctic ice sheet , where the temperature increases , for example , by 21 ºC at 2040 m depth at Vostok ( Vostretsov et al 1984 ) , and by 21 ºC at 1700 m depth at the Byrd station ( Gow and Williamson 1976 ) , salinity and acidity will decrease as more H2O enters the liquid phase .
This will lead to a volume increase of intercrystalline voids containing brine .
As a first approximation , one may infer from the data of Assur ( 1958 ) that this volume increase factor could be near 100 at a depth of about 2000 m at Vostok , considering a brine with similar ionic composition as that of standard sea ice .
The depression of the freezing point of brine ( salinity 27 - 35 % o permil ) under a load pressure has a slope of about - 0.0076 º C / bar ( Fujino et al 1974 ) .
Therefore , and because of increasing temperature with depth , one may expect that deep in the ice sheet there will be melting of the ice .
On a macro - scale the brine migrates downward in the ice sheets due to gravity and the density differences between ice and brine .
Under a temperature gradient the brine in the veins will tend to migrate toward higher temperatures , ie downward , because the brine density will be higher at lower than at higher temperatures ( Leeder et al 1987 ) .
The permeable ice acts as a sieve for the brine , thereby redistributing elements , isotopes and micro-particulates .
The drainage may contribute in part to the formation of pockets of lakes of liquid water below ice sheets , observed by radio - echo sounding in Eastern Antarctica ( Oswald and Robin 1973 ) and near Vostok ( Zotikov 1986 ) .
Budd et al ( 1971 ) calculated near basal temperatures of - 23.5 ºC to - 26.2 ºC in the Vostok region .
Vostretsov et al ( 1984 ) measured temperatures in the Vostok borehole down to a depth of about 2000 m.
Linear extrapolation of these latter data to a depth of 3700 m gives a basal temperature of about - 4 ºC .
Oswald and Robin ( 1973 ) reported a marked increase in radar echo strength of 10 - 20 dB ( decibel ) as the radar signals moved from the ice to the sub - sheet lakes .
The reflection coefficient fom an ice - pure water interface would be around - 3 dB , while the reflection coefficient from an ice - rock interface would be - 14 to - 20 dB ( Oswald and Robin 1973 ) .
The increased radar echo strength means that the radar signals were reflected from a medium with a much higher conductivity than ice or pure water .
This medium could be saline water , moraine , clay , graphite - rich rocks , ore minerals , or a mixture of such materials ( Segalstad 1985 ) .
Because the radar echo targets are extraordinarily smooth and have an area of up to 8000 km ^2 ( Drewry 1987 ) , they probably represent a substantial layer of liquid water in the form of sub - sheet lakes ( Oswald and Robin 1973 ) .
This water will have to be saline to be such a strong radar reflector .
Using the data of Fyfe ( 1964 ) , Fujino et al ( 1974 ) and Potter ( 1978 ) on freezing point depression versus salinity and pressure , one can calculate that for a temperature of - 4 ºC in such lakes the corresponding salinity should be about 4 % ( weight ) NaCl equivalents at the 3700 m basal ice depth at Vostok , under a pressure of about 330 bars .
The salt solution is not likely to consist of dissolved NaCl only , but rather a mixture of different dissolved mono - and multi-valent salts .
Gow et al ( 1968 ) detected pressurized liquid water at the ice - rock interface beneath the ice sheet at the Byrd station at a depth of 2164 m .
Its chemical composition was not determined , but its specific conductance of 45 micro - mho / cm^2 was higher than that of melted ice ( 1.7 - 3.1 micro-mho / cm ^ 2 ) .
Changes in salt concentrations influence the solubility of gases in the brine .
Yasumishi and Yoshida ( 1979 ) found that the solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions of electrolytes commonly present in polar ice decreases slightly with increasing concentration of salts .
The decreasing salinity and increasing intercrystalline brine volume at great depths in the ice sheet may be partly responsible for the observed variation in the CO2 content of the gas inclusions from Antarctic cores .
The discovery of a liquid phase in ice at very low temperatures is extremely important .
It indicates that , in ice sheets , even in the coldest regions , there is a quasi- infinite network of liquid - filled veins in which dissolved substances and suspended micro-particles can migrate and interact .
The use of Antarctic and Greenland ice cores for studies on the chemical and isotopic composition of the atmosphere of past epochs is based on the assumption that cold polar ice sheets lack a liquid phase .
Therefore , diffusion effects and mass transport in the fluid phase were ignored , and it was generally accepted that Antarctic ice can preserve unchanged the original composition of entrapped gas for long periods of time .
Recent studies have provided convincing evidence that this fundamental assumption is wrong .
STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROCESSES
Changes caused by increasing load pressure in the ice sheets , and by its relaxation in the ice cores , are of great importance for understanding processes that influence the elemental and isotopic composition of air inclusions in the ice .
Some of the processes are listed in Table 6 , and their effects are illustrated in Figure 11 .
We discuss them in relation to concentrations of CO2 recorded in the Vostok core .
Most of the arguments for the Vostok core are also valid for the CO2 record in a 1900 m deep Byrd core ( Neftel et al 1988 ) and for other deep cores .
A striking feature of the data shown in Fig. 11 is that the vertical distribution of CO2 concentrations is similar to the distribution of brittle cracks , pressure of air inclusions in relaxed cores , core volume expansion , crystal size , and disappearance of primary air bubbles and formation of secondary cavities .
Such similarities strongly suggest that the concentrations of CO2 in the gas recovered from the Vostok core are artifacts caused by in situ and post - coring processes .
A total disappearance of primary air bubbles in the ice sheet was observed at the Byrd station by Gow et al ( 1968 ) and Gow ( 1971 ) below a depth of 1200 m .
The secondary gas cavities reappeared in the bubble - free deep ice cores after the load pressure was removed by drilling ( Fig 11 ) .
Miller ( 1969 ) postulated that the formation of air clathrates causes the disappearance of air bubbles at greater depths in polar ice sheets , and that the reappearance of the secondary gas cavities is caused by dissociation of clathrates .
He predicted that N2 and O2 clathrates start to form at a temperature of - 30 ºC at depths of 850 and 600 m , respectively .
This was confirmed by Shoji and Langway ( 1982 , 1983 ) , who found that air clathrates appeared at Dye 3 ( Greenland ) near a depth of 994 m .
They also found that secondary gas cavities , having irregular shapes , were gradually forming by dissociation of single clathrate inclusions during 86 and 180 hours after core cutting in the borehole .
The newly formed cavities grew exponentially with time , driven by high O2 and N2 clathrate dissociation pressures in the decompressed cores .
The N2 / O2 composition ratio of the clathrates trapped in deep ice cores collected at Dye 3 ( Greenland ) was 1.7 , ie markedly lower than the N2 / O2 ratio of 4 in atmospheric air .
This is because oxygen molecules form hydrate clathrates earlier and at shallower depth than nitrogen molecules ( Nakahara et al 1988 ) .
This separation mechanism changes the elemental composition of clathrates and that of the gas in the air bubbles .
The depth compression of ice is relaxed elastically before the cores reach the surface ( Gow 1971 ) .
At the Byrd station this period of relaxation results in a volume increase of about 0.2 % for near - bottom samples .
Subsequent relaxation of the load pressure occurs in the cores over a longer period , and is governed by the bubbliness of the ice and orientation of the ice crystals .
This relaxation may cause up to 0.6 % expansion of the volume of the core ( Fig 11 ) .
Gow ( 1971 ) found that the volume expansion and decrease in ice density after relaxation was accompanied by more than a two - fold dilation of pressurized air bubbles in which disk - like cracks were formed intersecting the air bubbles .
The cores still continued to relax 27 months after they were drilled .
Sections of the Byrd core from depths between 400 and 900 m exhibited brittle fractures .
These stressed cores tended to fracture at the slightest mechanical shock .
The ice contained abundant air bubbles ( Fig 11 ) , in which the air pressure in situ was between 40 and 80 bars , decreasing to about 15 bars 1 year after drilling ( Gow and Williamson 1975 ) .
In the Vostok core , fractured ice was already present at a depth of 125 m ( Legrand et al 1988 ) .
An improvement in the mechanical condition of the Byrd core , associated with the gradual disappearance of air bubbles , was observed below 900 m depth .
Some relaxation effects , such as volume expansion and density decrease , diminished in the deeper core sections ( Fig 11 ) but other effects appeared .
Three distinctive types of inclusions were observed after the deep core sections were brought to the surface : secondary gas cavities , plate - like inclusions , and cleavage cracks .
All three types are of secondary origin , because none were observed in the initial examinations immediately after the core sections were pulled to the surface , but only after a longer period ( Gow 1971 ) .
Secondary gas cavities started to appear in the Byrd core at around 600 m depth .
They were faceted in reflected light , had a knobby external appearance , and were easily distinguished from primary air bubbles , which possess smooth outlines .
The secondary cavities were filled with gas , the quantity of which increased with time ( Gow 1971 ) .
The cavities were surrounded by crystal disturbances ( Shoji and Langway 1983 ) possibly formed by quasi- explosive ( decrepitation ) dissociation of air clathrates .
Cleavage cracks made their first appearance at about 600 m depth .
They were not uniformly distributed in cores , especially in the deep ones .
There the cleavage cracks were clumped together in layers .
The number of these cracks increased with time .
Their thickness was 1 - 10 micrometers , and their volume was about 10 % of that of the secondary cavities .
In the very deep ice , below 2000 m , cleavage cracks were larger and more numerous .
Plate - like inclusions appeared after a period of storage of the core sections from a depth below 800 m .
They were 1.0 micrometers thick .
The formation of these voids can probably be attributed to strain - induced vacancies ( Gow 1971 ) .
Gow and Williamson ( 1976 ) found that the crystal size in the Antarctic ice sheet changes with depth in an irregular way .
They observed a constantly increasing crystal size from the firn - like transition to a depth of 400 m , an irregular plateau in the size distribution between 400 and 1200 m , a sharp decrease in size with a peak near 1600 m , then a dramatic crystal size increase at 1800 m and below ( Fig 11 ) .
Similar observations were reported from other Antarctic and Arctic locations ( Herron et al 1985 ; Langway et al 1988 ; see also review by Patterson 1981 ) .
In a Dome C ( Antarctica ) core , between 400 and 550 m depth , Duval and Lorius ( 1980 ) found a coincidence between a sudden decrease in crystal size and a sudden change of delta - 18O values in the ice .
They interpreted this as a climatic signal .
However , they were unable to offer a plausible mechanism to explain the relationship between crystal size and climatic changes .
We propose that these delta - 18O changes are due to recrystallization of ice in the ice sheet and in the ice core .
Crystal growth was also observed when the ice cores were stored for a few days ( Duval and Lorius 1980 ) , 1 month , or 1 year ( Narita and Nakawo 1985 ) .
Later , Petit et al ( 1987 ) reiterated the idea of a correlation between climate and ice crystal size in the Dome C ( Antarctica ) core , but they noted that it suffers limitations due to in situ processes .
The temperature memory of crystals proposed by Petit et al ( 1987 ) was criticized by Alley et al ( 1988 ) .
Alley et al ( 1988 ) found that this memory lasts only hours rather than thousands of years , and that the small crystal sizes in Wisconsinian ice are probably caused by impurities in the ice .
Langway et al ( 1988 ) and Shoji and Langway ( 1989 ) observed an inverse correlation between sulphate concentrations and crystal size in the Dye 3 core .
The reason for this variability remains unknown ( Paterson 1981 ; Shoji and Langway 1989 ) .
The strikingly similar vertical distribution of CO2 and crystal size in the Vostok core is more likely caused by physico - chemical processes in the ice sheet and in the ice core than to past climatic changes .
The first dramatic decrease in CO2 concentrations in the Vostok core , at a depth of about 400 m , coincides with the region where major brittle cracks appear ( Fig 11 ) associated with disk - like cracks intersecting the air bubbles .
In this zone the relaxation stresses exceeded the tensile strength of the ice .
This part of the core was characterized by an abundance of air bubbles with a high initial ( in the ice sheet ) pressure of 34 bars , and by a rapid increase of core volume after relaxation of pressure in the bubbles to about 15 bars .
At such an initial pressure and at a temperature near - 50 ºC , gaseous CO2 enters the solid clathrate form ( Takenouchi and Kennedy 1965 ) , but not other air components ( Miller 1969 ) .
During dry crushing of such samples in the laboratory at low temperature , solid CO2 clathrate may be left in the ice and may not be included in the gaseous CO2 recovered from the bubbles .
This will lead to erroneously lower analytical results .
The low CO2 concentrations near 750 m depth coincide with the highest core volume expansion , accompanied by dramatic dilation of air bubbles and by crack formation ( Gow and Williamson 1975 ) .
The dilation of bubbles was accompanied by a decrease in bubble pressure .
This must be associated with differential escape of gas from the bubbles into the micro-cracks and liquid veins within the ice , and also out of the cores .
Depletion of CO2 is clearly dependent on changes in ice structure , which are reflected in core volume expansion , crystal size distribution , and disappearance and reappearance of air inclusions ( Fig 11 ) .
This depletion can be due to lower viscosity and smaller molecular volume of CO2 than of other air components .
Contamination by drilling fluid was probably one of the factors influencing the changes in gaseous components of the core .
Below about 900 m all original air bubbles disappear in the Vostok core ( Korotkevich et al 1978 ) .
All gas cavities from which CO2 was determined below this depth were secondary , and formed by

President Obama does n't have a health care bill -- but his budget assumes there will be one .
The proposal for fiscal year 2011 includes a " reserve fund for health care reform " totaling $ 634 billion -- a " down payment , " as the administration also puts it .
Of course , the administration has little choice but to budget for health care legislation .
Failure to do so would be a sign it has given up on the idea , and Obama has made it clear he will continue pushing for a final bill .
" What I will not do is stop working on this issue , " Obama said yesterday at his town hall in Nashua , N.H.
" Because it is the right thing to do for America and you need to let your members of Congress know they should n't give up , they should keep on pushing to make it happen . "
Obama will also discuss health care strategy this morning during his meeting with Senate Democrats .
Budget director Peter Orszag pointed out that both the House and the Senate have passed health care bills , and are now trying to merge -- an effort thrown off track by the recent Senate election in Massachusetts .
Scott Brown 's win gives Republicans the power to block a final health care bill in the Senate .
Obama has responded by trying to pressure congressional Republicans into offering their own plans , lest they risk the wrath of voters who want changes in the health care system .
" What I 've done is I 've said to the Republicans , ' show me what you 've got , ' " Obama said in New Hampshire .
On this Super Bowl week , Obama employed a huddle of football analogies to describe the current standing of health care .
" We 're essentially on the 5 - yard line , " Obama said .
" So we 've had to go into overtime , but we are now in the red zone , that 's exactly right .
We 're in the red zone .
We 've got to punch it through . "

DNA from a 40,000 - year - old pinkie finger , belonging to a child and found in a cave in Siberia , indicates that the bone is from a previously unknown family of human relatives that lived among Neanderthals and modern humans , German researchers reported Wednesday .
The discovery , if confirmed by research already underway , would mark the first time that an entirely new species of hominid has been identified solely on the basis of DNA sequencing , the team reported online in the journal Nature .
It also suggests that other currently unknown species could be similarly identified .
With the recent , and still controversial , discovery of the Hobbit - like species Homo floresiensis that survived in Indonesia until about 13,000 years ago , the evidence now indicates that at least four species of human - like creatures walked the Earth at the same time .
The finding suggests that “ 40,000 years ago , the planet was more crowded than we thought , ” wrote evolutionary biologist Terence A. Brown of the University of Manchester in an editorial accompanying the report .
The new species shared a common ancestor with both modern humans and Neanderthals about 1 million years ago , based on the DNA sequences , according to the team led by anthropologists Johannes Krause and Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
That is about 500,000 years older than the last common ancestor shared by Neanderthals and modern humans .
“ I like it because it makes us sort of a normal mammal , ” said anthropologist Todd R. Disotell of New York University ’s Center for the Study of Human Origins , who was not involved in the research .
“ At every other phase of evolutionary history , there has always been multiple species at any one time . ”
The DNA sequences are from mitochondria , the tiny organelles within cells that provide power for all the activities of life .
They thus provide a useful indicator of lineage , but say little about the physical characteristics of the whole organism .
And because the researchers have only the finger bone , found in the Altai Mountains in 2008 , they are unable to draw any broader conclusions about its identity .
But Krause and his colleagues are now working feverishly to sequence the much - more - difficult - to - analyze DNA in the nucleus of cells in the hopes that the information will provide a much better picture of the new form of life they appear to have discovered .
Until the team has a complete sequence of nuclear DNA , “ we are not saying this is a new species , ” Pääbo said at a news conference .
But all the evidence so far suggests it is , he added .
Meanwhile , other researchers are speculating about the kinship of the bone -- known in the laboratory as “ X Woman ” because mitochondria are passed down through mothers -- guessing that it might belong to species such as Homo heidelbergensis or Homo antecessor , both of which split off from the human lineage in the same general window of time but were thought to have gone extinct much earlier .
The “ idea that this is an unknown species is a little bit premature , ” added anthropologist Richard Potts of the Smithsonian Institution ’s National Museum of Natural History .
There are a couple of candidates that could have survived in isolated pockets longer than researchers had thought , he said .
The pinkie bone , from a child age 7 to 9 but of unknown gender , was found in the Denisova Cave in southern Siberia .
The location is critical primarily for climatic reasons .
While most hominid fossils have been found in equatorial regions , the heat and humidity of such places rapidly degrade DNA , making sequencing problematic , if not impossible .
But DNA is preserved much better at higher altitudes and in colder climates .
The Denisova Cave shows signs of being occupied by humans and their relatives periodically for at least 125,000 years .
The X Woman ’s pinkie was found in a layer of soil and debris dating from 30,000 to 48,000 years ago .
Krause ’s lab developed techniques to sequence DNA from Neanderthals and “ their work is absolutely the best in the world , ” Disotell said .
Krause said at a news conference that the lab was sequencing mitochondrial DNA from several samples when he discovered one that was very unusual .
“ The sequence was similar to humans , but very distinct from humans , ” he said .
After performing many tests to ensure the results were not an artifact , “ I called Svante on his mobile [ phone ] and told him to sit down . ”
Pääbo , who was in the U.S. at the time , said , “ It was absolutely amazing .
At first I did n’t believe him .
I thought he was pulling my leg .
. . .
This was some new creature that has not been on our radar screens so far . ”
The team compared X Woman ’s sequence to that of six Neanderthals and 57 modern humans and concluded that her lineage branched off about 1 million years ago while that remote ancestor was still living in Africa .
She is thus not a direct ancestor of humans , but a cousin of sorts .
Similar genetic information about H. floresiensis could help to settle the controversy about whether it is simply a dwarf modern human or a distinct species .
Unfortunately , the climate in Indonesia probably precludes obtaining any H. floresiensis DNA .
Now the question is becoming whether researchers will find other new species as they look at more DNA - containing fossils from other high - altitude and cold sites .
“ I would n’t be surprised if we find multiple lineages , ” Disotell concluded .

On one hand you have Moody 's REAL CPPI index telling you commercial real estate prices not only bottomed in December , but are now increasing at the fastest rate in years .
On the other hand you have reality staring you in the face ( that is if you are reading the February RealPoint CMBS report ) , in the form of $ 46 billion in CMBS delinquencies in January : this was a record 5.762 % of total , and represents a 325 % increase from the $ 10.8 billion inJanuary 2009 ( and a 10 % increase sequentially ) .
Contrary to all propaganda punditry , the rate of deterioration in commercial real estate keeps accelerating .
Oh , and this number does not include the $ 3 billion Stuy Town default , which will be counted for the first time in March .
Look for the % of delinquent loans to hit 8 % - 9 % within 6 months , about the time when TALF will be really needed .
Too bad TALF expires the same day as Quantitative Easing for MBS ends , March 31 .
More from Realpoint :
Overall , the total unpaid balance for CMBS pools reviewed by Realpoint for the January 2010 remittance was $ 797.3 billion , up slightly from $ 797.18 billion in December 2009 ( affected by some servicer and trustee reporting delays ) .
Both the delinquent unpaid balance and delinquency percentage over the trailing twelve months are shown in Charts 1 and 2 , clearly trending upward .
The resultant delinquency ratio for January 2010 of 5.76 % ( up from the 5.22 % reported one month prior ) is over four times the 1.281 % reported one - year prior in January 2009 and 20 times the Realpoint recorded low point of 0.283 % from June 2007 .
The increase in both delinquent unpaid balance and ratio over this time horizon reflects a steady increase from historic lows in mid-2007 .
The $ 4.1 billion Extended Stay Hotel loan from the WBC07ESH transaction remained 90 +- days delinquent in January 2010 .
Realpoint expects the delinquency for this loan to continue in the near - term until any modification or restructuring agreement is reached .
In addition , the $ 3 billion Peter Cooper Village / Stuyvesant Town loan spread through multiple CMBS deals via pari passu structure is now expected to be reported delinquent in March 2010 .
On January 25 , 2010 , Tishman Speyer announced their intention to transfer title to the Lender via Deed - in - Lieu of foreclosure .
The Borrower initially sought a forbearance ( which was not granted ) , and ultimately did not make the full payment due in January 2010 , which triggered a default under the mortgage loan .
Funds have subsequently been swept from all reserves / escrows and applied to debt service in January and February 2010 ( thus reserves are essentially depleted ) and the borrower has indicated it will no longer fund debt service shortfalls .
Therefore , with the $ 4.1 billion delinquency of the Extended Stay Hotel loan , the expected delinquency of the $ 3 billion Peter Cooper Village / Stuyvesant Town loan , and the experienced average growth monthover - month , Realpoint now projects the delinquent unpaid CMBS balance to continue along its current trend and grow to between $ 60 and $ 70 billion by mid 2010 .
Based upon an updated trend analysis , we now project the delinquency percentage to grow to between 6 % and 7 % through the first quarter of 2010 , potentially approaching and surpassing 8 - 9 % under more heavily stressed scenarios through the mid-2010 ) .
This forecast / outlook is driven by the watchlist reporting of several Realpoint identified High Risk Loans from recent vintage transactions that continue to show signs of stress and are on the verge of delinquency , along with continued balloon maturity defaults from more seasoned transactions .
As part of our monthly surveillance efforts of every CMBS transaction , we continue to monitor in detail many large Realpoint Watchlisted loans that have never met their pro-forma underwritten expectations .
This includes a large amount of loans that remain current in payments but have already been transferred into special servicing - many of which may ultimately default based upon a denial of requests for loan modifications or debt restructuring by the special servicers , or a decision by borrowers to surrender the collateral .
With TALF expiring soon , is it time to start , if not panicking , then realizing that mere good intentions and a large vocabulary will not do much for the billions in missing interest expense that will result in creeping defaults across all CMBS classes and vintages .
For those who still believe glimmers of reality may eventually creep into capital markets , here are RealPoint 's near - term projections .
Over the past three months , delinquency growth by unpaid balance has averaged roughly $ 4.47 billion per month .
Assuming ongoing monthly pay - down and liquidation activity , if such delinquency average were increased by an additional 25 % growth rate , and then carried through the first quarter 2010 , the delinquent unpaid balance would reach $ 57 billion and reflect a delinquency percentage slightly above 7 % by March 2010 .
Carried through mid-2010 , the delinquent unpaid balance would top $ 73 billion and reflect a delinquency percentage above 9.5 % by June 2010 .
In addition to this growth scenario , if we again add - in the default of the $ 3 billion Peter Cooper Village / Stuyvesant Town loan , the delinquent unpaid balance would reach $ 60 billion and reflect a delinquency percentage above 7.6 % by March 2010 .
Carried through mid-2010 , the delinquent unpaid balance would top $ 76.9 billion and reflect a delinquency percentage near 10 % by June 2010 .
For everyone else , we suggest you follow whatever the momo trade of the day is , and do n't forget sell to some other greater fool .
The latter is something the market has lots of .
Until it does n't .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court granted a temporary stay of execution late Wednesday for a condemned Texas inmate who is requesting DNA testing of evidence in his case .
The order was handed down less than an hour before Henry " Hank " Skinner , 47 , was scheduled to be executed by injection for the New Year 's Eve 1993 killings of his live - in girlfriend and her two sons .
The Supreme Court granted the temporary stay while it considers whether to take up Skinner 's broader appeal .
It was not immediately clear when the court might consider the case , but there was no indication a decision would be made before Thursday .
Skinner 's attorneys maintain that DNA testing of the evidence could establish his innocence and determine the real killer .
" This action suggests that the court believes there are important issues that require closer examination , " defense attorney Robert Owen said of the temporary stay .
" We remain hopeful that the court will agree to hear Mr. Skinner 's case and ultimately allow him the chance to prove his innocence through DNA testing . "
Skinner heard the news while he was eating what was to be his last meal , according to Michelle Lyons , a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice .
He expressed relief and surprise , saying , " I had made up my mind I was going to die " and " I feel like I really won today , " according to Lyons .
Skinner said he is " eager to get the DNA testing so I can prove my innocence and get the hell out of here , " according to Lyons .
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has received more than 8,000 letters from Skinner 's advocates urging a stay , according to the Innocence Project and Change.org , whose members and supporters have sent the letters through their Web sites .
State Sen. Rodney Ellis and state Rep. Elliott Naishtat were among those who have called for a reprieve .
" It has come to my attention that there are numerous problems with Mr. Skinner 's case that raise serious questions regarding the fairness of his trial and whether or not he is guilty , " Ellis wrote in a letter to Perry on Tuesday .
Word about the case has spread as far as France , where demonstrations were planned Wednesday at the U.S. Embassy in Paris by supporters of Skinner 's French wife , Sandrine Ageorges .
Since Skinner 's conviction in 1995 , he " has tirelessly pursued access to the untested physical evidence , " according to court documents filed with the Supreme Court in February .
That evidence includes vaginal swabs and fingernail clippings from Skinner 's then - girlfriend Twila Busby , hairs found in her hand and two knives found at the scene , along with a dish towel and a windbreaker jacket , according to the filing .
Skinner has never denied being in the home when Busby and her sons -- Elwin Caler , 22 , and Randy Busby , 20 , -- were killed .
However , he maintains he was incapacitated because of the " extreme quantities of alcohol and codeine " that he had consumed earlier that evening , according to the documents .
Prosecutors maintain forensic evidence gathered at the scene and witness statements point to Skinner .
A female friend of Skinner 's who lived four blocks away testified at Skinner 's trial that he walked to her trailer and told her that he may have kicked Twila Busby to death , although evidence did not show she had been kicked .
The neighbor has since recanted parts of her testimony .
Authorities followed a blood trail from the crime scene to the female friend 's trailer and found Skinner in the closet , authorities said .
He was " wearing heavily blood - stained jeans and socks and bearing a gash on the palm of his right hand , " according to the Texas attorney general 's summary of the case .
In addition , authorities said cuts on Skinner 's hand came from the knife used to stab the men .
Skinner said he cut it on glass .
Some DNA testing was done , which implicated Skinner , but not on the items he now wants tested .
" DNA testing showed that blood on the shirt Skinner was wearing at the time of his arrest was Twila 's blood , and blood on Skinner 's jeans was a mixture of blood from Elwin and Twila , " authorities said .
However , Owen wrote in the Supreme Court filing , " the victims ' injuries show that whoever murdered them must have possessed considerable strength , balance and coordination . "
Twila Busby was strangled so forcefully that her larynx and the hyoid bone in her throat were broken .
She then was struck with an axe or pick handle 14 times , hard enough to drive fragments of her " unusually thick skull " into her brain , the court documents said .
" While attacking Ms. Busby , the perpetrator had to contend with the presence of her 6 - foot - 6 - inch , 225 - pound son , Elwin Caler , who blood spatter analysis showed was in the immediate vicinity of his mother as she was being beaten , " the court filing said .
" Somehow , the murderer was able to change weapons and stab Caler several times before he could fend off the attack or flee . "
Randy Busby was then stabbed to death in the bedroom the two brothers shared , the documents said .
Evidence presented at trial suggested that Twila Busby 's uncle , Robert Donnell -- who is now dead -- could have been the killer .
At a New Year 's Eve party she attended for a short time on the last night of her life , Donnell stalked her , making crude sexual remarks , according to trial testimony .
A friend who drove her home from the party testified she was " fidgety and worried " and that Donnell was no longer at the party when he returned .
" The defense presented evidence that Donnell was a hot - tempered ex-con who had sexually molested a girl , grabbed a pregnant woman by the throat and kept a knife in his car , " according to Owen 's letter to Perry .
An expert testified at trial that Skinner would have been too intoxicated to commit the crimes , and a review of the evidence suggests that Skinner might have been even more intoxicated than initially thought , Owen writes .
Media outlets in Texas have been supportive of a reprieve for Skinner .
" Before sending a man to die , we need to be absolutely sure of his guilt , " the Houston Chronicle wrote in an editorial Friday .
Skinner 's wife , Ageorges , told Radio France Internationale in a Tuesday interview that she began writing to Skinner in 1996 and they began visiting in 2000 .
" I 'm convinced of his innocence not because I love him and he's my husband , I 'm convinced of his innocence ... [ because ] there is scientific forensic evidence to prove that he was not even in a state to stand up at the time of the crime let alone murder three people that he loved , " Ageorges told CNN 's " Larry King Live " on Wednesday night after the stay had been granted .
" There is absolutely no motive . "
Ageorges also said she finds it " mind - boggling that evidence preserved from the crime scene 15 years later -- including the murder weapon , a rape kit , nail clippings from one of the victims , a male jacket that does n't fit his size at all with sweat , hair , DNA -- to this day is not tested . "
Recently , questions have swirled in Texas regarding the 2004 execution of Cameron Todd Willingham for a fire that killed his three daughters .
On March 19 , Perry issued a posthumous pardon to the family of Timothy Cole , who was serving a 25 - year sentence for aggravated sexual assault when he died in prison from an asthma attack .
After his death , DNA tests established his innocence , and another man confessed to the crime .
CNN 's William Mears , Ashley Hayes and Emily Probst contributed to this report .
Consumer Reports ’ latest tests of packaged leafy greens found bacteria that are common indicators of poor sanitation and fecal contamination , in some cases , at rather high levels .
The story appears in the March 2010 issue of Consumer Reports and is also available free online .
Consumers Union today also issued a report [ PDF ] urging the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to set safety standards for greens .
FDA food safety legislation pending in the Senate , and passed last summer by the House of Representatives , would require the FDA to create just such safety standards .
The tests , which were conducted with financial support from the Pew Health Group , assessed for several types of bacteria , including total coliforms and Enterococcus — “ indicator organisms ” found in the human digestive tract and in the ambient environment that can signal inadequate sanitation and the potential for the presence of disease - causing organisms .
While there are no existing federal standards for indicator bacteria in salad greens , there are standards for these bacteria in milk , beef , and drinking water .
Several industry consultants suggest that an unacceptable level in leafy greens would be 10,000 or more colony forming units per gram ( CFU/ g ) .
Consumer Reports found that 39 percent of samples exceeded this level for total coliform , and 23 percent for Enterococcus .
The tests did not find E. coli O157:H7 , Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella — sometimes deadly pathogens which can be found in greens , although it was not expected given the small sample size .
According to Consumers Union , the goal was to investigate other markers of poor sanitation that should be used in the food safety management of produce .
“ Although these ‘ indicator ’ bacteria generally do not make healthy people sick , the tests show not enough is being done to assure the safety or cleanliness of leafy greens , ” said Dr. Michael Hansen , senior scientist at Consumers Union , nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports .
“ Levels of bacteria varied widely , even among different samples of the same brand .
More research and effort is needed within the industry to better protect the public .
In the meantime , consumers should buy packages of greens that are as far from the use - by date as possible . ”

For its latest analysis , Consumer Reports had an outside lab test 208 containers of 16 brands of salad greens , sold in plastic clamshells or bags , bought last summer from stores in Connecticut , New Jersey , and New York .
Among the findings :
39 percent of samples exceeded 10,000 CFUs ( or another similar measure ) per gram for total coliforms and 23 percent for Enterococcus , the levels industry consultants deemed unacceptable .
2 percent of samples exceeded French and 5 percent Brazilian standards for fecal coliform bacteria .
Many packages containing spinach , and packages which were one to five days from their use - by date , had higher bacterial levels .
Packages six to eight days from their use - by date generally fared better .
Whether the greens came in a clamshell or bag , included “ baby ” greens , or were organic made no difference in bacteria levels .
Brands for which there were more than four samples , including national brands Dole , Earthbound Farm Organic , and Fresh Express , plus regional and store brands , had at least one package with relatively high levels of total coliforms or Enterococcus .
CU is calling on the Senate to pass pending FDA food safety reform legislation that requires the agency to set performance standards as well as develop safety standards for the growing or processing of fresh produce .
It ’s also asking that FDA formally declare certain pathogenic bacteria — such as E. coli O157:H7 , Salmonella , and Listeria — be considered adulterants when found in salad greens .
Until packaged salad becomes cleaner , consumers ’ best line of defense involves following these procedures in stores and kitchens :

The Department of Defense has identified 4,377 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war .
It confirmed the death of the following American on Monday :
RIECKHOFF , Robert M. , 26 , Specialist , Army ; Kenosha , Wis. ; 10th Mountain Division .
In cosmology , a special type of supernovae , known as a standard candle , is used to help determine distances on cosmological length scales .
These standard candles were what revealed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .
The inquisitive mind might start asking , " well what makes these ' standard ' " ?
Standard candles are type Ia supernovae , white dwarfs that have reached masses near the Chandrasekhar limit ( about 1.4 times the mass of our sun ) .
There are a couple of ways for a white dwarf to reach this mass , but a new study indicates that the most common is also the most violent : a collision between two white dwarfs .
Standard candles play an extremely important role in astronomy due to the challenge of estimating distance .
Determining how far an object is from you often requires comparison against a second object of known distance .
It 's easy to estimate how far my TV is from me when I know that my coffee table is about 18 inches from my sofa .
However , when you have nothing absolute to compare against — a dot on a completely white field — figuring out the distance to an object is much more difficult .
Even determining if something is a mile wide and ten miles away or ten thousand miles wide but a million miles away can be daunting when you have nothing to compare against .
Standard candles provide a frame of reference for distance .
Because all type Ia supernovae are the product of the same process in similar progenitor stars , they provide a frame of reference for nearby objects .
Since we know what to expect from such an explosion , we can determine the distance from Earth that it occurs given its peak luminosity .
The key to the similarity is the relationship between the Chandrasekhar limit and the supernova process .
White dwarfs are stable at masses up to the limit .
As they near this mass , however , the pressures and temperatures in the core of the star are hot enough to ignite uncontrolled carbon and oxygen fusion reactions that blow the star apart .
A white dwarf cannot exist at masses above the Chandrasekhar mass , as the electron degeneracy pressure is no longer powerful enough to push against the massive gravity , so a neutron star or black hole results .
Obviously , that means that the white dwarf must approach the Chandrasekhar limit from below .
Historically , there have been two main hypotheses for how this happens : either the massive white dwarf is the result of two smaller white dwarfs merging , or the white dwarf siphons matter off a nearby stellar companion .
This week 's issue of Nature contains observational results that conclusively favor to one mechanism over another .
The key lies in the X - ray emission signatures of the two scenarios .
If two white dwarf stars merge , the process does n't produce many X - rays until right before the thermonuclear blast .
In contrast , the accretion scenario should produce a significant amount of X - rays for 10 million years preceding the supernova event .
Using archival data from Chandra ( X- ray ) , Spitzer and 2MASS ( near - infrared ) observatories , researchers from the Max Planck Institute examined the X - ray flux from a half dozen nearby galaxies and the galactic bulge of Andromeda .
They found X - ray emissions were nearly 30 to 50 times less than what would be predicted if the accretion scenario were common .
This lead the authors to conclude that the process of drawing matter from companion stars accounts for no more than five percent of the observed type Ia supernovae in early - type galaxies .
Note the caveat at the end there : this result holds true for young galaxies .
For the accretion scenario to work , the companion star that is providing mass would need to be considerably larger than the white dwarf , something that would not be common in young galaxies such as those included in the survey .
In older galaxies , these massive companions may be more prevalent , so the alternate accretion scenario may be more plausible .
With this work , however , astronomers finally seem to be closer to having a standard mechanism that is capable of explaining the cosmologically important standard candles .

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent in January , its lowest rate since September , from 8.4 percent in December as the economy added 43,000 jobs , Statistics Canada said on Friday .
The Bay Street sign is pictured in the heart of the financial district as people walk by in Toronto , May 22 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mark Blinch
Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent and an increase of 15,000 jobs .
Almost all of the new jobs were part - time , to some extent reflecting the first notable increase in youth employment since the fall of 2008 .
The youth jobless rate fell to 15.1 percent from 16.0 percent .
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday he would be looking carefully at the labor market in crafting monetary policy .
Canada ’s unemployment rate has been more than 1 - 1/2 percentage points less than the U.S. figure .
The Canadian dollar rose as high as C$ 1.0716 or 93.32 U.S. cents , from C$ 1.0749 , or 93.03 U.S. cents just before the report , but BMO Capital Markets deputy chief economist , Doug Porter , said there was less than meets the eye in the report .
“ I do n’t think there ’s a big shock here for the Bank .
The fact the unemployment rate is grinding lower will be notable , but I do n’t think it ’s enough to put the Bank on high alert by any means , ” he said .
Aron Gampel , deputy chief economist at Scotiabank , saw the data as positive even though he said the gains were n’t as broad - based as hoped .
“ The issue here is that the Canadian economy is slowly but surely gaining momentum .
It would be much stronger if not for the fact that the trade side remains a drag at a time when domestic demand is doing extremely well , ” he said .
The increase in employment follows a decline of 28,300 jobs in December , a figure that was revised from a loss of 2,600 to reflect new statistical methods .
Employment was down only 16,000 from a year ago but remains 280,000 below the level of October 2008 , before the economic crisis began .
The largest rise in January , at 53,700 , was among private - sector employees .
The month saw 13,400 more public - sector employees , while self - employment dropped by 24,000 .
Manufacturing has taken the brunt of the employment cuts during the recession .
The sector lost another 15,700 jobs in January and stood 95,200 below a year earlier .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Airline stocks gained Tuesday after United and American airlines gave upbeat quarterly revenue reports , thanks to renewed business travel and international premium - class bookings , .
The sector 's benchmark stock index , the NYSE Arca Airline Index XAL , - 1.05 % , surged to a new 52 - week high , closing up 2.6 % at 36.99 points .
Shares of Continental CAL , +1.48 % climbed 4.4 % to $ 21.09 while American parent AMR Corp. AMR , jumped 8.5 % to $ 9.70 and United parent UAL Corp. UAUA rose 5.3 % to $ 18.43 .
Continental , UAL and AMR hit yearly highs earlier in the session .
United Airlines told analysts in New York that its revenue recovery in 2010 has so far outpaced the industry , thanks to a nice bump in international premium - class bookings and revenue from its corporate customers .
For February , passenger unit revenue grew 18 % from a year ago , versus 10.5 % growth in January , according to the Chicago - based airline operator .
Though industry comparisons are n't yet available for February , January growth beat the industry by seven points .
" We are clearly seeing signs of economic recovery , " said Kathryn Mikells , the chief financial officer at UAL .

Ancillary revenue has become a key source of revenue for United , thanks to first and second bag fees and on - board purchases of food , United said .
Read more about airlines retail strategy and the importance of in - flight sales .
At AMR , first - quarter passenger unit revenue is expected to climb by a range of 6.5 % to 7.5 % versus the year - ago period .
For the year , capacity is expected to climb 1 % from 2009 due to the resumption of flights to Mexico that were pared back over the summer due to the swine flu out break , and the launch of its Chicago to Beijing route in April .
" While there remains a lot of uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery and fuel prices , we 're focused on returning our airline to profitability , " said Chief Financial Officer Tom Horton , during an analyst meeting in New York .
UAL's United also posted its February traffic results late Monday and noted a steep reduction in passenger revenue due to severe winter storms in North America .
For February , United said its traffic rose 2.1 % to 7.82 billion revenue passenger miles , which equals one passenger flown one mile .
Capacity for the month declined 5.3 % to 9.93 billion available seat miles while load , or the percentage of seats filled with passengers , rose to 78.7 % from 73 % .
Winter storms took a $ 40 million bite of passenger revenue in February due to hundreds of weather - related cancellations , primarily in the North East .
The impact of the storms has collectively exceeded $ 100 million across the industry .
Earlier , Southwest Airlines LUV , - 0.29 % said weather - related flight cancellations during the month resulted in an estimated $ 15 million hit on passenger revenues .
US Airways LCC , said it suffered $ 30 million in lost revenue due to the unusual weather , Continental CAL , +1.48 % put the impact at $ 25 million , and budget - carrier AirTran AAI , sees the hit in the range of $ 5 million to $ 6 million .
Delta Air Liens DAL , -0.09 % said Friday it expects to post something on the weather impact this week .

The Saks Fifth Avenue stores in the Pioneer Place Mall are scheduled to close , the company Saks Inc. announced today .
The downtown Portland stores on 850 S.W. 5th Ave. and 385 S.W. Yamhill St. are reaching the end of their leases .
The main store , about 60,000 square feet , will close April 25 .
The men ’s store , about 23,000 square feet , will close July 31 .
“ The planned closing of the Portland store is consistent with our strategy of focusing our resources on our most productive stores , ” said Steve Sadove , chairman and chief executive officer of Saks .
Portland Mayor Sam Adams said in a statement that the “ property owners , the Portland Development Commission and I made unprecedented outreach efforts to keep Saks in Portland . ”
“ But we could not overcome national trends buffeting higher end and luxury retailers and the fact that Saks ’ Portland lease was up for renewal .
My thoughts are with the affected employees and their families , ” Adams said .
The Saks locations in Portland have about 100 employees .
Pioneer Place owner General Growth Properties has not decided what to do with the two spaces .
Spokesman David Keating could not confirm reports by The Oregonian newspaper that the fast - fashion clothing company H&M will move into the men ’s store space .
Keating said Pioneer Place would fill the larger space with another department store like Saks or use the space for multiple , smaller boutiques .
GOP Learns to Love Dissent “ The American people are saying , ‘ Stop ’ and they ’re screaming at the top of their lungs , ” said House Republican Leader John Boehner explaining why the GOP is so determined to kill President Barack Obama ’s health - insurance reform .

Printer friendly Dissent against the President of the United States , it seems , has become patriotic .
By contrast , seven years ago , as President George W. Bush was ordering the invasion of Iraq , dissent was treated by the American political establishment – and especially Republicans – as something to be ignored , disdained or despised .
Still , in the run-up to the war , millions of Americans took to the streets in massive demonstrations and literally screamed at the top of their lungs for Bush not to do it .
Many more called their congressmen and wrote letters to editors of newspapers .
In those days , however , the powers - that - be and the major media considered dissent to be un-American .
Iraq
War critics , ranging from former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter to the country music band the Dixie Chicks , saw their loyalty , their motives and sometimes their sanity questioned .
Ritter , who challenged Bush ’s claims about Iraq ’s WMD , was called a Saddam Hussein sympathizer , while the Dixie Chicks faced boycotts and death threats for expressing their personal shame that Bush was a fellow Texan .
And , as Bush readied his “ shock and awe ” military campaign , few in the U.S. news media defended the value of dissent .
There were n't even many voices -- allowed into the news columns or onto the evening news -- that urged caution on something as serious as going to war .
Those who did give voice to anti-war positions sometimes found themselves out of a job , like popular talk - show host Phil Donahue , whose show on MSNBC was cancelled despite the fact it was the network ’s highest rated program .
Comparing the Dissent
There are other contrasts , as well as parallels , between the Iraq War protests seven years ago and the health - care protests that began with rowdy “ town hall ” meetings last summer .
For one , the anti-war protests were much bigger and more widespread .
The protests against invading Iraq began in September 2002 and swelled over the months , peaking in February 2003 , with upwards of a million people rallying in New York City as part of a global day of action .
The street protests continued into March , with 100,000 demonstrating in Washington just four days before Bush launched the invasion and hundreds of local actions around the country starting on March 20 as the war began .
By comparison , the right - wing demonstrations against the health - care bill and other government domestic policies have attracted far fewer people .
Besides a September 2009 “ tea party ” rally in Washington that drew tens of thousands , the anti-reform , anti-tax movement has not been able to rally anywhere near the numbers that were seen in 2002 - 2003 .
This fact , however , appears irrelevant to the Washington political establishment .
While the major media ignored the anti-war protests or treated them as a nuisance , the press corps has been eager to highlight the dissent against Obama .
America ’s biggest newspapers have devoted considerable ink to the Tea Party movement , both in news and opinion sections .
Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein , for example , asks “ Does the future belong to the Tea Parties ? ” while New York Times columnist David Brooks has dubbed this decade as “ the Tea Party Teens . ”
Because the Tea Partiers have received much more attention than the anti-war protesters of seven years ago , Boehner and other Republicans are able to cite the protests as a popular mandate for blocking Obama ’s health reform .
Of course , part of the reason for the respectful mainstream media coverage of the Tea Parties is that right - wing Fox News has made them impossible to ignore .
Fox News has been a vocal and powerful proponent of this anti-government movement .
As Media Matters has extensively documented , “ Fox News has repeatedly aired segments encouraging viewers to get involved with ‘ tea party ’ protests across the country . ”
Now , in a transparent effort to sink President Obama ’s chief legislative priority , the network is encouraging viewers to inundate Congress with phone calls and e-mails to demand that members vote no on health insurance reform .
“ I suggest you call , e-mail , write members of Congress , ” Fox News host Mike Huckabee advised viewers .
“ To make it easy for you , ” he added , “ what we ’ve done is provide a simple link .
You can go to callcongressnow.com .
Keep calling until they answer . ”
Fox contributor Dana Perino urged viewers to “ pick up their phone and call their member of Congress today , ” while commentator Dick Morris went on the Rupert Murdoch - owned network to advertise “ a list of Congressmen to call for swing voters to get them to vote against it ” at his Web site .
Faced with Fox News ’ intensive coverage of the anti-reform protest movement , mainstream news outlets would get excoriated for “ liberal bias ” if they did n’t give substantial attention to the protests .
At the start of the Iraq War , however , the mainstream media faced no similar pressure from the Left , because progressives have nothing comparable to Fox News .
A surge in Fox News ’ considerable influence also can be traced to its “ patriotic , ” pro-war coverage of the invasion of Iraq seven years ago .
By some reports , Fox News had as much as a 300 percent increase in viewers at the height of the invasion , averaging 3.3 million viewers daily .
“ Fox News saw its profits double during the conflict , as viewers switched in droves from the main networks and other cable channels , ” reported BBC News in August 2003 .
The way CNN and MSNBC chose to compete with this exodus of viewers was by offering similarly pro-war coverage , though their efforts were viewed by many as pale imitations .
As the major news media joined in cheering on the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – and with war supporters openly challenging the patriotism of dissenters – many anti-war protesters felt powerless and unwelcome in their own country .
By contrast , today ’s anti-health reform dissenters are made to feel as though they are the “ real Americans ” standing up to an out - of - control Washington .

Yemen announced a truce with northern Shi’ite rebels on Thursday , aimed at ending a war that has raged on - and - off since 2004 and that drew in neighbouring Saudi Arabia , a Yemeni official said .
The conflict with the northern rebels , who complain of social , religious and economic discrimination in the southern Arabian state , intensified last year .
A truce was to start at midnight on Thursday , the official said .
The Yemeni rebels are known as the Houthis after the family name of their leader Abdul - Malik al - Houthi .
Here is some background about the Houthi rebels :
WHO ARE THE HOUTHIS ?
* The Houthis , like most tribesmen in Yemen ’s northern highlands , belong to the Zaidi sect of Shi’ite Islam , whose Hashemite line ruled for 1,000 years before a 1962 revolution .
* Zaidis , who make up about a third of Yemen ’s 23 million people , have coexisted easily with majority Sunnis in the past , but Badr al - Din al - Houthi , a cleric from the northern province of Saada , promoted Zaidi revivalism in the 1970s , playing on fears that Saudi - influenced Salafis threatened Zaidi identity .
* After north and south Yemen united in 1990 , the movement spawned the al - Haq party and the Houthi-led Believing Youth group .
Houthi’s son , Hussein , was elected to parliament in 1993 .
Saada remained neglected economically by the Sanaa government .
* President Ali Abdullah Saleh , himself a Zaidi , at first used the Houthis to counter - balance the Salafi groups .
The government later portrayed Believing Youth as a fundamentalist group , out to subvert the state and restore the Zaidi imamate .
* After the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks on U.S. cities , Saleh declared support for Washington ’s “ war on terror ” , in part to enlist U.S. support against the Houthis , whom Yemeni officials accused of having links to al Qaeda , Iran or Lebanon ’s Hezbollah .
* The Houthis say the government , with U.S. and Saudi backing , is targeting Zaidis in general , forcing them to take up arms to defend their villages against oppression .
HOW HAS THE CONFLICT UNFOLDED ?
* Violence began after Houthis embarrassed Saleh by shouting “ Death to America , death to Israel , a curse on the Jews , victory to Islam ” in his presence in a Saada mosque in 2003 .
* Security forces killed Hussein al - Houthi in September 2004 , only to see further rounds of fighting erupt in the mountains around Saada city , each more violent than the last .
* Qatar brokered a ceasefire in June 2007 and sponsored a peace deal signed in February 2008 , but clashes soon resumed .
Saleh unilaterally declared the war over in July 2008 .
Full - scale fighting resumed a year later .
* In November , Saudi Arabia attacked the Houthis after a rebel cross - border incursion .
The rebels , who accused Riyadh of allowing Yemeni troops to use its territory to launch attacks on them , said Saudi air strikes mostly targeted civilians .
* Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah told Kuwait ’s al - Seyassah daily on Dec. 26 that the last infiltrators had been expelled .
* The rebels offered a ceasefire on Jan. 25 and promised to withdraw from Saudi territory .
The Saudis declared victory on Jan. 27 .
They have acknowledged losing 131 dead in the conflict .
The rebels say Saudi air strikes have continued .
* On Jan. 30 , Houthi offered to accept government ceasefire terms .
The government rejected the rebel leader ’s proposal , saying he must also promise to end attacks on Saudi Arabia and drop a demand that Yemeni army operations stop first .
* On Feb .
11 , Yemen announced it had agreed on a ceasefire that was to begin at midnight and was aimed at ending the war with the rebels .

Brooklyn , New York ( VBS.TV ) --
Back in the mid-zeroes , I remember reading a lot of stories about a buildup of trash in the Pacific Ocean so massive that it had formed a floating island of waste the size of Texas .
Its colorful nickname was the Great Eastern Garbage Patch , and what was even more mind - boggling than the purported scale was that pretty much the only places you could dig up any substantial info about it were in minor oceanographic and environmental publications .
You also could n't find a photo of it to save your life .
It was like Garbage Brigadoon .
Anyhoo , the idea that one of the biggest environmental disasters of our age had been going on outside nearly everyone 's awareness piqued our curiosity , so we decided to head out there ( the middle of the ocean ) and see it for ourselves .
The Garbage Patch is located at a natural collecting point at the center of a set of revolving currents called the North Pacific Gyre .
The middle of the Gyre is more of a meteorological phenomenon than an actual place : a consistent high - pressure zone north of the Hawaiian Islands that , combined with the extremely weak currents , helps keep the ocean surface as placid as lake water .
Flotsam has been sucked into this area from the encircling currents for as long as the Pacific 's existed , but up until the last century this process ended with the refuse safely biodegrading and being reabsorbed into the food chain as nutrients .
With the advent of plastics , however , the Garbage Patch has transformed from a fertile feeding ground to the oceanic equivalent of a desert .
And a particularly crap - strewn desert at that .
See the rest of TOXIC : Garbage Island
We chartered a trip through the middle of the mess with Capt .
Charles Moore of the Oceanographic Research Vessel Alguita .
Capt .
Moore is credited with discovering the Patch in its present , trash - choked state , and at the time was one of the few people studying the extent and effect of the pollution .
Our voyage into the center of the Gyre took eight days of round - the - clock sailing on a 50 - foot catamaran with a crew of six ( including VBS 's three - man filming team ) .
Personal tensions mounted .
Humor got strange .
By the time we got to the beginning of the Patch , anticipation and cabin fever had conspired to make our expectations of " Garbage Island " unreasonably high , but what we found still managed to surpass them .
To the naked eye it looked no different from any other part of the ocean , except that every few minutes something really strange would float by .
For instance , one time it was a hard hat with Korean writing on it .
Another time it was a motorcycle tire .
Another time it was a child 's life preserver with a cartoonish shark bite taken out of the side .
Once it was an enormous telephone - pole - shaped thing that could have easily wrecked our ship if we 'd been on a slightly different course .
Here we were in one of the most remote stretches of water in the world -- thousands of miles from land , had n't seen another ship in days -- and everywhere around us was civilization 's detritus .
It would have been some consolation to think that the Garbage Patch was simply the result of careless sailors , but researchers estimate up to 80 percent of the trash originates on land .
That not only meant that the shampoo bottle or birthday balloon we scooped up had most likely spent years traveling around the currents of the Gyre before ending up in our path , but that there were countless others in the middle of the same journey .
It was a colossal bring - down .
Then we started taking some samples of the water , and that 's when we realized things were even worse than we thought .
Watch what the water samples showed

WASHINGTON , March 19 / PRNewswire - USNewswire / -- The Full Disclosure Network® presents a seven minute video news update ( http://tiny.cc/jail774) on the L.A. County Sheriff 's Department 's sudden reversal of their policy denying on - camera television interview with a county jail inmate who is considered by many observers to be a " political prisoner . "
Court corruption fighter Richard I . Fine has been held in L.A. County Central Men's Jail in solitary " coercive confinement " for civil contempt of court since March 4 , 2009 .
The video features Sheriff Department 's spokesman Steve Whitmore describing the hazardous jail conditions and why the Sheriff dropped his long standing opposition to the interview .
Richard I . Fine , is a prominent anti-trust attorney who has been incarcerated for a year with no release date set and no bail , following his attempt to disqualify L.A. Superior Court Judge David Yaffe for accepting illegal payments from L. A. County , a party involved in a case before him .
The entire interview will be featured on cable channels in major cities throughout the United States in April .
SHERIFF DROPS OPPOSITION TO INMATE INTERVIEW
On March 11 , 2010 County Sheriff Leroy Baca reversed his long standing opposition to the interview with Richard I . Fine , whose incarceration has been described " political ” in news coverage , most notably in the Sacramento Bee column of Dan Walters http://tiny.cc/Walters.
Fine has been held in L.A. County Central Men's Jail without a conviction , a jury trial , a release date or even a hearing date .
Sheriff Leroy Baca 's decision to let Full Disclosure Network Producers Leslie Dutton and T.J. Johnston video record a one hour interview with Fine in the jail came almost two months after Sterling Norris of the Judicial Watch , the public interest legal organization filed a lawsuit in the U.S. California Central District .
The complaint requested declaratory relief asking the court to hold the Sheriff 's policy regarding media requests for inmate interviews unlawful on the basis of violations of First Amendment Rights of the Press .

Earlier today , Joystick reported that the 1993 SNES version of Tecmo Super Bowl will soon be re-released on Playstation Network and the Xbox Live Arcade .
The SNES version was already a re-release of the original Tecmo Super Bowl that was released in 1991 for the NES .
At the time , it included upgraded visuals , minor tweaks and many bug fixes .
The re-release on PSN and XBLA will include updated HD graphics , but can also be played in the original 16 - bit mode .
While an exact release date is not known at this time , it is clear that the game will include all teams , players and matches that were included in the original and that the game will be known as Tecmo Bowl Throwback .
Despite being released in 1993 , Tecmo Super Bowl has acquired a cult following and has a community that continues to update emulation - roms with player rosters to this day .
The New York Times has now reported on a story we first broke over a week ago : the banks that helped Greece create debt - concealing swaps also took out swap contracts that will pay off if Greece defaults on its debt .
Here 's how Eric Dash and Nelson Schwartz write it up :
Bets by some of the same banks that helped Greece shroud its mounting debts may actually now be pushing the nation closer to the brink of financial ruin .
Echoing the kind of trades that nearly toppled the American International Group , the increasingly popular insurance against the risk of a Greek default is making it harder for Athens to raise the money it needs to pay its bills , according to traders and money managers .
These contracts , known as credit - default swaps , effectively let banks and hedge funds wager on the financial equivalent of a four - alarm fire : a default by a company or , in the case of Greece , an entire country .
If Greece reneges on its debts , traders who own these swaps stand to profit .
Unfortunately , there 's a bit of perfectly predictable confusion in the article .
“ It ’s like buying fire insurance on your neighbor ’s house — you create an incentive to burn down the house , ” Philip Gisdakis , head of credit strategy at UniCredit in Munich , tells the NYT .
But it 's not really anything like that at all , unless the banks in question are net short Greece .
And as far as we can tell , no Wall Street bank is net short Greek debt by any material amount .
Instead , many have attempted to hedge their exposures to a sovereign default .
So some , like Goldman Sachs , now appear to be " flat " on Greek exposure , standing to neither gain nor lose a large amount regardless of what happens .
The Europeans are certainly not short , according to credit traders familiar with the various positions of major market participants .
In fact , most are not even flat .
They have massive long exposures that they are desperately attempting to hedge but have been hesitant to sell down their positions for fear of creating a panic sell - off .
" These banks are n’t buying insurance on someone else ’s house , they ’re buying insurance on their own house , " Felix Salmon points out .
According to the New York Times , French banks hold $ 75.4 billion worth of Greek debt , Swiss banks have $ 64 billion of exposure , and German banks ’ exposure is $ 43.2 billion .
Of course they are trying to hedge this risk .
Hace unas semanas en este mismo espacio , con motivo precisamente del aniversario de la Constitución mexicana de 1917 , comentaba que una de las razones que tienen frenada la tan anhelada transición del sistema político mexicano es , por lo menos a mi entender , que los mexicanos no terminamos de ponernos de acuerdo en qué país queremos ser y como no nos ponemos de acuerdo en el qué , pues menos nos ponemos de acuerdo en el respectivo cómo .
Más allá de conveniencias partidarias , intereses particulares y rencores personales , realmente existe un problema ideológico importante que impide que las partes se pongan de acuerdo para sacar adelante una reforma política trascendente , y la reunión de la semana pasada en Cancún de los presidentes de América Latina y el Caribe me permite corroborar esa hipótesis .
Más información descargable Posición de México en América Latina
Los asistentes a la cumbre del sureste mexicano acordaron las bases de un organismo regional que excluye a Estados Unidos y a Canadá , países con los que México mantiene desde mediados de los años noventa un tratado de libre comercio conocido por sus siglas en inglés como NAFTA .
Tras la firma de los acuerdos , las opiniones a favor y en contra de los extremos en México no se hicieron esperar .
Protestaron los que piensan que es absurdo que México se comprometa con la pobre e inestable América Latina poniendo en peligro nuestras relaciones con el riquísimo y poderosísimo vecino del norte , que además ya es nuestro socio comercial , y también se hicieron oír los que piensan que ya iba siendo hora de que México reconociera su indiscutible vinculación con la cultura , la historia y el destino de nuestros vecinos por el sur .
En la encuesta que entregamos hoy a elpais.com queda claro que estas contraposiciones no sólo se dan entre los que conforman el llamado círculo rojo - categorización que se puso de moda en México hace unos años , que agrupa a los comentaristas profesionales y , también , a las audiencias minoritarias pero supuestamente bien informadas - , el público más general también se divide entre los que sueñan con ser Norteamérica y los que añoran sentirse por fin parte de América Latina .
En principio , la mayoría ( 60 % ) parece estar de acuerdo en que México ha dejado de ser un país líder en la región latinoamericana , es importante sin duda , pero ya no ostenta el liderazgo del que gozó hasta antes de los años noventa .
Aún influidos por la propaganda gubernamental sobre el éxito y trascendencia de la cumbre de Cancún , los mexicanos no percibimos que nuestro presidente sea una figura influyente en la región .
Los públicos se dividen casi por igual entre los que opinan que la figura influyente es el brasileño Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , los que piensan que el fuerte en la región es el venezolano Hugo Chávez y los que le confieren esa categoría a Felipe Calderón .
Pero lo que me parece que ejemplifica claramente cómo en México no tenemos claro qué país queremos ser , es que mientras el 40 % piensa que tenemos más cosas en común con Estados Unidos y Canadá , un 49 % asegura que tenemos mucho más con América Latina y el Caribe .
Queda claro que los públicos se inclinan por pensar que a México le conviene más tener relaciones con los países de América del Norte que con los del Cono Sur , y 57 % está esperando algún tipo de represalias por parte de Washington por haber aceptado crear un organismo americano sin su participación ; pero al mismo tiempo el 61 % estaría encantado si los países de América Latina y el Caribe nos uniéramos en un tratado similar al de la Comunidad Europea .
Estas mismas contradicciones las estamos viviendo todos los días cuando se discute el tipo de gobierno que nos conviene , la educación que debemos implantar , los servicios de salud que tenemos que garantizar , dónde y cómo tenemos que invertir y hasta el tipo de televisión que quisiéramos disfrutar .
En México no nos hemos puesto de acuerdo en qué país queremos ser y las opiniones publicadas se cansan de adjudicarse culpas unas a otras porque los acuerdos sobre lo que hay que hacer no caminan .
La pregunta es hasta dónde este diálogo sordo puede aguantar , antes de que una posición autoritaria y dictatorial aparezca y termine por aplastarnos a todos .
Killer Whale , Orcinus Orca , from the Latin Orcus : Demons from the Underworld , belonging to the realms of the dead .
For thousands of years , killer whales have hunted the great baleen whales in every ocean on earth , yet only in one place have they ever co-operated with humans to hunt whales , and then largely only with one family , the Davidsons .
“ Killers of Eden ” is the extraordinary story of the contract between man and one of nature ’s most powerful and intelligent creatures .
Each year for more than a century on Australia ’s far south east coast , autumn moved into winter and the killer whales would return to Eden from the Antarctic and lie in wait .
Their prey were the baleen whales journeying to and from their breeding grounds hundreds of kilometers up the coast .
Three generations of the Davidson family worked with the killer whales , often invited by the killers and led out to sea to join in the hunts .
A few members of the pod of orcas would swim right into the mouth of the kiah river where the Davidsons had their two isolated houses on the opposite side of the bay from the township of Eden .
They would then breach or thrash their tails on the water surface untill the whalers emerged and rowed their boats out to meet them .
The Davidsons called this behaviour “ flop - tailing ” .
No other Eden whalers were ever visited in this manner .
On cloudy moonless nights , the Davidson crews would follow the glowing bioluminescent trails of the orcas which would light up the sea .
When the whale was dead , the Davidsons would simply row home after tying an anchor and small buoy to it , leaving first spoils to the killers .
Just like orcas elsewhere in the world , the Eden killers only ate the tongue and lips and discarded the rest .
After a few days the whale would float to the surface and the Eden whalers would row out and tow the remains for “ trying out ” at their tiny whaling station on the banks of the Kiah river in Twofold bay .
The whalers called this arrangement “ the law of the tongue ” and as a result , far less of the whale was wasted than if the Orcas had hunted alone .
The relationship became so close that the whalers would attempt to rescue the killers if they became entangled in ropes and the killers would protect the humans from sharks if the flimsy green whaleboats were smashed .
As a result , few fatalities occured amongst the crews , despite regular serious accidents .
The killers could easily differentiate between the Davidson ’s green row boats and competitors boats of other colours .
Captive orcas in aquariums have no trouble recognising individual humans , distinguishing between others wearing identical clothing such as wetsuits .
so the Eden killers could likely have recognised individuals amongst the Davidson crews .
The Davidson boats ’ green colour was based on the green of the traditional Scottish Davidson tartan .
The Davidsons never used motor boats to catch whales .
Only rowboats .
Sometimes motor launches were offered for use as pick - up boats in case of accidents or to tow whales to shore .
In the final decade of whaling in the 1920s the Davidsons ’ neighbour J.R. Logan would occasionally give the row boats a tow out to a chase with his yacht the “ White Heather ” , but no bomb - gun or harpoon was ever fired from a motor boat in twofold bay .
The Davidsons avoided using explosive “ bomb - guns ” to catch whales because the concussive noise greatly distressed the killers and discouraged them from co-operating .
Using modern technology is not traditional , and is not “ cultural whaling ” .
Subsistence hunting
The Davidsons would rarely catch more than 8 whales a year in their subsistence level operation and likely had minimal impact on whale numbers .
They mostly only caught what the killer whales were hunting naturally .
The orcas did regularly attack southern right whales which became very rare .
By comparison , Tangalooma whaling station in Queensland took over 700 whales each year in the 1950s , devastating humback numbers at a much faster rate than they could possibly reproduce .
Modern day Japanese and Nordic whalers , in defiance of scientific and world opinion and ignoring a worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling , kill more whales in a single year than most Eden whalers took in a whole lifetime .
If you are interested in direct intervention against the poaching of whales , then you may wish to read about and support the Sea Shepherd Organisation .
The Killers Decline
In 1900 the killer pack numbered over 15 individuals untill a vagrant named Harry Silks knifed the killer Typee to death on Aslings beach .
Other sources state the killer Jackson was killed .
Immediately the killer pack left the bay for the remainder of the season and the following season only six returned .
Whilst it has been suggested that the disappearance of the killers was a result of dwindling food supply , large scale hunting of eastern coast humpback populations did not actually occur untill the 1950s , a whole half century after Typee ’s killing and the Eden pack spliting in two .
The population of humpbacks at the time of Typee ’s 1900 killing and splitting of the pod has been estimated by pacific whale foundation scientists as being the same as its pre-european settlement population .
The Davidsons became aware that during WW1 the killers were being deliberately shot and killed by Norwegian whalers working from Queensland who were oblivious to their non-competetive assistance to the Eden whalers .
Archer Davidson specifically mentions that as a reason for the killers numbers dwindling in that time period .
Old Tom himself passed away in 1930 , 30 years after Typee yet still 20 years before large scale whaling for humpbacks in Australia .
The skeleton of “ Old Tom ” , the last of the Eden Killers is preserved to this day in the Eden Killer Whale Museum and bears testament to the extraordinary tales told about him .
Tom ’s death in 1930 brought the 100 year period of whaling in Eden to a close .
100 + years of documentation
No mere myth or the recollections of foggy memories , whilst it was occuring , the Eden story was documented in a hundred years worth of Australian newspapers , police records , court transcripts , diaries , postcards , Australian Government Hansard , journals , and books and for an additional 75 years of oral history accounts and tape and video recordings .
The events were viewed by hundreds of eyewitnesses , members of government , leaders of industry , priests and ministers , knights of the realm .
It was most fortunately also documented in hundreds of photographs by two full time photographers over a 40 + year period and was filmed by a 35 mm Prestwick movie camera in one of the world ’s first documentaries in 1910 .
It was first shown publicly in the “ Lycic Picture Palace ” in Redfern , Sydney in 1912 .
Many of the photos were taken by C.E. Wellings or W.T. Hall and have been collected by Rene Davidson , grandson of master whaler George Davidson .
Many of these photographs are represented by original glass negatives .
Copies of the 1910 movie film were destroyed by a fire , probably caused by the nitrate film - stock itself , in the Bega bank in 1913 and only a few frames have survived .
If anyone has information on any other surviving copies or negatives please contact the website author .
Inter -species Interaction
Some people find it difficult to believe that over a 100 + year period of inter-species contact , encompassing many generations and with the mutual rewards of greater efficiency and food , orcas and humans could develop a co-operative relationship whilst hunting the same prey .
Yet those same people have no trouble accepting that with no prior contact with humans , wild orcas placed in aquariums within months will interact with humans , eventually allowing them to ride on their backs or perform huge leaps with humans standing on their snouts .
Orcas are intelligent and curious and will even intently study books about whales as has been documented by Dr John Ford of Vancouver aquarium .
Doubters may care to view video footage of this behaviour .
Wild orcas will spontaneously begin to habituate to and generate relationships with humans , as was actually problematic in the case of “ Luna ” , originally a member of L - pod who took up residence in Nootka sound in Vancouver Island British Columbia .
Members of the First Nations Mowachaht people there believed that Luna was the Re-incarnation of one of their elders and encouraged the interaction .
This parallels the Yuin people ’s beliefs in Eden .
Orcas are very social beings , and particularly in the absence of their own kind may seek out social contact with other creatures such as humans .
Tragically , Luna ’s fascination with people and boats led to a fatal accident between Luna and a tugboat propellor .
Documentary and Film
The story of the Eden killers has recently been made into a spectacular , award winning documentary “ Killers in Eden ” by the ABC natural history unit , produced by Klaus Toft .
The documentary is based on research from original source materials by Zoologist Danielle Clode and oral history interviews , document and image research by historian , VFX expert and film maker Greg McKee .
Greg and colleague Alister Ferguson also produced and supervised photorealistic visual effects for the program .
The documentary is available on DVD from a number of sources .
An even more exciting and profound feature film movie version is presently in development based on over 20 years of extensive new research from original sources and interviews with Eden whalers , family and townsfolk .
If you think the choreography of the Orca action for “ Happy Feet ” was spectacular , wait till you see what is in store for the Eden Killers feature film , which will imerse the audience into the world of the Killer whales , as well as the whalers .
Killers return
After having virtually disappeared from Twofold Bay since 1930 , pods of killer whales have begun to return to the Bay and have even been observed visiting the mouth of the Kiah river .
Whale remains and recent eyewitness accounts demonstrate that these present day orcas continue the whale hunting traditions of the original Eden pack .
It is interesting to speculate that these killers may be descendants of the original Eden pods .
Eden today is a fantastic location for whale watching and supports a number of whale watching vessels .
Humpback whales are regular visitors to the bay and may be observed feeding and cavorting with spectacular displays of acrobatics .
Vast numbers of people now experience these magnificent creatures at close range in the beautiful surrounds of Twofold Bay .
Local cameraman Peter Constable produces beautiful videos of these regular marine visitors to Eden .
Outside whale migration season , the vessels conduct tours of the bay and visit historic locations .

Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verses 17 - 21 .....
“ I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts , for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts : even one thing befalleth them .
as one dieth , so dieth the other : yea , they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast ; for all is vanity .

Tapedeck.org is a project of neckcns.com , built to showcase the amazing beauty and ( sometimes ) weirdness found in the designs of the common audio tape cassette .
There 's an amazing range of designs , starting from the early 60's functional cassette designs , moving through the colourful playfulness of the 70's audio tapes to amazing shape variations during the 80's and 90's .
We hope you enjoy these tapes as much as we do !
The compact audio cassette medium for audio storage was introduced by Philips in 1963 under the name Compact Cassette .
Although there were other magnetic tape cartridge systems at the time , the Compact Cassette became dominant as a result of Philips ' decision ( in the face of pressure from Sony ) to license the format free of charge .
It went on to become a popular ( and re-recordable ) alternative to the vinyl record deck during the 1970s .
During the 1980s , its popularity grew further as a result of the Sony Walkman , with cassette sales overtaking those of LPs .
( Vinyl overall remained ahead due to greater sales of singles , although cassette singles achieved popularity for a period in the 1990s ) .
The mass production of compact audio cassettes began in 1965 in Hannover , Germany , as did commercial sales of prerecorded music cassettes ( also known as musicassettes ; MC for short ) .
The system had been initially designed for dictation and portable use , thus the audio quality of early recorders was not well suited for music .
Some early models also had unreliable mechanical design .
As time went on , various improvements ( in particular , the introduction of Dolby noise reduction ) resulted in the format being taken seriously for musical use .
Although its use in the West has declined as a result of more advanced technologies , it remains widespread , and is still the dominant medium for listening to music in many third world countries .
In essence , the audio cassette is simply a cassette - based ( and smaller ) version of the older reel - to - reel tape format .
It consists of two miniature reels , between which an oxide - coated plastic tape , or magnetic tape , is passed and wound .
These reels ( along with some other mechanical parts ) are held inside a protective plastic shell .
Four single audio tracks are available on the tape .
These are paired to produce two stereophonic tracks – one played when the cassette is inserted with its ' A ' side facing up , and the other when it is turned over ( with the ' B ' side up ) , thus mimicking gramophone records .

Embedded processor manufacturer MIPS Technologies has released free tools for developing and testing Android applications .
These take the form of a distribution of open source processor emulator QEMU aimed at speeding up Android application design on MIPS processor architecture , and the Arriba Java development tool for QEMU , which has been produced as a result of a partnership with Viosoft , the company behind Arriba .
These include debugging and profiling technologies and monitoring and analysis modules .
The California - based embedded systems specialist has also added a compiler and GUI to Android 's Native Development Kit ( NDK ) to simplify the mouse - based build process .
The NDK is a toolkit comparable with the standard Android Software Development Kit ( SDK ) , which allows Android developers to write parts of their applications in native code languages such as C and C ++.
With the exception of the Arriba tool , the tools are available free from MIPS '
Android community portal – the Arriba tool will be available later this month .

Hippos are known to be aggressive ( Photo : Jill Sonsteby / Solent News )
A zebra at Zurich Zoo appeared to be staring into the jaws of death when visitors saw it nose to nose with an open - mouthed hippopotamus .
But the hippo had no intention of having the zebra for lunch - it was having its teeth cleaned .
The extraordinary sight was captured by photographer Jill Sonsteby , from Jacksonville , Florida .
She said the teeth - cleaning session lasted 15 minutes and the zebra came to no harm .
" The zebra was in the same enclosure as the hippo and its baby , " said Ms Sonsteby , 34 .
" The hippo opened its mouth and let the zebra in there to clean .
" Everybody was snapping pictures .
It was so great to be there at that moment . "
Dangerous
The hippopotamus is regarded as one of the most aggressive creatures in the world and has a bite that can cut a small boat in half .
Hippos can weigh up to three tonnes and are the third largest land mammal in the world .
Although they rarely kill each other , hundreds of fatal attacks on people in Africa have been recorded .
Despite its bulky frame , the hippo can outrun a human on land over short distances .
A couple of commenters have asked what software package I use to create the graphs that appear in bit - player posts–illustrations like the one below , which is a slightly improved version of something I posted last week .
Let ’s call it Figure 1 .
Prompted by these inquiries , I immodestly ask myself :
Why do my graphs look so darn good ?
I immodestly answer :
It ’s not because of any packaged software !
I do n’t need a cake mix , or even a recipe .
These are home - baked graphs , made from scratch out of locally grown organic pixels .
I have strong opinions about the aesthetics of scientific illustrations , and I could certainly spout off about the design elements of Figure 1 , such as that putty - colored background , just dark enough to allow drop - out white grid lines , yet neutral enough to avoid competing with the data curves , which also have a distinctive color scheme on which I could discourse at length .
Yes , I can talk the Tufte talk .
But I think the commenters were really asking how I create the graphs rather than why they ’re so elegant , and so I ’m going to focus here on the practical programming problem .
Most of my experience in drawing pictures with a computer comes from the world of print publishing , where the final product is ink on paper rather than pixels on a screen .
Compared with the online environment , print has some advantages , notably higher resolution ( up to 1,000 dots per centimeter ) and precise control over typography and color .
But print also has obvious limitations :
On a magazine page , there are no mouseovers or clickable buttons , and you ca n’t make a square knot twirl in 3D .
Thirty years ago , the big challenge for computer - generated illustrations was not how to draw the picture but how to get it out of the computer and onto the printing press .
You could n’t just export a PDF and place it in a Quark or InDesign document ; none of those things existed .
The only practical option was to print out the artwork , photograph it , and “ strip ” the negative into the page - size film that would be used to make the press plate .
Because of this emphasis on printouts , most of the effort went into programming the printer rather than the computer .
The figure below is the first published computer - generated illustration I had a hand in creating .
It appeared in Scientific American in 1983 .
The array of 282 tiny bar graphs was produced with an Epson MX - 80 dot- matrix printer , using escape codes to fire combinations of the eight pins in the printhead .
Of course the MX - 80 was a black - and - white device .
The two - color illustration was created from two separate printouts .
Also , the Epson letterforms were replaced with typeset characters .
The world of computer - generated illustrations changed dramatically with the arrival of PostScript , the “ page description language ” created by John Warnock and his colleagues at Adobe Systems ( based in part on earlier work at Evans and Sutherland and Xerox PARC ) .
PostScript was designed as a complete programming language rather than just a file format or a set of drawing commands .
And something else set it apart as well : attention to details of graphic design .
With most earlier software ( such as programs based on the Apple Quickdraw library ) , trying to create publishable figures was an exercise in frustration .
For example , the apparent weight of a line would vary depending on its orientation : lighter when vertical or horizontal , heavier when diagonal .
PostScript allows very precise control over such niceties of presentation .
To take another example , where lines meet the edge of a graph , you do n’t want to have to choose between falling short and overshooting ; PostScript provides the tools needed to make it look right .
( The version in the rightmost panel is created by allowing the colored lines to extend outside the background box , and then applying a clipping mask that cuts off all objects at the boundary of the box . )
Obsessing over minute details like these may seem comically fussy , but I believe that neatness counts in these matters .
To some extent , illustration is an art of illusion .
Graphs and diagrams work best when you can look through them rather than at them .
The viewer should be seeing the underlying information or abstraction –the array of correlation coefficients , the function y = f( x ) , or whatever –rather than noticing the mechanics of how the drawing was constructed .
A ragged edge is the kind of distraction that destroys the illusion .
Although PostScript was a giant step forward from the MX - 80 command set , in the early years it was still just another printer language , not a computer language .
The only way I could execute a PostScript program was to send it to a laser printer and wait to see what came out .
Sometimes it was a long wait .
I had no way of running a PostScript program on the computer itself .
( Ghostscript came later . )
My first PostScript illustrations were created as hand - written PostScript programs ; the same language was used both for doing the computations and for presenting the results .
The faces at right were created in this way .
( They were inspired by the work of Herman Chernoff and drawn to illustrate an American Scientist article by Robert Levine in 1990 . )
The dual role of the language caused me a moment of disorientation just now when I went looking for my records of this project .
I found an EPS ( encapsulated PostScript ) file , which I knew was the finished illustration , but where was the source code ?
And then I remembered : It ’s the same file !
Open it up in Ghostscript or Adobe Illustrator and you see those silly faces smiling or scowling at you ; open the same file in a text editor , and you see procedures for drawing elements of the faces :
/ draweyes { newpath dx dy eyewidth eyeheight 0 360 ellipse stroke ex ey eyewidth eyeheight 0 360 ellipse stroke } bind def / drawpupils { fx fy pupilsize pupilsize 0 360 ellipse fill gx gy pupilsize pupilsize 0 360 ellipse fill } bind def
Bill Casselman , the graphics editor of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , still favors this direct - to - PostScript methodology .
He has written an excellent guidebook , taking you from the basics of PostScript through an elaborate library for rendering three - dimensional objects .
But here I part company from Casselman ; I ’d rather not do all my computing in PostScript .
It ’s not that I have anything against the language itself , but the development environment is not to my taste .
I therefore adopted the modus operandi of writing a program in my language of choice ( usually some flavor of Lisp ) and having that program write a PostScript program as its output .
After doing this on an ad hoc basis a few times , it became clear that I should abstract out all the graphics - generating routines into a separate module .
The result was a program I named lips ( for Lisp - to - PostScript ) .
Most of what lips does is trivial syntactic translation , converting the parenthesized prefix notation of Lisp to the bracketless postfix of PostScript .
Thus when I write ( lineto x y ) in Lisp , it comes out x y lineto in PostScript .
The lips routines also take care of chores such as opening and closing files and writing the header and trailer lines required of a well - formed PostScript program .
But the lips interface is low - level , confined to drawing individual dots , line segments , rectangles and the like .
Assembling a complete graph out of these primitives is tedious .
For example , the grid of white lines in Figure 1 would have to be drawn one line at a time , with each line specified by a sequence of commands such as
( newpath ) ( moveto u v ) ( lineto x y ) ( stroke )
Before you can issue those commands , you have to calculate u , v , x and y .
Clearly , a higher - level front end is needed ; like everyone else , I call mine plot .
At the core of any plotting program is a simple operation : mapping points from an abstract user space to coordinates in a rectangular pane , the page space .
In Figure 1 , the y axis runs from 0 to 5000 ; values in this range have to be scaled to the dimensions of the graph , which is about 300 PostScript points , or 11 centimeters .
Mathematically , the transformation is straightforward .
Indeed , if I wished I could leave all the arithmetic to the PostScript interpreter , simply passing in the appropriate matrix elements for scaling and translation .
This is an attractive option ; it would allow plot to work entirely in user space .
But a few niggling details get in the way .
Consider the tick marks along the y axis in Figure 1 .
Their vertical positions are conveniently expressed in user coordinates : one tick every 500 units .
But what about the length of the ticks –their horizontal extent ?
This dimension is purely concerned with the appearance of the graph and has nothing to do with the content ; it ought to be expressed in unscaled units of points or pixels .
Here ’s a possible solution :
Let everything inside the rectangular frame of the graph–the area with the putty - colored background in Figure 1 – go through the scaling engine , but define everything outside the frame , including the tick marks and the axis labels , directly in page coordinates .
If you think this is the final answer , take a look at Figure 2 :
In this nonsensical graph ( constructed just for this occasion ) , data points are indicated by stars , crosses and diamonds .
The positions of those glyphs ought to be defined in user space , but the drawing commands that create the shapes are properly defined in page coordinates .
If we tried to draw the glyphs in user space , their size and shape would vary with position in the graph .
What ’s the best way to deal with this messy situation ?
Is there some tidy solution that will reconcile the two coordinate systems and allow all dimensions to be treated uniformly ?
I do n’t believe so ; it ’s just in the nature of graphs to mix up elements from these two disparate realms .
We look through a window into a world of data or mathematical abstractions , but we also draw our own little doodles on the window itself .
Of course there are solutions ; they ’re just not as pretty as I would like .
My own strategy for coping is to attach extra information to each geometric point , indicating whether or not the x and y coordinates are to go through the scaling transformation .
This is less troublesome than it might seem ; from the user ’s point of view , it ’s almost always invisible .
In writing the lips and plot programs , I walk a path that is already worn smooth by many earlier footsteps .
I do n’t know who wrote the first computer program for plotting data , but it probably came soon after the first program for producing data .
Today we have hundreds of clever , comprehensive , well - designed and well - maintained programs for plotting and graphing .
Gnuplot is very capable ;
Grace is one I ’ve never used but I ’ve heard good things about it ; Mathematica , Sage , R , MATLAB , Octave and the like all have elaborate graphics facilities built in ; the Python world , as usual , has an overabundance of options ; there are a few libraries for my beloved Lisp ; you can even do dataviz online .
All of which raises the question of why I bother to roll my own .
I ’ll never keep up–or even catch up –with the efforts of major software companies or the huge community of open - source developers .
In my own program , if I want something new–treemaps ?
vector fields ?
the third dimension ?
– nobody is going to code it for me .
And , conversely , anything useful I might come up with will never benefit anyone but me .
The trouble is , every time I try working with an external graphics package , I run into a terrible impedance mismatch that gives me a headache .
Getting what I want out of other people ’s code turns out to be more work than writing my own .
No doubt this reveals a character flaw : Does not play well with others .
In any case , the time for change is coming .
My way of working is woefully out of date and out of fashion .
PostScript is a technology that even Adobe seems to regard as outmoded .
And making ultraprecise PostScript graphs is quite silly when their destination is the web ; before I can put them online , I have to convert them to low - res PNG images .
Furthermore , a PostScript - based workflow loses out on all the interactive richness of the web .
These are deathly still images .
How can I expect to earn any web cred when my work is not even clickable , much less multitouch - enabled ?
If I continue in my stubborn , do - it - yourself mode , I could replace the PostScript back end with one that generates SVG .
This would n’t be a major undertaking .
But is SVG the right answer ?
It ’s been around for more than a decade and you still do n’t see much of it in the wild .
And there are horrid browser incompatibilities .
I suspect that Javascript ( and JQuery ) has a brighter future .
And if I can get over my abreaction to libraries , there are plenty of options .
Advice anyone ?
Update 2010 - 03 - 13 : Many thanks for all the thoughtful comments .
Herewith a few comments on comments :
Ron Renaud ’s graphs using Javascript in a canvas element are really very pretty , and they give me renewed hope that web graphics can measure up to a print standard .
But is the world quite ready for the canvas ?
This is a blog , after all .
Lots of people get to it with an RSS reader , not a web browser .
Zvika requests a link to a higher - resolution PNG .
I do n’t know how to do that .
I can make a larger PNG , but the resolution –the dots per centimeter –is really determined by the screen you ’re looking at .
Which is not to say that larger illustrations would n’t be a good idea .
When I redesign these pages , I want to allow more room for bigger pictures .
Gary Reuben suggests Python Matplotlib and the ggplot2 package for R .
The latter is new to me , and very impressive .
I want to go read more about it .
Several other readers favor SVG .
I ’m okay with that .
It looks easy to change my current software to generate SVG output instead of ( or in addition to ) PostScript .
The question remaining for me is whether SVG on the web is something that browsers ( and , again , RSS readers ) can swallow without choking .
John Haugland mentions PDF as the successor to PostScript .
I could n’t possibly survive without PDF these days , but I do n’t see it as an ideal medium for illustrations embedded in web pages .
Reading PDFs within a browser requires a plugin , which some people refuse to install .
( I ’m one of those people . )
Furthermore , because PDF is a binary format based on a directory of offsets to tables , it ’s more trouble to write PDF files than either PostScript of SVG .
Nate mentions Processing , the graphics and animation language created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry .
I ’ve written about this before at bit - player and elsewhere .
I ’m a big fan , but Processing is essentially a front end to Java , and I have reservations about embedding Java applets in web pages .
John Ressig ’s reimplementation of the language in Javascript overcomes that problem , and one of these days I ’ll get around to doing something serious with it .
Finally , Marc asks for a look at my Lisp code .
I ’m always shy about sharing such unfinished things , but here it is .
Update 2010 - 03 - 28 : When commenter Zvika asked for higher - resolution graphics , my reply was unhelpful ; let me now try to say something more useful .
Even though I ca n’t do anything to improve screen resolution , I can , as Zvika notes , provide a larger version of each image .
The Wikipedia way of doing this , which Zvika mentions , is to link to a separate HTML page , which replaces everything on the page you ’re currently reading .
As a test , I ’ve done this with Figure 1 above ; click on that figure and you ’ll be whisked away to a supersized version of the graph .
To get back here , you ’ll have to use your browser ’s “ back ” button .
Another approach , adopted by , for example , the New York Times , is a pop-up window .
I ’ve done this with Figure 2 above ; click on it and a new window with a bigger version will open in front of this page .
Personally , I dislike both of these strategies .
I want to see the words and the pictures at the same time in the same context .
I suppose I could implement ( or swipe ) some glitzy Ajaxian solution that expands the artwork box within the window .
But I still feel the right solution is to redesign the pages so that there ’s room for larger illustrations in the first place .
( Admittedly I ’ve been meaning to do that for more than a year . )
There ’s also a question about how best to make use of a more spacious picture box .
In the supersized Figure 1 , the transformation is much like an optical enlargement , projecting the same information at larger scale .
The overall dimensions are doubled , and so is the width of each line , the size of the type , and so on .
This is probably the answer for those troubled by visual deficiencies ( including my own presbymyopic eyes ) .
In Figure 2 I have enlarged the illustration by 150 percent but kept all the individual graphic elements ( line weights , labels , the glyphs that mark data points ) the same size .
This kind of rescaling allows information to be read from the graph with greater precision .
Perhaps a middle way is sensible here .
Indeed , maybe type should scale as the square root of graph size ?
( CNN ) --
Female suicide bombers detonated explosions that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow during rush hour on Monday morning , killing dozens of people , officials said .
A Web site associated with Chechen separatists , who have long fought for independence from Russia , claimed responsibility for the attacks .
Immediately after the explosions , officials had cast suspicion on the separatists .
Chechnya is a southwestern Russian republic , in the Caucasus Mountains region .
Years of conflict have been devastating for its infrastructure .
Chechnya 's population of 600,000 to 800,000 is primarily made up of Sunni Muslims and Russian Orthodox Christians .
Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced in their conflict with Moscow .
Below is a timeline of the conflict .
August 2009 - The head of a humanitarian agency in Chechnya and her husband are found dead , their bodies stuffed in the trunk of their car .
July 2009 - A leading human rights activist is abducted and killed near her home in Grozny .
Natalya Estemirova , of the Russian human rights group Memorial , had openly criticized Chechnya 's authoritarian president , Ramzan Kadyrov , and his methods .
April 2009 - Russia declares an end Thursday to its 10 - year anti-terror " operation " in Chechnya with the rebel movement largely quashed .
The end to the offensive could see the withdrawal of thousands of troops from the Muslim - majority region .
April 2007 - Eighteen people are killed when a Russian - made Mi-8 military transport helicopter crashes in Chechnya .
Local media reports said the helicopter was shot down by Chechen rebels during a Russian operation .
September 17 , 2004 - In an e-mail message posted on the Chechen rebel Web site , Kavkazcenter.com , Chechen terrorist leader Samil Basayev claims responsibility for several recent terrorist attacks in Russia , including the Moscow metro bombing , explosions aboard two passenger jets and the taking of hostages at a school in Beslan .
September 5 , 2004 - The Russian government has one suspect in custody .
The death count stands at 335 hostages , including 156 children , along with 26 hostage - takers and 10 Russian special forces soldiers .
September 3 , 2004 - Russian troops end a standoff at Beslan , a Russia school in which Chechen rebels had taken several hundred students , teachers , and parents hostage .
September 2 , 2004 - Some Beslan hostages are released .
September 1 , 2004 - Armed attackers storm a school and herd at least 100 children , parents and teachers -- possibly as many as 400 , later revealed to be 1,200 -- into a school in southern Russia where they threatened to kill the children .
The hostage takers reportedly demanded the release of more than two dozen prisoners picked up during raids on Chechens in southern Russia in June and a Russian withdrawal all of its forces from Chechnya .
Some of the hostage - takers were reportedly wearing explosives belts used in suicide bombings .
August 31 , 2004 - A female suicide bomber kills nine people and herself , and wounds 51 others when she detonates a bomb outside a subway station in northeastern Moscow .
August 24 , 2004 - Two Russian passenger planes are blown up almost simultaneously , killing 89 .
Federal Security Service are focusing on whether acts of terrorism brought down the jets after traces of Hexogen are found in wreckage of planes .
Hexogen , a powerful military explosive , has been used by Chechen rebels in other bombings .
May 2004 - Akhmad Kadyrov , the president of Chechnya , is assassinated .
Kadyrov was elected Chechen president with very strong backing from the Kremlin .
February 2004 - 40 are killed and 100 injured when a suicide bomber detonates a bomb on a Moscow metro train .
June 2003 - A suicide attack kills 15 people at a concert in Moscow .
May 2003 - 59 people are killed when two suicide bombers drive a truck full of explosives into a government complex in northern Chechnya .

1994 - Russia sends 35,000 - 40,000 troops in to Chechnya to stop the rebellion .
1991 - Chechnya begins fighting for independence from Russia .
Moscow sends troops in , but withdraws them after a few days .
In the spirit of the 2010 Winter Olympics I decided to break down the Sabres roster by Country .
The Sabres roster is heavily influenced by North American talent and Americans in particular .
Of the 13 forwards on the Sabres roster , seven of them are Americans .
When breaking down the top six there are three Americans and one Canadian .
Of course Thomas Vanek is Austrian and Jochen Hecht is German and both are currently top six forwards .
A chart like this is never an exact science because so many players have dual citizenship .
Jason Pominville and Tyler Myers are dual citizens on the Sabres roster .
I listed Pominville as an American because that is where he chose to play in international hockey and I listed Tyler Myers for the same reason .
Follow the jump for a breakdown of the Sabres by Country .
Sabres Roster by Country
Forwards Defense Goalies Total USA 7 1 1 9 Sweden 0 1 0 1 Canada 4 4 1 9 Slovakia 0 1 0 1 Germany 1 0 0 1 Finland 0 1 0 1 Austria 1 0 0 1
The pie charts are difficult to read but they give you a better idea of the Sabres roster breakdown .
I find it interesting that only four countries are represented on the front line for the Sabres and over half the forwards are American .
Goals Scored by Country
Forwards Defense Goalies Total USA 76 1 0 77 Sweden 0 3 0 3 Canada 34 13 0 47 Slovakia 0 4 0 4 Germany 13 0 0 13 Finland 0 1 0 1 Austria 18 0 0 18
Points by Country
Forwards Defense Goalies Total USA 181 19 0 200 Sweden 0 15 0 15 Canada 84 62 0 146 Slovakia 0 9 0 9 Germany 29 0 0 29 Finland 0 11 0 11 Austria 39 0 0 39
The Charts above serve very little purpose but it does make us aware of the makeup of the team .
For argument sake I went through the rosters of the division leaders to look at country of origin and I was surprised at the number of Canadians on the rosters , especially the Capitals and Sharks .
San Jose has 14 Canadians on the roster and only four Americans .
If you want to use that as an excuse for the Sabres recent decent in the standings , I will remind you that the New Jersey Devils are constructed much like the Buffalo Sabres .
The Devils have a total of eight Americans on their roster and they are currently second place in the Eastern Conference .
In “ The Yellow Fever Pages ” ( full citation below ) , Karen Eng discusses a recurring problem she , as a Chinese - American woman , faces when dating : that many men , particularly
White men , who express interest in her are not interested in her as an individual , but rather in a generalized Asian woman and the fantasies that are associated with them .
Eng sums up the fantasies many men hold about Asian ( particularly Japanese ) women :
The fantasy Asian is intelligent yet pliable , mysterious yet ornamental … perpetually pre-pubescent–ageless and petite … high - pitched , girly –while simultaneously being exotic and wise …
She comes from a culture where women traditionally serve men… ( p. 68 ) .
Thus , when men ask her out , Eng has to figure out whether they are asking her out because they think she specifically is interesting , or whether they ’re asking her out because what they see is an Asian woman to whom they attach all kinds of expectations about exoticism , subservience , and so on .
As she puts it , regardless of how she presents herself , the interests she expresses , the type of music and clothing she ’s interested in , “ … they still see a little Oriental flower . ”
I could not help but think of Eng ’s article when one of my students , Casandra L. , let me know about the dating website ClassyAsianLadies :
The website specifically markets Asian American women to men in the U.S. , drawing on all of the stereotypes Eng describes .
Here are some images from the site ; I highlighted some of the most blatant examples of the “ Asian women as hot but also passive ” stereotypes in red :
So they are n’t trying to use you to get to the U.S. ( though , after stating these are women living in the U.S. , they are always described as Asian , not Asian American ) .
And the men who want to date them just love and respect “ the Asian culture ” ( and , you know , there ’s just one culture in all of Asia ) .
And how do you show your appreciation for a culture ?
By marrying someone who personifies the elements of that culture you have romanticized .
Notice the guys using the site appear to expect quite a lot in a woman : she has to remain “ a lady , ” be “ sweet , gentle , beautiful , loving , fun , ” but also be “ intelligent and independent . ”
I do n’t know to what degree the website specifically targets
White men .
There were three photos of Asian women with men on the site ; two showed Asian women with White men , one showed an Asian woman with an Asian man .
In case you are n’t convinced yet , here ’s some more information on why you should marry an Asian woman :
Unlike “ the average woman ” ( which presumably means White women in the U.S. , since we ’re the majority of women and all ) , Asian women have n’t become too competitive ( just intelligent and independent !
But that ’s different ! ) and certainly are n’t “ masculine . ”
Again we see the romanticizing of a certain stereotype of “ Asian culture , ” with Asian women having a “ well - known cultural attitude of gentle and caring support ” and “ Eastern values , ” which apparently involves being sweet and supportive .
Though they ’ve also “ learned Western values , ” which here is associated with being “ outgoing … independent and fun… ” .
Thus , the West = independent , fun women , while the East = supportive , submissive ones .
Notice the last line in that image : “ … that perfect Asian girlfriend or wife . ”
This is what Eng was getting at : this is n’t about finding the perfect girlfriend or wife ; this is about a fantasy of the perfect Asian girlfriend / wife .
“ Yellow fever ” refers to the fetishization of Asian women by men who have a specific idea of what Asian women are like and view them as particularly desirable mates based not on their unique personalities but because of the “ Eastern values ” they supposedly adhere to .
The women thus become somewhat interchangeable .
Eng ’s frustration grew largely out of the difficulty of getting men to notice her , as opposed to her status as an Asian American woman .
Some other gems :
Asian women are exotic but also make a lot of money ( no gold - diggers here ! ) .
Men find them “ intoxicating . ”
They ’re loyal , and “ dedicated to their men . ”
An Asian woman “ always thinks of her man first ! ”
They ’ll help with financial planning without being “ intrusive ” – that is , they ’ll make suggestions , but it ’s ultimately up to him to decide and she ’ll accept whatever he decides on .
They ’re “ easy to be with …rarely complain … and constructive with their criticism . ”
One of my students said the whole “ Wonderfully easy to be with ” section made her think of the way people describe breeds of dogs : “ Get a Labrador !
They ’re smart , fun , and easy - going !
They ’ll make a nice addition to any family ! ”
The translation to all of this : Asian women will offer their wisdom and support , but will then step back and let their men decide .
They are n’t bitches who will nag at you or criticize you in a nasty way , or complain that you are n’t doing half the housework , or expect to have an equal role in financial decisions .
And she wo n’t let herself go and become a fatty , so be assured –what you see now is what you can expect she ’ll stay like forever .
Aside from the objectification of Asian women ( and “ the Asian culture ” ) as having a predetermined set of characteristics you can count on , this says a lot about concerns surrounding changes in gender roles in the U.S.
These women are being marketed as the antithesis of the “ average ” woman in the U.S. , who is demanding , hard to get along with , too competitive , and does n’t stay sufficiently attractive .
Female assertiveness or insistence on gender equality is de-feminizing and unattractive ; it turns us into masculinized women who wo n’t submit to men ’s authority to take our ideas into consideration but make final decisions based on what they think is best .
For a certain group of men , then , dating an Asian woman is a way to reclaim a romanticized gender hierarchy in which women mix cultural elements associated with the “ East ” and the “ West . ”
They ’re independent and make money ( the fun part of female empowerment , unless the independence goes to far and they get uppity ) , but they retain “ Eastern ” gender roles in which their independence is , ultimately , limited by their passivity and submissiveness to men , as well as appropriate displays of femininity ( being thin , beautiful , and exotic ) .
And , thus , this type of relationship allows men who believe they have been victimized and emasculated by the women ’s movement to reclaim some of the overt patriarchal power the believe they ’ve been robbed of .
NEW ! ( Mar. ’ 10 ) : Rachel K. sent a link to this t- shirt , which ThinkGeek says translates as “ now accepting applications for Japanese girlfriends . ”
It ’s a great example of the fetishization of Japanese women :
( “ The Yellow Fever Pages . ” 2000 .
Bitch issue 12 , p. 68-73 . )
Also check out Lisa ’s post on marketing Asian women to specifically anti-feminist men .
NEW ! ( May ’ 10 ) : Sophie L. sent in this spam message she got on Skype , offering “ a sweet lady that will be caring and understanding ” in case ” European and American women are too arrogant for you . ”
In this case the source of of these nice , lovely women is Russia … which , yes , is part of Europe , but do n’t get caught up on geographical details .
You can find yourself a woman with “ royal blood and royal look ” !
Chevrolet Beat
Are you thinking of buying a Chevrolet Beat ?
We shall tell you all the things you need to know , before you go ahead and make the purchase .
This will be a review on the car .
There are many things about the car that you are bound to love .
For instance , the inside and outside are both funky and attractive .
It ’s light and easy to drive , and perfect for beginners .
You do n’t have to deal with any bumpiness , the ride quality is decent .
Plus , you will surely notice the superbike - inspired speedometer .
The interiors are well done , there is ARAI fuel efficiency topper , and there is a 3 year service guarantee from Chevrolet .
But the unconventional styling might not be for everyone .
The Chevrolet Beat comes from GM Daewoo ( South Korea ) , and it is based on the M300 platform .
The Matiz was based on the M100 platform , and the Spark was based on the M200 platform .
The Chevrolet Beat does not come in a beige option , there ’s no possibility of driver seat adjustment , keyless entry , or even steering mounted controls on the end .
The rear windows at the back are very small , thus you get a feeling of mild claustrophobia .
And the car is n’t available with diesel , that will be launched in a year or so .
However , the Beat does have a lot going for it .
The dashboard is cool and swoopy , and you ’re sure to love the superbike - style meter arrangement .
The exteriors are quite unusual , but it takes some getting used to .
There is a squarish digital display on the right of the speedometer , when you can find the information on the RPM meter and the fuel gauge .
At first look , the display might seem a little cluttered , but you ’ll learn to like it in time .
The Beat has subtle black panel , which runs from the front door panels to the dashboard .
One of the things that are rather bad about the Beat is the colors of the interiors – which are dull and boring .
The driving position is rather low , and gives a slight sport - like feel to driving .
The front seats are quite support and the lateral support is excellent .
Plus , there is a tilt - adjustable steering wheel , with a three - spoke design , and there are even contours where you can place your thumbs .
However , you should note that you might find the bright silver finish of the steering spokes a little tacky .
But one of the things that work about the Beat is the fact that you can read the RPM , trip meter , time , and fuel tank crystal clearly .
There is no glare or reflection , even in broad daylight .
What ’s more , the Beat is quite different from the Spark , in the sense that the control stalks are correctly configured for right hand drive , for instance , the wiper controls are on the left .
The dashboard is also set a little higher , and the driver ’s seat is rather low .
The ergonomics of the car are up to standard , all the crucial controls are right at hand .
You might find the cut of the gear - knob a little strange ; perhaps a traditional design would have been better ?
You ’ll like the clarity of the wing mirrors ; they are also quite user - friendly , even the left hand mirror gives you a good view of the two expressway lanes .
But you do n’t have electric adjustment for the mirrors , unfortunately .
There is also no MID showing real - time fuel efficiency .
On the whole , the Beat has good interiors and finish , just that short drivers might have an issue because of the non-adjustment options of seat height .
Else , it ’s a pretty decent car which would definitely be a good purchase .
John Barrowman has said that he does n't want his Torchwood character 's sexuality to be reversed in the US version .
According to Entertainment Weekly , the American remake of Torchwood has plans to make his Captain Jack role straight .
" I hope wherever [ the franchise ] goes that the show stays the same , " said the actor .
" The last thing I would want would be for Jack to become this heterosexual , straight hero .
He 's an omnisexual guy .
He likes men , women , aliens , whatever .
I think we should continue going down that route . "
The star added that any effort to change Captain Jack 's sexual orientation would need to involve a " big discussion " between creator Russell T Davies and his producing partner Julie Gardner .
As for additional information about the spinoff , Barrowman claimed that he only knows what has already been reported , including that Fox has commissioned Davies to write the pilot .

Liveblog of talk on Sporadic Play , Bryan Cash & Jeremy Gibson
Sporadic play describes a game where mechanics intentionally limit how often a player interacts with a persistent game world .
We ’ll talk about history with it , why it is a good thing , design concepts , and a bit about the future .
HISTORY … IN REVERSE
Most obvious place to start — Facebook .
Look at the top 20 games here .
Farmville is # 1 and uses sporadic play .
Mafia Wars , Petville , YoVille , 16 of the top 20 are sporadic play games .
If you add up the MAU , you get 332 m people , which is kinda BS , but just in the top 20 .
It has also been around in console and traditional PC games .
Animal Crossing , a game where as time went on in real life , events like Christmas happened in the game too .
Seasons , real time , limiting what you can do based on the real time of the real .
Another one was Kingdom of Loathing in 2002 , a web game , limited number of things you can do based on action points .
Another recent example is play by email or play by forums .
You may be familiar with Gaia Online — a game in the form of a forum .
There are also RPG forums and PBEM RPGs .
And Tradewars 2002 — which came out in 1984 , when 2002 was THE FUTURE .
You flew around to different planets , traded , had fights .
And at the end of your actions for the day , you had to leave your spaceship online while you had your day , vulnerable .
So you would park your ship in the deepest darkest corner of space .
29.9 m players of fantasy sports in 2007 … pick rosters , teams , and then you get delayed results and watch what happens .
Has been around since 1960 .
You are playing a game as a metagame around another game .
Going further back … play by mail .
Peaked in the 1980s , but started as mail rules for Diplomacy by John Boardman in the 1960s .
There were three magazines devoted to playing games by mail .
And then there is chess , by correspondence .
Since you had so muh time you could do research , look up moves in books , and pick the optimal period .
On this sheet people would mail back and forth there were choices for “ I ca n’t read your handwriting ” — a 2 month delay in a move !
This goes back to the middle ages , kings sending moves back and forth .
The conference game this year is BackChannel , which is betting on keywords that will be tweeted during the show … a high tech sporadic version of Buzzword Bingo .
The stock market is also premised on sporadic play .
Limited interaction , persistent world … been going on since 1602 in Amsterdam and 1309 in Antwerp .
And evolution : from a species point of view it is a sporadic play game .
You get limited interaction , then 9 months later , a result … slow feedback … but hey after billions of years , we think we won .
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
It does not mean casual .
People lump them together , and there is overlap , but consider Bejeweled Blitz .
You can keep playing it as much as you want .
Key differences …
* depth of gameplay — stock market is a deep game .
* Variability of learning curve .
Casual games have smooth ones … sporadic games vary a lot .
* Potential time commitment .
Bejeweled Blitz can eat 4 hours … but a sporadic play game intentionally CAP you , so the potential for time commitment is lower .
* Persistence … the world persists in some way , and does not reset .
* Sporadic does not necessarily mean asynch multiplayer .
It focuses on the relationship between the player and the game .
It frequently USES asynch multiplayer of course .
WHY CARE ?
Millions of people play sporadic games on social networks .
People tend to talk about these in terms of viral tricks and we wanted to talk about it differently .
Also , reaching broad audiences .
We were traditional gamers who did n’t have time anymore but still want to play .
Then there is the multitasking gamer .
It is more common now to find gamers who are playing multiple games at once .
Then there are non-traditional gamers .
They are looking for “ something to do ” with low time commitment and barrier to entry .
All of these audiences can be served by the same sporadic game .
This is also a new lens for designers — lens in the sense of Jesse Schell ’s lenses in ART OF GAME DESIGN .
Many games now are sporadic but we do n’t think of them that way .
We believe sporadic play can be added to existing games and allow them to reach broader audiences .
SKYRATES
We made this back in 2006 at ETC at CMU .
In 2008 it won an award at the IGF , and also some awards from JayIsGames .
You play a character , build up skills , you have a plane .
Buy weapons , etc .
You fly places , you click on the combat icon , and fight some pirates in real time action .
But mostly , you just fly .
A screen with the plane bobbing up and down .
Flight in the game is in real time .
You trasport goods like fish from one town to another .
But the entire time for this trade route is 11 hours and 32 minutes … you can see a timeline of a traderoute with multiple stops stretching into the future .
The game used to SMS players when an attack happened , interrupt you while you were doing your taxes or whatever .
Fights with pirates accumulate , so you can catch up whenever you come back .
So it is a game where you spend the majority of your time not playing it .
But there ’s a persistent world , with brief interaction .
My avatar in the game keeps doing my action queue while I go on with my life .
Now , Skyrates is not perfect .
But it taught us a lot about these sort of games .
WHAT IS SPORADIC PLAY GOOD FOR ?
Respecting player ’s time .
( WoW screenshot … two guys who have played for 3 weeks … one an hour a day , and one 20 hours a day …
“ I HATE this latter guy ” ) .
But in sporadic play , even if you have 20 minutes a day you feel competitive .
Also , it is n’t about player position , but about velocity — how well are you using your time every day , how efficiently you are using your time .
We did some analytics , showing players the other players using the same plane they had , comparing yourself that way , on efficiency .
Managing obsession .
Everyone loves cake , but it can be too awesome .
Players often play to the point of oversaturation … they get exhausted , who burn out beause the game allows them to play as much as they want .
They play until they are sick of it .
Remember the old showbiz rule : always leave them wanting more .
Developer benefits : it extends the life of your content .
With 20 minutes of time , they run through content at a metered rate .
It gives you more time to develop .
And you an develop more based on consumption trends — watch where they go and what they consume and develop in response to that .
You can “ prune ” your procedural content towards what players want .
Some examples … in Kingdom of Loathing or FB games they use metrics to decide on content .
And in WoW they added daily quests , adding ways to block the rate of consumption .
Indirectly turning it into more of a sporadic game .
These are elements allowing you to play it sporadically of you need to .
It lets you internalize a game … a constant drip feed of interaction reminding you to re-engage .
Email , Twitter , Facebook , SMS , “ I should check in . ”
EVE
Online demonstrates that sporadic play does not need to be casual .
Skill learning in EVE is sporadic — from a few minutes to a month to learn something .
There are players who just research , and do n’t play the game in any other way .
When a game is internalized , it becomes a regular activity … like checking your email , but it takes less time .
Check in between classes , or at work .
Keeps it in the back of your mind all day .
It makes your life a little more exciting .
Sporadic play gives us new revenue models .
Time is the most valuable resource , and we let people pay for the fourth dimension !
Time is worth way more than their money .
Having a more lucrative use of the time you have is really powerful .
I might pay for a 50 % luck bonus or 10 % boost to Xp for a day .
Also paying to avoid the parts of a game you do n’t like .
Buy a mining robot to avoid the dull mining .
So people pay you to play your game less , which also frees up server load .
DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR SPORADIC PLAY
* Time currency .
Some sort of point that is gained over time .
Action points , moves , health .
You can play with the rate it accumulates .
Mafia
Wars gives you a point every five minutes .
Others like Legends of Zork gives you 30 once a day .
Can you go past a maximum ?
Save them up ?
Can you adjust the rate with variation ( more on weekends ? )
Basically , this is about managing the obsession , you decide how often you want them playing with this mechanic , and how long an experience is .
* Scheduling things .
Groups of actions that occur as time passes .
You can sequential — queued movement .
Parallel actions — like cultivation in farming games .
A question is who is doing the scheduling .
You can make it directed and tell the player , or give them the option to pick different schedules .
And when is the player notified of rewards ?
As soon as you finish the action , and then you have to wait for action points to accumulate ?
Then there ’s no suspense .
On the other hand , if you hold off the feedback on success , whether the action worked , that means two hours of wondering what the outcome will be .
Then there is the question of how many items can be scheduled .
How many fields do you have , how long a queue ?
* Uncertainty .
Weighing the chances on whether an action may happen .
Predicting the state of the game in the future … since this is a persistent world , the state can change over time .
So if I send things in a direction which will take 5 hours , there ’s the possibility that stuff changes in the 5 hour interim .
A question to ask is how much do you want players to look ahead .
You have to ask yourself how much complexity you want .
And how powerful do you want to make prediction ?
In Skyrates everyone was moving goods … so you tried to move goods to somewhere that was a good place to sell , but other players could see it too …
There is also real life uncertainty , whether real life obligations can interfere .
* Punctuality .
Player attention to the schedule .
It ties into how players make choices .
You plant crops , if you set up the game so that they get double crops if they show up on time , or spoil if they take too long .
If it takes a ouple of days to spoil , that is a lot easier for players .
These elements add risk and analysis to the game for players .
The design question is do I want to reward punctuality , punish for being late ?
Determines how hardcore the game feels , how risky decisions are .
And is there insurance ?
You could make a really bad deal in Skyrates where your guy did stuff poorly because you set it up in advance and things changed … so they added an insurance mechanic to prevent a bad decision by the bot .
* Multiplayer .
How do player affect one another ?
Competition via leaderboard is one way .
Trading in Skyrates was indirect comptition , or Mafia wars attacks when you are not looking .
Cooperation is possible too — ways to help people via asynchronous play .
The funny thing about the current games is that some of them do this via asynchronous synchronous play , as in Mouse Hunt .
Tournaments happen on a schedule , people who are on at the same time do make a difference .
It forms some player relationships .
Roleplaying is another form … an event that triggers synchronous activity as a periodic or optional thing .
THE FUTURE
Engagement customization … a game that understands when I have time to dig in , or when I do n’t .
Most games just split this up .
Games that adapt to how much YOU want to play .
This goes beyond single player and into multiplayer .
You see some games where there is a core that is there for every fifteen minute timer , and others who play at longer intervals .
Is there a way to trade time , loan things , or otherwise play together within limits and be important to one another ?
Elegantly handling the desire to quit .
Netflix lets you put an account on hold , but lets you set a reminder to come back in the future .
A way to maintain a bit of a connection to them .
Let ’s say you are going to drop out for three mnonths , can the game play itself for you in that time so you come back thinking that it has still been there for you ?
Shared time currencies is the notion that action points could be shared between games or gamers .
Ways to use the points you earn across multiple titles from one developer .
Or you ca n’t play again until your whole group finishes ?
Or real life metrics — you play the weight loss game , lose one real life pound , that gives extra action points ?
Community consensus .
You can join a faction in wow , but so ?
Identity as part of a larger gorup is n’t that important .
But think of voting … it is sporadic in real life , and based on that our community arrives at consensus .
Can there be a sense of working together in this sporadic sense to shape the notion of what a group is ?
Multi-engagement gaming .
The idea that the same player can play differently on different devices is not new .
“ Keyhole interaction ” — complex game , like stock market , but simple interactions , buy and sell .
But multi-engagement means adding a companion to existing IPs .
Casual players supporting hardcore players , for example .
Think about a Call of Duty World Conquest strategic game on Facebook that ties into the CoD FPS ?
Add a Yellow Ribbon mobile app — add my gamertag to your yellow ribbon on your phone .
If you launchy the app daily , it means you are thinking about me , it boosts my character .
IN CONCLUSION
Sporadic play has been around for hundreds of years .
It can be integrated into many types of games .
It can be used to create companion experiences for existing games .
It can help small developers extend their content , and it respects the players ’ time .

From the questions segment … adding chat helped with frustration when you wanted to play but were out of points because it gave something to do .
After cost overruns , a series of delays , and almost a decade of hype , the F - 35 Lighting finally performed a vertical landing for the first time .
Yesterday at 1 P.M. , after descending from a 150 - foot - high hover , the test plane touched down on the tarmac at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station .
This is a significant step forward for the F - 35 , as its vertical takeoff and landing capability are crucial to the fighter 's role as a replacement for the aging Harrier jet .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) --
More than three decades after China formalized its one - child policy , the population - control program no longer applies to most Chinese and looks set to be abolished .
While government statistics are n't publicly available , a widely cited figure from state - media reports shows less than 36 % of the country 's population was subject to the policy , as of 2007 .
But even this low number may overstate compliance with the once - strict rule that bars Chinese couples from having more than one child .
Current exceptions abound -- including allowing a second child for many rural families , almost all ethnic minorities , families where both parents are themselves only children , and many other cases .
And for those targeted under the policy -- such as residents of Beijing , where the one - child rule is said to be more strictly enforced than in many other parts of the country -- financial penalties , either in the form of fines or exclusions from benefits , are the main deterrent .
Reuters
" There is no punishment [ for having a second child ] , just the need to spend money to obtain the hukou [ registration papers ] , " said a Beijing mother of a second child , who asked not to be identified .
" If you do n't want a Beijing hukou , that 's no problem .
You can send the [ second or third child ] to a private school , send them to an overseas university , or else go to Hong Kong and give birth there , " she said .
Hukou documents are crucial to allow citizens access to public services , including schooling , medical facilities and jobs .
Couples having more than one child in contravention to the policy must pay a fine to register their additional children .
Fines assessed for having additional children are calculated as a multiple of the per-capita gross domestic product in the parents ' domicile .
For example , residents of Guangdong province in southern China -- one of the nation 's most populous -- found in violation of the policy may be required to pay a fine that could be up to six times the family 's income in the previous year .
However , such penalties are n't always strictly enforced , and as a result , they have met with limited success in dissuading high - income families from having a second , or even a third child .
Recent Chinese media accounts have highlighted an increasing number of well - to - do couples who have more than one child by paying the fines .
The official version , meanwhile , stays unchanged .
" I believe the policy is slowly being relaxed and will eventually be removed .
But there is a bureaucratic machinery that now protects the existing system , so I think this will take time , " said John Bacon - Shone , associate dean for research at the faculty of social sciences at The University of Hong Kong .
In fact , intense speculation that China may allow couples to have two children recently forced officials to formally refute them .
Zhao Baige , deputy director of the National Population and Family Planning Commission of China , said last month that China 's family - planning policy will remain unaltered during the 12th five - year plan , which is slated to run from 2011 to 2015 .
Pursuing zero - growth
To be sure , China is paying a heavy social cost for the one - child policy and has reasons to kill the rule .
A rapidly ageing population without an adequate social - security net and shrinking ranks of young workers present a demographic time - bomb for the nation .
The fertility rate is now estimated between 1.6 and 1.9 , already below the replacement level of around 2.1 .
So if the current trend continues , the population is forecast to start declining within a couple of decades .
And other side effects from the policy pose problems .
In the past , stories abounded , for instance , of some Chinese couples seeking to have a son and aborting daughters , to the point where doctors are now generally forbidden by law to tell pregnant women the sex of their child - to - be .
Siu Yat -ming , associate dean and associate professor of sociology at Hong Kong Baptist University , pointed out that when China initially introduced the one - child policy , it was only meant to be in place for one generation and was aimed at slowing the rate of growth , not reducing the population .
Siu , an expert on Chinese demographics and family - planning studies , said the administration is pursuing a " zero - growth [ population ] policy , " and one reason policy makers have n't ended the one - child policy as yet , is that they fear a return to unbridled population growth .
In the early days of the People 's Republic of China , couples were encouraged to raise large families .
Officials now maintain that without the family planning policies introduced in the late 1970s , China 's population would have risen to over 1.7 billion by 2008 -- higher than its population today by more than 350 million , equivalent to the population of the U.S. and Canada put together .
This concern , says Siu , is the reason for caution .
" They are afraid of giving the wrong signal to the population .
They will do it step by step , and not open the policies so quickly , " he said .
" They are already doing experiments -- relaxing policies in rural areas and seeing the results .
...
If they find that they can control [ population growth ] , then they will do it on a larger area . "
Even when China does officially lift the one - child rule , the country may continue to have family - planning policies in place to prevent a return to the explosive growth in its population , said Siu .
Chinese officials contacted by MarketWatch were n't able to provide immediate comment for this report .
Peer pressure and consumer culture
While China 's one - child policy has drawn criticism , especially outside the country , its general acceptance by the Chinese population can come as a surprise .
An often - quoted 2008 survey by the Washington , D.C. - based Pew Research Center showed that nearly 76 % of China 's population supports the policy .
Meanwhile , anecdotal evidence suggests mixed views on those who do have additional children .
Gao Dacheng , an IT professional living in Beijing , says wealthy couples with multiple children are " admired " as they can afford better education and lifestyle for their offspring .
However , the poor or ill - educated parents having addition children " are thought to be stupid , " particularly those who " never stop bearing children until they get a boy , " he said .
Gao said he himself does n't plan on having a second child , though he knows others who do .
Michael DeGolyer , a professor at the government and international studies department at Hong Kong Baptist University , says attitudes to both the policy and its breach are tied to a cultural pressure to conform .
He says Chinese society has " this incredible tradition of peer pressure and moral pressure on behavior " and a " tradition of preaching what you should and should n't do that could actually put Christianity to shame . "
But DeGolyer says such attitudes can change , citing the Chinese preference for male children .
In the old days , some women would go as far as to commit suicide if they could n't have a male child to carry on the family name .
But a new " consumer culture " is changing that preference , as China 's development creates a more prominent economic role for women .
" Having a child is totally different from what it used to be .
[ Earlier ] , you would have children to support you during your old age and carry on the family name .
But now , it 's also applying to wealth and connections and influence , " DeGolyer said .
But in terms of the one - child policy , attitude may be less of a factor than the growth of China 's cities .
In 1978 , less than 18 % of China 's population lived in urban areas .
Three decades later , the figure had surged to nearly 46 % , as the Chinese economic engine created millions of jobs that enticed would - be farm workers to the cities .
As a result , DeGolyer says , China 's population growth may change little , even if it ends the policy completely .
" In no country have cities been generating population .
They 've been consumers of population .
It 's the rural regions which generate population , " said DeGolyer .
WCBS TV reports that Lee Evans , an early suspect in the 1978 disappearance of five Newark , New Jersey teenagers , has been arrested for their murder along with another as - yet - unidentified man .
The Associated Press reports that Evans had earlier been eliminated as a suspect after passing a polygraph test :
The boys , Melvin Pittman and Ernest Taylor , who were both 17 , and Alvin Turner , Randy Johnson , and Michael McDowell , who were all 16 , were last seen on a busy street near a park where they had played basketball on Aug. 20 , 1978 .
They were with a carpenter , Lee Evans , who routinely hired teens to help him with odd jobs , police have said .
Evans told police at the time that he dropped off the boys on a street corner near an ice cream parlor .
Later that night , Michael McDowell returned home and changed clothes , then returned to a waiting pickup truck with at least one other boy inside .
That was the last confirmed sighting of any of the teens .
Evans was repeatedly interviewed in the months after the disappearances but passed a polygraph examination and was cleared as a suspect .
If Evans is indeed guilty of killing the “ Clinton Avenue Five , ” then this is yet another case where misplaced reliance on the pseudoscience of polygraphy led to investigatorial misdirection .
Such cases include those of “ Green River Killer ” Gary Leon Ridgway , “ Woodchipper Killer ” Richard Crafts , “ Angel of Death ” Charles Cullen , and Dennis Donohue , the likely killer of Buffalo , New York teenager Crystallynn Girard .
All passed polygraphs regarding their crimes .
Update : The Newark Star - Ledger reports that the second man arrested was Lee Evans ’s cousin , Philander Hampton , 53 , of Jersey City .

Yet another story about a school installing surveillance cameras in bathrooms reminds us that , while parents are treated as pedophiles for taking photographs of their own children , any perversion whatsoever is acceptable as long as it is conducted by those deemed to be in a position of authority .
“ Outraged parents have hit out at a school in Birmingham after pupils discovered CCTV cameras in the school ’s toilets , ” reports Sky News .
“ Youngsters at Grace Academy in Chelmsley Wood claim they returned from half - term to find staff had installed the cameras without notifying them or their parents . ”
The report points to another recent case in Britain , where a school in Salford filmed children in various stages of undress changing into their gym kit .
Parents slammed the move as a “ total invasion of privacy ” and many students refused to use the bathroom , but the school claimed that installing cameras to watch children in the most intimate setting possible was perfectly normal because “ children want to feel secure ” .
So as long as it ’s done in the name of safety and security , watching children in bathrooms is acceptable .
Perhaps child molesters who are caught with kiddie porn should use the defense that they are merely watching videos of children to make them “ feel secure ” .
But we ’re forgetting the golden rule – you ’re only allowed to engage in such behavior if you happen to be ascribed some position of authority .
We have reported on numerous cases of school officials installing cameras in school bathrooms which allow perverts to spy on children in various stages of undress .

Compare this with the case of Kevin Geraghty - Shewan , a man who dared to take photographs of his own son in public riding a toy train .
Geraghty - Shewan was promptly interrupted by a security thug who accused him of being a pedophile .
The man was then approached by a police officer and threatened with arrest for having the temerity to get upset about the situation .
Of course , the fact that Geraghty - Shewan and his son were simultaneously being filmed by a plethora of shopping mall CCTV cameras is beside the point – big brother is allowed to watch us but we ca n’t even record our own offspring without being lectured about how we ’re potential child molesters by those in petty positions of authority .
And it ’s not just school corridors and bathrooms where kids are being spied on .
Perhaps the most shocking aspect of the recent case in Philadelphia , where a school district issued laptop computers to 1,800 students across two high schools and then used concealed cameras within the machines to spy on students and their parents without their knowledge or consent , is the fact that school officials did not attempt to hide the scandal , they bragged about it .
In a PBS news clip , the assistant principle in a seperate case shows a reporter how , much to his own amusement , he spies on kids via their laptops and even takes pictures of them .
“ I always like to mess with them and take a picture , ” chuckles the man as the reporter whitewashes the alarming spectacle .
Watch the clip .
If a child pervert had been caught installing software on laptops that enabled him to watch and record children , there would be outrage , but again , when someone in a petty position of authority does it , it ’s normal and good .
This cult - like mass mental illness that anything done by an authority figure is acceptable strikes at the very root of everything that ’s wrong with our society today .
The broader argument is that schools across the western world are now beginning to resemble prisons as children are surveilled , policed and even arrested as criminals for the most benign adolescent behavior like doodling on a desk , as happened to 12 - year - old Queens student Alexa Gonzalez recently .
Regular drug raids , strip searches and lockdowns all inculcate within the child the notion that they are a prisoner of big brother from an early age .
Anyone who can afford to get their children out of the public school system and place them in a well - run private school or better yet , home school their kids , would be insane not to do so in the current climate .
For those who ca n’t afford to do so , you ’re going to have to spend a lot of time with your children in an attempt to reverse the psychological conditioning they are being bombarded with on a daily basis in the prison camps without bars that now pass for schools in many parts of the western world .

It is well known that the onset of puberty marks the end of the optimal period for learning language and certain spatial skills , such as computer / video game operation .
Recent work published in the journal Science by Sheryl Smith , PhD , professor of physiology and pharmacology , and colleagues at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn shows that a novel brain receptor , alpha4 - beta - delta , emerges at puberty in the hippocampus , part of the brain that controls learning and memory .
Before puberty , expression of this receptor is low and learning is optimal .
However , at puberty , increases in this receptor reduce brain excitability and impair spatial learning .
Dr. Smith has demonstrated that this learning deficit can be reversed by a stress steroid that diminishes the harmful effects of the alpha4 - beta - delta receptors , thereby facilitating learning .
" These findings suggest that intrinsic brain mechanisms alter learning during adolescence , but that mild stress may be one factor that can reverse this decline in learning proficiency during the teenage years , " says Dr. Smith .
" They also suggest that different strategies for learning and motivation may be helpful in middle school .
And it is within the realm of possibility that a drug could be developed that would increase learning ability post - puberty , one that might be especially useful for adolescents with learning disabilities . "
In 2007 , Dr. Smith and colleagues demonstrated that a hormone normally released in response to stress , THP , actually reverses its effect at puberty , when it increases activity of the hippocampus .
While in adults this hormone acts like at tranquilizer , in adolescents it has the opposite effect , an action that may help to explain mood swings in teenagers .
Catholic Charities in Washington D.C. has made its latest move in ensuring its homophobic policies remain intact as marriage equality laws are set to begin in the district :
" Starting Tuesday , Catholic Charities will not offer benefits to spouses of new employees or to spouses of current employees who are not already enrolled in the plan .
A letter describing the change in health benefits was e-mailed to employees Monday , two days before same - sex marriage will become legal in the District .
' We looked at all the options and implications , ' said the charity 's president , Edward J. Orzechowski .
' This allows us to continue providing services , comply with the city 's new requirements and remain faithful to the church 's teaching . '
Catholic Charities , which receives $ 22 million from the city for social service programs , protested in the run-up to the council 's December vote to allow same - sex marriage , saying that it might not be able to continue its contracts with the city , including operating homeless shelters and facilitating city - sponsored adoptions . "
Catholic Charities ended its foster care program last month because it would n't be allowed to discriminate against gay and lesbian married couples .
Darren Black , the head of home insurance at Confused.com , said : " I would n't be surprised if , as social media grow in popularity and more location - based applications come to fore , insurance providers consider these in their pricing of an individual 's risk .
We could see rises of up to 10 pc for people who use these sites .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs was a good sport today as he modeled a Team Canada hockey jersey at his briefing , paying off a bet placed on the Olympic gold medal hockey game last month .
Gibbs joked his attire " does signal casual Friday " at the White House , before turning around to show his last name and the No. 39 on the back of the red- and - white jersey featuring an iconic maple leaf .
To recap the wager : Gibbs said he'd wear a Canadian jersey to a news briefing if the Canadians won , and counterpart Dmitri Soudas , spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper , would wear the U.S. jersey if the Americans won .
Sadly , Team USA lost , but the Americans did have an impressive , record - setting medal haul at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver .
Gibbs said he wanted to wear the No. 39 in honor of Ryan Miller , the U.S. team goalie and Buffalo Sabres star who was named Most Valuable Player of the Tournament .
The surprise for the assembled reporters -- and those watching on cable and the Internet -- was when Gibbs took off his Canadian jersey to display a blue Team USA jersey hidden underneath .
The U.S. jersey bore the number 10 , which Gibbs said was in honor of the 2010 Winter Olympics .
Gibbs took most of his questions today wearing the U.S. jersey .
By the way , Gibbs said President Obama will pay off his own Olympic bet with Harper .
One case each of Molson , Canada 's favorite brew , and Yuengling , from America 's oldest brewery in Pottsville , Pa. , will be delivered to Harper .
Gibbs joked that Soudas might be drinking the beer himself .

Tentative de vol au Musée du quai Branly : «
Il y a deux procès dans ce procès »
Cinq militants , dont l’activiste congolais Emery Mwazulu Diyabanza , comparaissaient mercredi devant le tribunal de Paris , pour « tentative de vol en réunion d’un objet mobilier classé ».
Le jugement sera rendu le 14 octobre .
There are a number of factors that influence how well we do in school , including the amount of time we study and our interest in a subject .
Now , according to new findings in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , how quickly we expect to receive our grades may also influence how we perform .
Psychological scientists Keri L. Kettle and Gerald Häubl of the University of Alberta in Canada wanted to investigate how the timing of expected feedback impacts individuals ' performance .
For this experiment , they recruited students enrolled in a class that required each student to give a 4 - minute oral presentation .
The presentations were rated by classmates on a scale from 0 ( poor ) to 10 ( excellent ) and the average of these ratings formed the presenter 's grade for that part of the course .
Students received an email 1 day , 8 days , or 15 days before their presentation and were invited to participate in this research study .
Students agreeing to volunteer in the study were informed when they would receive feedback on their presentation and were asked to predict their grades .
Participating students were randomly assigned to a specific amount of anticipated feedback delay , which ranged from 0 ( same day ) to 17 days .
The results reveal a very interesting relationship between how soon the students expected to receive their grades and their performance : Students who were told they would receive feedback quickly on their performance earned higher grades than students who expected feedback at a later time .
Furthermore , when students expected to receive their grades quickly , they predicted that their performance would be worse than students who were to receive feedback later .
This pattern suggests that anticipating rapid feedback may improve performance because the threat of disappointment is more prominent .
As the authors note , " People do best precisely when their predictions about their own performance are least optimistic . "
Although this experiment took place in a classroom , the authors conclude that these findings " have important practical implications for all individuals who are responsible for mentoring and for evaluating the performance of others . "
As I quickly found out , American Home Mortgage had become one of the fastest - growing mortgage lenders in the country .
One of its specialties was serving people just like me : borrowers with good credit scores who wanted to stretch their finances far beyond what our incomes could justify .
In industry jargon , we were “ Alt - A ” customers , and we usually paid slightly higher rates for the privilege of concealing our financial weaknesses .
I thought I knew a lot about go - go mortgages .
I had already written several articles about the explosive growth of liar ’s loans , no -money - down loans , interest - only loans and other even more exotic mortgages .
I had interviewed people with very modest incomes who had taken out big loans .
Yet for all that , I was stunned at how much money people were willing to throw at me .
Bob called back the next morning .
“ Your credit scores are almost perfect , ” he said happily .
“ Based on your income , you can qualify for a mortgage of about $ 500,000 . ”
What about my alimony and child - support obligations ?
No need to mention them .
What would happen when they saw the automatic withholdings in my paycheck ?
No need to show them .
If I wanted to buy a house , Bob figured , it was my job to decide whether I could afford it .
His job was to make it happen .
“ I am here to enable dreams , ” he explained to me long afterward .
Bob ’s view was that if I ’d been unemployed for seven years and did n’t have a dime to my name but I wanted a house , he would n’t question my prudence .
“ Who am I to tell you that you should n’t do what you want to do ?
I am here to sell money and to help you do what you want to do .
At the end of the day , it ’s your signature on the mortgage — not mine . ”
You had to admire this muscular logic .
My lenders were n’t assuming that I was an angel .
They were betting that a default would be more painful to me than to them .
If I wanted to take a risk , for whatever reason , they were not going to second - guess me .
What mattered more than anything , Bob explained , was a person ’s credit record .
History seemed to show that the most important predictor of whether people defaulted on their mortgages was their “ FICO ” score ( named after the Fair Isaac Corporation , which developed the main rating system ) .
If you always paid your debts on time before , the theory went , you would probably keep paying on time in the future .
Bob ’s original plan was to write two mortgages , one for 80 percent of the purchase price and a piggyback loan for 10 percent .
I would kick in the final 10 percent , cashing out a chunk of New York Times stock — my last .
If I had been a normal borrower , the whole deal would have sailed through at a low interest rate .
My $ 120,000 base salary and my assets were easy to document .
But given my actual income after alimony and child support , I could n’t possibly have qualified for a standard mortgage .
Bob ’s plan was to write a “ stated - income loan , ” or “ liar ’s loan , ” so that I would n’t have to give the game away by producing paychecks or tax returns .
Folks , this is as serious as it gets .

***
Cisco Brewery 's The Woods # 3 Massachusetts , unknown ABV
This stout is aged in rum barrels , but there is n't a heavy rum or oaky flavor here .

MOSCOW — The Orange coalition of Western - leaning political factions in Ukraine ’s Parliament disintegrated Tuesday , in what could be the first stage in an effort to unseat Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko .
Ms. Tymoshenko , who led the coalition , immediately labeled the dissolution illegal , and vowed to continue to lead the “ democratic team . ”
She has so far rebuffed calls for her resignation from Viktor F. Yanukovich , who defeated her in a bitterly contested presidential election last month .
But the collapse of the majority coalition in Parliament , which Ms. Tymoshenko led , could seriously undermine her ability to hang on , analysts said .
“ I declare that the coalition no longer exists , ” the Parliament ’s speaker , Volodymyr M. Lytvyn , said in remarks broadcast on Russian television .
Mr. Lytvyn said that the Our Ukraine faction and his own bloc had pulled out of the coalition , leaving it without the 226 seats needed to hold a majority .
A 38 - year - old garda charged with attempted robbery has been released on bail after he gave an undertaking to abstain from alcohol and enter a 12 - week treatment programme .
A bench warrant had earlier today been issued for the arrest of Mario Boersma , with an address at Rosebay Drive , Forest Hill , Carrigaline , Co Cork , after he failed to turn up in court when his case was called .
He is charged with attempted robbery of Susan Stenning at Kilmoney Stores in Carrigaline on Saturday .
Mr Boersma is a garda stationed in Celbridge , Co Kildare .
He was charged at a special district court sitting in Cork yesterday and was released on bail and was due to appear in court again today .
However , when his case was called this afternoon , Judge Eamon O'Brien was told that Mr Boersma was not in court and he issued a bench warrant for his arrest on the application of Garda Inspector Billy Duane .
Mr Boersma 's solicitor Frank Buttimer told the court his client was in court earlier today but he appeared to be under some distress and unwell .
He was arrested by gardaí at Church Bay Road , Crosshaven , Co Cork , at 2 pm this afternoon and brought before the court .
His case will be back before the district court again on Wednesday .
Be warned my fellow humans , robots will not be satisfied until they defeat us in even the most trivial of contests .
Cube Stormer is the latest creation from Mike Dobson , aka Robotics Solutions , and not only is it made entirely out of Legos , it can solve any 3x3x3 rubik ’s cube in less than twelve seconds .
Often it can finish in less than five !
This thing looks badass and is incredible to watch .
Check it out in the video below .
We ’ve seen some impressive robots from the Lego Mindstorms community before , most notably the fully functional model of an ABB Flexpicker .
Little did I know , however , that these Lego bots were out to solve the Rubik ’s cube .
Cube Stormer is just the latest and fastest of these robots , there are many others .
Something else I did n’t know : 12 seconds is n’t even a world record for cube solving .
The fastest human solved a randomized cube in around 7 seconds .
Do n’t believe me ?
We ’ve got that video , too !
Still , if 12 seconds is n’t a world record , 2 seconds is .
That ’s the fastest we see a Cube Stormer solution in the video .
The fastest human average time for five solves is around 10 seconds .
I ’m guessing that the Lego robot could defeat this time by a significant margin .
What does this teach us ?
Robots are better than humans even when it comes to colossal wastes of time .
Oh , and robots are becoming more advanced everyday , even amateur robotics are impressive now , yadda yadda yadda Singularity , Kurzweil , future !
Sorry .
My mind needs a distraction after the psychological trauma that is watching one childhood toy ( Legos ) defeat another toy ( Rubik ’s cube ) in a pitched battle .
Maybe I ’ll go work on a Sudoku .
Lego robots have n’t attempted that yet , have they ?
DAMMIT !

Okay , so the anagram from Monday 's comic has still not been solved , so I thought I 'd give a few clues before letting it stand for ALL ETERNITY :
All words in the solution are dictionary words .
What 's more , all words in the solution are in the Jadrian 's awesome Qwantz Corpus !
The solution is natural - sounding , reasonably - grammatical dialogue that T - Rex would say , using phrasing that T - Rex would use .
The punctuation :,!! is in the solution , in that order !
The longest word in the solution is 11 characters long .
The solution does not refer to anagrams or puzzles or winning t- shirts .
However , what T - Rex is saying is directly related to the content of the comic the puzzle appears in .
The letters given are case - sensitive !
The first word of the solution is " I " .
I tested out Joel 's puzzle - solving tool and it does let you know that the correct answer works !
Also linked on Joel 's page are some brute - force scripts and even a branch - and - bound solver ( awesome ! ) , but the solution is long enough to make pure brute force not really feasable .
You 'll have to use your head .
I think that 's pretty much it !
Some of these clues I 'd posted on Twitter or hinted at , but now they are explicit !
And there 's a few new pieces of information there too .
Since this puzzle has gone unsolved for three days , the prize is now two t- shirts AND an adorable T - Rex Squishable !

Late last year , we described a genome sequencing technique that brought the price of consumables down to under $ 5,000 .
That technique , offered by Complete Genomics , has now been put to use : all the genomes have been obtained from a family of four in which both children suffer from two genetic disorders .
In addition to identifying likely causative mutations , the full family pedigree has produced new measures of human mutation and recombination .
So far , as each genome has been completed , it 's typically been compared to a reference genome that 's meant to represent a " typical " human .
But the human population is large and diverse , and the differences between a typical person and the reference may have been present in our population for thousands of years .
In contrast , by knowing the sequence of a child and both its parents , the changes in DNA that occur as a result of recombinations and mutations in each parent 's germ cells can be tracked in exquisite detail .
Of course , you first have to get rid of the errors .
Any method of sequencing DNA has a known error rate , and there are certain sequences in the genome that are more prone to these mistakes than others .
All together , sequencing the genome identified over 4 million bases in which at least one of the genomes differed from the reference sequence .
But nearly a million of these were identical in all four individuals ; another 3.4 million had been identified as sites of common variations within the human genome .
When all of these were eliminated , there were only 323,255 base changes that appeared to be distinct to this family .
The authors of the paper then focused on getting rid of some of the errors .
Some of these errors are caused by repetitive sequences , which sometimes cause genome assembly algorithms to delete portions of the repeat .
That dropped the number down to about 50,000 differences that were either new mutations or sequencing errors .
They resequenced every one of these regions and found only 28 that appeared to be new mutations in the offspring ; each of these was directly confirmed by mass spectroscopy of the relevant stretch of DNA .
The authors estimate that , all told , they 've eliminated approximately 70 percent of the sequencing errors , producing an accuracy of 99.999 percent .
After estimating the false negative rate , the authors concluded that humans have a mutation rate of 1.1x10 - 8 at each base , which means that every individual is likely to have been born with approximately 70 new mutations .
That 's a bit less than half of previous estimates , but it 's within the range defined by our differences with the chimp genome and an estimated time of divergence of 5 million years .
The precise map of differences also enabled the authors to track where pieces of the original parental genomes had been swapped by recombination .
The precise bases can't be identified , given that most of the genome is identical in all four individuals , but they were able to identify 155 crossover sites within a median precision of 2,600 bases .
Most of these occurred within known " hotspots " of recombination that had been identified previously .
As if all of this data was n't enough , the family itself had been chosen because both children ( and neither parent ) suffers from two genetic diseases : Miller syndrome and primary ciliary dyskinesia .
The former has not had a gene definitively associated with it ; the latter has had a number .
The simplest explanation of this would be a single recessive mutation , with the parents heterozygous , and the offspring homozygous .
Since the diseases are rare , the authors excluded any base differences that have been previously identified as common within the human population .
Only a single gene fit this pattern when identical mutations were considered .
But it 's possible for different mutations in the same gene to cause a single phenotype , with each parent carrying a distinct base change .
Three additional genes matched this pattern .
So the authors sequenced these genes in two other individuals with Miller 's syndrome , and identified DHODH , a gene previously suggested to be associated with the disease as its likely cause .
One surprise is that the primary ciliary dyskinesia is likely to be caused by a completely separate mutation .
DNAH5 , another of the four genes to come through this analysis , had previously been identified as a cause of that disorder .
So , the family appears to be unlucky enough to be dealing with two rare , recessive mutations .
That we 've reached the point where this work is even possible is simply amazing .
I 've really got no words for the fact that it was done by a mere 15 - author collaboration , only two of whom hail from Complete Genomics .
As the authors point out , we 're at the point where it may be cheaper and easier to sequence entire pedigrees than hunt down enough affected individuals to identify a Mendelian trait by traditional methods .
The fact that the approach generates additional useful data — things like human mutation rates and recombination locations have always been based on much rougher estimates — is really quite a significant bonus .
I anticipate that this wo n't be the first paper of its sort , and these estimates will continue to be refined as more family pedigrees are available at the genome level .

From the New York Daily News via Associated Press reports :
Global warming resolves 30 - year land dispute between India , Bangladesh : Coveted island sinks By NIRMALA GEORGE , Associated Press Writer Nirmala George , Associated Press Writer – Wed Mar 24 , 9:29 am ET NEW DELHI – For nearly 30 years , India and Bangladesh have argued over control of a tiny rock island in the Bay of Bengal .
Now rising sea levels have resolved the dispute for them : the island ’s gone .
New Moore Island in the Sunderbans has been completely submerged , said oceanographer Sugata Hazra , a professor at Jadavpur University in Calcutta .
Its disappearance has been confirmed by satellite imagery and sea patrols , he said .
“ What these two countries could not achieve from years of talking , has been resolved by global warming , ” said Hazra .
Note in the map below that the island was a river estuary , meaning it was n’t made out of rock as claimed .
It was made out of mud and sand .
From Wikipedia :
The island was situated only two kilometers from the mouth of the Hariabhanga River .
The emergence of the island was first discovered by an American satellite in 1974 that showed the island to have an area of 2,500 sq meters ( 27,000 sq ft ) .
Later , various remote sensing surveys showed that the island had expanded gradually to an area of about 10,000 sq meters ( 110,000 sq ft ) at low tide , including a number of ordinarily submerged shoals .
The highest elevation of the island had never exceeded two meters above sea level . [ 1 ]
… The island was claimed by both Bangladesh and India , although neither country established any permanent settlement there because of the island ’s geographical instability .
India had reportedly hoisted the Indian flag on South Talpatti in 1981 and established a temporary base of Border Security Forces ( BSF ) on the island , regularly visiting with naval gunships . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Wikipedia Map
The AP claim ( probably from Seth Borenstein ) is that global warming induced sea level rise has submerged the island , and that is complete nonsense .
Let ’s look at sea level trends in the region .
Here ’s the NOAA Tides and Currents map of the area from their interactive web site .
NOAA ’s nearest tide gauge shows sea level rising in that region at 0.54 mm / year , which means that would take nearly 2000 years for sea level to rise one meter .
See the plot below :
Note that since the island was first discovered in 1974 , the sea level graph above shows 19.4 mm ( 0.76 inches ) rise based on a rate of 0.54 mm / year .
Sea level rise is a relative phenomenon .
It can be caused by sea rising , or land sinking .
Sort of like sitting on a train at the station , and you ca n’t tell if your train has started moving or the adjacent one .
Looking at a satellite image of the Bangladesh delta , one can see how tides , currents , silts , and other factors shape what is a tenuous boundary between land and sea :
Temporary estuary islands and sandbars appear and disappear all the time worldwide .
Sometimes it can take a few years , sometimes a few centuries .
Note that most of the area near South Talpatti Island is only 1 - 3 meters above sea level anyway , which means that such low lying islands made of mud and sand are prone to the whims of tide and currents and weather .
Low lying islands are modified by nature on a regular basis .
For example we have Chandeleur Lighthouse in Louisiana
From USGS :
The lighthouse was situated on land until Hurricane Georges ( September 28 , 1998 ) .
After that the island had eroded from under the lighthouse such that the lighthouse appeared to be in open water .
Since Georges , although the island had reformed behind the lighthouse , the lighthouse remained in open water .
The pre-Ivan photo ( August 11 , 2004 ) shows the lighthouse in open water about 30 m from the shoreline , and the northern tip of the island was relatively broad and extended several hundred meters north of the lighthouse . …
It was probably the cumulative effect of four hurricanes in 7 years that resulted in the deep erosion ( evidenced by lack of shoaling ) seen now after Hurricane Ivan .
And looking further back in time , islands have disappeared before : from the Sarasota Herald – May 29 , 1937
While we are on the subject of islands disappearing into the Indian Ocean , even more interesting is the 2002 discovery nearby of a 9,000 year old city , submerged 36 metres off the coast of India .
==================
The city is believed to predate the Harappan civilisation
Lost city ‘ could rewrite history ’
By BBC News Online ’s Tom Housden
The remains of what has been described as a huge lost city may force historians and archaeologists to radically reconsider their view of ancient human history .
Marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 metres ( 120 feet ) underwater in the Gulf of Cambay off the western coast of India could be over 9,000 years old .
The vast city – which is five miles long and two miles wide – is believed to predate the oldest known remains in the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years .
=================
How many Hummers were they driving 9,000 years ago ?
Chalk up another clueless AGW claim .
Sea level rises and / or land subsides , estuary flows change , and sandbars appear and disappear .
In this case of a tiny sandbar / island near the Bangladesh delta , it has nothing to do with global warming .

US troops could be more involved in Kandahar
The US has said it is planning a new offensive later this year to drive the Taliban from the southern Afghanistan city of Kandahar .
The current action against the Taliban stronghold of Marjah was a " prelude " to a bigger operation , a US official said .
The US general in charge of Nato forces in Afghanistan has said the local population in Kandahar is at risk .
Kandahar is Afghanistan 's second largest city , and was once a Taliban stronghold .
' Reversing momentum '
A major offensive there would follow the current military operation in neighbouring Helmand province .
" If the goal in Afghanistan is to reverse the momentum of the Taliban ... then we think we have to get to Kandahar this year , " an official in the White House told reporters .
The US goal was to bring " comprehensive population security " to the city .
Suicide attacks are frequently carried out in Kandahar , with one at the beginning on February killing three people .
He described Marjah as " a tactical prelude to a comprehensive operation in Kandahar City . "
The Marjah offensive by Nato forces began in mid-February , and has several more weeks to go .
It was " pretty much on track " , the official said .
Kabul attack
In Kabul on Friday , explosions and shooting took place in an area of hotels and guesthouses popular with foreigners .
Up to nine Indians , a Frenchman and an Italian were killed .
Three gunmen and two policemen died in a gun battle that lasted several hours .
Taliban militants said they had carried it out .
President Hamid Karzai condemned the violence .
India called it " barbaric " .
Kabul has been relatively quiet since 18 January , when Taliban bombers and gunmen attacked government targets and shopping malls , killing 12 people .
Friday 's attack is also the Taliban 's first major raid since the arrest of key leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Pakistan this month .
When it comes to technology , the sex industry is no laggard , and as robots become more human - like in their appearance and abilities , US - based company TrueCompany is poised to launch Roxxxy – the world 's first sex robot - that has many more capabilities than your average sex doll .
Apart from having better defined physical features than previous dolls , Roxxxy has been programmed with her own personality and her manufacturers say she can listen , talk , carry on a conversation , feel your touch and respond to it , as well as move her private areas inside when she is being " utilized " to deliver an unforgettable erotic experience .
There are even plans for a male version - Rocky the Robot .
Roxxxy is the ninth version of TrueCompanion 's sex robot .
She began development in 2001 .
" Our first sex robot , Trudy , was built in the 1990s and was not designed for resale .
Rather , she was a test bed to refine techniques which we would later use in Roxxxy and Rocky TrueCompanion , " says designer and partner Douglas Hines .
While Roxxxy might look like a high - end quality doll , Hines assures us that the similarities end there .
Apart from her ability to move certain sections of her anatomy ( her three high quality construction " inputs " as he delicately states ) she also has a personality which is matched as much as possible to her owner 's personality .
" So she likes what you like , dislikes what you dislike , etc .
She also has moods during the day just like real people !
She can be sleepy , conversational or she can ' be in the mood ' , " says Hines .
She even has an orgasm !
Roxxxy has a heartbeat and a circulatory system !
The circulatory system helps heat the inside of her body .
Apart from the usual options sex dolls come with , purchasers can specify her hair color , hair style , skin tone , makeup selection , etc , ( the company can also accommodate custom requests ) , Hines says Roxxxy owners may decide to have the sex robot use one of her five other pre-programmed personalities :
Frigid Farrah – reserved and shy
Wild Wendy – outgoing and adventurous
S&M Susan – ready to provide your pain / pleasure fantasies
Young Yoko – barely 18 and waiting for you to teach her
Mature Martha – very experienced and would like to teach you !
And / or " you can build your own additional girlfriend personalities , " adds Hines .
" She interacts just like a human interacts , " says Hines .
" She hears what you are saying as well as where you are touching her and responds as appropriately as possible . "
For instance , if you have Roxxxy using her " Frigid Farrah " personality and you touched her in a private area , more than likely , she will not be too appreciative of your advance .
But if your Roxxxy is using the " Wild Wendy " personality , she will want you to do it again !
Roxxxy is flexible enough to allow owners to add to the five preloaded girlfriend profiles and change the existing five personalities to better suit their preferences .
Hines explains that it is possible to share girlfriends ( other Roxxxy robots ) with other owners by " swapping " them back and forth online .
" For example , you lend your custom - built girlfriend , ' Sexy Susan ' to one of your friends online – but he can only ' use ' her until Sunday morning and then she needs to be returned to you .
Until Sunday morning , he can ' engage ' your girlfriend by using your Sexy Susan personality with his Roxxxy sex robot .
You also have the option of sharing your girlfriend with everyone in our forum if you would like .
You will also have access to everyone else 's girlfriends , if they allow them to be shared . "
Hines says this is the same as wife or girlfriend - swapping without any of the social issues or sexual disease - related concerns .
" All of these features , which all of our sex robots share , make them truly a unique experience , " he says , proudly .
At present , Roxxxy models can only speak English but the company anticipates releasing Japanese , Spanish and German - speaking versions soon .
Hines says the company is pleased to have had thousands of requests to buy the sex robots and has had many inquiries with additional questions .
" When you decide to have your own Roxxxy , you will also be subscribed to a monthly support plan that will cover any general support questions as well as updates to your Roxxxy , " says Hines .
" Since the subscription service includes updates , she requires a link to the Internet via Wi-Fi .
If necessary , you can hook her up to a network cable if you do not have wireless access at your location . "
Who are potential buyers of Roxxxy ( and Rocky ) ?
Hines says the sex robots are helping individuals as well as couples spice up their sex lives as well as giving them a true companion ( i.e. TrueCompanion ) to share their most erotic fantasies or simply to have someone provide them with companionship and unconditional love .
" We also have many people that have hit a ' dry spell ' in their love life or do not have many suitable mates living near them .
Other couples want to experience a ' threesome ' .
We are happy to make our customers ' dreams come true with their own TrueCompanion . "
For those worried about privacy , Hines states that all information is kept confidential .
" Also , all billing and shipments reference the generic computer - sounding company name of our partner company : Data Software Solutions , LLC or Data Software Solutions Support .
Roxxxy ain't cheap .
This top shelf gal 's base price is US $ 7,000 but as Hines attests , she 's not a sex doll , she 's a sex robot !
" We have a limited time deep discount program being offered as well as flexible payment plans . "
Details are on the TrueCompanion website .

Any device with a remote consumes electricity when on standby
But do we know just how much power we are using when we switch things off or put them into standby mode ?
Energy management consultant John Field says : " Electronic devices like TV or video or stereos , anything which has a remote control , have to be live so you can switch on remotely .
" There is nothing to stop you switching it off physically , but if you are going to switch it off with the remote control , then something at the other end within the box has to be live .
" It has to have power and electronics operating , so there 's a bit of what 's called standby power . "
Ultimately , using your remote control can use more power than getting off your backside and pressing the buttons yourself .
Power consumption
Standby power can range between 10 and 15 watts , and occasionally beyond .
On its own , this is not much .
But if you get half a dozen devices on standby , it is the equivalent of a 60 watt bulb .
A PC is always using energy unless it is totally switched off
A laptop computer , for example , can be plugged into the mains via his meter which reads the voltage and wattage used .
The device is useful because the way the systems draw standby power can be difficult to monitor .
A commercial version is being put together by a group called DIY Kyoto .
Astonishing figures
All around the house we bleed power .
The modern home is permanently on standby , full of equipment that sits " half on " , waiting to spring immediately to life when we ask it to .
Figures from the Energy Saving Trust on standby power use in the UK home are astonishing :
Stereos on standby cost £ 290 m and produce 1.6 million tonnes of CO2
VCRs and DVD cost £ 194 m and produce 1.06 million tonnes of CO2
TVs on standby cost £ 88 m and produce 480,000 tonnes of CO2
It means that in one year , in the UK alone , our equipment on standby produces a total of 3.1 million tonnes of CO2 .
But there is a bigger culprit out there : the personal computer , as Scott Richards from power supply manufacturer Antec explains .
If you really want to be green with your PC , when you 're done using it turn it off
Scott Richards , power supply manufacturer
" And depending on what kind of mode you 're in that power can be anywhere between five watts to 60 and beyond .
" If a million PC users switched to a more efficient power supply , it would save almost the equivalent of 250 thousand litres of gasoline a day . "
By the end of 2004 there were 820 million PCs in use around the world , and by 2007 that will top a billion , according to the Computer Industry Almanac .
No matter how easy these devices make our lives there is little doubt that they are costing us and the planet dearly .
As Mr Richards says : " If you really want to be green with your PC , when you 're done using it turn it off . "
