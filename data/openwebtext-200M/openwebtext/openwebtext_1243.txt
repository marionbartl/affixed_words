COLUMBUS , Ohio -- Stefanie Spielman , the wife of NFL and Ohio State star Chris Spielman who led a public fight against breast cancer , died Thursday after a lengthy battle with the disease .
She was 42 .
Stefanie Spielman died at the family 's home in Upper Arlington , surrounded by her family , according to WBNS radio in Columbus , where Chris Spielman co-hosts a show .

" Stefanie has gone home to be with the Lord , " Chris Spielman said in a statement released by the station .
" For that , we celebrate , but with broken hearts .
I want to thank everyone for their support over the last 12 years .
Together , with your help , hopefully we made a difference in this fight . "
Stefanie Spielman was 30 years old and three months pregnant in 1998 when she detected a lump in her breast .
She later miscarried and discovered she had cancer .
She survived four bouts with cancer before a fifth recurrence in March .
Chris Spielman was playing linebacker with the Buffalo Bills when he decided to give up football for a year to stay home with his wife and children .
When his wife lost her hair because of chemotherapy treatments , he shaved his head .
" People say , ' It 's a great thing that you 're doing , ' " Chris Spielman said at the time .
" I always say it would be a terrible thing if I did n't . "
The Spielmans became advocates for breast - cancer detection and research , winning several awards for their dedication to the cause .
The Spielmans raised more than $ 6 million for research at Ohio State through the Stefanie Spielman Fund for Breast Cancer Research .
She helped form a support group for young women with breast cancer , hosted an annual event that honored cancer survivors and created a fund to help breast cancer patients and their families who struggled financially .
She was inducted into the Ohio Women 's Hall of Fame in 2002 for her work .
" We have lost a leader in the fight against cancer , " seven - time Tour de France winner and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong said .
" Stefanie was a living example of courage and strength to everyone around her . "
Two - time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin , the president and CEO of the Ohio State Alumni Association , said Stefanie Spielman was a compassionate person who " took her personal struggle and used it as a platform to help other women battling breast cancer . "
He said the Ohio State community was " tremendously saddened " by her death .
Chris Spielman played 10 seasons in the NFL with the Detroit Lions and the Bills before retiring after a violent hit that left him momentarily paralyzed when he was with the Cleveland Browns .
" The Lions ' family is deeply saddened with the passing of a good friend , " the Lions said in a statement .
" Stefanie touched the hearts of everyone who knew her .
With her strong faith and Chris ' devoted support , Stefanie smiled in the face of adversity and used her battle with cancer to help countless others .
She was and always will be an inspiration .
Our heartfelt prayers and thoughts go to Chris and the family . "
Spielman is currently a college football analyst at ESPN .
Stefanie Spielman is survived by her husband and their four children , Madison , Noah , Macy and Audrey .

Faster and dramatically more power - efficient than rotating magnetic media , solid - state disks ( SSDs ) are one of the longest - awaited and most eagerly anticipated technologies in the past two decades of computing .
The theoretical underpinnings of mass storage with no moving parts have been with us for decades , but the improvements that have put solid - state in economic and technological reach of ever larger segments of the storage market have been slow in coming .
As the tipping point draws nearer with ever - increasing momentum , let 's take a look back at the long journey to the practical SSD , and a look forward at the likely future progress of this technology .
A brief history of flash memory
Solid - state memory has been around since very nearly the beginning of computing , but a great many of the details have changed since that earlier time when ferrous ring memory was programmed with copper coils .
The first nonvolatile semiconductor memory technology even theoretically suitable for use as a disk was Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory ( EEPROM ) , invented by Intel in 1978 .
Using floating - gate transistors to store bits of information , and with specific read , write , and erase circuitry for each cell , EEPROM achieved roughly the read performance of RAM with no volatility and the ability to be rewritten many times .
It could , in theory , with the right device engineering , have been used as main storage for a PC .
There were serious problems , though : EEPROM was slow , it was expensive , it was power - consuming , and it was not durable .
Erasing and rewriting bytes of EEPROM can individually take milliseconds ( most of this time taken by the erase operation ) , so the full system would n't have been much faster than a hard disk .
Moreover , over 2,500 of Intel 's initial EEPROM module , the 2KB 2816 , would have been required to match Seagate 's 1980 5MB ST506 , at a cost of many tens of thousands of dollars next to the ST506's $ 1500 .
Such an EEPROM proto-SSD would consume about 1.5 kW of electricity while under a full writing load , about a hundred times the consumption of the hard disk .
Individual bits of EEPROM would burn out after about ten thousand write - erase cycles , which could be done to the entire disk in as little as three days of continuous writing .
For these reasons , among many more , the idea of an EEPROM SSD was never even floated .
The next new technology to come down the pike , invented by Toshiba in 1980 , announced in 1984 , and commercialized by Intel in 1988 , was a refinement on EEPROM which offered partial solutions to these problems .
Called NOR Flash Memory , the new technology used vastly less power , and allowed more write / erase cycles before burnout .
NOR flash omitted the circuitry to individually erase each bit , and instead it divided the available memory into blocks which could only be erased together , dramatically raising the speed of erase operations , but breaking byte addressability for write operations , and necessitating an awkward " read - the - block , erase it , write the modified block " operation for partial - block writes .
The simplified circuitry also lowered overhead and die sizes , lowering costs dramatically .
At this point , cost became the primary theoretical impediment to the development of SSDs , and a turning point was reached .
Of course , as time goes on , continuing development in semiconductor fabrication technology increases the speed , capacity , and durability of SSDs of the same design based on the same technology .
Costs continually fall .
But the price - competitive position of flash memory against hard disks is n't actually helped much by this .
In 1997 , hard disk prices were a factor of 30 lower than the spot price of flash memory , and by 2003 the difference was over 100 - fold .
Even Moore 's law can't compete against hard disk price scaling , which , ever since the advent of Giant Magnetoresistive Heads , has outpaced it dramatically .
Nonvolatile memory in the age of NAND
To make flash more competitive with magnetic storage , new technologies have been popularized which change the layout of flash further .
Optimized for low cost rather than speed , succeeding generations of Flash technology have been less about making Flash more suitable for disks than about bringing the advantages of NOR Flash to more markets by lowering its cost .
The first of these innovations , introduced in 1987 and commercialized in 1989 , was NAND flash .
The floating - gate transistors of NAND are oriented in a NAND gate , allowing lines of storage with failed transistors to function , and more dense packing of lines .
However , this means that NAND reads are not byte - addressable .
NAND is read in pages , which are larger than bytes but smaller than blocks .
Between the saved read circuitry , denser packing , and lower process quality needs , the cost of NAND is much lower than that or NOR , and its density much higher .
Write endurance is lower than NOR .
More than this , though , NAND turns read reliability into a statistical shell game .
Individual reads have a much higher bit error rate than with any of the prior - discussed types of memory , so much more aggressive error encoding is involved in ensuring that NAND reads are accurate .
Error correction begins with checksum bits in each page .
ECC bits in each block , and between blocks , escalate the level of error protection .
The latest twist on Flash memory is MLC technology .
All the systems we 've discussed so far store information by toggling each cell between two states ; a neutral and a charged state ; this is a single - level cell , or SLC , design .
In what has been referred to as multi - level cell ( MLC ) flash , each cell has a neutral voltage and three levels of charged state , for a total of four states capable of storing two bits of information .
While this scheme allows more data storage per transistor — and is hence much cheaper — reading more finely differentiated voltages requires finer measurement , which is in turn slower and more error - prone .
It also reduces the usable life of the Flash thus produced .
So SLC is superior in terms of performance and lifecycle , while MLC is cheaper and denser .
The performance and lifecycle gaps are dissipating as process technology improves , while the price and density gaps widen .
As the balance shifts toward MLC , higher levels of MLC technology become feasible .
The key advances were first made by a small Israeli company called M - Systems .
M-Systems released some of the first NAND flash drives for use in rugged industrial and military computers , the onboard systems for the Israeli Defense Force tanks and aircraft .
A number of years ago , M - Systems invented techniques that allow even finer voltage level setting and measurement in NAND cells , allowing them to store three bits ( eight levels ) or even four bits ( 16 levels ) per flash cell .
Referred to as X3 and X4 technology , this technique takes the price - and - density vs. speed - and - durability tradeoff of MLC even further .
M- Systems ' X3 and X4 technology is currently in the hands of Sandisk , which bought M - Systems in 2006 and gained exclusive control of the patents in an arbitrated dispute with Samsung .
The concluding judgment in the dispute ruled that Sandisk was n't bound by M - Systems ' license agreement with Samsung , so now Sandisk and partner Toshiba are now ahead in X3 and X4 technology , while behind in process technology .
The Intel - Micron Flash partnership , though , is advancing in X3 , and in the long run , achieving higher levels of cell level density , possibly including partial bits , will be an ongoing competition among manufacturers , not a one - sided arrangement .
The continuing evolution of nonvolatile memory technology from EEPROM to NOR to NAND to MLC NAND to X3 and X4 NAND , along with process improvements , are pushing the price - per - bit for semiconductor memory products closer and closer to that of hard disk drives , while retaining , at least somewhat , the former 's theoretical advantages in speed , latency , form factor , and ruggedness .
Given this climate , the eventual penetration of SSDs into storage segments currently dominated by hard disks is effectively assured .
The only questions are when and how it will happen .
Additional insiders have stepped forward to shed more light into Microsoft 's troubled acquisition of Danger , its beleaguered Pink Project , and what has become one of the most high profile Information Technology disasters in recent memory .
The sources point to longstanding management issues , a culture of " dogfooding " ( to eradicate any vestiges of competitor 's technologies after an acquisition ) , and evidence that could suggest the failure was the result of a deliberate act of sabotage .
AppleInsider previously broke the story that Microsoft 's Roz Ho launched an exploratory group to determine how the company could best reach the consumer smartphone market , identified Danger as a viable acquisition target , and then made a series of catastrophic mistakes that resulted in both the scuttling of any chance that Pink prototypes would ever appear , as well as allowing Danger 's existing datacenter to fail spectacularly , resulting in lost data across the board for T - Mobile 's Sidekick users .
Why Danger failed within Microsoft
Now , a new source has stepped forward to elaborate on why Microsoft 's Danger acquisition failed so dramatically .
This source , intimately involved in the core engineering circle of Microsoft 's Pink Project , outlined that Pink was n't simply the acquired Danger group , but existed prior to the acquisition .
While the Pink group operated within Microsoft independently of both Windows Mobile and Zune , this source claims that " Pink was in fact a Zune - phone , " in that " Pink was a third group tasked with taking Zune software and making it a phone . "
The pre-Danger Pink group was characterized as " A huge source of trouble , " with the source explaining that " the Redmond - based Pink designers brooked no feedback and won all appeals to higher management ( presumably by leveraging face - time ) . "
Pink was given Carte Blanche to assemble a team and get started , but external constraints prevented Danger from simply growing into the Pink Project within Microsoft .
" When Danger was acquired , Pink was already a going concern but had no engineering staff .
Microsoft discovered that Danger had unbreakable contractual obligations that meant they could n't turn us into warm bodies working on Pink , so they staffed up internally , " the source reported .
" By the time Danger engineering became available to work on Pink a year later , innumerable bad decisions had already been made by clueless idiots . "
In response to comments that have characterized the story of Microsoft bungling Danger and Pink as too ridiculous to be true , the source wrote , " no one really grasps how dysfunctional Microsoft has become .
Yes Microsoft did spend half a billion dollars for , as near as anyone can tell , absolutely nothing .
Not exactly the first time .
Asserting that it 's a ridiculous supposition is in no way disproving it . "
The insider then verified key elements of previous reports of the failed acquisition and datacenter outage : " Yes , the first thing Microsoft did was cancel the in progress Sidekick , and T - Mobile slapped them silly .
Yes , they set ambitious and clearly fictitious target dates and then make hard decisions based on those dates .
Yes , they half - developed features and then cut them to bring their dates in .
Yes , they have no one on staff with technical understanding of Danger internals ( as they proved pretty recently responding to the data center fiasco ) which means they have no one important from Danger .
" Yes , design is from Pink - Redmond , and technical is not from Danger , so what exactly is from Danger ?
Yes they cut SMS from the phone recently ( because SMS is ' too hard ' ) ; no doubt someone beat them up about that , but the point is that the decision makers are beyond clueless . "
Was Microsoft 's Sidekick data loss incompetent " dogfooding " ?
The prevailing story of how Microsoft could have accidentally orchestrated a complete failure of its Danger cloud services and then remained unable to salvage any user data from any backups says that Microsoft 's engineers attempted to perform a SAN transition that failed without any contingency plans in place .
However , while Microsoft has plenty of examples of poor management , it also has no shortage of qualified engineers and information technology professionals , none of whom would plausibly begin upgrade work on a production data center without an exit strategy and backups in place .
To the engineers familiar with Microsoft 's internal operations who spoke with us , that suggests two possible scenarios .
First , that Microsoft decided to suddenly replace Danger 's existing infrastructure with its own , and simply failed to carry this out .
Danger 's existing system to support Sidekick users was built using an Oracle Real Application Cluster , storing its data in a SAN ( storage area network ) so that the information would be available to a cluster of high availability servers .
This approach is expressly designed to be resilient to hardware failure .
Microsoft is well known for wanting to replace competitor 's technologies with its own .
The company famously failed to do this after buying up HoTMaiL in 1996 and attempting to replace its Sun Solaris servers with PCs running NT ; it similarly failed to smoothly transition WebTV from its original Sun-infrastructure to one based on Windows Server and WinCE clients in the late 90s .
Microsoft also struggled to help Dell replace its WebObjects - based web store after Apple bought NeXT in 1997 .
Striving to rid the company of foreign technology and " eat one 's own dog food " instead is so common that Microsoft 's employees are said to commonly use the word " dogfooding " as a verb to describe this .
Danger 's Sidekick data center had " been running on autopilot for some time , so I do n't understand why they would be spending any time upgrading stuff unless there was a hardware failure of some kind , " wrote the insider .
Given Microsoft 's penchant for " for running the latest and greatest , " however , " I would n't be surprised if they found out that [ storage vendor ] EMC had some new SAN firmware and they just had to put it on the main production servers right away . "
A variety of " dogfooding " or aggressive upgrades could have resulted in data failure , the source explained , " especially when the right precautions have n't been taken and the people you hired to do the work are contractors who might not know what they 're doing . "
The Oracle database Danger was using was " definitely one of the more confusing and troublesome to administer , from my limited experience .
It 's entirely possible that they were n't backing up the ' single copy ' of the database properly , despite the redundant SAN and redundant servers . "
Was Microsoft 's Sidekick data loss an act of sabotage ?
Still , despite the precedent Microsoft has set for failing to port existing systems to its own technologies , the company had no real or compelling reason to transition Danger 's systems over to Microsoft - based servers .
Few consumers were even aware that Microsoft was running the Sidekick service ; most customers would naturally think T - Mobile was operating its own support services for its subscribers .
Unlike HoTMaiL and WebTV , Microsoft was running the Sun Solaris / Linux / Oracle - based Danger servers as part of a contractual obligation to T - Mobile .
Microsoft was only interested in employing Danger 's talent to develop a new consumer phone of its own design , not in upgrading or rebranding the existing Sidekick platform .
This suggests that there was no reason for a major transition or upgrade to be occurring .
Instead , the fact that no data could be recovered after the problem erupted at the beginning of October suggests that the outage and the inability to recover any backups were the result of intentional sabotage by a disgruntled employee .
In any other circumstance , Microsoft or T - Mobile would likely have come forward with an explanation of the mitigating circumstances , blaming bad hardware , a power failure , or some freak accident .
An act of sabotage " would explain why neither party is releasing any more details : for legal reasons dealing with the ongoing investigation to find the culprit(s ) , " one of the sources said .
Due to the way Sidekick clients interact with the service , any normal failure should have resulted in only a brief outage until a replacement server could be brought up .
The very long outage of core functionality , followed by an incapacity to recover any data , both point to the possibility that " someone with access to the servers at the datacenter must have inserted a time bomb to wipe out not just all of the data , but also all of the backup tapes , and finally , I suspect , reformatting the server hard drives so that the service itself could not be restarted with a simple reboot ( and to erase any traces of the time bomb itself ) . "
Unlike a more conventional incident involving a suspicious failure , the source said , " the Microsoft IT forensic investigators who would normally be called upon to investigate this sort of thing are all trained on Windows servers and have no clue of any of the details of the Sidekick service .
" If this was an ordinary sort of failure , the service would have come back within a day , so once again , all signs point to sabotage .
If they erased the server hard drives , they would have to reinstall the OS on each affected server , then reload all of the server - side software and start everything back up , and who knows how many people are remaining at Danger who even know how to do all of that ?
Once again , there is no -one on the Microsoft side who is going to know how to do any of this .
" Certainly Microsoft has armored themselves against any kind of similar sabotage on the Redmond side , but Danger was always run like a small company where individual employees had a higher level of access to servers and such .
With Google , Amazon , and others promoting their own cloud services , why would anyoneÂ choose Microsoft for anything remotely mission critical after this fiasco ? "
Why Sidekick clients can't power down during the crash
Since the failure , T - Mobile has been warning its Sidekick customers " during this service disruption , please DO NOT remove your battery , reset your Sidekick , or allow it to lose power . "
The reason for this relates to how the Sidekick interacts with the Danger cloud services Microsoft was running .
" On the iPhone , you sync your data with your PC / Mac via iTunes , and MobileMe in parallel syncs both the iPhone and the PC / Mac with ' the cloud " [ at MobileMe ] .
If the cloud were to go down and everything lost ( like I said , an almost completely inconceivable occurrence except by deliberate sabotage ) , your data would still be preserved on both your iPhone and your PC / Mac , " a source explained .
" Unfortunately , it does n't work that way on the Sidekick .
The Sidekick was designed under the assumption that the cloud would always be available , and that your data would be safe there , so the device does n't try very hard to preserve your data if you were to yank the battery or in the rare event of a phone OS crash / reboot .
Instead , under these circumstances the device starts from an empty database and then reloads all of your data from the service when it comes back up .
" That 's why T - Mobile has been telling everyone not to pull the batteries on their Sidekicks or let them run down .
It is safe to turn the device off and on with the power button , and it should also shut down cleanly if the battery runs down , but once again , if it fails to shut down cleanly , it starts over from an empty database on the next reboot .
" What makes things even worse is that there 's no way to sync your personal data directly to your PC .
T - Mobile provides for a small fee a third - party app download to sync your data with Outlook on a Windows PC ( and there was a similar app for Mac at one point , but it was discontinued some time ago , pre-acquisition ) , but I do n't think it syncs email messages , I know it does n't sync SMS [ messages ] , and what 's worse is that it syncs from the cloud to the PC , not from the device to the PC .
" Normally that 's an advantage because you do n't need any sort of sync cable , but in this case , with the service down and unlikely to come back up , there 's now no way to transfer any of your data , except by saving your contacts and SMS messages to the SIM card ( which has a very limited number of slots available , compared to the device ) , or by manually writing everything you want to preserve down on paper .
" So this is a catastrophic failure of the worst possible kind .
Like I said , I can't think of any innocent explanation for all user data to have been lost permanently , and for the service to still be down . "
T- Mobile irate at Microsoft
Even before the data center failure , T - Mobile and Microsoft were at odds over the future of the Sidekick platform and the Pink Project 's goal to break the exclusive agreement Danger had formed with T - Mobile as a long term partner .
Microsoft was reportedly in secret talks with Verizon to ship two CDMA versions of a " Pink " phone , either under the Windows Phone brand or under the Zune logo , in addition to creating a GSM / UMTS version of both phones for T - Mobile .
Following Microsoft 's Danger data server crisis , things have moved from tense to catastrophic .
T - Mobile owns the Sidekick brand , and the cloud services failure associated with its brand will likely decimate the million active Sidekick subscribers T - Mobile maintains , despite the fact that the mobile operator did nothing wrong .
" T- Mobile has an SLA ( Service Level Agreement ) with Danger / Microsoft , which is a standard legal document for these types of relationships , one that requires Danger / MS to reimburse T - Mobile with defined monetary penalties if the service goes down for longer than x minutes , etc .
I have no clue about the details , but clearly a week - plus outage plus permanent loss of all user data stored in the cloud ( leaving only the user data stored on the devices themselves , which will completely vanish if the device is shut down improperly or crashes ! ) is the worst possible violation of the SLA conceivable , and essentially guarantees a very nasty lawsuit against Microsoft , regardless of whatever forensic and legal investigations they are doing to try to find the culprit , " one of the insiders explained .
" T- Mobile is now getting blamed for something which is n't their fault at all , and a million plus customers are now seriously considering leaving for the iPhone or elsewhere .
I 'm also thinking that a class - action lawsuit on behalf of those users who lost all of their data ( contacts , notes , emails , SMS's , tasks , calendar entries ) is now quite likely , and once again T - Mobile is going to be caught in the crossfire , even though the servers were all run by Danger / Microsoft and not T - Mobile . "
Insiders say T - Mobile is likely to apply its Sidekick trademark to phones from another partner , likely Google 's Android , which shares some commonality with Danger but lacks the same reliance upon a cloud services business model .
Beyond T - Mobile , observers say Microsoft 's problems with Danger are likely to reflect poorly on the company 's own Azure Services cloud computing initiative , as well as its MyPhone cloud service for Windows Mobile phones .
The sidelining of the Pink Project is also a likely setback to Microsoft 's ongoing relationship with Verizon , which has been an early advocate of Microsoft 's other mobile related technologies , including the DRM used in Verizon 's VCast music and media service .
London , England ( CNN ) -- UK
Prime Minister Gordon Brown was under mounting criticism on Tuesday over his perceived casual attitude towards soldiers killed in Afghanistan as support for the mission collapses .
Attacks over equipment shortages for British troops in Afghanistan , his failure to bow at a war memorial , and his misspellings in a condolence letter to a soldier 's grieving mother all led one commentator to ask : " Ca n't Gordon Brown do anything right ? "
The Afghan and military issues dominated the British prime minister 's monthly news conference at 10 Downing Street on Tuesday , taking up 40 of the 50 minutes he spent at the lectern .
Brown stated over and over his sympathy for the families of fallen troops and his determination to see the war effort through .
" Each life lost is an irreplaceable loss from a family , " Brown said .
" It reminds us all of the stark human cost of armed conflict in the service of our society . "
The latest embarrassment for the prime minister emerged Monday , when The Sun newspaper told the story of Jacqui Janes , who received the condolence letter from Brown after her 20 - year - old son was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan .
Janes told the paper she was " so angry " that the hand - written letter was filled with spelling errors -- including her own last name , which Brown spelled " James . "
Brown also crossed out a mistake in spelling the soldier 's name and spelled four other words wrong , the newspaper said .
" The letter was scrawled so quickly I could hardly even read it and some of the words were half - finished .
It 's just disrespectful , " she told The Sun .
" He said , ' I know words can offer little comfort . '
When the words are written in such a hurry the letter is littered with more than 20 mistakes , they offer no comfort . "
Brown called Janes to apologize after the article appeared , according to The Sun .
Janes recorded the conversation and gave it to the paper , which recently announced on its front page that it was dropping support for Brown 's Labour Party in favor of the Conservatives .
The paper printed a transcript and published the audio Tuesday ; in it , Janes tells Brown that the letter was an " insult " to her son and that the spelling mistakes were " disrespectful . "
The prime minister says in the conversation that he had only " good intentions " and sympathy for the mother 's loss .
" The last thing on my mind was to cause any offense to Jacqui Janes , and I think people know me well enough to know that it would never be my intention -- by carelessness or by failure -- to cause any grief to a grieving mother , " Brown said at the news conference Tuesday .
Just two days earlier , some criticized Brown for another military gaffe -- not bowing his head when he laid a wreath at the Cenotaph , the London military monument those who died in the two world wars , on Remembrance Sunday .
It was fodder for talk radio and Twitter , where people debated whether it was intentional .
" It 's disgusting because it is not respectful , " an unnamed former Royal Air Force serviceman told The Daily Telegraph .
Some columnists seemed to forgive the prime minister for not nodding his head .
" He attends Remembrance Day at the Cenotaph looking solemn and dignified , black tie and poppy carefully in place , lays a wreath , steps back in thoughtful silence -- and is abused in the papers next day for failing to bow his head , " wrote John Walsh in The Independent .
" If a politician lays a wreath at the Cenotaph , it 's not an insult ; it 's an expression of respect .
And forgetting to adjust your head a certain way indicates you have personal feelings and are n't just going through the motions . "
The Guardian 's Tom Meltzer suggested that Brown -- who is blind in one eye -- may have been " distracted by the difficulty of walking down the steps backwards " after he laid the wreath and simply forgot .
But simply the fact that Brown was criticized for not bowing his head indicates how widely unpopular he has become , wrote Richard Littlejohn in the Daily Mail .
" These so - called ' gaffes ' can be attributed to Brown 's characteristic clumsiness and social dyslexia , " he wrote .
" But they are magnified by both the unpopularity of the war and the ( prime minister ) himself . "
Brown has already come under repeated criticism for the level of equipment for the 9,000 British troops in Afghanistan , which some have said is too low .
The prime minister has defended equipment levels and said he seeks assurances from military officers in the field that troops have the supplies they need .
Last week , Brown defended equipment levels in a major speech on Afghanistan .
It followed the release days earlier of a military memo , sent in early June , from a British officer that warned a shortage of helicopters was putting British troops at risk because they were forced to travel on the ground , increasing the chances they could be killed by a roadside bomb .
The memo was written by Lt. Col.
Rupert Thorneloe , who died a month later in a roadside bombing .
He remains the highest - ranking British serviceman to die in combat since the 1982 Falklands War .
Janes brought the issue up in her recorded phone conversation with Brown , saying her son bled to death because there was no helicopter to take him for treatment .
She said she had even had to buy military gear for her son to use -- something other military parents have said as well .
" We have tried to provide the best equipment in the world , " Brown said Tuesday .
" We have increased the investment we have made in helicopters and in vehicles and in the equipping of the armed forces in a way that we have never done in our country before . "
Asked about Janes ' accusation that her son died because of a lack of helicopters , Brown said he had asked for a full report on all aspects of the guardsman 's death .
" I am assured that in normal circumstances , there is always helicopter capability , " he said .
Tuesday was also the day that the bodies of six British soldiers killed in Afghanistan returned to Britain , their coffins draped in the Union Flag .
Five of them were killed in a single incident November 3 at a base in the southern province of Helmand , when an Afghan policeman they had been training fired on them .
The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack .
The somber day and the days of criticisms led The Guardian 's Meltzer to write , " Ca n't Gordon Brown do anything right ? "
Roy Greenslade , a media columnist for The Guardian , said no -- not because Brown is doing things wrong , but because the press gives him little slack .
" Brown , it would appear , has no ally in the popular press , " Greenslade wrote .
" He is being hung out to dry and it is painful to watch .
I fear it will get even worse in the coming months . "

The Progressive Movement
The Federal Reserve Act of December 23 , 1913 , was part and parcel of the wave of Progressive legislation on local , state , and federal levels of government that began about 1900 .
Progressivism was a bipartisan movement that , in the course of the first two decades of the 20th century , transformed the American economy and society from one of roughly laissez - faire to one of centralized statism .
Until the 1960s , historians had established the myth that Progressivism was a virtual uprising of workers and farmers who , guided by a new generation of altruistic experts and intellectuals , surmounted fierce big business opposition in order to curb , regulate , and control what had been a system of accelerating monopoly in the late 19th century .
A generation of research and scholarship , however , has now exploded that myth for all parts of the American polity , and it has become all too clear that the truth is the reverse of this well - worn fable .
In contrast , what actually happened was that business became increasingly competitive during the late 19th century , and that various big - business interests , led by the powerful financial house of J. P. Morgan and Company , tried desperately to establish successful cartels on the free market .
The first wave of such cartels was in the first large - scale business — railroads .
In every case , the attempt to increase profits — by cutting sales with a quota system — and thereby to raise prices or rates , collapsed quickly from internal competition within the cartel and from external competition by new competitors eager to undercut the cartel .
During the 1890s , in the new field of large - scale industrial corporations , big - business interests tried to establish high prices and reduced production via mergers , and again , in every case , the merger collapsed from the winds of new competition .
In both sets of cartel attempts , J. P. Morgan and Company had taken the lead , and in both sets of cases , the market , hampered though it was by high protective - tariff walls , managed to nullify these attempts at voluntary cartelization .
It then became clear to these big - business interests that the only way to establish a cartelized economy , an economy that would ensure their continued economic dominance and high profits , would be to use the powers of government to establish and maintain cartels by coercion ; in other words , to transform the economy from roughly laissez - faire to centralized , coordinated statism .
But how could the American people , steeped in a long tradition of fierce opposition to government - imposed monopoly , go along with this program ?
How could the public ’s consent to the New Order be engineered ?
Fortunately for the cartelists , a solution to this vexing problem lay at hand .
Monopoly could be put over in the name of opposition to monopoly !
In that way , using the rhetoric beloved by Americans , the form of the political economy could be maintained , while the content could be totally reversed .

Monopoly had always been defined , in the popular parlance and among economists , as “ grants of exclusive privilege ” by the government .
It was now simply redefined as “ big business ” or business competitive practices , such as price - cutting , so that regulatory commissions , from the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to state insurance commissions , were lobbied for and staffed with big - business men from the regulated industry , all done in the name of curbing “ big- business monopoly ” on the free market .
In that way , the regulatory commissions could subsidize , restrict , and cartelize in the name of “ opposing monopoly , ” as well as promoting the general welfare and national security .
Once again , it was railroad monopoly that paved the way .
For this intellectual shell game , the cartelists needed the support of the nation ’s intellectuals , the class of professional opinion molders in society .
The Morgans needed a smokescreen of ideology , setting forth the rationale and the apologetics for the New Order .
Again , fortunately for them , the intellectuals were ready and eager for the new alliance .
The enormous growth of intellectuals , academics , social scientists , technocrats , engineers , social workers , physicians , and occupational “ guilds ” of all types in the late 19th century led most of these groups to organize for a far greater share of the pie than they could possibly achieve on the free market .
These intellectuals needed the State to license , restrict , and cartelize their occupations , so as to raise the incomes for the fortunate people already in these fields .
In return for their serving as apologists for the new statism , the State was prepared to offer not only cartelized occupations , but also ever - increasing and cushier jobs in the bureaucracy to plan and propagandize for the newly statized society .
And the intellectuals were ready for it , having learned in graduate schools in Germany the glories of statism and organicist socialism , of a harmonious “ middle way ” between dog - eat - dog laissez - faire on the one hand and proletarian Marxism on the other .
Big government , staffed by intellectuals and technocrats , steered by big business , and aided by unions organizing a subservient labor force , would impose a cooperative commonwealth for the alleged benefit of all .

Unhappiness with the National - Banking System
The previous big push for statism in America had occurred during the Civil War , when the virtual one - party Congress after secession of the South emboldened the Republicans to enact their cherished statist program under cover of the war .
The alliance of big business and big government with the Republican party drove through an income tax , heavy excise taxes on such sinful products as tobacco and alcohol , high protective tariffs , and huge land grants and other subsidies to transcontinental railroads .
The overbuilding of railroads led directly to Morgan ’s failed attempts at railroad pools , and finally to the creation , promoted by Morgan and Morgan - controlled railroads , of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887 .
The result of that was the long secular decline of the railroads , beginning before 1900 .
The income tax was annulled by Supreme Court action , but was reinstated during the Progressive period .
The most interventionist of the Civil War actions was in the vital field of money and banking .
The approach toward hard money and free banking that had been achieved during the 1840s and 1850s was swept away by two pernicious inflationist measures of the wartime Republican administration .
One was fiat money greenbacks , which depreciated by half by the middle of the Civil War .
These were finally replaced by the gold standard after urgent pressure by hard - money Democrats , but not until 1879 , 14 full years after the end of the war .
A second , and more lasting , intervention was the National Banking Acts of 1863 , 1864 , and 1865 , which destroyed the issue of bank notes by state - chartered ( or “ state ” ) banks by a prohibitory tax , and then monopolized the issue of bank notes in the hands of a few large , federally chartered “ national banks , ” mainly centered on Wall Street .
In a typical cartelization , national banks were compelled by law to accept each other ’s notes and demand deposits at par , negating the process by which the free market had previously been discounting the notes and deposits of shaky and inflationary banks .
In this way , the Wall Street–federal government establishment was able to control the banking system , and inflate the supply of notes and deposits in a coordinated manner .
But there were still problems .
The national - banking system provided only a halfway house between free banking and government central banking , and by the end of the 19th century , the Wall Street banks were becoming increasingly unhappy with the status quo .
The centralization was only limited , and , above all , there was no governmental central bank to coordinate inflation , and to act as a lender of last resort , bailing out banks in trouble .
As soon as bank credit generated booms , then they got into trouble ; bank - created booms turned into recessions , with banks forced to contract their loans and assets and to deflate in order to save themselves .
Not only that , but after the initial shock of the National Banking Acts , state banks had grown rapidly by pyramiding their loans and demand deposits on top of national - bank notes .
These state banks , free of the high legal - capital requirements that kept entry restricted in national banking , flourished during the 1880s and 1890s and provided stiff competition for the national banks themselves .
Furthermore , St. Louis and Chicago , after the 1880s , provided increasingly severe competition to Wall Street .
Thus , St. Louis and Chicago bank deposits , which had been only 16 percent of the St. Louis , Chicago , and New York City total in 1880 , rose to 33 percent of that total by 1912 .
All in all , bank clearings outside of New York City , which were 24 percent of the national total in 1882 , had risen to 43 percent by 1913 .
The complaints of the big banks were summed up in one word : “ inelasticity . ”
The national - banking system , they charged , did not provide for the proper “ elasticity ” of the money supply ; that is , the banks were not able to expand money and credit as much as they wished , particularly in times of recession .
In short , the national - banking system did not provide sufficient room for inflationary expansions of credit by the nation ’s banks . [ 1 ]
By the turn of the century , the political economy of the United States was dominated by two generally clashing financial aggregations : the previously dominant Morgan group , which began in investment banking and then expanded into commercial banking , railroads , and mergers of manufacturing firms ; and the Rockefeller forces , which began in oil refining and then moved into commercial banking , finally forming an alliance with the Kuhn , Loeb Company in investment banking and the Harriman interests in railroads . [ 2 ]
Although these two financial blocs usually clashed with each other , they were as one on the need for a central bank .
Even though the eventual major role in forming and dominating the Federal Reserve System was taken by the Morgans , the Rockefeller and Kuhn , Loeb forces were equally enthusiastic in pushing , and collaborating on , what they all considered to be an essential monetary reform .
The Beginnings of the “ Reform ” Movement : The Indianapolis Monetary Convention
The presidential election of 1896 was a great national referendum on the gold standard .
The Democratic party had been captured , at its 1896 convention , by the populist , ultrainflationist antigold forces , headed by William Jennings Bryan .
The older Democrats , who had been fiercely devoted to hard money and the gold standard , either stayed home on election day or voted , for the first time in their lives , for the hated Republicans .
The Republicans had long been the party of prohibition and of greenback inflation and opposition to gold .
But since the early 1890s , the Rockefeller forces , dominant in their home state of Ohio and nationally in the Republican party , had decided to quietly ditch prohibition as a political embarrassment and as a grave deterrent to obtaining votes from the increasingly powerful bloc of German - American voters .
In the summer of 1896 , anticipating the defeat of the gold forces at the Democratic convention , the Morgans , previously dominant in the Democratic party , approached the McKinley – Mark Hanna–Rockefeller forces through their rising young satrap , Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts .
Lodge offered the Rockefeller forces a deal : the Morgans would support McKinley for president , and neither sit home nor back a third , Gold Democrat party , provided that McKinley pledged himself to a gold standard .
The deal was struck , and many previously hard - money Democrats shifted to the Republicans .
The nature of the American political - party system was now drastically changed : what was previously a tightly fought struggle between hard - money , free - trade , laissez - faire Democrats on the one hand , and inflationist , protectionist , statist Republicans on the other , with the Democrats slowly but surely gaining ascendancy by the early 1890s , was now a party system dominated by the Republicans until the depression election of 1932 .
The Morgans were strongly opposed to Bryanism , which was not only populist and inflationist , but also anti–Wall Street bank ; the Bryanites , much like populists of the present day , preferred Congressional , greenback inflationism to the more subtle , and more privileged , big bank –controlled variety .
The Morgans , in contrast , favored a gold standard .
But , once gold was secured by the McKinley victory of 1896 , they wanted to press on to use the gold standard as a hard - money camouflage behind which they could change the system into one less nakedly inflationist than populism but far more effectively controlled by the big - banker elites .
In the long run , a controlled Morgan - Rockefeller gold standard was far more pernicious to the cause of genuine hard - money than a candid free - silver or greenback Bryanism .
As soon as McKinley was safely elected , the Morgan - Rockefeller forces began to organize a “ reform ” movement to cure the “ inelasticity ” of money in the existing gold standard and to move slowly toward the establishment of a central bank .
To do so , they decided to use the techniques they had successfully employed in establishing a pro–gold standard movement during 1895 and 1896 .
The crucial point was to avoid the public suspicion of Wall Street and banker control by acquiring the patina of a broad - based grassroots movement .
The movement , therefore , was deliberately focused in the Middle West , the heartland of America , and organizations developed that included not only bankers , but also businessmen , economists , and other academics , who supplied respectability , persuasiveness , and technical expertise to the reform cause .
Accordingly , the reform drive began just after the 1896 elections in authentic Midwest country .
Hugh Henry Hanna , president of the Atlas Engine Works of Indianapolis , who had learned organizing tactics during the year with the pro–gold standard Union for Sound Money , sent a memorandum , in November , to the Indianapolis Board of Trade , urging a grassroots , Midwestern state like Indiana to take the lead in currency reform . [ 3 ]
In response , the reformers moved fast .
Answering the call of the Indianapolis Board of Trade , delegates from boards of trade from 12 Midwestern cities met in Indianapolis on December 1 , 1896 .
The conference called for a large monetary convention of businessmen , which accordingly met in Indianapolis on January 12 , 1897 .
Representatives from 26 states and the District of Columbia were present .
The monetary reform movement was now officially underway .
The influential Yale Review commended the convention for averting the danger of arousing popular hostility to bankers .
It reported that “ the conference was a gathering of businessmen in general rather than bankers in particular ” ( quoted in Livingston 1986 , p. 105 ) .
The conventioneers may have been businessmen , but they were certainly not very grassrootsy .
Presiding at the Indianapolis Monetary Convention of 1897 was C. Stuart Patterson , dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School and a member of the finance committee of the powerful , Morgan - oriented Pennsylvania Railroad .
The day after the convention opened , Hugh Hanna was named chairman of an executive committee , which he would appoint .
The committee was empowered to act for the convention after it adjourned .
Historical Setting of ... Ludwig von Mises Best Price : $ 8.00 ( as of 01:45 EST - Details )
The executive committee consisted of the following influential corporate and financial leaders :
John J. Mitchell of Chicago , president of the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank , and a director of the Chicago and Alton Railroad ; the Pittsburgh , Fort Wayne , and Chicago Railroad ; and the Pullman Company , was named treasurer of the executive committee .
H. H. Kohlsaat , editor and publisher of the Chicago Times Herald and the Chicago Ocean Herald , trustee of the Chicago Art Institute , and a friend and advisor of Rockefeller ’s main man in politics , President William McKinley .
Charles Custis Harrison , provost of the University of Pennsylvania , who had made a fortune as a sugar refiner in partnership with the powerful Havemeyer ( “ Sugar Trust ” ) interests .
Alexander E. Orr , a New York City banker in the Morgan ambit , who was a director of the Morgan - run Erie and Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific railroads , the National Bank of Commerce , and the influential publishing house of Harper Brothers .
Orr was also a partner in the country ’s largest grain - merchandising firm and a director of several life - insurance companies .
Edwin O. Stanard , St. Louis grain merchant , former governor of Missouri , and former vice president of the National Board of Trade and Transportation .
E. B. Stahlman , owner of the Nashville Banner , commissioner of the cartelist Southern Railway and Steamship Association , and former vice president of the Louisville , New Albany , and Chicago Railroad .
A. E. Willson , influential attorney from Louisville and future governor of Kentucky .
But the two most interesting and powerful executive committee members of the Monetary Convention were Henry C. Payne and George Foster Peabody .
Henry Payne was a Republican party leader from Milwaukee , and president of the Morgan - dominated Wisconsin Telephone Company , long associated with the railroad - oriented Spooner - Sawyer Republican machine in Wisconsin politics .
Payne was also heavily involved in Milwaukee utility and banking interests , in particular as a long - time director of the North American Company , a large public utility –holding company headed by New York City financier Charles W. Wetmore .
So close was North American Company to the Morgan interests that its board included two top Morgan financiers .
One was Edmund C. Converse , president of Morgan - run Liberty National Bank of New York City , and soon to be founding president of Morgan ’s Bankers ’ Trust Company .
The other was Robert Bacon , a partner in J. P. Morgan and Company , and one of Theodore Roosevelt ’s closest friends , whom Roosevelt would later make assistant secretary of state .
Furthermore , when Theodore Roosevelt became president as the result of the assassination of William McKinley , he replaced Rockefeller ’s top political operative , Mark Hanna of Ohio , with Henry C. Payne as Postmaster General of the United States .
Payne , a leading Morgan lieutenant , was reportedly appointed to what was then the major political post in the Cabinet specifically to break Hanna ’s hold over the national Republican party .
It seems clear that replacing Hanna with Payne was part of the savage assault that Theodore Roosevelt would soon launch against Standard Oil as part of the open warfare about to break out between the Rockefeller –Harriman–Kuhn , Loeb , and the Morgan camps ( Burch 1981 , p. 189 , n. 55 ) .
Even more powerful in the Morgan ambit was the secretary of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention ’s executive committee , George Foster Peabody .
The entire Peabody family of Boston Brahmins had long been personally and financially closely associated with the Morgans .
A member of the Peabody clan had even served as best man at J. P. Morgan ’s wedding in 1865 .
George Peabody had long ago established an international banking firm of which J. P. Morgan ’s father , Junius , had been one of the senior partners .
George Foster Peabody was an eminent New York investment banker with extensive holdings in Mexico .
He helped reorganize General Electric for the Morgans , and was later offered the job of secretary of the treasury during the Wilson administration .
He would function throughout that administration as a “ statesman without portfolio ” ( ibid. , pp. 231 , 233 ; Ware 1951 , pp. 161–67 ) .
Let the masses be hoodwinked into regarding the Indianapolis Monetary Convention as a spontaneous , grassroots outpouring of small Midwestern businessmen .
To the cognoscenti , any organization featuring Henry Payne , Alexander Orr , and especially George Foster Peabody meant but one thing : J. P. Morgan .
The Indianapolis Monetary Convention quickly resolved to urge President McKinley to ( 1 ) continue the gold standard and ( 2 ) create a new system of “ elastic ” bank credit .
To that end , the convention urged the president to appoint a new Monetary Commission to prepare legislation for a new , revised monetary system .
McKinley was very much in favor of the proposal , signaling Rockefeller agreement , and on July 24 he sent a message to Congress urging the creation of a special monetary commission .
The bill for a national monetary commission passed the House of Representatives but died in the Senate ( Kolko 1983 , pp. 147–48 ) .
Disappointed but intrepid , the executive committee , failing a presidentially appointed commission , decided in August 1897 to go ahead and select its own .
The leading role in appointing this commission was played by George Foster Peabody , who served as liaison between the Indianapolis members and the New York financial community .
To select the commission members , Peabody arranged for the executive committee to meet in the Saratoga Springs summer home of his investment - banking partner , Spencer Trask .
By September , the executive committee had selected the members of the Indianapolis Monetary Commission .
The members of the new Indianapolis Monetary Commission were as follows ( Livingston 1986 , pp. 106–07 ) :
The chairman was former senator George F. Edmunds , Republican of Vermont , attorney , and former director of several railroads .
C. Stuart Patterson was dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School , and a top official of the Morgan - controlled Pennsylvania Railroad .
Charles S. Fairchild , a leading New York banker , president of the New York Security and Trust Company , was a former partner in the Boston Brahmin investment banking firm of Lee , Higginson , and Company , and executive and director of two major railroads .
Fairchild , a leader in New York state politics , had been secretary of the treasury in the first Cleveland Administration .
In addition , Fairchild ’s father , Sidney T. Fairchild , had been a leading attorney for the Morgan - controlled New York Central Railroad .
Stuyvesant Fish , scion of two long - time aristocratic New York families , was a partner of the Morgan - dominated New York investment bank of Morton , Bliss , and Company , and then president of Illinois Central Railroad and a trustee of Mutual Life .
Fish ’s father had been a senator , governor , and secretary of state .
Louis A. Garnett was a leading San Francisco businessman .
Thomas G. Bush of Alabama was a director of the Mobile and Birmingham Railroad .
J. W. Fries was a leading cotton manufacturer of North Carolina .
William B. Dean , merchant from St. Paul , Minnesota , and a director of the St. Paul–based , transcontinental Great Northern Railroad , owned by James J. Hill , ally with Morgan in the titanic struggle over the Northern Pacific Railroad with Harriman , Rockefeller , and Kuhn , Loeb .
George Leighton of St. Louis was an attorney for the Missouri Pacific Railroad .
Robert S. Taylor was an Indiana patent attorney for the Morgan - controlled General Electric Company .
The single most important working member of the commission was James Laurence Laughlin , head professor of political economy at the new Rockefeller - founded University of Chicago , and editor of its prestigious Journal of Political Economy .
It was Laughlin who supervised the operations of the Commission ’s staff and the writing of the reports .
Indeed , the two staff assistants to the Commission who wrote reports were both students of Laughlin at Chicago : former student L. Carroll Root , and his then - current graduate student Henry Parker Willis .
The impressive sum of $ 50,000 was raised throughout the nation ’s banking and corporate community to finance the work of the Indianapolis Monetary Commission .
New York City ’s large quota was raised by Morgan bankers Peabody and Orr , and heavy contributions to fill the quota came promptly from mining magnate William E. Dodge , cotton and coffee trader Henry Hentz , a director of the Mechanics National Bank , and J. P. Morgan himself .
With the money in hand , the executive committee rented office space in Washington , DC in mid-September and set the staff to sending out and collating the replies to a detailed monetary questionnaire , sent to several hundred selected experts .
The Monetary Commission sat from late September into December 1897 , sifting through the replies to the questionnaire collated by Root and Willis .
The purpose of the questionnaire was to mobilize a broad base of support for the Commission ’s recommendations , which they could claim represented hundreds of expert views .
Second , the questionnaire served as an important public - relations device , making the Commission and its work highly visible to the public , to the business community throughout the country , and to members of Congress .
Furthermore , through this device , the Commission could be seen as speaking for the business community throughout the country .
To this end , the original idea was to publish the Monetary Commission ’s preliminary report , adopted in mid-December , as well as the questionnaire replies in a companion volume .
Plans for the questionnaire volume fell through , although it was later published as part of a series of publications on political economy and public law by the University of Pennsylvania ( Livingston 1986 , pp. 107–08 ) .
Undaunted by the slight setback , the executive committee developed new methods of molding public opinion using the questionnaire replies as an organizing tool .
In November , Hugh Hanna hired as his Washington assistant financial journalist Charles A. Conant , whose task was to propagandize and organize public opinion for the recommendations of the Commission .
The campaign to beat the drums for the forthcoming Commission report was launched when Conant published an article in the December 1 issue of Sound Currency magazine , taking an advanced line on the Commission report , and bolstering the conclusions not only with his own knowledge of monetary and banking history , but also with frequent statements from the as - yet - unpublished replies to the staff questionnaire .
Over the next several months , Conant worked closely with Jules Guthridge , the general secretary of the Commission ; they first induced newspapers throughout the country to print abstracts of the questionnaire replies .
As Guthridge wrote some Commission members , he thereby stimulated “ public curiosity ” about the forthcoming report , and he boasted that by “ careful manipulation ” he was able to get the preliminary report “ printed in whole or in part — principally in part — in nearly 7,500 newspapers , large and small . ”
In the meantime , Guthridge and Conant orchestrated letters of support from prominent men across the country .
When the preliminary report was published on January 3 , 1898 , Guthridge and Conant made these letters available to the daily newspapers .
Quickly , the two built up a distribution system to spread the gospel of the report , organizing nearly 100,000 correspondents “ dedicated to the enactment of the commission ’s plan for banking and currency reform ” ( Livingston 1986 , pp. 109–10 ) .
The prime and immediate emphasis of the preliminary report of the Monetary Commission was to complete the promise of the McKinley victory by codifying and enacting what was already in place de facto : a single gold standard , with silver reduced to the status of subsidiary token currency .
Completing the victory over Bryanism and free silver , however , was just a mopping - up operation ; more important in the long run was the call raised by the report for banking reform to allow greater elasticity .
Bank credit could then be increased in recessions and whenever seasonal pressure for redemption by agricultural country banks forced the large central reserve banks to contract their loans .
The actual measures called for by the Commission were of marginal importance .
More important was that the question of banking reform had been raised at all .
Since the public had been aroused by the preliminary report , the executive committee decided to organize the second and final meeting of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention , which duly met at Indianapolis on January 25 , 1898 .
The second convention was a far grander affair than the first , bringing together 496 delegates from 31 states .
Furthermore , the gathering was a cross-section of America ’s top corporate leaders .
While the state of Indiana naturally had the largest delegation , of 85 representatives of boards of trade and chambers of commerce , New York sent 74 , including many from the city ’s Board of Trade and Transportation , Merchant ’s Association , and Chamber of Commerce .
Such corporate leaders as Cleveland iron manufacturer Alfred A. Pope , president of the National Malleable Castings Company , attended ; as did Virgil P. Cline , legal counsel to Rockefeller ’s Standard Oil Company of Ohio ; and C.A. Pillsbury , of Minneapolis–St.
Paul , organizer of the world ’s largest flour mills .
From Chicago came such business notables as Marshall Field and Albert A. Sprague , a director of the Chicago Telephone Company , subsidiary of the Morgan - controlled telephone monopoly , American Telephone and Telegraph Company .
Not to be overlooked is delegate Franklin MacVeagh , a wholesale grocer from Chicago , an uncle of a senior partner in the Wall Street law firm of Bangs , Stetson , Tracy , and MacVeagh , counsel to J. P. Morgan and Company .
MacVeagh , who was later to become secretary of the treasury in the Taft administration , was wholly in the Morgan ambit .
His father - in - law , Henry F. Eames , was the founder of the Commercial National Bank of Chicago , and his brother Wayne was soon to become a trustee of the Morgan - dominated Mutual Life Insurance Company .
The purpose of the second convention , as former Secretary of the Treasury Charles S. Fairchild candidly explained in his address to the gathering , was to mobilize the nation ’s leading businessmen into a mighty and influential reform movement .
As he put it , “ if men of business give serious attention and study to these subjects , they will substantially agree upon legislation , and thus agreeing , their influence will be prevailing . ”
He concluded that “ My word to you is , pull all together . ”
Presiding officer of the convention , Iowa ’s Governor Leslie M. Shaw , was however , a bit disingenuous when he told the gathering , “ You represent today not the banks , for there are few bankers on this floor .
You represent the business industries and the financial interests of the country . ”
There were plenty of bankers there , too ( Livingston 1986 , pp. 113–15 ) .
Shaw himself , later to be secretary of the treasury under Theodore Roosevelt , was a small - town banker in Iowa , and president of the Bank of Denison throughout his term as governor .
More important in Shaw ’s outlook and career was the fact that he was a long - time close friend and loyal supporter of the Des Moines Regency , the Iowa Republican machine headed by the powerful Senator William Boyd Allison .
Allison , who was to obtain the Treasury post for his friend , was in turn tied closely to Charles E. Perkins , a close Morgan ally , president of the Chicago , Burlington , and Quincy Railroad , and kinsman of the powerful Forbes financial group of Boston , long tied in with the Morgan interests ( Rothbard 1984 , pp. 95–96 ) .
Also serving as delegates to the second convention were several eminent economists , each of whom , however , came not as academic observers but as representatives of elements of the business community .
Professor Jeremiah W. Jenks of Cornell , a proponent of trust cartelization by government and soon to become a friend and advisor of Theodore Roosevelt as governor , came as delegate from the Ithaca Business Men ’s Association .
Frank W. Taussig of Harvard University represented the Cambridge Merchants ’ Association .
Yale ’s Arthur Twining Hadley , soon to be the president of Yale , represented the New Haven Chamber of Commerce , and Frank M. Taylor of the University of Michigan came as representative of the Ann Arbor Business Men ’s Association .
Each of these men held powerful posts in the organized economics profession , Jenks , Taussig , and Taylor serving on the currency committee of the American Economic Association .
Hadley , a leading railroad economist , also served on the board of directors of Morgan ’s New York , New Haven , and Hartford ; and Atchison , Topeka , and Santa Fe Railroads . [ 4 ]
Both Taussig and Taylor were monetary theorists who , while committed to a gold standard , urged reform that would make the money supply more elastic .
Taussig called for an expansion of national bank notes , which would inflate in response to the “ needs of business . ”
As Taussig ( quoted in Dorfman 1949 , p. xxxvii ; Parrini and Sklar 1983 , p. 269 ) put it , the currency would then “ grow without trammels as the needs of the community spontaneously call for increase . ”
Taylor , too , as one historian puts it , wanted the gold standard to be modified by “ a conscious control of the movement of money ” by government “ in order to maintain the stability of the credit system . ”
Taylor justified governmental suspensions of specie payment to “ protect the gold reserve ” ( Dorfman 1949 , pp. 392–93 ) .
On January 26 , the convention delegates duly endorsed the preliminary report with virtual unanimity , after which Professor J. Laurence Laughlin was assigned the task of drawing up a more elaborate final report , which was published and distributed a few months later .
Laughlin’s — and the convention ’s — final report not only came out in favor of a broadened asset base for a greatly increased amount of national - bank notes , but also called explicitly for a central bank that would enjoy a monopoly of the issue of bank notes . [ 5 ]
Meanwhile , the convention delegates took the gospel of banking reform to the length and breadth of the corporate and financial communities .
In April 1898 , for example , A. Barton Hepburn , president of the Chase National Bank of New York ( at that time a flagship commercial bank for the Morgan interests ) , and a man who would play a large role in the drive to establish a central bank , invited Monetary Commissioner Robert S. Taylor to address the New York State Bankers ’
Association on the currency question , since “ bankers , like other people , need instruction upon this subject . ”
All the monetary commissioners , especially Taylor , were active during the first half of 1898 in exhorting groups of businessmen throughout the nation for monetary reform .
Meanwhile , in Washington , the lobbying team of Hanna and Conant were extremely active .
A bill embodying the suggestions of the Monetary Commission was introduced by Indiana Congressman Jesse Overstreet in January , and was reported out by the House Banking and Currency Committee in May .
In the meantime , Conant met almost continuously with the banking committee members .
At each stage of the legislative process , Hanna sent circular letters to the convention delegates and to the public , urging a letter - writing campaign in support of the bill .
In this agitation , McKinley ’s Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage worked closely with Hanna and his staff .
Gage sponsored similar bills , and several bills along the same lines were introduced in the House in 1898 and 1899 .
Gage , a friend of several of the monetary commissioners , was one of the top leaders of the Rockefeller interests in the banking field .
His appointment as secretary of the treasury had been gained for him by Ohio ’s Mark Hanna , political mastermind and financial backer of President McKinley , and old friend , high - school classmate , and business associate of John D. Rockefeller , Sr .
Before his appointment to the Cabinet , Gage was president of the powerful First National Bank of Chicago , one of the major commercial banks in the Rockefeller ambit .
During his term in office , Gage tried to operate the Treasury as a central bank , pumping in money during recessions by purchasing government bonds on the open market , and depositing large funds with pet commercial banks .
In 1900 , Gage called vainly for the establishment of regional central banks .
Finally , in his last annual report as secretary of the treasury in 1901 , Lyman Gage let the cat completely out of the bag , calling outright for a government central bank .
Without such a central bank , he declared in alarm , “ individual banks stand isolated and apart , separated units , with no tie of mutuality between them . ”
Unless a central bank establishes such ties , Gage warned , the Panic of 1893 would be repeated ( Livingston 1986 , p. 153 ) .
When he left office early the next year , Lyman Gage took up his post as president of the Rockefeller - controlled US Trust Company in New York City ( Rothbard 1984 , pp. 94–95 ) .
The Gold Standard Act of 1900 and After
Any reform legislation had to wait until after the elections of 1898 , for the gold forces were not yet in control of Congress .
In the autumn , the executive committee of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention mobilized its forces , calling on no less than 97,000 correspondents throughout the country , through whom it had distributed the preliminary report .
The executive committee urged its constituency to elect a gold - standard Congress ; when the gold forces routed the silverites in November , the results of the election were hailed by Hanna as eminently satisfactory .
The decks were now cleared for the McKinley administration to submit its bill , and the Congress that met in December 1899 quickly passed the measure ; Congress then passed the conference report of the Gold Standard Act in March 1900 .
The currency reformers had gotten their way .
It is well known that the Gold Standard Act provided for a single gold standard , with no retention of silver money except as tokens .
Less well known are the clauses that began the march toward a more “ elastic ” currency .
As Lyman Gage had suggested in 1897 , national banks , previously confined to large cities , were now made possible with a small amount of capital in small towns and rural areas .
And it was made far easier for national banks to issue notes .
The object of these clauses , as one historian put it , was to satisfy an “ increased demand for money at crop-moving time , and to meet popular cries for ‘ more money ’ by encouraging the organization of national banks in comparatively undeveloped regions ” ( Livingston 1986 , p. 123 ) .
The reformers exulted over the passage of the Gold Standard Act , but took the line that this was only the first step on the much - needed path to fundamental banking reform .
Thus , Professor Frank W. Taussig of Harvard praised the act , and greeted the emergence of a new social and ideological alignment , caused by “ strong pressure from the business community ” through the Indianapolis Monetary Convention .
He particularly welcomed the fact that the Gold Standard Act “ treats the national banks not as grasping and dangerous corporations but as useful institutions deserving the fostering care of the legislature . ”
But such tender legislative care was not enough ; fundamental banking reform was needed .
For , Taussig declared , “ the changes in banking legislation are not such as to make possible any considerable expansion of the national system or to enable it to render the community the full service of which it is capable . ”
In short , the changes allowed for more and greater expansion of bank credit and the supply of money .
Therefore , Taussig ( 1990 , p. 415 ) concluded , “ It is well - nigh certain that eventually Congress will have to consider once more the further remodeling of the national bank system . ”
In fact , the Gold Standard Act of 1900 was only the opening gun of the banking reform movement .
Three friends and financial journalists , two from Chicago , were to play a large role in the development of that movement .
Massachusetts - born Charles A. Conant ( 1861 –1915 ) , a leading historian of banking , wrote his A History of Modern Banks of Issue in 1896 , while still a Washington correspondent for the New York Journal of Commerce and an editor of Bankers Magazine .
After his stint of public relations work and lobbying for the Indianapolis Convention , Conant moved to New York in 1902 to become treasurer of the Morgan - oriented Morton Trust Company .
The two Chicagoans , both friends of Lyman Gage , were , along with Gage , in the Rockefeller ambit : Frank A. Vanderlip was picked by Gage as his assistant secretary of the treasury , and when Gage left office , Vanderlip came to New York as a top executive at the flagship commercial bank of the Rockefeller interests , the National City Bank of New York .
Meanwhile , Vanderlip ’s close friend and former mentor at the Chicago Tribune , Joseph French Johnson , had also moved east to become professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania .
But no sooner had the Gold Standard Act been passed when Joseph Johnson sounded the trumpet by calling for more - fundamental reform .
Professor Johnson stated flatly that the existing bank note system was weak in not “ responding to the needs of the money market , ” i.e. , not supplying a sufficient amount of money .
Since the national banking system was incapable of supplying those needs , Johnson opined , there was no reason to continue it .
Johnson deplored the US banking system as the worst in the world , and pointed to the glorious central banking system as existed in Britain and France . [ 6 ]
But no such centralized banking system yet existed in the United States : “ In the United States , however , there is no single business institution , and no group of large institutions , in which self - interest , responsibility , and power naturally unite and conspire for the protection of the monetary system against twists and strains . ”
In short , there was far too much freedom and decentralization in the system .
In consequence , our massive deposit credit system “ trembles whenever the foundations are disturbed , ” i.e. , whenever the chickens of inflationary credit expansion came home to roost in demands for cash or gold .
The result of the inelasticity of money , and of the impossibility of interbank cooperation , Johnson opined , was that we were in danger of losing gold abroad just at the time when gold was needed to sustain confidence in the nation ’s banking system ( Johnson 1900 , pp. 497f ) .
After 1900 , the banking community was split on the question of reform , the small and rural bankers preferring the status quo .
But the large bankers were headed by A. Barton Hepburn of Morgan ’s Chase National Bank , who drew up a bill as head of a commission of the American Bankers Association , and presented it in late 1901 to Representative Charles N. Fowler of New Jersey , chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee , who had introduced one of the bills that had led to the Gold Standard Act .
The Hepburn proposal was reported out of committee in April 1902 as the Fowler Bill ( Kolko 1983 , pp. 149–50 ) .
The Fowler Bill contained three basic clauses .
The first allowed the further expansion of national bank notes based on broader assets than government bonds .
The second , a favorite of the big banks , was to allow national banks to establish branches at home and abroad , a step illegal under the existing system due to fierce opposition by the small country bankers .
While branch banking is consonant with a free market and provides a sound and efficient system for calling on other banks for redemption , the big banks had little interest in branch banking unless accompanied by centralization of the banking system .
Third , the Fowler Bill proposed to create a three - member board of control within the Treasury Department to supervise the creation of the new bank notes and to establish clearinghouse associations under its aegis .
This provision was designed to be the first step toward the establishment of a full - fledged central bank ( Livingston 1986 , pp. 150–54 ) .
Although they could not control the American Bankers Association , the multitude of country bankers , up in arms against the proposed competition of big banks in the form of branch banking , put fierce pressure upon Congress and managed to kill the Fowler Bill in the House during 1902 , despite the agitation of the executive committee and staff of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention .
With the defeat of the Fowler Bill , the big bankers decided to settle for more modest goals for the time being .
Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island , perennial Republican leader of the US Senate and Rockefeller ’s man in Congress , [ 7 ] submitted the Aldrich Bill the following year , allowing the large national banks in New York to issue “ emergency currency ” based on municipal and railroad bonds .
But even this bill was defeated .
Meeting setbacks in Congress , the big bankers decided to regroup and turn temporarily to the executive branch .
Foreshadowing a later , more elaborate collaboration , two powerful representatives each from the Morgan and Rockefeller banking interests met with Comptroller of the Currency William B. Ridgely in January 1903 , to try to persuade him , by administrative fiat , to restrict the volume of loans made by the country banks in the New York money market .
The two Morgan men at the meeting were J. P. Morgan himself and George F. Baker , Morgan ’s closest friend and associate in the banking business .
[ 8 ]
The two Rockefeller men were Frank Vanderlip and James Stillman , long - time chairman of the board of the National City Bank . [ 9 ]
The close Rockefeller - Stillman alliance was cemented by the marriage of the two daughters of Stillman to the two sons of William Rockefeller , brother of John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , and long - time board member of the National City Bank ( Burch 1981 , pp. 134–35 ) .
The meeting with the comptroller did not bear fruit , but the lead instead was taken by the secretary of the treasury himself , Leslie Shaw , formerly presiding officer at the second Indianapolis Monetary Convention , whom President Roosevelt appointed to replace Lyman Gage .
The unexpected and sudden shift from McKinley to Roosevelt in the presidency meant more than just a turnover of personnel ; it meant a fundamental shift from a Rockefeller - dominated to a Morgan - dominated administration .
The shift from Gage to Shaw was one of the many Rockefeller - to - Morgan displacements .
On monetary and banking matters , however , the Rockefeller and Morgan camps were as one .
Secretary Shaw attempted to continue and expand Gage ’s experiments in trying to make the Treasury function like a central bank , particularly in making open - market purchases in recessions , and in using Treasury deposits to bolster the banks and expand the money supply .
Shaw violated the statutory institution of the independent Treasury , which had tried to confine government revenues and expenditures to its own coffers .
Instead , he expanded the practice of depositing Treasury funds in favored , big national banks .
Indeed , even banking reformers denounced the deposit of Treasury funds to pet banks as artificially lowering interest rates and leading to artificial expansion of credit .
Furthermore , any government deficit would obviously throw a system dependent on a flow of new government revenues into chaos .
All in all , the reformers agreed increasingly with the verdict of economist Alexander Purves , that “ the uncertainty as to the Secretary ’s power to control the banks by arbitrary decisions and orders , and the fact that at some future time the country may be unfortunate in its chief Treasury official [ has ] … led many to doubt the wisdom ” of using the Treasury as a form of central bank ( Livingston 1986 , 156 ; Burch 1981 , pp. 161–62 ) .
In his last annual report of 1906 , Secretary Shaw urged that he be given total power to regulate all the nation ’s banks .
But the game was up , and by then it was clear to the reformers that Shaw ’s as well as Gage ’s proto–central bank manipulations had failed .
It was time to undertake a struggle for a fundamental legislative overhaul of the American banking system , to bring it under central - banking control . [ 10 ]
Charles A. Conant : Surplus Capital and Economic Imperialism
The years shortly before and after 1900 proved to be the beginnings of the drive toward the establishment of a Federal Reserve System .
It was also the origin of the gold - exchange standard , the fateful system imposed upon the world by the British in the 1920s and by the United States after World War II at Bretton Woods .
Even more than the case of a gold standard with a central bank , the gold - exchange standard establishes a system , in the name of gold , which in reality manages to install coordinated , international , inflationary , paper money .
The idea was to replace a genuine gold standard , in which each country ( or , domestically , each bank ) maintains its reserves in gold , by a pseudo–gold standard in which the central bank of the client country maintains its reserves in some key or base currency , say pounds , or dollars .
Thus , during the 1920s , most countries maintained their reserves in pounds , and only Britain purported to redeem pounds in gold .
This meant that these other countries were really on a pound rather than a gold standard , although they were able , at least temporarily , to acquire the prestige of gold .
It also meant that when Britain inflated pounds , there was no danger of losing gold to these other countries , who , quite the contrary , happily inflated their own currencies on top of their expanding balances in pounds sterling .
Thus , there was generated an unstable , inflationary system — all in the name of gold — in which client states pyramided their own inflation on top of Great Britain’s .
The system was eventually bound to collapse , as did the gold - exchange standard in the Great Depression , and Bretton Woods by the late 1960s .
In addition , the close ties based on pounds and then dollars meant that the key or base country was able to exert a form of economic imperialism , joined by their common paper and pseudogold inflation , upon the client states using the key money .
By the late 1890s , groups of theoreticians in the United States were working on what would later be called the “ Leninist ” theory of capitalist imperialism .
The theory was originated , not by Lenin but by advocates of imperialism , centering around such Morgan - oriented friends and brain - trusters of Theodore Roosevelt as Henry Adams , Brooks Adams , Admiral Alfred T. Mahan , and Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge .
The idea was that capitalism in the developed countries was “ overproducing , ” not simply in the sense that more purchasing power was needed in recessions , but more deeply in that the rate of profit was therefore inevitably falling .
The ever - lower rate of profit from the “ surplus capital ” was in danger of crippling capitalism , except that salvation loomed in the form of foreign markets and especially foreign investments .
New and expanded foreign markets would increase profits , at least temporarily , while investments in undeveloped countries would be bound to bring a high rate of profit .
Hence , to save advanced capitalism , it was necessary for Western governments to engage in outright imperialist or neoimperialist ventures , which would force other countries to open their markets for American products and would force open investment opportunities abroad .
Given this doctrine — based on the fallacious Ricardian view that the rate of profit is determined by the stock of capital investment , instead of by the time preferences of everyone in society — there was little for Lenin to change except to give an implicit moral condemnation instead of approval and to emphasize the necessarily temporary nature of the respite imperialism could furnish for capitalists . [ 11 ]
Charles Conant set forth the theory of surplus capital in his A History of Modern Banks of Issue ( 1896 ) and developed it in subsequent essays .
The existence of fixed capital and modern technology , Conant claimed , invalidated Say ’s Law and the concept of equilibrium , and led to chronic “ oversavings , ” which he defined as savings in excess of profitable investment outlets , in the developed Western capitalist world .
Business cycles , claimed Conant , were inherent in the unregulated activity of modern industrial capitalism .
Hence the importance of government - encouraged monopolies and cartels to stabilize markets and the business cycle , and in particular the necessity of economic imperialism to force open profitable outlets abroad for American and other Western surplus capital .
The United States ’ bold venture into an imperialist war against Spain in 1898 galvanized the energies of Conant and other theoreticians of imperialism .
Conant responded with his call for imperialism in “ The Economic Basis of Imperialism ” in the September 1898 North American Review , and in other essays collected in The United States in the Orient : The Nature of the Economic Problem and published in 1900 .
S. J. Chapman ( 1901 , p. 78 ) , a distinguished British economist , accurately summarized Conant ’s argument as follows : ( 1 ) “ In all advanced countries there has been such excessive saving that no profitable investment for capital remains . ”
( 2 ) Since all countries do not practice a policy of commercial freedom , “ America must be prepared to use force if necessary ” to open up profitable investment outlets abroad , and ( 3 ) the United States possesses an advantage in the coming struggle , since the organization of many of its industries “ in the form of trusts will assist it greatly in the fight for commercial supremacy . ” [ 12 ]
The war successfully won , Conant was particularly enthusiastic about the United States keeping the Philippines , the gateway to the great potential Asian market .
The United States , he opined , should not be held back by “ an abstract theory ” to adopt “ extreme conclusions ” on applying the doctrines of the Founding Fathers on the importance of the consent of the governed .
The Founding Fathers , he declared , surely meant that self - government could only apply to those competent to exercise it , a requirement that clearly did not apply to the backward people of the Philippines .
After all , Conant wrote , “ Only by the firm hand of the responsible governing races … can the assurance of uninterrupted progress be conveyed to the tropical and undeveloped countries ” ( Healy 1970 , pp. 200–01 ) .
Conant also was bold enough to derive important domestic conclusions from his enthusiasm for imperialism .
Domestic society , he claimed , would have to be transformed to make the nation as “ efficient ” as possible .
Efficiency , in particular , meant centralized concentration of power .
“ Concentration of power , in order to permit prompt and efficient action , will be an almost essential factor in the struggle for world empire . ”
In particular , it was important for the United States to learn from the magnificent centralization of power and purpose in Czarist Russia .
The government of the United States would require “ a degree of harmony and symmetry which will permit the direction of the whole power of the state toward definite and intelligent policies . ”
The US Constitution would have to be amended to permit a form of Czarist absolutism , or at the very least an enormously expanded executive power in foreign affairs ( Healy , pp. 202–03 ) .
An interesting case study of business opinion energized and converted by the lure of imperialism was the Boston weekly , The US Investor .
Before the outbreak of war with Spain in 1898 , the US Investor denounced the idea of war as a disaster to business .
But after the United States launched its war , and Commodore Dewey seized Manila Bay , the Investor totally changed its tune .
Now it hailed the war as excellent for business , and as bringing about recovery from the previous recession .
Soon the Investor was happily advocating a policy of “ imperialism ” to make US prosperity permanent .
Imperialism conveyed marvelous benefits to the country .
At home , a big army and navy would be valuable in curbing the tendency of democracy to enjoy “ a too great freedom from restraint , both of action and of thought . ”
The Investor added that “ European experience demonstrates that the army and navy are admirably adopted to inculcate orderly habits of thought and action . ”
But an even more important benefit from a policy of permanent imperialism would be economic .
To keep “ capital … at work , ” stern necessity requires that “ an enlarged field for its product must be discovered . ”
Specifically , “ a new field ” had to be found for selling the growing flood of goods produced by the advanced nations , and for investment of their savings at profitable rates .
The Investor exulted in the fact that this new “ field lies ready for occupancy .
It is to be found among the semicivilized and barbarian races , ” in particular the beckoning country of China .
Particularly interesting is the colloquy that ensued between the Investor , and the Springfield ( Mass . )
Republican , which still propounded the older theory of free trade and laissez - faire .
The Republican asked why trade with undeveloped countries is not sufficient without burdening US taxpayers with administrative and military overhead .
The Republican also attacked the new theory of surplus capital , pointing out that only two or three years earlier , businessmen had been loudly calling for more European capital to be invested in American ventures .
To the first charge , the Investor fell back on “ the experience of the race for , perhaps ninety centuries , [ which ] has been in the direction of foreign acquisitions as a means of national prosperity . ”
But , more practically , the Investor delighted over the goodies that imperialism would bring to American business in the way of government contracts and the governmental development of what would now be called the “ infrastructure ” of the colonies .
Furthermore , as in Britain , a greatly expanded diplomatic service would provide “ a new calling for our young men of education and ability . ”
To the Republican ’s second charge , on surplus capital , the Investor , like Conant , developed the idea of a new age that had just arrived in American affairs : an age of large - scale manufacture and hence overproduction , an age of a low rate of profit , and consequent formation of trusts in a quest for higher profits through suppression of competition .
As the Investor put it , “ The excess of capital has resulted in an unprofitable competition .
To employ Franklin ’s witticism , the owners of capital are of the opinion they must hang together or else they will all hang separately . ”
But while trusts may solve the problem of specific industries , they do not solve the great problem of a general “ congestion of capital . ”
Indeed , wrote the Investor , “ finding employment for capital … is now the greatest of all economic problems that confront us . ”
To the Investor , the way out was clear :
The logical path to be pursued is that of the development of the natural riches of the tropical countries .
These countries are now peopled by races incapable on their own initiative of extracting its full riches from their own soil … .
This will be attained in some cases by the mere stimulus of government and direction by men of the temperate zones ; but it will be attained also by the application of modern machinery and methods of culture to the agricultural and mineral resources of the undeveloped countries .
( Quoted in Etherington 1984 , p. 17 )
By the spring of 1901 , even the eminent economic theorist John Bates Clark , of Columbia University , was able to embrace the new creed .
Reviewing proimperialist works by Conant , Brooks Adams , and the Reverend Josiah Strong in a single celebratory review in March 1901 in the Political Science Quarterly , Clark emphasized the importance of opening foreign markets and particularly of investing American capital “ with an even larger and more permanent profit ” ( Parrini and Sklar 1983 , p. 565 , n. 16 ) .
J. B. Clark was not the only economist ready to join in apologia for the strong state .
Throughout the land by the turn of the 20th century , a legion of economists and other social scientists had arisen , many of them trained in graduate schools in Germany to learn of the virtues of the inductive method , the German Historical School , and a collectivist , organicist state .
Eager for positions and power commensurate with their graduate training , these new social scientists , in the name of professionalism and technical expertise , prepared to abandon the old laissez - faire creed and take their places as apologists and planners in a new , centrally - planned state .
Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman of Columbia University , of the prominent Wall Street investment banking family of J. and W. Seligman and Company , spoke for many of these social scientists when , in a presidential address before the American Economic Association in 1903 , he hailed the “ new industrial order . ” [ 13 ]
Seligman prophesied that in the new , 20th century , the possession of economic knowledge would grant economists the power “ to control … and mold ” the material forces of progress .
As the economist proved able to forecast more accurately , he would be installed as “ the real philosopher of social life , ” and the public would pay “ deference to his views . ”
In his 1899 presidential address , Arthur Twining Hadley of Yale also saw economists developing as society ’s philosopher kings .
The most important application of economic knowledge , declared Hadley , was leadership in public life , becoming advisers and leaders of national policy .
“ I believe , ” opined Hadley ,
that their [ economists ’] largest opportunity in the immediate future lies not in theories but in practice , not with students but with statesmen , not in the education of individual citizens , however widespread and salutary , but in the leadership of an organized body politic .
( Silva and Slaughter 1984 , p. 103 )
Hadley perceptively saw the executive branch of the government as particularly amenable to providing access to position and influence for economic advisers and planners .
Previously , executives were hampered in seeking such expert counsel by the importance of political parties , their ideological commitments , and their mass base in the voting population .
But now , fortunately , the growing municipal reform ( soon to be called the Progressive ) movement was taking power away from political parties and putting it into the hands of administrators and experts .
The “ increased centralization of administrative power [ was giving ] … the expert a fair chance . ”
And now , on the national scene , the new American leap into imperialism in the Spanish - American War was providing an opportunity for increased centralization , executive power , and therefore for administrative and expert planning .
Even though Hadley declared himself personally opposed to imperialism , he urged economists to leap at this great opportunity for access to power ( Silva and Slaughter 1984 , pp. 120–21 ) .
The organized economic profession was not slow to grasp this new opportunity .
Quickly , the executive and nominating committees of the American Economic Association ( AEA ) created a five - man special committee to organize and publish a volume on colonial finance .
As Silva and Slaughter put it , this new , rapidly put together volume permitted the AEA to show the power elite how the new social science could serve the interests of those who made imperialism a national policy by offering technical solutions to the immediate fiscal problems of colonies , as well as providing ideological justifications for acquiring them .
( Silva and Slaughter , p. 133 )
The chairman of the special committee was Professor Jeremiah W. Jenks of Cornell , the major economic adviser to Governor Theodore Roosevelt .
Another member was Professor E. R. A. Seligman , another key adviser to Roosevelt .
A third colleague was Dr. Albert Shaw , influential editor of the Review of Reviews , progressive reformer and social scientist , and long - time crony of Roosevelt ’s .
All three were long - time leaders of the American Economic Association .
The other two , non-AEA leaders , on the committee were Edward R. Strobel , former assistant secretary of state and adviser to colonial governments , and Charles S. Hamlin , wealthy Boston lawyer and assistant secretary of the treasury , who had long been in the Morgan ambit , and whose wife was a member of the Pruyn family , longtime investors in two Morgan - dominated concerns : the New York Central Railroad and the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York .
Essays in Colonial Finance ( Jenks et al. 1900 ) , the volume quickly put together by these five leaders , tried to advise the United States how best to run its newly - acquired empire .
First , just as the British government insisted when the North American states were its colonies , the colonies should support their imperial government through taxation , whereas control should be tightly exercised by the US imperial center .
Second , the imperial center should build and maintain the economic infrastructure of the colony : canals , railroads , and communications .
Third , where — as was clearly anticipated — native labor is inefficient or incapable of management , the imperial government should import ( white ) labor from the imperial center .
And , finally , as Silva and Slaughter put it ,
the committee ’s fiscal recommendations strongly intimated that trained economists were necessary for a successful empire .
It was they who must make a thorough study of local conditions to determine the correct fiscal system , gather data , create the appropriate administrative design and perhaps even implement it .
In this way , the committee seconded Hadley ’s views in seeing imperialism as an opportunity for economists by identifying a large number of professional positions best filled by themselves .
( Silva and Slaughter 1984 , p. 135 )
With the volume written , the AEA cast about for financial support for its publication and distribution .
The point was not simply to obtain the financing , but to do so in such a way as to gain the imprimatur of leading members of the power elite on this bold move to empower economists as technocratic expert advisers and administrators in the imperial nation - state .
The American Economic Association found five wealthy businessmen to put up two - fifths the full cost of publishing Essays in Colonial Finance .
By compiling the volume and then accepting corporate sponsors , several of whom had an economic stake in the new American empire , the AEA was signaling that the nation ’s organized economists were ( 1 ) wholeheartedly in favor of the new American empire ; and ( 2 ) were willing and eager to play a strong role in advising and administering the empire , a role which they promptly and happily filled , as we shall see in the following section .
In view of the symbolic as well as practical role for the sponsors , a list of the five donors for the colonial - finance volume is instructive .
One was Isaac N. Seligman , head of the investment - banking house of J and W Seligman and Company , a company with extensive overseas interests , especially in Latin America .
Isaac ’s brother E. R. A. Seligman was a member of the special committee on Colonial Finance and an author of one of the essays in the volume .
Another was William E. Dodge , a partner of the copper mining firm of Phelps , Dodge , and Company , and member of a powerful mining family allied to the Morgans .
A third donor was Theodore Marburg , an economist who was vice president of the AEA at the time , and also an ardent advocate of imperialism as well as heir to a substantial American Tobacco Company fortune .
Fourth was Thomas Shearman , a single - taxer and an attorney for the powerful railroad magnate Jay Gould .
And last but not least , was Stuart Wood , a manufacturer who had a PhD in economics and had been a vice president of the AEA .
Conant : Monetary Imperialism and the Gold - Exchange Standard
The leap into political imperialism by the United States in the late 1890s was accompanied by economic imperialism , and one key to economic imperialism was monetary imperialism .
In brief , the developed Western countries by this time were on the gold standard , while most of the Third World nations were on the silver standard .
For the past several decades , the value of silver in relation to gold had been steadily falling , due to
an increasing world supply of silver relative to gold , and the subsequent shift of many Western nations from silver or bimetallism to gold , thereby lowering the world ’s demand for silver as a monetary metal .
The fall of silver values meant monetary depreciation and inflation in the Third World , and it would have been a reasonable policy to shift from a silver - coin to a gold - coin standard .
But the new imperialists among US bankers , economists , and politicians were far less interested in the welfare of Third World countries than in foisting a monetary imperialism upon them .
For not only would the economies of the imperial center and the client states then be tied together , but they would be tied in such a way that these economies could pyramid their own monetary and bank credit inflation on top of inflation in the United States .
Hence , what the new imperialists set out to do was pressure or coerce Third World countries to adopt , not a genuine gold - coin standard , but a newly conceived “ gold - exchange ” or dollar standard .
Instead of silver currency fluctuating freely in terms of gold , the silver to gold rate would then be fixed by arbitrary government price - fixing .
The silver countries would be silver in name only ; the country ’s monetary reserve would be held , not in silver , but in dollars allegedly redeemable in gold ; and these reserves would be held , not in the country itself , but as dollars piled up in New York City .
In that way , if US banks inflated their credit , there would be no danger of losing gold abroad , as would happen under a genuine gold standard .
For under a true gold standard , no one and no country would be interested in piling up claims to dollars overseas .
Instead , they would demand payment of dollar claims in gold .
So that even though these American bankers and economists were all too aware , after many decades of experience , of the fallacies and evils of bimetallism , they were willing to impose a form of bimetallism upon client states in order to tie them into US economic imperialism , and to pressure them into inflating their own money supplies on top of dollar reserves supposedly , but not de facto , redeemable in gold .
The United States first confronted the problem of silver currencies in a Third World country when it seized control of Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898 and occupied it as a permanent colony .
Fortunately for the imperialists , Puerto Rico was already ripe for currency manipulation .
Only three years earlier , in 1895 , Spain had destroyed the full - bodied Mexican silver currency that its colony had previously enjoyed , and replaced it with a heavily debased silver “ dollar , ” worth only 41 cents in US currency .
The Spanish government had pocketed the large seigniorage profits from that debasement .
The United States was therefore easily able to substitute its own debased silver dollar , worth only 45.6 cents in gold .
Thus , the United States ’ silver currency replaced an even more debased one , and also the Puerto Ricans had no tradition of loyalty to a currency only recently imposed by the Spaniards .
There was therefore little or no opposition in Puerto Rico to the US monetary takeover . [ 14 ]
The major controversial question was what exchange rate the American authorities would fix between the two debased coins : the old Puerto Rican silver peso and the US silver dollar .
This was the rate at which the US authorities would compel the Puerto Ricans to exchange their existing coinage for the new American coins .
The treasurer in charge of the currency reform for the US government was the prominent Johns Hopkins economist , Jacob H. Hollander , who had been special commissioner to revise Puerto Rican tax laws , and who was one of the new breed of academic economists repudiating laissez - faire for comprehensive statism .
The heavy debtors in Puerto Rico — mainly the large sugar planters — naturally wanted to pay their peso obligations at as cheap a rate as possible ; they lobbied for a peso worth 50 cents American .
In contrast , the Puerto Rican banker - creditors wanted the rate fixed at 75 cents .
Since the exchange rate was arbitrary anyway , Hollander and the other American officials decided in the time - honored way of governments : more or less splitting the difference , and fixing a peso equal to 60 cents . [ 15 ]
The Philippines , the other Spanish colony grabbed by the United States , posed a far more difficult problem .
As in most of the Far East , the Philippines was happily using a perfectly sound silver currency , the Mexican silver dollar .
But the United States was anxious for a rapid reform , because its large armed forces establishment suppressing Filipino nationalism required heavy expenses in US dollars , which it of course declared to be legal tender for payments .
Since the Mexican silver coin was also legal tender and was cheaper than the US gold dollar , the US military occupation found its revenues being paid in unwanted and cheaper Mexican coins .
Delicacy was required , and in 1901 , for the task of currency takeover the Bureau of Insular Affairs ( BIA ) of the War Department — the agency running the US occupation of the Philippines — hired Charles A. Conant for the task .
Secretary of War Elihu Root was a redoubtable Wall Street lawyer in the Morgan ambit who sometimes served as J. P. Morgan ’s personal attorney .
Root took a personal hand in sending Conant to the Philippines .
Conant , fresh from the Indianapolis Monetary Commission and before going to New York as a leading investment banker , was , as might be expected , an ardent gold - exchange - standard imperialist as well as the leading theoretician of economic imperialism .
Realizing that the Filipino people loved their silver coins , Conant devised a way to impose a gold US dollar currency upon the country .
Under his cunning plan , the Filipinos would continue to have a silver currency ; but replacing the full - bodied Mexican silver coin would be an American silver coin tied to gold at a debased value far less than the market exchange value of silver in terms of gold .
In this imposed , debased bimetallism , since the silver coin was deliberately overvalued in relation to gold by the US government , Gresham ’s law went inexorably into effect .
The overvalued silver would keep circulating in the Philippines , and undervalued gold would be kept sharply out of circulation .
The seigniorage profit that the Treasury would reap from the debasement would be happily deposited at a New York bank , which would then function as a “ reserve ” for the US silver currency in the Philippines .
Thus , the New York funds would be used for payment outside the Philippines instead of as coin or specie .
Moreover , the US government could issue paper dollars based on its new reserve fund .
It should be noted that Conant originated the gold - exchange scheme as a way of exploiting and controlling Third World economies based on silver .
At the same time , Great Britain was introducing similar schemes in its colonial areas in Egypt , the Straits Settlements in Asia , and particularly in India .
Congress , however , pressured by the silver lobby , balked at the BIA ’s plan .
And so the BIA again turned to the seasoned public relations and lobbying skills of Charles A. Conant .
Conant swung into action .
Meeting with editors of the top financial journals , he secured their promises to write editorials pushing for the Conant plan , many of which he obligingly wrote himself .
He was already backed by the American banks of Manila .
Recalcitrant US bankers were warned by Conant that they could no longer expect large government deposits from the War Department if they continued to oppose the plan .
Furthermore , Conant won the support of the major enemies of his plan , the American silver companies and prosilver bankers , promising them that if the Philippine currency reform went through , the federal government would buy silver for the new US coinage in the Philippines from these same companies .
Finally , the tireless lobbying , and the mixture of bribery and threats by Conant , paid off .
Congress passed the Philippine Currency Bill in March 1903 .
In the Philippines , however , the United States could not simply duplicate the Puerto Rican example and coerce the conversion of the old for the new silver coinage .
For the Mexican silver coin was a dominant coin not only in the Far East but throughout the world , and the coerced conversion would have been endless .
The United States tried ; it removed the legal tender privilege from the Mexican coins , and decreed the new US coins to be used for taxes , government salaries , and other government payments .
But this time the Filipinos happily used the old Mexican coins as money , while the US silver coins disappeared from circulation into payment of taxes and transactions to the United States .
The War Department was beside itself : how could it drive Mexican silver coinage out of the Philippines ?
In desperation , it turned to the indefatigable Conant , but Conant could n’t join the colonial government in the Philippines because he had just been appointed to a more far - flung presidential commission on international exchange for pressuring Mexico and China to go on a similar gold - exchange standard .
Hollander , fresh from his Puerto Rican triumph , was ill .
Who else ?
Conant , Hollander , and several leading bankers told the War Department they could recommend no one for the job , so new then was the profession of technical expert in monetary imperialism .
But there was one more hope , the other procartelist and financial imperialist , Cornell ’s Jeremiah W. Jenks , a fellow member with Conant of President Roosevelt ’s new Commission on International Exchange ( CIE ) .
Jenks had already paved the way for Conant by visiting English and Dutch colonies in the Far East in 1901 to gain information about running the Philippines .
Jenks finally came up with a name , his former graduate student at Cornell , Edwin W. Kemmerer .
Young Kemmerer went to the Philippines from 1903 to 1906 , to implement the Conant plan .
Based on the theories of Jenks and Conant , and on his own experience in the Philippines , Kemmerer went on to teach at Cornell and then at Princeton , and gained fame throughout the 1920s as the “ money doctor , ” busily imposing the gold - exchange standard on country after country abroad .
Relying on Conant ’s behind - the - scenes advice , Kemmerer and his associates finally came out with a successful scheme to drive out the Mexican silver coins .
It was a plan that relied heavily on government coercion .
The United States imposed a legal prohibition on the importation of the Mexican coins , followed by severe taxes on any private Philippine transactions daring to use the Mexican currency .
Luckily for the planners , their scheme was aided by a large - scale demand at the time for Mexican silver in northern China , which absorbed silver that was in the Philippines or that would have been smuggled into the islands .
The US success was aided by the fact that the new US silver coins , perceptively called “ conants ” by the Filipinos , were made up to look very much like the cherished old Mexican coins .
By 1905 , force , luck , and trickery had prevailed , and the conants ( worth 50 cents in US money ) were the dominant currency in the Philippines .
Soon the US authorities were confident enough to add token copper coins and paper conants as well . [ 16 ]
By 1903 , the currency reformers felt emboldened enough to move against the Mexican silver dollar throughout the world .
In Mexico itself , US industrialists who wanted to invest there pressured the Mexicans to shift from silver to gold , and they found an ally in powerful finance minister Jos Limantour .
But tackling the Mexican silver peso at home would not be an easy task , for the coin was known and used throughout the world , particularly in China , where it formed the bulk of the circulating coinage .
Finally , after three - way talks between US , Mexican , and Chinese officials , the Mexicans and Chinese were induced to send identical notes to the US Secretary of State , urging the United States to appoint financial advisers to bring about a currency reform and stabilized exchange rates with the gold countries ( Parrini and Sklar 1983 , pp. 573–77 ; Rosenberg 1985 , p. 184 ) .
These requests gave President Roosevelt , upon securing Congressional approval , the excuse to appoint in March 1903 a three - man Commission on International Exchange to bring about currency reform in Mexico , China , and the rest of the silver - using world .
The aim was “ to bring about a fixed relationship between the moneys of the gold - standard countries and the present silver - using countries , ” in order to foster “ export trade and investment opportunities ” in the gold countries and economic development in the silver countries .
The three members of the CIE were old friends and like - minded colleagues .
The chairman was Hugh H. Hanna , of the Indianapolis Monetary Commission , the others were his former chief aide at that Commission , Charles A. Conant , and Professor Jeremiah W. Jenks .
Conant , as usual , was the major theoretician and finagler .
He realized that major opposition to Mexico and China ’s shift to a gold standard would come from the important Mexican - silver industry , and he devised a scheme to get European countries to purchase large amounts of Mexican silver to ease the pain of the shift .
In a trip to European nations in the summer of 1903 , however , Conant and the CIE found the Europeans less than enthusiastic about making Mexican silver purchases as well as subsidizing US exports and investments in China , a land whose market they too were coveting .
In the United States , on the other hand , major newspapers and financial periodicals , prodded by Conant ’s public relations work , warmly endorsed the new currency scheme .
In the meantime , however , the United States faced similar currency problems in its two new Caribbean protectorates , Cuba and Panama .
Panama was easy .
The United States occupied the Canal Zone , and would be importing vast amounts of equipment to build the canal , and so it decided to impose the American gold dollar as the currency in the nominally independent Republic of Panama .
While the gold dollar was the official currency of Panama , the United States imposed as the actual medium of exchange a new debased silver peso worth 50 cents .
Fortunately , the new peso was almost the same in value as the old Colombian silver coin it forcibly displaced , and so , like Puerto Rico , the takeover could go without a hitch .
Among the US colonies or protectorates , Cuba proved the toughest nut to crack .
Despite all of Conant ’s ministrations , Cuba ’s currency remained unreformed .
Spanish gold and silver coins , French coins , and US currency all circulated side by side , freely fluctuating in response to supply and demand .
Furthermore , similar to the prereformed Philippines , a fixed bimetallic exchange rate between the cheaper US , and the more valuable Spanish and French , coins led the Cubans to return cheaper US coins to the US customs authorities in fees and revenues .
Why then did Conant fail in Cuba ?
In the first place , strong Cuban nationalism resented US plans for seizing control of their currency .
Conant ’s repeated request in 1903 for a Cuban invitation for the CIE to visit the island met stern rejections from the Cuban government .
Moreover , the charismatic US military commander in Cuba , Leonard Wood , wanted to avoid giving the Cubans the impression that plans were afoot to reduce Cuba to colonial status .
The second objection was economic .
The powerful sugar industry in Cuba depended on exports to the United States , and a shift from depreciated silver to higher - valued gold money would increase the cost of sugar exports , by an amount Leonard Wood estimated to be about 20 percent .
While the same problem had existed for the sugar planters in Puerto Rico , American economic interests , in Puerto Rico and in other countries such as the Philippines favored forcing formerly silver countries onto a gold - based standard so as to stimulate US exports into those countries .
In Cuba , on the other hand , there was increasing US investment capital pouring into the Cuban sugar plantations , so that powerful and even dominant US economic interests existed on the other side of the currency reform question .
Indeed , by World War I , American investments in Cuban sugar reached the sum of $ 95 million .
Thus , when Charles Conant resumed his pressure for a Cuban gold - exchange standard in 1907 , he was strongly opposed by the US Governor of Cuba , Charles Magoon , who raised the problem of a gold - based standard crippling the sugar planters .
The CIE never managed to visit Cuba , and ironically , Charles Conant died in Cuba , in 1915 , trying in vain to convince the Cubans of the virtues of the gold - exchange standard ( Rosenberg 1985 , pp. 186–88 ) .
The Mexican shift from silver to gold was more gratifying to Conant , but here the reform was effected by Foreign Minister Limantour and his indigenous technicians , with the CIE taking a back seat .
However , the success of this shift , in the Mexican Currency Reform
Act of 1905 , was assured by a world rise in the price of silver , starting the following year , which made gold coins cheaper than silver , with Gresham ’s law bringing about a successful gold coin currency in Mexico .
But the US silver coinage in the Philippines ran into trouble because of the rise in the world silver price .
Here , the US silver currency in the Philippines was bailed out by coordinated action by the Mexican government , which sold silver in the Philippines to lower the value of silver sufficiently so that the Conants could be brought back into circulation . [ 17 ]
But the big failure of Conant / CIE monetary imperialism was in China .
In 1900 , Britain , Japan , and the United States intervened in China to put down the Boxer Rebellion .
The three countries thereupon forced defeated China to agree to pay them and all major European powers an indemnity of $ 333 million .
The United States interpreted the treaty as an obligation to pay in gold , but China , on a depreciated silver standard , began to pay in silver in 1903 , an action that enraged the three treaty powers .
The US minister to China reported that Britain might declare China ’s payment in silver a violation of the treaty , which would presage military intervention .
Emboldened by the United States ’ success in the Philippines , Panama , and Mexico , Secretary of War Root sent Jeremiah W. Jenks on a mission to China in early 1904 to try to transform China from a silver - to a gold - exchange standard .
Jenks also wrote to President Roosevelt from China urging that the Chinese indemnity to the United States from the Boxer Rebellion be used to fund exchange professorships for 30 years .
Jenks ’s mission , however , was a total failure .
The Chinese understood the CIE currency scheme all too well .
They saw and denounced the seigniorage of the gold - exchange standard as an irresponsible and immoral debasement of Chinese currency , an act that would impoverish China while adding to the profits of US banks where seigniorage reserve funds would be deposited .
Moreover , the Chinese officials saw that shifting the indemnity from silver to gold would enrich the European governments at the expense of the Chinese economy .
They also noted that the CIE scheme would establish a foreign controller of the Chinese currency to impose banking regulations and economic reforms on the Chinese economy .
We need not wonder at the Chinese outrage .
China ’s reaction was its own nationalistic currency reform in 1905 to replace the Mexican silver coin with a new Chinese silver coin , the tael ( Rosenberg 1985 , pp. 189–92 ) .
Jenks ’s ignominious failure in China put an end to any formal role for the Commission on International Exchange . [ 18 ]
An immediately following fiasco blocked the US government ’s use of economic and financial advisers to spread the gold - exchange standard abroad .
In 1905 , the State Department hired Jacob Hollander to move another of its Latin American client states , the Dominican Republic , onto the gold - exchange standard .
When Hollander accomplished this task by the end of the year , the State Department asked the Dominican government to hire Hollander to work out a plan for financial reform , including a US loan , and a customs service run by the United States to collect taxes for repayment of the loan .
Hollander , son - in - law of prominent Baltimore merchant Abraham Hutzler , used his connection with Kuhn , Loeb and Company to place Dominican bonds with that investment bank .
Hollander also engaged happily in double dipping for the same work , collecting fees for the same job from the State Department and from the Dominican government .
When this peccadillo was discovered in 1911 , the scandal made it impossible for the US government to use its own employees and its own funds to push for gold - exchange experts abroad .
From then on , there was more of a public - private partnership between the US government and the investment bankers , with the bankers supplying their own funds , and the State Department supplying good will and more concrete resources .
Thus , in 1911 –1912 , the United States , over great opposition , imposed a gold - exchange standard on Nicaragua .
The State Department formally stepped aside , but approved Charles Conant ’s hiring by the powerful investment - banking firm of Brown Brothers to bring about a loan and the currency reform .
The State Department lent not only its approval to the project , but also its official wires , for Conant and Brown Brothers to conduct the negotiations with the Nicaraguan government .
By the time he died in Cuba in 1915 , Charles Conant had made himself the chief theoretician and practitioner of the gold - exchange and the economic - imperialist movements .
Aside from his successes in the Philippines , Panama , and Mexico , and his failures in Cuba and China , Conant led in pushing for gold - exchange reform and gold - dollar imperialism in Liberia , Bolivia , Guatemala , and Honduras .
His magnum opus in favor of the gold - exchange standard , the two - volume The Principles of Money and Banking ( 1905 ) , as well as his pathbreaking success in the Philippines , were followed by a myriad of books , articles , pamphlets , and editorials , always backed up by his personal propaganda efforts .
Particularly interesting were Conant ’s arguments in favor of a gold - exchange , rather than a genuine gold - coin , standard .
A straight gold - coin standard , Conant believed , did not provide a sufficient amount of gold to provide for the world ’s monetary needs .
Hence , by tying the existing silver standards in the undeveloped countries to gold , the “ shortage ” of gold could be overcome , and also the economies of the undeveloped countries could be integrated into those of the dominant imperial power .
All this could only be done if the gold - exchange standard were “ designed and implemented by careful government policy , ” but of course Conant himself and his friends and disciples always stood ready to advise and provide such implementation ( Rosenberg 1985 , p. 197 ) .
In addition , adopting a government - managed gold - exchange standard was superior to either genuine gold or bimetallism because it left each state the flexibility of adapting its currency to local needs .
As Conant asserted ,
It leaves each state free to choose the means of exchange which conform best to its local conditions .
Rich nations are free to choose gold , nations less rich silver , and those whose financial methods are most advanced are free to choose paper .
It is interesting that for Conant , paper was the most “ advanced ” form of money .
It is clear that the devotion to the gold standard of Conant and of his colleagues was only to a debased and inflationary standard controlled and manipulated by the US government , with gold really serving as a faade of allegedly hard money .
And one of the critical forms of government manipulation and control in Conant ’s proposed system was the existence and active functioning of a central bank .
As a founder of the “ science ” of financial advising to governments , Conant , followed by his colleagues and disciples , not only pushed a gold - exchange standard wherever he could do so , but also a central bank to manage and control that standard .
As Emily Rosenberg points out ,
Conant thus did not neglect … one of the major revolutionary changes implicit in his system : a new , important role for a central bank as a currency stabilizer .
Conant strongly supported the American banking reform that culminated in the Federal Reserve System … and American financial advisers who followed Conant would spread central banking systems , along with gold - standard currency reforms , to the countries they advised .
( Rosenberg 1985 , p. 198 )
Along with a managed gold - exchange standard would come , as replacement for the old free - trade , unmanaged , gold - coin standard , a world of imperial currency blocs , which “ would necessarily come into being as lesser countries deposited their gold stabilization funds in the banking systems of more advanced countries ” ( ibid . ) .
New York and London banks , in particular , shaped up as the major reserve fundholders in the developing new world monetary order .
It is no accident that the United States ’ major financial and imperial rival , Great Britain , which was pioneering in imposing gold - exchange standards in its own colonial area at this time , built upon this experience to impose a gold - exchange standard , marked by all European currencies pyramiding on top of British inflation , during the 1920s .
That disastrous inflationary experiment led straight to the worldwide banking crash and the general shift to fiat paper moneys in the early 1930s .
After World War II , the United States took up the torch of a world gold - exchange standard at Bretton Woods , with the dollar replacing the pound sterling in a worldwide inflationary system that lasted approximately 25 years .
Nor should it be thought that Charles A. Conant was the purely disinterested scientist he claimed to be .
His currency reforms directly benefitted his investment banker employers .
Thus , Conant was treasurer , from 1902 to 1906 , of the Morgan - run Morton Trust Company of New York , and it was surely no coincidence that Morton Trust was the bank that held the reserve funds for the governments of the Philippines , Panama , and the Dominican Republic , after their respective currency reforms .
In the Nicaragua negotiations , Conant was employed by the investment bank of Brown Brothers , and in pressuring other countries he was working for Speyer and Company and other investment bankers .
After Conant died in 1915 , there were few to pick up the mantle of foreign financial advising .
Hollander was in disgrace after the Dominican debacle .
Jenks was aging , and lived in the shadow of his China failure , but the State Department did appoint Jenks to serve as a director of the Nicaraguan National Bank in 1917 , and also hired him to study the Nicaraguan financial picture in 1925 .
But the true successor of Conant was Edwin W. Kemmerer , the “ money doctor . ”
After his Philippine experience , Kemmerer joined his old Professor Jenks at Cornell , and then moved to Princeton in 1912 , publishing his book Modern Currency Reforms in 1916 .
As the leading foreign financial adviser of the 1920s , Kemmerer not only imposed central banks and a gold - exchange standard on Third World countries , but also got them to levy higher taxes .
Kemmerer , too , combined his public employment with service to leading international bankers .
During the 1920s , Kemmerer worked as a banking expert for the US government ’s Dawes Commission , headed special financial advisory missions to over a dozen countries , and was kept on a handsome retainer by the distinguished investment banking firm of Dillon and Read from 1922 to 1929 .
In that era , Kemmerer and his mentor Jenks were the only foreign - currency - reform experts available for advising .
In the late 1920s , Kemmerer helped establish a chair of international economics at Princeton , which he occupied , and from which he could train students like Arthur N. Young and William W. Cumberland .
In the mid-1920s , the money doctor served as president of the American Economic Association . [ 19 ]
Jacob Schiff Ignites the Drive for a Central Bank
The defeat of the Fowler Bill for broader asset currency and branch banking in 1902 , coupled with the failure of Secretary of Treasury Shaw ’s attempts of 1903 –1905 to use the Treasury as a central bank , led the big bankers and their economist allies to adopt a new solution : the frank imposition of a central bank in the United States .
The campaign for a central bank was kicked off by a fateful speech in January 1906 by the powerful Jacob H. Schiff , head of the Wall Street investment bank of Kuhn , Loeb and Co. , before the New York Chamber of Commerce .
Schiff complained that , in the autumn of 1905 , when “ the country needed money , ” the Treasury , instead of working to expand the money supply , reduced government deposits in the national banks , thereby precipitating a financial crisis , a “ disgrace ” in which the New York clearinghouse banks had been forced to contract their loans drastically , sending interest rates sky - high .
An “ elastic currency ” for the nation was therefore imperative , and Schiff urged the New York Chamber ’s committee on finance to draw up a comprehensive plan for a modern banking system to provide for an elastic currency ( Bankers Magazine 1906 , pp. 114–15 ) .
A colleague who had already been agitating behind the scenes for a central bank was Schiff ’s partner , Paul Moritz Warburg , who had suggested the plan to Schiff as early as 1903 .
Warburg had emigrated from the German investment firm of M. M. Warburg and Company in 1897 , and before long his major function at Kuhn , Loeb was to agitate to bring the blessings of European central banking to the United States . [ 20 ]
It took less than a month for the finance committee of the New York Chamber to issue its report , but the bank reformers were furious , denouncing it as remarkably ignorant .
When Frank A. Vanderlip , of Rockefeller ’s flagship bank , the National City Bank of New York , reported on this development , his boss , James Stillman , suggested that a new five - man special commission be set up by the New York Chamber to come back with a plan for currency reform .
In response , Vanderlip proposed that the five - man commission consist of himself ; Schiff ; J. P. Morgan ; George Baker of the First National Bank of New York , Morgan ’s closest and longest associate ; and former Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage , now president of the Rockefeller - controlled US Trust Company .
Thus , the commission would consist of two Rockefeller men ( Vanderlip and Gage ) , two Morgan men ( Morgan and Baker ) , and one representative from Kuhn , Loeb .
Only Vanderlip was available to serve , however , so the commission had to be redrawn .
In addition to Vanderlip , beginning in March 1906 , there sat , instead of Schiff , his close friend Isidore Straus , a director of R. H. Macy and Company .
Instead of Morgan and Baker there now served two Morgan men : Dumont Clarke , president o
A man hated his mugshot picture so much that he ended up sending a replacement to the newspaper that he took of himself , standing in front of a police van .
The interesting thing is that the man is at large and is been sought by the police for burglary charges .
British Police is seeking Matthew Maynard , 23 , as a person of interest in connection with a home burglary .
They published his picture in South Wales Evening Post with 7 other people resulting in 4 arrests .
But Maynard did n’t like his picture issued by the police , so he tried to make it right .
He sent a text to the newspaper complaining that he did n’t like the police issued picture and sent them a replacement picture that was taken in front of a police van .
Obviously police loved the picture and the help !

( Initial Mugshot picture )
One officer said : “ He is a berk .
He thinks he is being clever by showing off like this – but we ’ll have him in soon now .
“ Everyone in Swansea will know what he looks like now . ”
South Wales police issued their mugshot of Maynard along with seven other suspects as part of a major swoop which saw 81 arrests in 48 hours .
Four of the suspects were quickly picked up but Maynard is one of four still on the run .
Acting Chief Inspector Nigel Whitehouse , who led the operation , said : “ Maynard is very well known to us in the police here in Swansea .
“ He is a well known member of the criminal fraternity and seeing him like this is not a surprise to us .
“ We hope now that many more people will know what he looks like and give us information which can lead to his arrest .
“ But if he has any sense at all then he should just give himself up to us now . ”
Maynard is wanted for a house raid in Mount Pleasant , Swansea , in September .

A gargantuan iPod Touch billboard disappeared from its scaffolding in Boston this week .
The 13,750 - square - foot wall of a Planet Self - Storage building is showing its whale mural underneath for the first time since 2007 ( that 's two years of oversized Apple banners ) .
No one seems to know why the ad so suddenly disappeared , but it might be related to the fact that the state 's Outdoor Advertising Board has been calling it illegal for a while .
You see , rules for giant wall ads like this require that the building owner sell the product being advertised .
Planet Self - Storage sells iTunes gift cards ( why ? ) but not iPods or any other iProducts .
( Lots of Apple products might be self–stored inside , of course . )
The Boston Globe 's take is that the billboard 's illegality was generally overlooked by the mayor 's office .
Maybe PETA elves took the banner down in an effort to save the whales .

India Buying 200 Tons of Gold ,
What does it Mean ?
India ’s central bank , Reserve Bank of India , announced on Nov. 2 , 2009 a purchase of gold from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) :
" The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has concluded the purchase of 200 metric tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , under the IMF ’s limited gold sales programme .
This was done as part of the Reserve Bank ’s foreign exchange reserves management operations .
The purchase was an official sector off - market transaction and was executed over a two week period during October 19 – 30 , 2009 at market based prices . "
By my calculation , the bank disposed of about 2.3 percent of its June 30 , 2009 foreign currency assets or about $ 7 billion worth , expressed in dollars .
These assets grew tenfold between 1998 and 2007 , and by only 20 percent since then .
RBI ’s gold reserves , at market value , were 3.85 percent of the total foreign currency assets before the purchase .
They jumped by 60 percent .
They become about 6.3 percent of the new lower amount of foreign currency assets .
We do n’t know how many dollar assets RBI disposed of as compared with pound and euro assets .
It ’s likely to have been a large amount .
This transaction has a significant meaning that goes well beyond the dollar amounts involved , which are not that large .
It means that a major central bank has actually disposed of dollar assets and prefers gold instead .
It means that it regarded its dollar holdings as excessive .
There are more central banks in the same position .
They may do the same .
China had been suggested again and again as the potential buyer of the 403 tonnes of gold to be offered by the IMF .
India ’s purchase was a surprise .
In financial terms , RBI is not simply adjusting its reserve position .
It is arbitraging .
It has a profit incentive to sell dollars and buy gold .
In a recent article , I suggested the following :
" There is another way to arbitrage the difference between the market price of gold and its ZDV [ Zero Discount Value ] when the market price is less than the ZDV .
Other central banks can borrow dollars , buy gold , and then issue currencies against it .
With these currencies , backed by gold , they can repay the dollar borrowings and still have a profit .
They can gain the arbitrage profits in precisely the same way that the FED might have or that private entrepreneurs might have . "
RBI and other central banks hold dollars whose nominal gold backing is about 15 percent of the FED ’s monetary base liabilities ( currency plus reserves ) .
RBI sells $ 1,000 worth of U.S. securities and gets 1 oz . of gold .
The $ 1,000 that it gives up have only $ 150 worth of gold behind them .
RBI profits by $ 850 .
The article pointed out that this arbitrage is an economic incentive or force for selling of dollars and buying of gold .
RBI has availed itself of this opportunity .
The article observed that foreign central banks and governments , for their own reasons , had spurned this opportunity in the past , thereby maintaining various economic disequilibria :
" MANY foreign central banks have done the opposite .
They sometimes have sold gold .
They have usually accumulated dollars in substantial amounts in the form of dollar loans .
They have not only not competed with the FED and taken advantage of this arbitrage opportunity , they have gone the other way and supported the FED and the U.S. government by their loans .
This was one part of the financial side of government - run economic policies . "
RBI ’s action signals a change in this behavior .
It is a fresh signal , since we already had been given others .
The arbitrage between dollars and gold is so large that it is bound to draw further players into it .
The dollar is on its way to losing its reserve status .
Does India ’s purchase signal a run on the dollar ?
Does it signal a rapid and widespread attempt by major players to divest the dollar in favor of hard assets ?
Not at this time .
Bear in mind that China has already been accumulating hard assets for a few years now .
There is no run on the dollar , but there is a steady movement away from dollars as a reserve asset in the coffers of central banks .
A stroll on the dollar has become a brisk walk on the dollar , and there is a threat that this will become a trot on the dollar .
In economic terms , the end of dollar dominance has momentous implications for the world ’s political and economic arrangements .
Price levels , interest rates , loans , asset prices , production facilities , trade arrangements , and much else all have been put into place based on the dollar as a reserve asset .
Domestic political arrangements , promises , taxes , and programs are involved .
All of these are in for adjustments .
Some serious changes await us .
Even if the changes are smooth and gradual , they are likely to be large .
Large discontinuous changes can not be ruled out .
A dollar overhang is a sword of Damocles hanging over the U.S. government and economy .
If a surplus of dollar securities exists at current prices , then their prices will have to decline .
This will drive U.S. interest rates up .
This has many implications .
For one thing , it will drive the U.S. budget deficit up even further , which in turn will set off untold political actions and reactions .
Dollar overhang is not a new problem .
It goes back to 1971 and earlier .
It has never been solved .
The problem is now far larger than ever before .
If a scramble for new solutions is not already on among economists who are trying to save this system , it will be soon enough .
We can expect to hear new ideas broached , each of which is supposed to resolve the problem .
There are only two kinds of solutions : inflationary and non-inflationary .
A British pound as good as gold is long gone .
A U.S. dollar as good as gold is long gone , but the dollar has hung on for 37 years now .
A yuan as good as gold does not exist .
A basket of currencies as good as gold does not exist .
The inflatable dollar and inflatable currencies are ruling the roost at present .
India ’s action and some of China ’s actions signal that they are inching – really groping – their way back to hard assets and a non-inflationary solution .
China ’s IMF proposal indicates a degree of confusion on her part .
It is at best an attempt to buy time and gain political influence , but it does not address the international monetary problem .
The IMF solution wo n’t work if the SDR is backed up by paper currencies or is a paper currency basket .
There is no way that all the central banks can offload their dollar reserves on the IMF .
What good will it do to receive another paper credit , the Special Drawing Right ( SDR ) in return ?
It especially wo n’t work if the IMF is selling gold reserves , for that weakens the backing for its supra-national currency , which is the SDR .
RBI ’s purchase shows that at least one central bank is not waiting for such a " solution . "
It prefers gold .
The world ’s State - controlled money system based on the dollar has built up serious and embedded economic imbalances or disequilibria .
They are what lay beneath the stock and real estate bubbles and the market crashes of 2008 and 2009 .
They are just beginning to be unwound .
Political and economic statements , trial balloons , conferences , speeches , negotiations , and frictions among the major powers will be the ongoing indications of this process .
So will actions like that of the Reserve Bank of India .
Viewed in this context , U.S. fiscal and monetary policies seem grotesquely out of step with reality .
Yet another bout of massive inflation and debt creation in order to " create " a buoyant economy does nothing to address the basic political economic issues .
While America ponders further socializing health care and further controlling and taxing energy use , it continues to debase its currency .
This used to provide U.S. pressure for other countries to inflate their currencies .
That situation appears to have changed .
It now provides ever - greater incentives to other countries to abandon the dollar and revalue their currencies upwards against the dollar and gold .
American legislators have not yet woken up to this fact , which entails serious changes in U.S. domestic and foreign policies .

Do Crocs really look like Porsches ?
They do , at least according to the luxury car - maker .
Footnoted found an interesting item in a CROX SEC filing , showing that the German car - maker is suing the self - styled ugly footwear company over the " Cayman " trademark :
On May 11 , 2009 , Crocs Europe B.V. received a letter from Dr. Ing. H.c.F. Porsche AG ( ” Porsche ” ) claiming that the Company ’s use of the “ Cayman ” shoe model designator infringes upon their Community Trademark Registration of the mark “ CAYMAN ” in class 25 .
Porsche is requesting that Crocs Europe B.V. immediately cease and desist use of the Cayman mark and pay Porsche ’s attorney ’s fees in conjunction with the issuance of the notice letter .
On July 30 , 2009 the Company was served with notice of an injunction against Crocs Europe BV ’s use of the Cayman mark in Germany .
Crocs is already in plenty of financial trouble .

Oct. 1 , 2009 -- Scientists have discovered a gene that may affect longevity and leanness .
That gene is called S6K1 .
In lab tests , the typical life span of mice lacking the S6K1 gene was 9 % longer and the maximum life span was 10 % longer than mice with that gene intact .
Knocking out the S6K1 gene only affected longevity in female mice ; the reasons for that are n't clear from the study , which appears in the Oct. 2 edition of Science .
Female mice without the S6K1 gene also were leaner than female mice that have that gene , regardless of how much they ate , note the researchers , who included Colin Selman , PhD , of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland .
Selman worked on the study while at University College London .
Selman 's team also notes that mice lacking the S6K1 gene were " smaller than their littermates throughout their lives " but were healthy and were n't dwarfs .
The results seen by deleting the S6K1 gene mimic the anti-aging effects of caloric restriction seen in lab tests on animals -- but without dieting , Selman and colleagues observed .
The researchers conclude that thwarting the S6K1 gene might lead to treatments for aging - related diseases .
However , they have n't studied the gene in people .

Donate a coat , see Public Enemy up close
By David Malitz
Donate a jacket to charity and you could be this close to Chuck D and Flava Flav when Public Enemy plays at Lisner Auditorium on Nov. 18 .
( Kyle Gustafson / For The Washington Post )
One of the highlights of August 's Virgin Mobile FreeFest was the set turned in by rap pioneers Public Enemy .
Said me , at the time : " [ the band ] , led by outspoken frontman Chuck D , turned fiery polemics such as ' Fight the Power ' and ' Welcome to the Terrordome ' into hand - waving hits .
The presence of Flavor Flav lent the set an air of lightness ; for all his shenanigans on VH1 , he remains the definitive hip - hop hype man . "
Public Enemy returns to the area on Wednesday , Nov. 18 for a show at Lisner Auditiorium .
It 's a benefit show for Sasha Bruce House , a non-profit shelter for homeless youth in Washington , D.C.
As an added incentive for concertgoers , if you donate a new or gently used coat , you get an upgrade to VIP seats in the first few rows .
Buy advance tickets from the 9:30 club box office , bring a coat to donate at that time , and the seat upgrade is automatic ; bring a coat to the venue and the VIP tickets will be given out on a first - come , first - served basis .
All donated coats will be given to homeless teens in D.C .

If humans are genetically related to chimps , why did our brains develop the innate ability for language and speech while theirs did not ?
Scientists suspect that part of the answer to the mystery lies in a gene called FOXP2 .
When mutated , FOXP2 can disrupt speech and language in humans .
Now , a UCLA / Emory study reveals major differences between how the human and chimp versions of FOXP2 work , perhaps explaining why language is unique to humans .
Published Nov. 11 in the online edition of the journal Nature , the findings provide insight into the evolution of the human brain and may point to possible drug targets for human disorders characterized by speech disruption , such as autism and schizophrenia .
" Earlier research suggests that the amino - acid composition of human FOXP2 changed rapidly around the same time that language emerged in modern humans , " said Dr. Daniel Geschwind , Gordon and Virginia MacDonald Distinguished Chair in Human Genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" Ours is the first study to examine the effect of these amino - acid substitutions in FOXP2 in human cells .
" We showed that the human and chimp versions of FOXP2 not only look different but function differently too , " said Geschwind , who is currently a visiting professor at the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London .
" Our findings may shed light on why human brains are born with the circuitry for speech and language and chimp brains are not . "
FOXP2 switches other genes on and off .
Geschwind 's lab scoured the genome to determine which genes are targeted by human FOXP2 .
The team used a combination of human cells , human tissue and post - mortem brain tissue from chimps that died of natural causes .

The chimp brain dissections were performed in the laboratory of coauthor Todd Preuss , associate research professor of neuroscience at Emory University 's Yerkes National Primate Research Center .
The scientists focused on gene expression -- the process by which a gene 's DNA sequence is converted into cellular proteins .
To their surprise , the researchers discovered that the human and chimp forms of FOXP2 produce different effects on gene targets in the human cell lines .
" We found that a significant number of the newly identified targets are expressed differently in human and chimpanzee brains , " Geschwind said .
" This suggests that FOXP2 drives these genes to behave differently in the two species . "
The research demonstrates that mutations believed to be important to FOXP2's evolution in humans change how the gene functions , resulting in different gene targets being switched on or off in human and chimp brains .

" Genetic changes between the human and chimp species hold the clues for how our brains developed their capacity for language , " said first author Genevieve Konopka , a postdoctoral fellow in neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" By pinpointing the genes influenced by FOXP2 , we have identified a new set of tools for studying how human speech could be regulated at the molecular level . "
The discovery will provide insight into the evolution of humans ' ability to learn through the use of higher cognitive skills , such as perception , intuition and reasoning .
" This study demonstrates how critical chimps and macaques are for studying humans , " noted Preuss .
" They open a window into understanding how we evolved into who we are today . "
Because speech problems are common to both autism and schizophrenia , the new molecular pathways will also shed light on how these disorders disturb the brain 's ability to process language .
The National Institute of Mental Health , the A.P. Giannini Foundation and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression funded the study .
The UCLA coauthors included Jamee Bomar , Giovanni Coppola , Fuying Gao , Zophonias Jonsson , Sophia Peng , Kellen Winden and James Wohlschlegel .
Sir Hugh wants police independence retained Police chiefs in England and Wales may quit if a Conservative government forced directly elected commissioners on them , Sir Hugh Orde has said .
Sir Hugh , head of the chief constables ' association , told the BBC police independence was " absolutely critical " .
The Tories want elected officials with powers to hire or fire police chiefs , set budgets and policing priorities .
But Sir Hugh said any idea the police were under " political influence " could undermine democracy .
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the Conservatives had made clear they would not be deflected from their plans , although they are still consulting on the details .
Setting budgets
At last year 's party conference the Tories outlined some proposals , saying rather than being " directed by and accountable to the home secretary " they wanted chief constables to be accountable to local people .
They outlined plans for police commissioners - civilian workers who would set the police budget , appoint and dismiss chief constables and set local policing priorities in England and Wales .
I would not be surprised to see chief officers not want to be part of a system where they can be told how to deliver policing
Sir Hugh Orde , Acpo president
Send us your comments
But Sir Hugh , the former chief constable of Northern Ireland who took over as head of the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) this year , said colleagues would resist being told how to protect the public by locally - elected leaders .
In an interview for BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , Sir Hugh said : " Even the perception that the police service of this country is under any political influence , I think that suggests you cannot argue that you are a proper democratic society .
It 's as simple and as stark as that .
" Every chief officer fully understands the need to be held accountable .
" We must be operationally independent in terms of how we deliver policing .
We should not be influenced by anyone who has any potential or suggestion for a political basis . "
No votes Sir Hugh suggested the Conservative plans would be a resigning issue .
" I would not be surprised to see chief officers not want to be part of a system where they can be told how to deliver policing , " said Sir Hugh .
" There will be no votes in protecting people from terrorism , from organised crime and from serial rapists that cross the country because they wo n't be local and they wo n't get you votes . "
We are faced with the very real prospect of police chief resignations under Conservative plans to politicise the police
Alan Johnson
Home Secretary
It follows a row over the resignation of Metropolitan Police head Sir Ian Blair , who blamed Conservative mayor of London Boris Johnson for forcing him out .
Labour had considered introducing directly elected police authorities - which scrutinise forces and set policing priorities - in England and Wales .
But the government dropped the plan last December - then home secretary Jacqui Smith said she feared they would become politicised .
' OK Corral ' On Friday Home Secretary Alan Johnson called on the Conservatives to withdraw their commitment , saying : " We are faced with the very real prospect of police chief resignations under Conservative plans to politicise the police . "
He added : " It must be clear that chief officers , and chief officers alone , are responsible for running their force . "
And Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " The last thing British police need is an elected sheriff leading the shootout at the OK Corral .
" Accountability must come from a broad - based police authority elected to represent all strands of the local community . "
The Conservatives declined to comment on Sir Hugh 's interview .
Sir Hugh said all the political parties were too closely focused on the number of officers on the beat to grasp the need for fundamental reforms to how police are organised .
He said the majority of chief officers wanted to replace the current 44 forces with larger regional ones better placed to tackle major investigations including terrorism , serious organised crime and internet - based fraud .

Yesterday , I excitedly preordered Barnes & Noble 's " Nook " ebook reader .
Today , I cancelled the order -- and I 'm none to happy about it .
Why ca n't Barnes & Noble learn from its past mistakes ?
The bookseller 's digital titles are way overpriced -- at least compared to Amazon ( Sony charges even more than both booksellers for many titles ) .
Quick examples -- and more will come later in this post : Twilight by Stephanie Meyer : $ 6.59 from Amazon ; $ 8.79 from B&N. Philip K Dick 's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep ? : $ 8.38 from Amazon ; $ 11.20 from B&N . ( Sony charges $ 9.89 for the first and $ 9 for the second . )
Barnes & Noble has been down this sordid path before .
Ten years ago , B&N was an early ebook pioneer , opening a store using Microsoft Reader technology .
But the bookseller had the pricing all wrong , asking the same price for digital -- for which there was no printing or distribution costs -- as hardcover books .
That 's right , and the ebooks came with onerous DRM that made sharing titles nearly impossible .
Advertisement
For years , I criticized B&N and other ebook sellers for overpricing that stalled adoption .
Eventually , Barnes & Noble closed its ebook store .
Here 's the epitaph I wrote in September 2003 on the now defunct Microsoft Monitor Weblog once run by JupiterResearch ( Forrester Research has absorbed the analyst firm ) :
This morning I received a notice from Barnes & Noble.com informing that as of today , the company would no longer offer ebooks online .
Customers like me have 90 days to retrieve titles from their online Microsoft Library ; 90 days from purchase for Adobe ebook customers .
I purchased my first Microsoft Reader ebook about four years ago , and , unless I am mistaken , from Barnes & Noble.com .
The company offered an excellent ebook library and facilities for downloading titles .
I will sorely miss the service .
The larger question is what Barnes & Noble. com 's exit means for the larger ebook market .
Maybe I 'm a nut , but I find reading an ebook on my HP iPaq handheld to be quite enjoyable .
Still , publishers could have done more to make the price of titles more appealing .
Who wants to pay 25 bucks for a new ebook , the same as the hardcover price ?
That hardcover book has associated printing and distribution costs that should n't affect ebook pricing .
The hardcover can be passed around among family members or borrowed by the neighbor across the street .
The ebook version is much less portable , so why charge so much ?
I do n't see the ebook market as dead , but Barnes & Noble.com 's bowing out of the market is n't a good sign .
I remember when the bookseller championed for good writers without big - name publishers or offered print - on - demand services that could revive out - of - print editions .
Maybe we 're just not a nation of leisure readers anymore , which would be the sadest commentary on this development yet .
Four years would pass before Amazon showed enough cunning and courage to release the Kindle reader and reasonably priced ebooks .
Kindle has got to be the ugliest ebook reader on the planet .
It 's styling matches what I imagine an Amazon warehouse to look like .
But the ebooks are priced to sell , and that 's the appeal .
Price matters -- a principle Amazon has long and successfully practiced .
Apple applied the principle to iTunes Music Store in 2003 , by offering 99 - cent singles .
Kindle reader is n't the revolution so much as Kindle book pricing .
Why does n't Barnes & Noble get that ?
Pricing turned me away from an ebook reader that is really exciting ( more on the device in a few paragraphs ) .
Some more comparisons :
In my searches , I only found a few a newer or popular titles were Amazon and B&N matched prices , such as Dan Brown 's The Lost Symbol or The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants by Ann Brashares .
But the for majority of my searches , Amazon titles cost considerably less than those from Barnes & Noble .
My searches were random , and some I abandoned because Amazon had many ebook titles not available from Barnes & Noble .
I 'm not quibbling pennies here .
Barnes & Noble pricing is as much as 50 percent more than Amazon .
I found few instances where the difference was less than 10 percent .
Barnes &
Noble may not be asking as much as it did during its 1999 - 2003 foray into ebooks , but pricing is way too high -- particularly for a bookseller playing catchup .
Amazon has got an early mass - market ebook lead .
Competitive ebook pricing would be crucial to winning over people to Nook .
Barnes & Noble appears to be betting on the device as the bigger draw .
No question , Nook is cool .
It 's well designed , competitively priced and likely more extensible because of the Android operating system .
From the broadest strategy perspective , Barnes & Noble is preparing an ebook and content publishing platform as much as a simple digital book reader .
That 's impressive .
But can the device be enough when ebook pricing is so much higher ?
For me , the answer is no .
I suspect that many other potential buyers will balk at higher pricing , too .
I ask you , Betanews readers , to offer your opinions in comments .
Is Barnes & Noble asking too much ?
Are you even interested in ebooks ( I ask mainly because of DRM ) ?
In fairness , Barnes & Noble learned a few lessons from its past ebook selling mistakes , and these are worth observing .
The first effort came from the Barnes & Noble.com Website , at a time when fewer people were online .
The new strategy looks to leverage the physical stores , which makes sense .
For example , Nook will be sold at Barnes & Noble stores .
Something else :
The bookseller is addressing longstanding criticisms of onerous DRM by allowing customers to lend their ebooks for as long as 14 days .
The difference between Kindle and Nook is the difference between the approach of a real bookseller versus a warehouser .
Barnes & Noble is trying to anticipate the needs of the reading customer .
Use of physical stores and ebook lending are great examples of Barnes & Noble leveraging its strengths and anticipating what its customers want .
But do those needs include paying as much as 50 percent more for ebooks than Amazon ?
You tell me .
That 's what comments are for .

On Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit _______________________
BRIEF OF THE SOFTWARE FREEDOM LAW CENTER AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT _______________________
Much of the world ’s most important and most commercially significant software is distributed under copyright licensing terms that give recipients freedom to copy , modify and redistribute the software ( “ free software ” ) ..
One could not send or receive e-mail , surf the World Wide Web , perform a Google search or take advantage of many of the other benefits offered by the Internet without free software .
Indeed , this brief was written entirely with free software word processors , namely OpenOffice , GNU Emacs and LATEX , each of which are not just competitive with or superior to non-free software programs , but which also provide their users with the freedom to improve the program to fit their needs and reflect their desires .
The Software Freedom Law Center ( “ SFLC ” ) is a not - for - profit legal services organization that provides legal representation and other law - related services to protect and advance free software .
SFLC provides pro bono legal services to non-profit free software developers and also helps the general public better understand the legal aspects of free software .
SFLC has an interest in this matter because the decision of this Court will have a significant effect on the rights of the free software developers and users SFLC represents .
More specifically , SFLC has an interest in ensuring that limits are maintained on the reach of patent law so that Free and Open Source software development is not unreasonably and unnecessarily impeded .
Summary of Argument
In Microsoft v. AT&T , this Court recognized that “ [ a ] bstract software code [ uninstalled in a machine ] is an idea without physical embodiment . ” 550 U.S. 437 , 449( 2007 ) .
The court below correctly decided that , on the basis of this Court ’s prior holdings , such abstract ideas without physical embodiment cannot be the subject of a statutory patent monopoly .
Software standing alone cannot be patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101 , because , as this Court has repeatedly recognized in an unbroken series of cases extending over more than 130 years , “ An idea of itself is not patentable . ” Rubber - Tip Pencil v. Howard , 87 U.S. ( 20 Wall . ) 498 , 507 ( 1874 ) .
The court below correctly held , therefore , that the Patent Act should be interpreted so that computer software can contribute to the claims of a patent only to the extent that this software is combined with a special - purpose machine or is used in a “ process ” that transforms matter , like the rubber undergoing vulcanization in Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 ( 1981 ) .
The Federal Circuit ’s conclusion on this point is the only outcome consistent with the prior teachings of this Court .
It also represents the outcome best calculated to produce maximum innovation in the production of computer software under contemporary technical conditions .
Any other holding would not only breach the line previously established by the decisions of this Court between patentable art and processes on the one hand and abstract ideas or facts of nature on the other — in doing so it would also raise grave constitutional issues under the analysis set forth by this Court in Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 ( 2003 ) .
I. Software Is Algorithms For Computers
In Human Readable Terms , And Is Therefore Not Patentable , As This Court Has Repeatedly Held
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held below that the presence of a particular machine or apparatus or the transformation of a particular article into a different state or thing turns the abstract ideas expressed by a computer program code into a “ process ” within the meaning of the Act .
This conclusion correctly follows from this Court ’s prior holdings .
This Court has repeatedly held that subject matter which would have the practical effect of preempting laws of nature , abstract ideas or mathematical algorithms is ineligible for patent protection .
Further , in Microsoft v. AT&T you also stated that abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment and is merely information — a detailed set of instructions .
A computer program , no matter what its function , is nothing more or less than the representation of an algorithm .
It is not conceptually different from a list of steps written down with pencil and paper for execution by a human being .
In no uncertain terms , this Court in Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63 ( 1972 ) , held that software , which contains and upon command executes algorithms that solve mathematical problems through the use of a computer , was not patentable under § 101 .
Thus , software standing alone , without the presence of a special purpose machine or the act of transforming a particular article into a different state or thing is merely information , a representation of an algorithm or algorithms , and not a “ process ” within the meaning of this Act .
Confronted with the rise of new technologies , this Court has addressed the issue of patentable subject matter several times .
Benson , 409 U.S. 63 ; Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 584 ( 1978 ) ; Diamond v. Chakrabarty , 447 U.S. 303 ( 1980 ) ; Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 ( 1981 ) .
Since before the Civil War , this Court has consistently made it clear that subject matter which would have the practical effect of preempting laws of nature , abstract ideas or mathematical algorithms is ineligible for patent protection .
O’Reilly v. Morse , 56 U.S. ( 15 How . ) 62 , 113 ( 1854 ) ; Benson , 409 U.S. at 71 .
These cases effectively establish a clear boundary of ineligibility for patent protection to safeguard the fundamental constitutional requirement that laws of nature , abstract ideas , mathematical propositions and algorithms be left unrestrained by patents .
This Court stated in Flook that to be eligible for patent protection , “ [ a ] process itself , not merely the mathematical algorithm , must be new and useful . ”
437 U.S. at 591 , observing also that it is “ incorrect [ to ] assume [ ] that if a process application implements a principle in some specific fashion , it automatically falls within the patentable subject matter of § 101 ... . ” 437 U.S. at 593 .
Such an assumption , the Court said , is based on an impermissibly narrow interpretation of prior cases , including specifically Benson , and is “ untenable ” because “ [ i] t would make the determination of patentable subject matter depend simply on the draftsman ’s art and would ill serve the principles underlying the prohibition against patents for ‘ ideas ’ or phenomena of nature . ”
Id .
In alignment with Benson and Flook , this Court ’s decision in Diamond v. Diehr held that structures or processes must , when considered as a whole , perform functions intended to be covered by patent law in order to be eligible for patent protection .
450 U.S. at 192 .
Diehr followed and upheld the core holdings of both Benson and Flook .
Id. at 191 –193 ( “ [o ] ur reasoning in Flook is in no way inconsistent with our reasoning here ” ) .
Benson , Flook , Diehr , and the other decisions of this Court regarding patentable subject matter consistently established that the inquiry into whether subject matter is eligible for patenting is one of substance , not form .
This Court requires that one look not simply at the language of the patent claim to see if it recites a structure of multiple steps or components , but also at the practical effect of the claim to see if it in fact covers — or otherwise would restrict the public ’s access to — a principle , law of nature , abstract idea , mathematical formula , mental process , algorithm or other abstract intellectual concept .
This substantive standard ensures that skilled patent draftsmanship is not capable of overcoming one of the core doctrines of patent law recognized by this Court for more than 150 years that “ [ a ] principle , in the abstract , is a fundamental truth ; an original cause ; a motive ; these cannot be patented , as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right . ”
Le Roy v. Tatham , 55 U.S. ( 14 How . ) 156 , 175 ( 1853 ) ; Funk Bros. , 333 U.S. 127 , 130 ( 1948 ) ; Benson , 409 U.S. at 67 ( “ [ p ] henomena of nature , though just discovered , mental processes , and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable , as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work ” ) .
Despite the arguments made by Petitioners and their amici to the contrary , this Court has clearly and unambiguously limited the scope of patentable subject matter to exclude software from its ambit in the most definite terms .
In Benson , this Court held invalid a software patent directed to a specific application of a generic formulation because “ the mathematical formula involved here has no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital computer , which means that if the judgment below is affirmed , the patent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself . ”
409 U.S. at 71 –72 .
The holding of Benson is properly applicable to all software , because a computer program , no matter what its function , is neither more nor less than the representation of one or more algorithms .
Further , just as claiming fifty — or even a thousand — laws of nature is no more patentable than claiming a single law of nature , no form of software , regardless of how many algorithms or formulas it comprises , is patentable :
It will always be merely and solely made up of algorithms for computers to execute , written down in a form comprehensible to human beings for them to study and expand upon .
This Court ’s decision in Diehr is not to the contrary .
It followed the teaching of Benson , and determined that the invention there claimed was not substantially the software , but rather the totality of an “ industrial process for the molding of rubber products , ” which is undeniably included within the realm of patentable subject matter .
450 U.S. at 191–93 .
Had the applicant sought to claim the software used in that process by itself , however , this Court would have most assuredly found it to be unpatentable subject matter just as it had in Benson .
In Diehr , this Court observed : When a claim recites a mathematical formula ( or scientific principle or phenomenon of nature ) , an inquiry must be made into whether the claim is seeking patent protection for that formula in the abstract .
A mathematical formula as such is not accorded the protection of patent laws , and this principle cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment .
450 U.S. at 191 ( internal citation omitted ) .
This result — which makes software describing a portion of the solution to a practical problem unpatentable on its own , outside the real - world context of the problem and its solution — is not only in accord with the rest of this Court ’s patent jurisprudence , it is also the best way to protect innovation in software and the only way that fully comports with both Article I , Section 8 and the First Amendment .
II .
Excluding Software From Patentable Subject Matter Maximizes Innovation In Software
If mathematics were patentable , there would be less mathematical innovation .
Only those who were rich enough to pay royalties , or who benefited from subsidization by government , or who were willing to sign over the value of their ideas to someone richer and more powerful than themselves , would be permitted access to the world of abstract mathematical ideas .
Theorems build upon theorems , and so the contributions of those who could not pay rent — and all the further improvements based upon those contributions — would be lost .
For more than a quarter century , beginning with a few stalwart thinkers and exponentially increasing in size and influence , a movement to build computer software by sharing — treating software programming languages like mathematical notation , for the expression of abstract ideas to be studied , improved , and shared again — has revolutionized the production of software around the world .
The “ free software movement , ” believes , like this Court , that computer software expresses abstract ideas , and therefore concludes that the ideas themselves will grow best if left most free to be learned and improved by all .
It has attracted hundreds of thousands , soon millions of programmers around the world to the making of new and innovative software through the social process that for centuries has been the heart of Western science : “ share and share alike . ”
Free software , often referred to by commercial entities as “ open source software , ” to prevent confusion between the social freedom of its making and the price at which they sell copies , has become the single most influential body of software around the world .
Free software operating systems now power everything from cellphones to home appliances to supercomputer clusters .
There is no major or minor computer hardware architecture , no class of consumer electronics , no form of network hardware connecting humanity ’s telephone calls , video streams , or anything else transpiring in the network of networks we call “ the Internet ” that does n’t include free software .
The most important innovations in human society during the last decade , the World Wide Web and the Wikipedia , were based on and are now dominated by free software and the idea of free knowledge sharing it represents .
This explosion of technical innovation has occurred for two primary reasons .
First , the principle rule of free software , the required sharing of computer program source code , has allowed young people around the world to learn and apply their skills by studying and improving real software doing real jobs in their own and others ’ daily lives .
This process has enabled the incremental improvement of the art by everyone , rather than by the necessarily small number of programmers working for any one firm with proprietary control of source code .
Second , by creating a “ protected commons ” for the free exchange of ideas embodied in program source code , the free software copyright licensing structure has enabled cooperative interactions among competing firms : each firm has been assured of permanent continuing access to the improvements in program code made by all other firms , which were required to make the source code of those improvements freely available to all users .
Thus firms were able to increase their levels of investment in cooperative production , and were able to exchange ideas with academic researchers , secure in the knowledge that those investments would not be appropriated by others claiming exclusive rights .
The principle that innovation is made possible by the free exchange of ideas is not recent , and is not limited to software .
Indeed , our constitutional system of free expression since Thomas Jefferson is based on the recognition that control of ideas by power has never produced more ideas than their free and unrestricted circulation .
The history of western science since the 17th century is one long testament to this truth , and it is that very history which gave rise to the patent system , whose exclusion of “ abstract ideas , ” “ facts of nature , ” and “ algorithms ” is as much as recognition of the principle as is the basic constitutional policy of offering temporary legal benefits in return for prompt and complete disclosure of technological discoveries to the public .
This Court has recognized the growth and innovation in the software industry in the absence of patent protection .
In Benson , this Court noted that “ the creation of programs has undergone substantial and satisfactory growth in the absence of patent protection and that copyright protection for programs is presently available . ”
409 U.S. at 72 ( quoting “ To Promote the Progress of . . . Useful Arts , ” Report of the President ’s Commission on the Patent System ( 1966 ) ) .
A few years later , in Diehr , the Court observed that “ [ n] otwithstanding fervent argument that patent protection is essential for the growth of the software industry , commentators have noted that ‘ this industry is growing by leaps and bounds without it . ’ ” 450 U.S. at 217 ( internal citations omitted ) .
Recent empirical data also suggests that software patents actually stifle innovation instead of promoting it .
See J. Bessen and M. Meurer , Do Patents Perform Like Property ? , Academy of Management Perspectives , pp. 8 –20 ( Aug. 2008 ) ( “ The direct comparison of estimated net incentives suggests that for public firms in most industries today , patents may actually discourage investment in innovation . ” )
III .
The First Amendment Prohibits Construing The Patent Act To Permit The Patenting Of Abstract Ideas
This Court held in Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186 ( 2003 ) , that the First Amendment precludes the extension of statutory monopolies to abstract ideas .
Eldred , 537 U.S. at 219 .
As you there said , the near - simultaneous adoption of the Patent and Copyright Clause and the First Amendment indicates that these laws are fundamentally compatible .
This compatibility , however , depends on a construction of the patent and copyright laws that preserves First Amendment principles , including the freedom to communicate any “ idea , theory , and fact . ”
Id .
Eldred identified two mechanisms in copyright law that are necessary to accommodate this principle .
First , the idea / expression dichotomy limits copyright ’s monopoly to an author ’s expression , leaving ideas “ instantly available for public exploitation . ”
Id .
Second , the fair use doctrine allows the public to use even copyrighted expression for some purposes , “ such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ... , scholarship , or research . ”
Id. at 220 .
Patent statutes , which depend on the same constitutional grant of authority as copyright statutes are similarly limited by the First Amendment .
See Eldred , 537 U.S. at 201 ( “ Because the Clause empowering Congress to confer copyrights also authorizes patents , congressional practice with respect to patents informs our inquiry . ” ) .
The presence of an unwavering exemption for abstract ideas reconciles patent law with the First Amendment in a fashion similar to the idea / expression dichotomy ’s crucial role in reconciling copyright and freedom of speech .
The presence of a limiting principle is even more necessary with respect to patent law than with respect to copyright , because , as you observed in Eldred , “ the grant of a patent ... prevent [s ] full use by others of the inventor ’s knowledge . ”
537 U.S. at 217 ( emphasis added ) ( internal citation omitted ) .
Patents can and do limit the application of knowledge to produce a new machine or to transform an article into a different state or thing , but they cannot constitutionally limit the communication of knowledge or ideas .
Eldred teaches that , without this limitation , determining the scope of patent eligibility in each individual case would raise First Amendment questions of great difficulty .
Patent law also recognizes no analogue to fair use , previously described by this Court as the second bulkwark of constitutional harmony between copyright and free expression .
537 U.S. at 219-220 .
The absence of any provision for fair use substantially increases the constitutional difficulty when patents are sought and granted for expressions of abstract ideas .
Therefore , patents on software standing alone , which could be infringed by the dissemination of computer program source code as well as by the execution of such code by a special - purpose tool or in the course of an industrial process with a material result , disturb the “ definitional balance ” between the First Amendment and the Patent Act.
Eldred , 537 U.S. at 219 .
In its unprocessed source code form , software is merely the expression of abstract ideas in human language — a description of a sequence of steps that will produce a particular result ( i.e. an “ algorithm ” ) .
The source code of a program which performs the steps described in a software patent is distinguishable from the literal patent only in that it expresses the same steps in a different language .
Therefore , since anyone may copy or publish the actual patent without infringing , it must also be permissible to communicate its claims in source code form .
The sharing of source code is also essential to “ scholarship and comment , ” two categories of speech recognized in Eldred and Harper & Row , Publishers v. Nation Enters . , 471 U.S. 539 , 560 ( 1985 ) , as particular First Amendment concerns .
Computer science textbooks , for example , rely heavily on source code and pseudo - code to communicate concepts and describe useful algorithms .
See , e.g. , Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie , The C Programming Language ( Prentice Hall 1978 ) .
Likewise , computer science students are often required to express their answers to test questions in a real or hypothetical programming language .
And without the use of source code , it is difficult for developers to comment on whether an idea can be implemented , to comment on an algorithm ’s performance , or to suggest improvements .
Moreover , First Amendment concerns cannot be avoided by exempting source code and limiting patent protection to software which has been converted to executable form , or which has actually been executed .
Recent rulings , such as the Federal Circuit ’s decision in Metabolite Labs , Inc. v. Laborator Corp. of Am. Holdings , 370 F.3d 1354 ( Fed. Cir. 2004 ) , cert .
dismissed , 548 U.S. 124 ( 2006 ) , demonstrate that secondary liability would still restrict the communication of ideas expressed in source code .
In Metabolite , a medical testing laboratory was successfully sued for inducement to patent infringement for telling doctors what steps to take to correlate the presence of amino acids in body fluids with a vitamin deficiency .
370 F.3d at 1358 .
Once communicating the content of a patent to doctors is held inducement to patent infringement , constitutionally - protected communication among programmers will inevitably be chilled .
This result would be a restriction on the expression of abstract ideas .
The court below correctly interpreted the Act to avoid this dubious outcome , by requiring more than an abstract expression of an idea : either a machine specially adapted to the implementation of that idea , or a transformation of the physical environment mediated or controlled by software .
Any other construction of the statute would raise serious constitutional questions .
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons , the decision below should be affirmed .
Respectfully submitted .

Still looking on the bright side of life : Monty Python crew reunite for 40th anniversary
They were n't expecting the Spanish Inquisition - but the crew of Monty Python were more than happy to answer questions from their fans as they reunited for their 40th anniversary last night .
The five surviving members of the cast - complete with a cardboard cut - out of dead member Graham Chapman - were honoured with a BAFTA Special Award to mark the four decades since their unique brand of humour first hit TV screens .
And , as they made light - hearted jokes about each other , there was no sign of the the tensions that have reportedly existed within the group .
Reunion :
The five surviving members of Monty Python get together on U.S. TV to celebrate their 40th anniversary .
They also brought the late Graeme Chapman as a cardboard cut- out
As they were : A publicity picture released in 1969 shows bottom from left : Terry Jones , John Cleese and Michael Palin .
Top from left : Graham Chapman , Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam
The five members - John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones and Michael Palin - appeared relaxed in each others ' company and said they were happy to be together again .
The official reason for the reunion at New York 's Ziegfield Theatre was a special showing of a new documentary chronicling the life of Python .
Six hours of footage and interviews from Monty Python : Almost the Truth ( The Lawyer 's Cut ) is due to be aired in six installments from October 18 , coinciding with the anniversary .
Ladies in red : Carol Cleveland , a regular Python contributor , and Trudie Styler , producer and wife of Sting , attended the event in New York
After an abridged version was shown to an enthusiastic audience , the surviving members , plus the cardboard Chapman , took to the stage to answer questions .
As Cleese , Gilliam , Idle , Jones and Palin rifled through the cards handed to them , suspicions were soon raised that they were not taking proceedings entirely seriously .
Indeed , when Cleese asked a second question that called into question Michael Palin 's career choices it was clear that the Pythons were determined to replace legitimate questions with good - humoured gags at each others ' expense .
Outstanding contribution :
The actors ( L - R ) Michael Palin , John Cleese , Terry Jones , Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle received a Bafta Special Award
Gilliam read a card that reportedly asked : ' Why is n't John funny anymore ? ' with Palin quickly chipping in : ' I was just trying out my pen . '
Aside from the new documentary , the Pythons had gathered to receive a BAFTA Special Award for Outstanding Contribution to Film and TV .
As they did so , they received a stranding ovation from the audience .
During his comments following the release of Nintendo 's recent financials , company President Satoru Iwata laid out the connectivity rates for the Wii and DS in Japan .
According to Nintendo's numbers 30 percent of Wii owners are currently connecting their Wii to the internet and only 20 percent of DS owners are doing it .
The numbers spike whenever a big online game is released for either system or whenever new online functions are released , but Iwata says that the company must take more aggressive action or those numbers will drop .
Despite Iwata 's claim that Nintendo is truly interested in its system 's online functionality ( and their work to sponsor wireless hot spots in places like McDonald's )
Iwata does not think that digital distribution of games will be playing a big role in the gaming market for quite some time .
He reinforced his opinion that while he does see digital distribution as a means to provide additional internet - driven software features he does not see it as a dominant delivery method for games any time soon .
" " In 20 years or so , I might say it will have probably changed , " Iwata said while discussing the possible shift to digital distribution .
" But in 5 years or so , I do not totally agree .
... Habits of life do not change [ so ] radically and quickly . "
He is , of course , right .
Even I , a technologically advanced person of a young age , am having trouble letting go of physical retail .
Imagine what a member of Nintendo's new " expanded audience " feels when they 're offered a game without a box or disc .

This is something very special from " The American Thinker , " which has been on a quite a tear of late .
The Problem , as editor J.R. Dunn spells it out , is that the left just loves terrorism , and terrorists , and thinks that MASS DEATH is just , meh , another one of those things that happens .
" This is a historically unique situation , " he says , completely different from all those other historical situations in which the left could " never be truly patriotic in the real sense , " you know , in the sense of getting yourself up in a star - spangled wetsuit and whacking it to some picture of a demure Betsy Ross in three - quarters profile til you 're red , and then blue , and then white in the face .
( Auto - patriotic asphyxiation ? )
Or whatever it is J.R.
Dunn does to express his love of country .
Ahem .
Dunn ( no relation to Anita , we presume ) goes on : " Never before would effective treason by a large minority have been tolerated , particularly involving such crucial sectors as media , academia , and education . "
So please , oh please , tell us about what our forefathers would have done to solve this problem of people who love terror , we 're all thinking , Americanly .
So how do we respond ?
We 'll pause here to allow the loud cry of " Hang ‘em all ! " to roll over us and commend everyone involved for their enthusiasm , if not their prescription .
But what we need , though perhaps not as final , is something effective and workable within with contemporary social norms .
Yes , contemporary social norms you say , this is a good strategy , even if it 's a not - quite - final solution .
Usually wingnuts are content to stand athwart 1863 yelling stop !
but every now and again they venture into contemporary methods of elimination , which is how they stay relevant .
To wit : " We yank drunk drivers out of cars ; we must also yank leftists out of the public sphere . "
And then : " The second step is to identify them .
Call them out by name , relentlessly and repeatedly . "
If you 're Michelle Malkin , call them out by name , address , place of employment , place of elementary - schooling , whatever .
And then " do n't bring a knife to a gun fight . "
This would be sound advice if Dunn or his audience knew what a gun fight looked like .
But finally , there 's the third step which is to " target them , isolate them and render them harmless . "
Ohmigod , let us all be very afraid of the little American
Thinkers threatening to terrorize the nation at some point , when they get around to it , to save it from terrorists .
Methinks J.R. Dunn has consumed too much tea at those parties .
By George Friedman U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has decided that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be tried in federal court in New York .
Holder 's decision was driven by the need for the U.S. government to decide how to dispose of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , a U.S. Naval base outside the boundaries of the United States selected as the camp in which to hold suspected al Qaeda members .
We very carefully use the word " camp " rather than prison or prisoner of war camp .
This is because of an ongoing and profound ambiguity not only in U.S. government perceptions of how to define those held there , but also due to uncertainties in international law , particularly with regard to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 .
Were the U.S. facility at Guantanamo a prison , then its residents would be criminals .
If it were a POW camp , then they would be enemy soldiers being held under the rules of war .
It has never really been decided which these men are , and therefore their legal standing has remained unclear .
War vs. Criminal Justice
The ambiguity began shortly after 9/11 , when then - U.S. President George W. Bush defined two missions : waging a war on terror , and bringing Osama bin Laden and his followers to justice .
Both made for good rhetoric .
But they also were fundamentally contradictory .
A war is not a judicial inquiry , and a criminal investigation is not part of war .
An analogy might be drawn from Pearl Harbor .
Imagine that in addition to stating that the United States was at war with Japan , Franklin Roosevelt also called for bringing the individual Japanese pilots who struck Hawaii to justice under American law .
This would make no sense .
As an act of war , the Japanese action fell under the rules of war as provided for in international law , the U.S. Constitution and the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) .
Japanese pilots could not be held individually responsible for the lawful order they received .
In the same sense , trying to bring soldiers to trial in a civilian court in the United States would make no sense .
Creating a mission in which individual Japanese airmen would be hunted down and tried under the rules of evidence not only would make no sense , it would be impossible .
Building a case against them individually also would be impossible .
Judges would rule on evidence , on whether an unprejudiced jury could be found , and so on .
None of this happened , of course — World War II was a war , not a judicial inquiry .
It is important to consider how wars are conducted .
Enemy soldiers are not shot or captured because of what they have done ; they are shot and captured because of who they are — members of an enemy military force .
War , once launched , is pre-emptive .
Soldiers are killed or captured in the course of fighting enemy forces , or even before they have carried out hostile acts .
Soldiers are not held responsible for their actions , but neither are they immune to attack just because they have not done anything .
Guilt and innocence do not enter into the equation .
Certainly , if war crimes are in question , charges may be brought ; the UCMJ determines how they will be tried by U.S. forces .
Soldiers are tried by courts - martial , not by civilian courts , because of their status as soldiers .
Soldiers are tried by a jury of their peers , and their peers are held to be other soldiers .
International law is actually not particularly ambiguous about the status of the members of al Qaeda .
The Geneva Conventions do not apply to them because they have not adhered to a fundamental requirement of the Geneva Conventions , namely , identifying themselves as soldiers of an army .
Doing so does not mean they must wear a uniform .
The postwar Geneva Conventions make room for partisans , something older versions of the conventions did not .
A partisan is not a uniformed fighter , but he must wear some form of insignia identifying himself as a soldier to enjoy the conventions ' protections .
As Article 4.1.6 puts it , prisoners of war include " Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory , who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces , without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units , provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war . "
The Geneva Conventions of 1949 does not mention , nor provide protection to , civilians attacking foreign countries without openly carrying arms .
The reasoning behind this is important .
During the Franco - Prussian war , French franc - tireurs fired on Prussian soldiers .
Ununiformed and without insignia , they melded into the crowd .
It was impossible for the Prussians to distinguish between civilians and soldiers , so they fired on both , and civilian casualties resulted .
The framers of the Geneva Conventions held the franc - tireurs , not the Prussian soldiers , responsible for the casualties .
Their failure to be in uniform forced the Prussians to defend themselves at the cost of civilian lives .
The franc - tireurs were seen as using civilians as camouflage .
This was regarded as outside the rules of war , and those who carried out such acts were seen as not protected by the conventions .
They were not soldiers , and were not to be treated as such .
An Ambiguous Status Extending protections to partisans following World War II was seen as a major concession .
It was done with concerns that it not be extended so far that combatants of irregular forces could legally operate using their ability to blend in with surrounding civilians , and hence a requirement of wearing armbands .
The status of purely covert operatives remained unchanged :
They were not protected under the Geneva Conventions .
Their status remained ambiguous .
During World War II , it was U.S. Army practice to hold perfunctory trials followed by executions .
During the Battle of the Bulge , German commandos captured wearing U.S. uniforms — in violation of the Geneva Conventions — were summarily tried in field courts - martial and executed .
The idea that such individuals were to be handed over to civilian courts was never considered .
The actions of al Qaeda simply were not anticipated in the Geneva Conventions .
And to the extent they were expected , they violated the conventions .
Holder 's decision to transfer Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to federal court makes it clear that Mohammed was not a soldier acting in time of war , but a criminal .
While during times of war spies are tried as criminals , their status is precarious , particularly if they are members of an enemy army .
Enemy soldiers out of uniform carrying out reconnaissance or espionage are subject to military , not civilian , justice , and frequently are executed .
A spy captured in the course of collecting information is a civilian , particularly in peacetime , and normally is tried as a criminal with rules of evidence .
Which was Mohammed ?
Under the Geneva Conventions , his actions in organizing the Sept. 11 attacks , which were carried out without uniforms or other badges of a combatant , denies him status and protection as a POW .
Logically , he is therefore a criminal , but if he is , consider the consequences .
Criminal law is focused on punishments meted out after the fact .
They rarely have been preventive measures .
In either case , they follow strict rules of evidence , require certain treatments of prisoners and so on .
For example , prisoners have to be read the Miranda warning .
Soldiers are not policeman .
They are not trained or expected to protect the legal rights of captives save as POWs under the UCMJ , nor protect the chain of custody of evidence nor countless other things that are required in a civilian court .
In criminal law , it is assumed that law enforcement has captured the prisoner and is well - versed in these rules .
In this case , the capture was made without any consideration of these matters , nor would one expect such consideration .
Consider further the role of U.S. covert operations in these captures .
The United States conducts covert operations in which operatives work out of uniform and are generally not members of the military .
Operating outside the United States , they are not protected by U.S. law although they do operate under the laws and regulations promulgated by the U.S. government .
Much of their operations run counter to international and national law .
At the same time , their operations are accepted as best practices by the international system .
Some operate under cover of diplomatic immunity but carry out operations incompatible with their status as diplomats .
Others operate without official cover .
Should those under unofficial cover be captured , their treatment falls under local law , if such exists .
The Geneva Conventions do not apply to them , nor was it intended to .
Spies , saboteurs and terrorists fall outside the realm of international law .
This class of actors falls under the category of national law , leaving open the question of their liability if they conduct acts inimical to a third country .
Who has jurisdiction ?
The United States is claiming that Mohammed is to be tried under the criminal code of the United States for actions planned in Afghanistan but carried out by others in the United States .
It is a defensible position , but where does this leave American intelligence planners working at CIA headquarters for actions carried out by others in a third country ?
Are they subject to prosecution in the third country ?
Those captured in the third country clearly are , but the claim here is that Mohammed is subject to prosecution under U.S. laws for actions carried out by others in the United States .
And that creates an interesting reciprocal liability .
A Failure to Evolve
The fact is that international law has not evolved to deal with persons like Mohammed .
Or more precisely , most legal discussion under international law is moving counter to the Geneva Conventions ' intent , which was to treat the franc - tireurs as unworthy of legal protection because they were not soldiers and were violating the rules of war .
International law wants to push Mohammed into a category where he does n't fit , providing protections that are not apparent under the Geneva Conventions .
The United States has shoved him into U.S. criminal law , where he does n't fit either , unless the United States is prepared to accept reciprocal liability for CIA personnel based in the United States planning and supporting operations in third countries .
The United States has never claimed , for example , that the KGB planners who operated agents in the United States on behalf of the Soviet Union were themselves subject to criminal prosecution .
A new variety of warfare has emerged in which treatment as a traditional POW does n't apply and criminal law does n't work .
Criminal law creates liabilities the United States does n't want to incur , and it is not geared to deal with a terrorist like Mohammed .
U.S. criminal law assumes that capture is in the hands of law enforcement officials .
Rights are prescribed and demanded , including having lawyers present and so forth .
Such protections are practically and theoretically absurd in this case : Mohammed is not a soldier and he is not a suspected criminal presumed innocent until proven guilty .
Law enforcement is not a practical counter to al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
A nation cannot move from the rules of counterterrorism to an American courtroom ; they are incompatible modes of operation .
Nor can a nation use the code of criminal procedures against a terrorist organization operating transnationally .
Instead , they must be stopped before they commit their action , and issuing search warrants and allowing attorneys present at questioning is not an option .
Therefore — and now we move to the political reality — it is difficult to imagine how the evidence accumulated against Mohammed could enter a courtroom .
Ignoring the methods of questioning , which is a separate issue , how can one prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt without compromising sources and methods , and why should one ?
Mohammed was on a battlefield but not operating as a soldier .
Imagine doing criminal forensics on a battlefield to prove the criminal liability of German commandos wearing American uniforms .
In our mind , there is a very real possibility that Mohammed could be found not guilty in a courtroom .
The cases of O.J. Simpson and of Jewish Defense League head Rabbi Meir Kahane 's killer , El Sayyid Nosair — both found not guilty despite overwhelming evidence — come to mind .
Juries do strange things , particularly amid what will be the greatest media circus imaginable in the media capital of the world .
But it may not be the jury that is the problem .
A federal judge will have to ask the question of whether prejudicial publicity of such magnitude has occurred that Mohammed can't receive a fair trial .
( This is probably true . )
Questions will be raised about whether he has received proper legal counsel , which undoubtedly he has n't .
Issues about the chain of custody of evidence will be raised ; given that he was held by troops and agents , and not by law enforcement , the chances of compromised evidence is likely .
The issue of torture will , of course , also be raised but that really is n't the main problem .
How do you try a man under U.S. legal procedures who was captured in a third country by non-law enforcement personnel , and who has been in military custody for seven years ?
There is a nontrivial possibility that he will be acquitted or have his case thrown out of court , which would be a foreign policy disaster for the United States .
Some might view it as a sign of American adherence to the rule of law and be impressed , others might be convinced that Mohammed was not guilty in more than a legal sense and was held unjustly , and others might think the United States has bungled another matter .
The real problem here is international law , which does not address acts of war committed by non-state actors out of uniform .
Or more precisely , it does , but leaves them deliberately in a state of legal limbo , with captors left free to deal with them as they wish .
If the international legal community does not like the latter , it is time they did the hard work of defining precisely how a nation deals with an act of war carried out under these circumstances .
The international legal community has been quite vocal in condemning American treatment of POWs after 9/11 , but it has n't evolved international law , even theoretically , to cope with this .
Sept. 11 is not a crime in the proper sense of the term , and prosecuting the guilty is not the goal .
Instead , it was an act of war carried out outside the confines of the Geneva Conventions .
The U.S. goal is destroying al Qaeda so that it can no longer function , not punishing those who have acted .
Similarly the goal in 1941 was not punishing the Japanese pilots at Pearl Harbor but destroying the Japanese Empire , and any Japanese soldier was a target who could be killed without trial in the course of combat .
If it wishes to solve this problem , international law will have to recognize that al Qaeda committed an act of war , and its destruction has legal sanction without judicial review .
And if some sort of protection is to be provided al Qaeda operatives out of uniform , then the Geneva Conventions must be changed , and with it the status of spies and saboteurs of all countries .
Holder has opened up an extraordinarily complex can of worms with this decision .
As U.S. attorney general , he has committed himself to proving Mohammed 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while guaranteeing that his constitutional rights ( for a non-U.S. citizen captured and held outside the United States under extraordinary circumstances by individuals not trained as law enforcement personnel , no less ) are protected .
It is Holder 's duty to ensure Mohammed 's prosecution , conviction and fair treatment under the law .
It is hard to see how he can .
Whatever the politics of this decision — and all such decisions have political dimensions — the real problem faced by both the Obama and Bush administrations has been the failure of international law to evolve to provide guidance on dealing with combatants such as al Qaeda .
International law has clung to a model of law governing a very different type of warfare despite new realities .
International law must therefore either reaffirm the doctrine that combatants who do not distinguish themselves from noncombatants are not due the protections of international law , or it must clearly define what those protections are .
Otherwise , international law discredits itself .

Mark Cuban , the eccentric owner of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks , has a post in his blog this week suggesting a way to kill Google by paying the top one thousand most popular sites $ 1 M each to leave the Google Index .
He wonders if Rupert Murdoch 's plan to leave the Google Index could mark the beginning of a full - scale exodus from Google , one which could be expedited with some cash payoffs from Microsoft .
Now , I 'm no legal expert , but it seems to me that such a ploy would not fly with the government , but for the sake of argument , let 's say it would .
Why would you want to wipe out Google ?
Pay Me , Pay Me , Pay Me My Money Down
I 'm sure Microsoft is looking for ways to choke Google .
After all , that 's what competitors do , but I 'm not sure it's in a top web site 's best interest to abandon Google , no matter how much cash is involved .
If I 'm getting a fair amount of traffic from Google , and I make a lot of money , would the million dollar bribe be enough to entice me to cut off that gravy train ?
I suppose it 's possible .
After all a million dollars is not a trivial amount of money to most of us , and if it involved other enticements like placement guarantees and ad deals , it might look good .
What 's interesting is that the numbers involved in a scheme like this would probably not make a company like Microsoft flinch .
Remember , Microsoft was ready to pay $ 45 billion at one point for Yahoo !.
Play Both Ends Against the Middle
Cuban 's plan gets a little more interesting when he suggests that perhaps Google would n't stand still while its closest competitor tried to force the market away from its search engine .
Maybe Google would up the stakes .
After all , they have money too .
Maybe the top sites could get Google into a bidding war with Microsoft , but would this be healthy for anyone except the companies that were the recipients of this largess ?
It probably would n't be great for smaller companies who would n't be worth the attention in a playing field that was now defined by cash payments .
Too Many Questions
But in the end , there are way too many questions left unanswered .
Would Microsoft stock holders stand for this use of Microsoft cash resources in a scheme that still might not work ?
Would Google up the cash stakes , or more likely tie up such an approach in court for so many years that it would n't matter to most of us for a long , long time ?
Would the government stand by and watch this game without stepping in ?
I 'm not sure , but for me personally , I can't see the advantage of choking Google in this fashion , or if anyone would be willing to take the risk it would involve of leaving the world 's most popular search engine , cash payments not withstanding .
Google simply drives too much traffic and why kill the golden goose for spite ?
Yesterday Maine voted to restrict marriage to opposite - sex couples .
It ’s a sad day for people who believe that all couples who love each other should be allowed to marry , full stop .
But the chart below may cushion the blow a tiny bit .
It ’s from a paper by Jeffrey Lax and Justin Phillips , “ Gay Rights in the States : Public Opinion and Policy Responsiveness , ” recently published in the American Political Science Review ( via The Monkey Cage ) .
What you are seeing is support for same - sex marriage in 1994 - 96 , 2003 - 04 , and 2008 - 09 ; solid dots indicate that same - sex marriage is equal , hollow dots that it is not .
Similarly , here ’s the picture of recent ( 2008 ) support for same - sex marriage by age group :
Barring a backlash even bigger than the one we ’ve seen over the last ten years ( during which support for same - sex marriage increased in every state except Utah ) , time is on the side of same - sex marriage .
That may still be small consolation to elderly couples who have been together for decades .

According to a report in the Chicago Tribune , the Blackhawks are set to sign Patrick Kane Jonathan Toews and Duncan Keith to contract extensions .
The Tribune reports the signings of the forwards , both restricted free agents after the season , are expected in the next day or two .
In addition , the Hawks are said to be near an agreement with defenseman Duncan Keith , and the team could announce all three signings as early as Tuesday .
" Our goal like I 've said from the beginning is to keep the core of our team together , and they 're core players , " Blackhawks GM Stan Bowman said before the season .
" That 's the strength and the way you have to do it in the game today .
Evaluate your players , determine who the core players are and keep that group together and fill in around them .
" Pierre LeBrun of " Hockey Night in Canada " and ESPN.com said Saturday that new contracts for the Hawks ' dynamic duo could happen " sometime in the next two weeks . "
Business social network LinkedIn , fresh off its milestone of 50 + million users , is now getting a makeover , and it definitely changes the way you use the social media website .
In a detailed blog post , the company announced that it has begun a limited test of its new design .
It features a newer , longer top - level navigation bar , the removal of the dreaded left - hand navigation bar , and a cleaner overall look .
Screenshots
The best way to describe the new layout though is to place the old design and the new one side - by - side .
First , here is the homepage as it currently exists :
Now , here is the new design for the homepage , courtesy of LinkedIn :
You 'll notice immediately that the emphasis is on the top navigation , that the main content has been pushed to the left hand side of the screen , and that each of the top menu items have a deeper web of subcategories under them ( just look at the options under " Groups " as an example ) .
One more comparison .
This is a profile page currently :
And here is the new one :
You 'll notice that content has been moved up the page ( this is very important - it requires less scrolling and thus less chance of people bouncing off of the page ) and a far stronger focus on the profile and its content .
The key to this entire design it seems is the removal of the left hand navigation bar , which we are fans of .
It distracted users away from the important information on the page .
While the design is still being tested and iterated upon , more and more users should be seeing this layout relatively soon .

Database operations often tend to be the main bottleneck for most web applications today .
It 's not only the DBA 's ( database administrators ) that have to worry about these performance issues .
We as programmers need to do our part by structuring tables properly , writing optimized queries and better code .
In this article , I 'll list some MySQL optimization techniques for programmers .
Before we start , be aware that you can find a ton of useful MySQL scripts and utilities on Envato Market .
1. Optimize Your Queries For the Query Cache
Most MySQL servers have query caching enabled .
It 's one of the most effective methods of improving performance , that is quietly handled by the database engine .
When the same query is executed multiple times , the result is fetched from the cache , which is quite fast .
The main problem is , it is so easy and hidden from the programmer , most of us tend to ignore it .
Some things we do can actually prevent the query cache from performing its task .
The reason query cache does not work in the first line is the usage of the CURDATE ( ) function .
This applies to all non-deterministic functions like NOW ( ) and RAND ( ) etc ...
Since the return result of the function can change , MySQL decides to disable query caching for that query .
All we needed to do is to add an extra line of PHP before the query to prevent this from happening .
2. EXPLAIN Your SELECT Queries
Using the EXPLAIN keyword can give you insight on what MySQL is doing to execute your query .
This can help you spot the bottlenecks and other problems with your query or table structures .
The results of an EXPLAIN query will show you which indexes are being utilized , how the table is being scanned and sorted etc ...
Take a SELECT query ( preferably a complex one , with joins ) , and add the keyword EXPLAIN in front of it .
You can just use phpmyadmin for this .
It will show you the results in a nice table .
For example , let 's say I forgot to add an index to a column , which I perform joins on :
After adding the index to the group_id field :
Now instead of scanning 7883 rows , it will only scan 9 and 16 rows from the 2 tables .
A good rule of thumb is to multiply all numbers under the " rows " column , and your query performance will be somewhat proportional to the resulting number .
3. LIMIT 1 When Getting a Unique Row
Sometimes when you are querying your tables , you already know you are looking for just one row .
You might be fetching a unique record , or you might just be just checking the existence of any number of records that satisfy your WHERE clause .
In such cases , adding LIMIT 1 to your query can increase performance .
This way the database engine will stop scanning for records after it finds just 1 , instead of going thru the whole table or index .
4. Index the Search Fields
Indexes are not just for the primary keys or the unique keys .
If there are any columns in your table that you will search by , you should almost always index them .
As you can see , this rule also applies on a partial string search like " last_name LIKE 'a % ' " .
When searching from the beginning of the string , MySQL is able to utilize the index on that column .
You should also understand which kinds of searches can not use the regular indexes .
For instance , when searching for a word ( e.g. " WHERE post_content LIKE ' % apple % ' " ) , you will not see a benefit from a normal index .
You will be better off using mysql fulltext search or building your own indexing solution .
5. Index and Use Same Column Types for Joins
If your application contains many JOIN queries , you need to make sure that the columns you join by are indexed on both tables .
This affects how MySQL internally optimizes the join operation .
Also , the columns that are joined , need to be the same type .
For instance , if you join a DECIMAL column , to an INT column from another table , MySQL will be unable to use at least one of the indexes .
Even the character encodings need to be the same type for string type columns .
6. Do Not ORDER BY RAND ( )
This is one of those tricks that sound cool at first , and many rookie programmers fall for this trap .
You may not realize what kind of terrible bottleneck you can create once you start using this in your queries .
If you really need random rows out of your results , there are much better ways of doing it .
Granted it takes additional code , but you will prevent a bottleneck that gets exponentially worse as your data grows .
The problem is , MySQL will have to perform RAND ( ) operation ( which takes processing power ) for every single row in the table before sorting it and giving you just 1 row .
So you pick a random number less than the number of results and use that as the offset in your LIMIT clause .
7. Avoid SELECT *
The more data is read from the tables , the slower the query will become .
It increases the time it takes for the disk operations .
Also when the database server is separate from the web server , you will have longer network delays due to the data having to be transferred between the servers .
It is a good habit to always specify which columns you need when you are doing your SELECT's .
8. Almost Always Have an id Field
In every table have an id column that is the PRIMARY KEY , AUTO_INCREMENT and one of the flavors of INT .
Also preferably UNSIGNED , since the value can not be negative .
Even if you have a users table that has a unique username field , do not make that your primary key .
VARCHAR fields as primary keys are slower .
And you will have a better structure in your code by referring to all users with their id's internally .
There are also behind the scenes operations done by the MySQL engine itself , that uses the primary key field internally .
Which become even more important , the more complicated the database setup is .
( clusters , partitioning etc ... ) .
One possible exception to the rule are the " association tables " , used for the many - to - many type of associations between 2 tables .
For example a " posts_tags " table that contains 2 columns : post_id , tag_id , that is used for the relations between two tables named " post " and " tags " .
These tables can have a PRIMARY key that contains both id fields .
9. Use ENUM over VARCHAR
ENUM type columns are very fast and compact .
Internally they are stored like TINYINT , yet they can contain and display string values .
This makes them a perfect candidate for certain fields .
If you have a field , which will contain only a few different kinds of values , use ENUM instead of VARCHAR .
For example , it could be a column named " status " , and only contain values such as " active " , " inactive " , " pending " , " expired " etc ...
There is even a way to get a " suggestion " from MySQL itself on how to restructure your table .
When you do have a VARCHAR field , it can actually suggest you to change that column type to ENUM instead .
This done using the PROCEDURE ANALYSE ( ) call .
Which brings us to :
10 . Get Suggestions with PROCEDURE ANALYSE ( )
PROCEDURE ANALYSE ( ) will let MySQL analyze the columns structures and the actual data in your table to come up with certain suggestions for you .
It is only useful if there is actual data in your tables because that plays a big role in the decision making .
For example , if you created an INT field for your primary key , however do not have too many rows , it might suggest you to use a MEDIUMINT instead .
Or if you are using a VARCHAR field , you might get a suggestion to convert it to ENUM , if there are only few unique values .
You can also run this by clicking the " Propose table structure " link in phpmyadmin , in one of your table views .
Keep in mind these are only suggestions .
And if your table is going to grow bigger , they may not even be the right suggestions to follow .
The decision is ultimately yours .
11 . Use NOT NULL If You Can
Unless you have a very specific reason to use a NULL value , you should always set your columns as NOT NULL .
First of all , ask yourself if there is any difference between having an empty string value vs. a NULL value ( for INT fields : 0 vs. NULL ) .
If there is no reason to have both , you do not need a NULL field .
( Did you know that Oracle considers NULL and empty string as being the same ? )
NULL columns require additional space and they can add complexity to your comparison statements .
Just avoid them when you can .
However , I understand some people might have very specific reasons to have NULL values , which is not always a bad thing .
From MySQL docs :
" NULL columns require additional space in the row to record whether their values are NULL .
For MyISAM tables , each NULL column takes one bit extra , rounded up to the nearest byte . "
12 . Prepared Statements
There are multiple benefits to using prepared statements , both for performance and security reasons .
Prepared Statements will filter the variables you bind to them by default , which is great for protecting your application against SQL injection attacks .
You can of course filter your variables manually too , but those methods are more prone to human error and forgetfulness by the programmer .
This is less of an issue when using some kind of framework or ORM .
Since our focus is on performance , I should also mention the benefits in that area .
These benefits are more significant when the same query is being used multiple times in your application .
You can assign different values to the same prepared statement , yet MySQL will only have to parse it once .
Also latest versions of MySQL transmits prepared statements in a native binary form , which are more efficient and can also help reduce network delays .
There was a time when many programmers used to avoid prepared statements on purpose , for a single important reason .
They were not being cached by the MySQL query cache .
But since sometime around version 5.1 , query caching is supported too .
To use prepared statements in PHP you check out the mysqli extension or use a database abstraction layer like PDO .
13 . Unbuffered Queries
Normally when you perform a query from a script , it will wait for the execution of that query to finish before it can continue .
You can change that by using unbuffered queries .
There is a great explanation in the PHP docs for the mysql_unbuffered_query ( ) function :
" mysql_unbuffered_query ( ) sends the SQL query query to MySQL without automatically fetching and buffering the result rows as mysql_query ( ) does .
This saves a considerable amount of memory with SQL queries that produce large result sets , and you can start working on the result set immediately after the first row has been retrieved as you do n't have to wait until the complete SQL query has been performed . "
However , it comes with certain limitations .
You have to either read all the rows or call mysql_free_result ( ) before you can perform another query .
Also you are not allowed to use mysql_num_rows ( ) or mysql_data_seek ( ) on the result set .
14 . Store IP Addresses as UNSIGNED INT
Many programmers will create a VARCHAR ( 15 ) field without realizing they can actually store IP addresses as integer values .
With an INT you go down to only 4 bytes of space , and have a fixed size field instead .
You have to make sure your column is an UNSIGNED INT , because IP Addresses use the whole range of a 32 bit unsigned integer .
In your queries you can use the INET_ATON ( ) to convert and IP to an integer , and INET_NTOA ( ) for vice versa .
There are also similar functions in PHP called ip2long ( ) and long2ip ( ) .
15 . Fixed - length ( Static ) Tables are Faster
When every single column in a table is " fixed - length " , the table is also considered " static " or " fixed - length " .
Examples of column types that are NOT fixed - length are : VARCHAR , TEXT , BLOB .
If you include even just 1 of these types of columns , the table ceases to be fixed - length and has to be handled differently by the MySQL engine .
Fixed - length tables can improve performance because it is faster for MySQL engine to seek through the records .
When it wants to read a specific row in a table , it can quickly calculate the position of it .
If the row size is not fixed , every time it needs to do a seek , it has to consult the primary key index .
They are also easier to cache and easier to reconstruct after a crash .
But they also can take more space .
For instance , if you convert a VARCHAR ( 20 ) field to a CHAR ( 20 ) field , it will always take 20 bytes of space regardless of what is it in .
By using " Vertical Partitioning " techniques , you can separate the variable - length columns to a separate table .
Which brings us to :
16 . Vertical Partitioning
Vertical Partitioning is the act of splitting your table structure in a vertical manner for optimization reasons .
Example 1 : You might have a users table that contains home addresses , that do not get read often .
You can choose to split your table and store the address info on a separate table .
This way your main users table will shrink in size .
As you know , smaller tables perform faster .
Example 2 : You have a " last_login " field in your table .
It updates every time a user logs in to the website .
But every update on a table causes the query cache for that table to be flushed .
You can put that field into another table to keep updates to your users table to a minimum .
But you also need to make sure you do n't constantly need to join these 2 tables after the partitioning or you might actually suffer performance decline .
17 . Split the Big DELETE or INSERT Queries
If you need to perform a big DELETE or INSERT query on a live website , you need to be careful not to disturb the web traffic .
When a big query like that is performed , it can lock your tables and bring your web application to a halt .
Apache runs many parallel processes / threads .
Therefore it works most efficiently when scripts finish executing as soon as possible , so the servers do not experience too many open connections and processes at once that consume resources , especially the memory .
If you end up locking your tables for any extended period of time ( like 30 seconds or more ) , on a high traffic web site , you will cause a process and query pileup , which might take a long time to clear or even crash your web server .
If you have some kind of maintenance script that needs to delete large numbers of rows , just use the LIMIT clause to do it in smaller batches to avoid this congestion .
18 . Smaller Columns Are Faster
With database engines , disk is perhaps the most significant bottleneck .
Keeping things smaller and more compact is usually helpful in terms of performance , to reduce the amount of disk transfer .
MySQL docs have a list of Storage Requirements for all data types .
If a table is expected to have very few rows , there is no reason to make the primary key an INT , instead of MEDIUMINT , SMALLINT or even in some cases TINYINT .
If you do not need the time component , use DATE instead of DATETIME .
Just make sure you leave reasonable room to grow or you might end up like Slashdot .
19 . Choose the Right Storage Engine
The two main storage engines in MySQL are MyISAM and InnoDB .
Each have their own pros and cons .
MyISAM is good for read - heavy applications , but it does n't scale very well when there are a lot of writes .
Even if you are updating one field of one row , the whole table gets locked , and no other process can even read from it until that query is finished .
MyISAM is very fast at calculating SELECT COUNT (*) types of queries .
InnoDB tends to be a more complicated storage engine and can be slower than MyISAM for most small applications .
But it supports row - based locking , which scales better .
It also supports some more advanced features such as transactions .
20 . Use an Object Relational Mapper
By using an ORM ( Object Relational Mapper ) , you can gain certain performance benefits .
Everything an ORM can do , can be coded manually too .
But this can mean too much extra work and require a high level of expertise .
ORM 's are great for " Lazy Loading " .
It means that they can fetch values only as they are needed .
But you need to be careful with them or you can end up creating to many mini-queries that can reduce performance .
ORM 's can also batch your queries into transactions , which operate much faster than sending individual queries to the database .
Currently my favorite ORM for PHP is Doctrine .
I wrote an article on how to install Doctrine with CodeIgniter .
21 . Be Careful with Persistent Connections
Persistent Connections are meant to reduce the overhead of recreating connections to MySQL .
When a persistent connection is created , it will stay open even after the script finishes running .
Since Apache reuses it 's child processes , next time the process runs for a new script , it will reuse the same MySQL connection .
It sounds great in theory .
But from my personal experience ( and many others ) , this features turns out to be not worth the trouble .
You can have serious problems with connection limits , memory issues and so on .
Apache runs extremely parallel , and creates many child processes .
This is the main reason that persistent connections do not work very well in this environment .
Before you consider using the mysql_pconnect ( ) function , consult your system admin .

Brain signals have shown that calves appear to feel pain when slaughtered according to Jewish and Muslim religious law ( Image : Alex Segre / Rex Features )
Brain signals have shown that calves do appear to feel pain when slaughtered according to Jewish and Muslim religious law , strengthening the case for adapting the practices to make them more humane .
“ I think our work is the best evidence yet that it ’s painful , ” says Craig Johnson , who led the study at Massey University in Palmerston North , New Zealand .
Johnson summarised his results last week in London when receiving an award from the UK Humane Slaughter Association .
His team also showed that if the animal is concussed through stunning , signals corresponding to pain disappear .

The findings increase pressure on religious groups that practice slaughter without stunning to reconsider .
“ It provides further evidence , if it was needed , that slaughtering an animal without stunning it first is painful , ” says Christopher Wathes of the UK Farm Animal Welfare Council , which has long argued for the practice to end .
Stunning result
In most western countries , animals must be stunned before they are slaughtered , but there is an exemption for religious practice , most prominently Jewish shechita and Muslim dhabiha .
Animal welfare groups have long argued that on welfare grounds , the exemptions should be lifted , as they have been in Norway .
Johnson ’s work , funded by the UK and New Zealand agriculture ministries , builds on findings in human volunteers of specific patterns of brain electrical activity when they feel pain .
Recorded with electroencephalograms , the patterns were reproducible in at least eight other mammal species known to be experiencing pain .
Johnson developed a way of lightly anaesthetising animals so that although they experienced no pain , the same electrical pain signals could be reliably detected , showing they would have suffered pain if awake .
The team first cut calves ’ throats in a procedure matching that of Jewish and Muslim slaughter methods .
They detected a pain signal lasting for up to 2 minutes after the incision .
When their throats are cut , calves generally lose consciousness after 10 to 30 seconds , sometimes longer .
Cut - throat practice
The researchers then showed that the pain originates from cutting throat nerves , not from the loss of blood , suggesting the severed nerves send pain signals until the time of death .
Finally , they stunned animals 5 seconds after incision and showed that this makes the pain signal disappear instantly .
“ It was n’t a surprise to me , but in terms of the religious community , they are adamant animals do n’t experience any pain , so the results might be a surprise to them , ” says Johnson .
He praised Muslim dhabiha practitioners in New Zealand and elsewhere who have already adopted stunning prior to slaughter .
They use a form of electrical stunning which animals quickly recover from if not slaughtered , proving that the stunned animal is “ healthy ” , thereby qualifying as halal .
Pressure drop
Representatives for both faiths responded by claiming that stunning itself hurts animals .
A spokesman for Shechita UK says that the throat cut is so rapid that it serves as its own “ stun ” , adding that there is abundant evidence shechita is humane .
“ Shechita is instantaneous , and due to the immediate drop in blood pressure and [ oxygen starvation ] of the brain , the animal loses consciousness within 2 seconds , ” he says .
“ It conforms to the statutory definition of stunning , in that it is a process which causes the immediate loss of consciousness which lasts until death . ”
Ahmed Ghanem , a halal slaughterman based in New Zealand , says that blood does n’t drain properly from stunned animals , although this has been countered by recent research at the University of Bristol in the UK .
Ghanem cites a 1978 study relying on EEG measurements led by Wilhelm Schulze of the University of Hanover , Germany , apparently concluding that halal slaughter was more humane than slaughter following stunning .
But Schulze himself , who died in 2002 , warned in his report that the stunning technique may not have functioned properly .

Exploring spontaneous healing and biology of belief probably from a different angle that we are used to looking at .
• EU council urged to look at cumulative effect • Campaigners fear controls will not be tough enough
Two - year - old children are being exposed to dangerous levels of hormone - disrupting chemicals in domestic products such as rubber clogs and sun creams , according to an EU investigation being studied by the government .
The 327 - page report says that while risks from " anti-androgen " and " oestrogen - like " substances in individual items have been recognised , the cumulative impact of such chemicals , particularly on boys , is being ignored .
The EU 's environment council of ministers is due to agree on a regulatory approach to the use of so - called " gender - bender " compounds before Christmas .
On Monday , EU officials will try to work out a strategy for creating risk assessments of products causing concerns .
Environmental campaigners fear controls will favour industry and not be sufficiently robust .
Phthalates , one of the main anti-androgen chemicals , which are used as softeners in soap , rubber shoes , bath mats and soft toys , have been blamed for blocking the action of testosterone in the womb and are alleged to cause low sperm counts , high rates of testicular cancer and malformations of the sexual organs .
Research has suggested that male foetuses around 8 - 12 weeks after conception can be effectively demasculinised by exposure to such chemicals .
The report presented to the environment council and passed on to the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) comes from Denmark , which has experienced a significant increase in the rates of testicular cancer .
The warnings are backed by the Chem ( Chemicals Health and Environment Monitoring )
Trust , a UK charity which has taken over campaigning work on toxic chemicals from the WWF ( World Wildlife Fund ) .
The Danish study , Survey and Health Assessment of the exposure of two - year - olds to chemical substances in consumer products , concludes : " A few exposures to a high content of an endocrine - disruptor , such as that of [ the phthalate ] DBP in rubber clogs may result in a critical risk for the two - year - old .
" ... The amounts that two - year - olds absorb from the [ preservative ] parabens propylparaben and butylparaben can constitute a risk for oestrogen - like disruptions of the endocrine system .
This contribution originates predominantly from cosmetic products such as oil - based creams , moisturising creams , lotions and sunscreen .
" Not only is there a need to reduce exposure to anti-androgens and oestrogen - like substances from food products , indoor air and dust , but also to reduce exposure to [ domestic ] products , as these contribute to both indoor air and dust and to direct exposure .
" There is also a need to reduce possible contributions from other sources , such as propyl- , butyl - and isobutyl paraben in cosmetics , and phthalates in footwear ( such as light - weight sandals and rubber boots ) . "
Gwynne Lyons , director of Chem Trust , said she feared the recommendations would not be heeded .
" There are worries that Poland and the UK are more focused on protecting industry .
Without public pressure , these countries will only agree to wording that sounds good , but actually falls short of ensuring that regulation is based on total exposure to , for example , so - called gender - bender chemicals .
" Both the public and wildlife are inadequately protected from harm , as regulation is based on looking at exposure to each substance in isolation , and yet it is now proven beyond doubt that hormone disrupting chemicals can act together to cause effects even when each by itself would not . "
Defra said : " Public safety is the government 's priority , and we will be reading the Danish report with interest .
The potential for " cocktail effects " from different chemicals should not be ignored , and we support the European Union 's Environment Council 's upcoming work on regulating combinations of chemicals . "
The government 's Interdepartmental Group on Health Risks from Chemicals has recently published a report offering a framework for assessing the risks of mixtures to human health .
It suggested that cumulative risk assessment should not be the only way of approaching " cocktail effects " .
Hormone disrupting chemicals in household products
• Phthalates are used in the manufacture of rubber clogs , rubber boots , soap packaging , products made from PVC , bath mats and soft toys .
They are also found in food products as a result of environmental pollution , according to the Danish study .
• Oestrogen - like substances , including chemicals known as parabens , occur in cosmetics , sun creams and moisturising lotions .
• Pesticides , such as DDT , dioxins and PCBs , are also known hormone - disruptors .
Sólo unos días después de asumir la presidencia de México , Felipe Calderón declaró la guerra contra el narcotráfico .
La explicación oficial fue que el crimen había socavado los cimientos del Estado hasta llegar a sustituirlo , que por primera vez Estados Unidos estaba dispuesto a ayudar , que el consumo y el crimen se habían disparado ...
Rubén Aguilar y Jorge Castañeda , altos cargos durante el Gobierno del presidente Vicente Fox , recibieron esas explicaciones con perplejidad .
Se pusieron a investigar y el resultado es un libro , El narco : la guerra fallida ( Punto de Lectura ) , donde ofrecen respuestas sorprendentes que no dejan en muy buen lugar al presidente Calderón .
EL PAÍS .
Ustedes sostienen que Felipe Calderón parte de " premisas endebles " cuando , en diciembre de 2006 , declara la guerra al narcotráfico .
" Es necesario un debate nacional " , dice el ex canciller Jorge Castañeda
Aguilar , ex portavoz gubernamental , cree que el presidente intenta legitimarse
EE UU no ha hecho nada para reducir la demanda de droga , según Castañeda
Ni Fox ni Calderón se han atrevido a hacer frente a los poderes fácticos
Más información Calderón mueve su gabinete pero no cambia criterio : gana control y premia lealtad
Jorge Castañeda .
( Ex ministro de Exteriores ) .
Y la mejor prueba de ello es que durante su campaña para la candidatura del PAN ( Partido Acción Nacional ) y luego para la presidencia de la República jamás mencionó el tema del narcotráfico , la guerra ni nada , y ahora se ha vuelto el centro de la primera mitad de su sexenio .
Esto es algo tan importante tan serio , tan costoso para el país que no se puede seguir en esta guerra sin llevar a cabo un debate nacional que desemboque o en la confirmación del rumbo o en el cambio de rumbo , pero ya con conciencia de la sociedad , y no por algo impuesto por una ocurrencia política de Calderón .
Y bueno , nos pusimos a escribir y empezamos a investigar .
Y llegamos a la conclusión de que la mayor parte de las premisas o de la sabiduría convencional sobre el narco en México no se sostiene , de acuerdo con las fuentes del propio gobierno .
Vamos enumerando una tras otra ...
Rubén Aguilar .
( Ex portavoz del Gobierno ) .
Aquella declaración de guerra contra el narcotráfico tan temprana nos hizo sospechar .
Nosotros conocíamos las encuestas nacionales de adicción pasadas y no se veía que hubiese un problema .
En 2008 , el Gobierno hace una encuesta que indica que el 0,4 % de la población es adicta .
O sea , sólo 450.000 mexicanos .
El aumento del consumo de 2002 a 2008 es apenas del punto siete , en razón de los baremos de la OMS .
Por lo tanto , no había un problema de consumo .
Tampoco había un problema de violencia .
Probablemente , como han demostrado varias investigaciones , en el momento en que se lanza la guerra contra el narco es de los momentos históricos con un nivel más bajo de violencia .
Cuando el presidente Calderón inicia la guerra , llevábamos 15 años bajando
J. C. Además , el Gobierno alega otras dos tesis para empezar la guerra que tienen que ver con EE UU y que nosotros demostramos que son falsas .
La primera es que por primera vez los norteamericanos asumen la responsabilidad compartida , están dispuestos a hacer algo .
Nosotros demostramos por comunicados conjuntos de los distintos presidentes o cancilleres que esto no es nuevo .
Desde hace 30 años , los Gobiernos de EE UU dicen sí , sí , sí , es culpa nuestra , somos una bola de mariguanos .
Pero , en segundo lugar , en los últimos 40 años , desde que la droga empieza a ser parte de la vida digamos no marginal en los EE UU y también de Europa , EE UU no ha hecho nada para reducir la demanda .
No han querido hacerlo y la demanda allí ha permanecido estable a lo largo de 40 años .
Otra de las tesis falsas para empezar la guerra es que la violencia en México viene porque los americanos venden armas .
Es verdad que EE UU vende armas y que los narcos tienen armas .
Pero la relación causal es mucho más compleja .
Porque si tener una frontera con EE UU fuera la razón por la que hay violencia en México , entonces no habría ni armas ni violencia en Río de Janeiro , en Sierra Leona , en Liberia , en Colombia , en Angola .. , y obviamente no es cierto .
Hay un mercado mundial de armas y el que las necesita , las compra .
Y pensar que nos conviene a nosotros en México vigilar la frontera de norte a sur para que no pasen armas es matar la gallina de los huevos de oro del turismo y del comercio sin que por ello vaya a haber menos armas en México .
R. A. Y hay una quinta razón entre las que da el presidente con una enorme fuerza para empezar su guerra : la razón de Estado .
El narco , alega él , ha penetrado en las estructuras del Estado .
Y nosotros demostramos en el libro con mucha claridad que si bien es cierto - México no es ni Noruega ni Dinamarca , es México , está en América Latina ...- es muchísimo menor que lo que ocurría años atrás , donde un gobernador del PRI [ Partido Revolucionario Institucional ] en el Estado de Quintana Roo era el organizador del narcotráfico , o el presidente De Lamadrid tiene que cerrar la seguridad federal porque está penetrada ...
J. C.Incluso el ex procurador Medina Mora es contradictorio al decir que el Estado está perdiendo ciertas facultades y al mismo tiempo rechazar la tesis del Estado fallido .
O una cosa o la otra .
En realidad nosotros estamos de acuerdo con Calderón y con Medina Mora en que el Estado mexicano no es un Estado fallido .
EL PAÍS .
Entonces , si esas premisas son falsas o endebles , ¿por qué Calderón se mete en un problema de esas dimensiones ?
R. A. Nosotros pensamos que lo que intentó Calderón fue legitimarse .
Ante las acusaciones de fraude electoral que rodearon su elección , él decide que requiere un acto fundacional de su Gobierno que lo legitime .
Por otro lado , todos los presidentes de México en los últimos seis sexenios una vez que asumen el poder hacen un acto fundacional en su gobierno .
Fox intentó la paz en Chiapas .
Zedillo encarceló a Raúl Salinas ...
J. C. Es un hecho que Calderón no tiene una salida fácil .
Nos imaginamos que cuando se metió con la idea de legitimarse de ese modo pensó que iba a ser muy fácil entrar y salir .
Rápido , fácil , barato , breve .
Pero no .
EL PAÍS .
Y la presencia del Ejército en las calles ya se está convirtiendo en un problema añadido ...
R. A. Y en un problema gravísimo .
Estamos arriesgando al Ejército en el desgaste de la calle .
Es un costo muy grande para el país , muy grande .
Ha costado muchísimos años recuperar esa buena imagen del Ejército después del trauma del 68 y las posibilidades de desgaste son enormes .
EL PAÍS .
¿Todo esto convierte a Calderón en un presidente fallido , en un presidente débil ...?
J. C. Yo creo que Calderón ha agotado prematuramente su presidencia .
Es decir , el ánimo que siente uno en el país hoy es el ánimo que se suele sentir en el último año .
O en los últimos seis meses de un presidente ya cansado , irritable .

No todas serán ciertas , pero algunas sí .
No hay día que no tenga que dar una explicación de por qué México es el único país del mundo que más ha padecido la crisis , cuya economía se va a contraer más .
Las explicaciones son erráticas .
Un día dice que es por EE UU .
¿Y por qué Canadá creció un 1 % ?
Otro culpa al turismo .
¿Y por qué República Dominicana creció un 3 % ...?
Este es el panorama : un presidente irritable , sin agenda , sin programa , rodeado de secretarios debilitados , con un Congreso que no le hace ya el menor caso ...
EL PAÍS .
Llama la atención la estrategia de Calderón de erigirse en el primer y único bastión contra el crimen organizado ...
J. C. Sí , dice eso , pero lo más curioso es que los principales personajes de la seguridad pública de este Gobierno son los mismos que los del Gobierno pasado .
Entonces , resulta difícil entender cómo en el régimen pasado estos mismos individuos eran unos ineptos o unos cómplices y ahora son superman o héroes nacionales ...
Calderón tuvo un momento de oportunidad , haber convertido su debilidad en su fuerza .
Pudo haberle dicho a los poderes fácticos de este país : no podemos seguir con la concentración del poder en México , los monopolios públicos , los privados , los económicos , los comerciales , los financieros , los mediáticos , los políticos , los sindicales ...
Fox lo dejó seguir seis años , fue un error , Zedillo también , fue un error , yo no lo voy a hacer porque si lo dejamos a la próxima nos cepillan a todos .
Y hubiera podido dar ese golpe .
Y decidió conscientemente no hacerlo .
Por miedo .
EL PAÍS .
¿ Por miedo ?
J. C. Siento que hay un problema que es semejante al de Fox , que es que enfrentar a los poderes fácticos y enfrentar al PRI , porque al final del día este es el viejo régimen priísta - los sindicatos , las paraestatales , el propio PRI como partido - , eso resulta como algo demasiado aterrador , tanto para Fox como para Calderón .
EL PAÍS .
¿ Por qué ?
J. C. Porque ambos pensaron que el enfrentamiento con el PRI efectivamente enajena al sector privado , a los poderes fácticos .
Tienen miedo a una crisis económica , a una salida de capital , a una devaluación de la moneda , a un repunte inflacionario , a una subida de las tasas de interés ...
Tanto
Fox como Calderón decidieron dejar en paz a los poderes fácticos , dejar en paz al PRI salvo en la retórica .
EL PAÍS .
Y es ahí donde empieza la comparación con Brasil que tanto molesta en el entorno del presidente Calderón .
R.A. Exactamente .
Necesitamos un presidente que pelee , que pelee la agenda ...
J. C. Y la gran pregunta entonces es : ¿por qué no quiere pelear ?
En Brasil , Lula sí pelea , tú lo ves que pelea las cosas , y gana algunas batallas , pero ha perdido muchas - incluido Honduras - .
No es que gane todas , pero va a todas , gana unas y pierde otras .
Whether or not you like it , Congress  health care bill ultimately comes down to one question :
How much faith do you have that a politically appointed committee in Washington , D.C. , can determine whats best ?
After last weeks Bay Bridge failure , Bay Area residents would do well to consider the obvious parallel .
If the government cant build a bridge that keeps us safe , can it really be trusted with the future of American health care ?
The original proposal prompted by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was a relatively straightforward bridge repair and seismic retrofit , estimated to take four years and cost $ 150 million to $ 200 million .
A bigger idea , however , took hold : Rather than simply fix the broken bridge , why not replace it with an entirely new structure , one with a world - class design intended to create an inspirational identity for Oakland and the East Bay ?
A Bay Bridge Design Task Force was appointed and eventually selected a never - before - built design for the new span , eliciting the protests of knowledgeable engineers who denounced it as seismically unsafe .
Despite the lowest bid coming in at $ 300 million more than cost projections , Caltrans forged ahead with the plan .
Choosing not to revise its cost estimates for the bridge , Caltrans instead promised to pursue cost - saving measures aggressively to stay within the $ 2.6 billion project budget . 
Currently , the bridge is projected to be complete in 2013  24 years after Loma Prietaat a cost of $ 6.3 billion .
The first sign that the design might not be so world - class was the crack in the eyebar discovered during and likely caused by Labor Day weekend construction .
As diagnosed by UC Berkeley civil engineering professor Abolhassan Astaneh - Asl , who has spent 20 years studying the bridge , the Labor Day crack was a warning sign that the repair they were doing was really a Band - Aid . 
After just seven weeks the Band - Aid broke .
Such an outcome should be no surprise .
Once authority was handed over to a political committee , decisions ceased to be based on what best served users of the bridge .
Cost and functionality took a backseat to visually appealing but unnecessary features , all to be paid for with higher bridge tolls .
These additions were planned with no concern for what impact those higher tolls might have on those who pay them .
Unfortunately , the proposed health care bill provides for precisely the same kind of decision making by political appointees with no accountability to those who will actually be using or paying for the resulting system .
The bill establishes a Health Benefits Advisory Committee with the power to restrict or permit anyones future access to health care .
The committee is entrusted with providing details for the public option and setting the price for plan participants .
In short , the committee will have enormous power to decide what health services any public or private insurer can cover , at what cost and for whom .
Those hoping to have future health care covered by something other than a Band - Aid should seriously evaluate the appropriateness of a politically entrenched health care committee accountable to none .
Improvements can and should be made , but a federal overhaul of the entire sector is no more necessary or desirable than a budget - busting , seismically unsound , signature design replacement for our utilitarian Bay Bridge .
Promises to pay for the bridges cost overruns of which there remains no end in sight with cost - saving measures  came to naught , just as those currently being made by health care overhaul proponents surely will .
If we allow health care to go the way of the Band - Aid plan , we shouldnt be surprised when the outcome resembles the bridge a flawed design with skyrocketing costs and dwindling benefits .
Former Vice President Al Gore ’s visit to Portland today and tomorrow has prompted some Nobel Peace Prize thoughts , and in Oregon the idea of nominating a Northwesterner .
The prospect shot around the Portland - area Linux circles ( drawing some debate as well as approval as it did ) , starting with this email from Keith Lofstrom :
Since the Nobel Peace Prize is often given to politicians , some disagree with the choices .
But it is often given to non-politicians who create international efforts to change the world for the better .
Look at the massive international efforts represented by SC09 , and realize that much of it started from the work of a 21 [ - year - old ] Finnish college student named after 1962 Nobel Peace Prize winner Linus Pauling .
It would be fitting to honor that international effort by giving a Peace Prize to Linus Torvalds , perhaps in 2011 on the 20th anniversary of the August 1991 Linux announcement , or in 2012 on the 50th anniversary of Pauling ’s award .
Linux is one of the largest cooperative international efforts ever undertaken .
It inspired Ubuntu , One Laptop Per Child , and many other global projects .
Linux conquered the supercomputer space , the server space , the embedded computer space – by peaceful means !
Linux helped sequence the human genome , helps protect the world computer infrastructure from viral attack , and is now the pathway for millions to learn computer programming and participate in new international efforts .
The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize recipient ( a politician some disagree with , please disagree in a different thread , thanks ) is giving the keynote to SC09 as I write this .
Meaning that we are all three handshakes away from the people that decide on future Peace Prizes .
Perhaps it is time to launch some messages through our connections and see what makes it to the committee meetings in Oslo .
According to the list on Wikipedia , the five people to convince are Thorbjørn Jagland ( chair ) , Kaci Kullmann Five ( deputy chair ) , Sissel Rønbeck , Inger - Marie Ytterhorn , and Ågot Valle .
We can start by sending them Norsk language Ubuntu disks .
While I imagine Linus Torvalds would be embarrassed by the attention , it would sure make his parents happy .
And it would mean one less Peace Prize for a politician .
MARRAKESH , Morocco — Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Monday for taking “ positive steps ” towards peace talks with Israel , while suggesting Israel could do more .
Her remarks came amidst criticism from the Arab world that she had sided with Israel by calling their offer to limit , but not halt , settlement growth an “ unprecedented ” step forward .
" This offer falls far short of what our preference would be .
But if it is acted upon , it will be an unprecedented restriction on settlements and would have a significant and meaningful effect on restraining their growth , " said Clinton here , in response to the Arab complaints .
Clinton is expected to be pressed on this issue when she meets with Arab foreign ministers at a conference here .
Clinton arrived in Morroco Sunday for meetings with officials from Arab and G8 countries on the final leg of a trip spent tackling two of America ’s biggest foreign policy goals : security in Pakistan and peace in the Middle East .
On her way here , Clinton met separately with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to restart a stalled peace process .
The United States has consistently urged both sides to resume peace negotiations , which were suspended last winter after the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip .
So far , Clinton ’s visit appears to have done little to break the impasse .
President Abbas maintained that the Palestinian Authority will not resume talks unless Israel stops the expansion of settlements in disputed areas .
Clinton has called for a settlement freeze in the past , but raised eyebrows on this trip when she publicly praised Netanyahu , calling his offer to limit settlement growth before beginning negotiations “ unprecedented . ”
" There has never been a precondition , " Clinton said .
" It has always been an issue within the negotiations . ”
U.S. State Department Spokesman Ian Kelly said Clinton plans to continue pushing both sides back to the table during her visit to Morocco , where she is attending the Forum for the Future , a democracy and development conference attended by representatives from G8 countries and foreign ministers from across the Arab world .
" Everybody should keep their eyes on the goal here of a comprehensive peace , and to get there we have to get the two sides to the point where they can sit down and have meaningful negotiations , " Kelly said .
" We ’re going to vigorously pursue this goal using all kinds of opportunities to do so . "
Morocco is the final stop on something of a charm offensive Clinton launched across the Muslim world starting Wednesday in Pakistan .
Clinton spent three days there , meeting with political leaders , journalists and members of the public .
Hours after she arrived , a car bomb exploded in Peshawar market , killing some 100 people .
State Department officials objected to claims the blast was meant to disrupt her visit .
“ We stand with those in Pakistan who are fighting this fight , ” Kelly said .
“ I would not draw too much out of the fact that there was a bomb on the day that she arrived .
There have been bombs , unfortunately , going off pretty consistently .
It ’s just an indication of the seriousness of this common challenge we have . ”
Later in her visit , Clinton reportedly angered Pakistani authorities with some pointed remarks during a roundtable meeting with newspaper editors in Lahore , suggesting that Pakistan had failed to do all it could to flush Al Qaeda from safe havens along the Afghan border .
“ I find it hard to believe that nobody in your government knows where they are , and could n’t get to them if they really wanted to , ” she said .
After an audience and joint appearance with King Mohammed VI in the Moroccan town of Ouarzazate Monday , Clinton was set to meet with several Arab foreign ministers in Marrakesh , including Saudi minister Saud al - Faisal .
She was then slated to address the press alongside Moroccan Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri Monday evening .
CORAL HARBOUR , NUNAVUT–Battling hypothermia and freezing skin , a teenage hunter was forced to shoot and kill a polar bear as he waited for more than a day to be rescued from a large chunk of drifting sea ice in the Canadian North .
The 17 - year - old was treated for hypothermia in Churchill , Man. , after being rescued Monday .
The teen and his 67 - year - old uncle , who were polar bear hunting , were reported missing late Saturday , said Ed Zebedee , director of the Nunavut government 's protection services branch .
The pair 's snowmobile broke down 18 kilometres from Coral Harbour , a tiny community on Nunavut 's Southampton Island in the northern part of Hudson Bay .
Walking toward the community to get help , they were separated .
A large chunk of ice broke off , setting the teen adrift , said Zebedee .
Searchers picked up the uncle Sunday morning .
Sometime before Sunday afternoon , the teen , who was armed with a rifle , encountered three bears , likely a female and two older cubs , on the same large ice pan .
One bear , likely the adult , got too close .
" He did have to shoot the polar bear to protect himself , " said Zebedee .
" There were two other bears on the ice pan but they stayed away from him so he did n't shoot at them at all . "
The two cubs remained with the carcass and the teen positioned himself as far away from them as he could .
Jean - Pierre Sharp , with the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Canadian Forces Base Trenton in Ontario , said an aerial search was launched Sunday morning .
A pilot on a small plane chartered by a government search - and - rescue agency spotted the teen Sunday afternoon and also saw the carcass of a bear .
Zebedee said the crew dropped a plastic container of chocolate bars and candy to the youth .
Neither that plane nor a Hercules aircraft that spotted the teen was able to rescue him before nightfall , and after they lost sight of him , the search continued overnight .
On Monday morning , the crew on the military search - and - rescue aircraft again spotted the youth .
Two search - and - rescue technicians parachuted to a larger ice floe a short distance away .
" Even after spending hours alone , huddling in temperatures that dipped below - 15C , the teen appeared to be in decent shape , " Sharp said .
" He was conscious , slightly hypothermic and appeared to have some frostbite . "
The two remaining bears were still in the area , Zebedee said .

About an hour later , searchers in a small boat from Coral Harbour took the teen and rescuers to shore .

( CNN ) --
The city of New Haven , Connecticut , will promote 14 firefighters who were involved in a workplace discrimination case that worked its way to the U.S. Supreme Court .
The firefighters were among the New Haven 20 -- one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters -- who fought the city after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam that left too few minorities qualified for promotions .
A U.S. District Court issued a judgment finding the city violated the civil rights of a group of the white firefighters when it threw out the exams in 2004 , according to Jessica Mayorga , city spokeswoman .
The Tuesday decision follows a court action by seven black New Haven firefighters seeking to delay the promotions .
" Yesterday , the court entered an order that provides the City of New Haven with the legal sanction necessary to move forward and promote the fourteen plaintiffs in the Ricci case entitled to promotions , " the city said in a statement .
" As a result , we intend to do so as soon as practicable . "
The firefighters will be promoted to either lieutenant or captain .
Mayorga said the other six involved in the lawsuit were not eligible for promotions that were available at the time the exams were given .
She said the court 's order only addresses 14 of the 20 plaintiffs .
If the exams had been certified in 2004 , the other six plaintiffs would not have been promoted .
The case was the center of attention during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of now - Justice Sonia Sotomayor , who was on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that backed the city in the case .
The U.S. Supreme Court eventually overturned the appeals court ruling 5 - 4 earlier this year when the justices ruled that the city improperly threw out the results of the promotion exams .
Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotion exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in Connecticut 's second - largest city .
New Haven 's personnel department had contracted with a private firm to design the exams .
When the results came back , however , city lawyers expressed concern about the results because none of the black firefighters and only one Latino who took the exam scored high enough to be promoted .
The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII , employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a " disparate impact " on a protected class , such as a specified race or gender .
The group of firefighters , claiming they were wronged by the city 's action , then sued , calling themselves the " New Haven 20 . "
Call of Duty Classic Available for 1200 MS Points Starting Wednesday
Larry Hryb , the Xbox Live Director of Programming better known by his moniker , Major Nelson , announced this afternoon via Twitter and his website majornelson.com that Call of Duty Classic will be available for 1200 points via Xbox Live on Wednesday , December 2nd .
Call of Duty Classic is a downloadable version of the original Call of Duty , which followed American , British , and Soviet soldiers in the fight against Hitler ’s Third Reich during World War II .
The game , originally released in 2003 , now looks dated , but is still a stunning example of epic game design and was the first to revolutionize ideas taken for granted today such as renewable health .
The most famous of the scenes in Call of Duty is the Soviet charge up the banks of the Volga River and into the city of Stalingrad as bullets and shells burst all around .
You are n’t given a weapon – you have to try and recover ammunition from fallen soldiers .
Furthermore , the game shocked many with its depiction of Stalin ’s order to “ not turn around , ” in which retreating Soviet soldiers would be shot by their own men .
The game was a huge hit and was a landmark for World War II games , taking the tried - and - true Medal of Honor formula and making you a soldier who was part of a unit rather than a single man fighting against a huge army .
The release is the latest in the Call of Duty franchise , following shortly on the heels of Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , which produced $ 550 million in revenue in its first week .
Call of Duty Classic has been available for download via Xbox Live and PSN for owners of the Hardened and Prestige Editions of Modern Warfare 2 since its release .
Call of Duty Classic is produced by Infinity Ward and published by Activision .
A suburban Illinois politician will be told the name of a man who allegedly made disparaging remarks about her teenaged son on a newspaper website 's comment section , a local judge has ruled .
During a bitterly contested election in Buffalo Grove , Illinois , an online flamewar erupted on the website of the local rag , the Daily Herald , about a candidate for Village Trustee , Lisa Stone .
In the user comments section , Stone 's 15 - year - old son became upset over posts by a person using the screen name Hipcheck16 and entered into a back - and - forth argument , the Chicago Tribune reports .
During the course of the row , Hipcheck16 allegedly made " deeply disturbing , " comments towards Stone 's son .
The paper says that at one point , Stone 's son challenged to him to debate the issues in person - in which Hipcheck16 responded " Seems like you 're very willing to invite a man you only know from the Internet over to your house - have you done it before , or do they usually invite you to their house ? "
Stone said the comment crosses the line , and petitioned to Cook County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Lawrence by way of a pre-suit subpoena that the Daily Herald should reveal the identity of Hipcheck16 .
She claims the comment was directed to a minor and was defamatory .
The newspaper was only able to supply the reader 's IP address , leading mama Stone to include Comcast in the filing .
In a six - page written ruling , Judge Lawrence said the poster 's name and address can be turned over to Stone , her attorneys and staff , and law enforcement so she can take legal action .
Her attorney tells the Tribune that First Amendment free speech protections are only designed to protect anonymous political debate , but not what he defines as sexual insinuations about children .
The attorney who is representing Hipcheck16 , known in court documents as " John Doe , " said his client has not decided whether to appeal , arguing the comments were innocent and are being " mischaracterized " by Stone .
The article 's comment thread still exists , although the relevant posts at the end have been removed for violating the newspaper website 's terms of service . ®

Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith has said that the band could be releasing a new album by November 2010 .
Speaking to Clash Magazine , Smith said that a follow - up to their mammoth 2006 effort Stadium Arcadium could be finished " Some time next year , maybe this time [ next year ] " .
" We ’re gonna write for a while , it usually takes us a while " , he said .
The band ended a two - year hiatus in October , after taking a break following the touring cycle for Stadium Arcadium .
RHCP bassist Flea has since collaborated with Thom Yorke ( Radiohead ) , while Smith has spent time with Chickenfoot ( Sammy Hagar , Joe Satriani ) and recorded his own solo album to go along with guitarist John Frusciante ‘s solo efforts .
NCA HOUSTON CELIAC SUPPORT GROUP
WHAT IS CELIAC DISEASE ?
Celiac Disease ( CD ) {also called non-tropical sprue , celiac sprue , gluten sensitive enteropathy , non-celiac sensitivity or autoimmune malabsorption syndrome} is a chronic digestive disorder affecting genetically susceptible individuals igluten intolerancen which the surface of the small intestine is damaged by eating gluten - containing grains such as wheat , barley , rye and oats .
Oats are generally contaminated with wheat .
Triticale , spelt , kamut , and malt ( barley ) contain gluten as well .
There are over 200 symptoms of CD and they vary so widely that there is no such thing as a typical case .
The symptoms of celiac disease are as varied as the nutritional deficiencies caused by the lack of absorption .
However , the most common symptoms are chronic diarrhea , or constipation , pale and bulky stools , abdominal cramping , intestinal gas , distention and bloating , anemia , fatigue , weakness , lack of energy , weight loss , depression , and irritability .
Now the most typical symptoms tend to be outside the digestive tract , ( e.g. , brain fog , constipation , dental abnormalities , electrolyte imbalance , elevated liver enzymes , headaches , focus problems , ataxia , infertility / miscarriages , pain in bones and / or joints , Osteopenia / osteoporosis ; and the skin presentation Dermatitis Herpetiformis ) .
Prevalence of CD in the U.S. is now thought to be at least 1 in 133 , or higher , from a 3 - year study by the Center for Celiac Disease .
The percentage is 1 % world wide .
A related skin condition known as dermatitis herpetiformis ( DH ) can also occur .
DH causes intense itchy , blistering outbreaks usually on the elbows , knees and feet .
CD and DH are so closely linked that 80 % of DH patients have the same bowel sensitivity to gluten as CD patients .
DIAGNOSIS
The most definitive test to confirm CD is a small bowel biopsy .
The biopsy involves the insertion of a small , flexible tube down the throat and on to the small intestine to retrieve tissue samples .
Although this procedure wo n't make most people 's list of favorite things to do , it is relatively quick and painless .
There is a special panel of 4 or 5 antibody tests that may be done as screening tests before the endoscope procedure .
One must be eating gluten for all of these tests to be as accurate as possible .
TREATMENT
Unfortunately , there are no pills , shots or operations to cure celiac disease .
The only known treatment is complete , lifelong avoidance of all products containing gluten .
After beginning the gluten - free diet , you should notice improvement within a few days to a few weeks , depending on the degree of sensitivity and the severity of the damage , but healing might not take place for up to a year .
THE GLUTEN - FREE DIET
The gluten - free ( GF ) diet is not as simple as it may seem .
You will be surprised to learn that gluten is hidden in many food products , like soups , salad dressings , medicines , vitamins , vinegars and ice cream .
It can even be in the glue on stamps and envelopes .
Further complicating matters is the fact that food labeling laws are not precise enough , although they are much better .
Prescription medications as well as over - the - counter medications generally do not test for or label for wheat or gluten .
Many CD patients have other food allergies , such as to dairy , soy or MSG .
So it 's more than a matter of simply not eating bread , pasta , regular oatmeal and breaded fried foods .
But it may be as easy as choosing a different brand .
Read all food labels every time !
Cross contamination is a problem at home and when you go out to eat .
Beware of toasters , food preparation surfaces , pasta cooking water , and spreads , shared utensils , colander / strainers , fryolater and deep fryers .
SO ... WHAT CAN I EAT ?
Cheer up !
You do n't have to live on bananas and boiled rice .
You can eat any food that does n't contain wheat , barley , rye or regular oats in any form .
Acceptable foods include fresh meats , fish , salads ( be careful of salad dressings ) , vegetables and fruit .
GOOD NEWS !
The good news is that you do n't have a disease requiring hospitalization , constant medication or long - term suffering -- at least not if you follow a strict gluten - free diet .
If you change your eating habits , you can eliminate the symptoms of CD and live a normal life .
Constant scrutiny and control of food intake is the only defense a person with celiac disease and / or DH has against gliadin - induced illness .
Thousands of others around the world have done it and so can you .
It may not be easy .
You wo n't be able to go to your favorite burger place any more , or to that wonderful pizza parlor you love so much .
But it will be a small price to pay for good health .
As soon as you eliminate all sources of gluten from your diet , your overall health will improve .
The NCA Houston Celiac Support Group has investigated many restaurant for you ( over 100 pages ) .
With appropriate substitutions , the diet can be quite acceptable .
Combinations of rice , corn , soy , potato starch , bean and tapioca flours are used to make gourmet breads , cakes , cookies , pastas and pizzas .
Your doctor and dietitian do n't have to live with these dietary restrictions every day and can't keep up with the multitude of product changes .
From here on , YOU are responsible for your own healing .
It is important to fully educate yourself about CD .
You will become an expert in what is allowable and what is not .
If you are not sure about a food item , you may contact the manufacturer and your local support group .
It may take you a while to get used to your new lifestyle .
And because you will not be eating the same as everybody else , you may be perceived as " different " .
By preparing your own meals , " brown bagging " at work , and calling ahead when you go to restaurants , you can be a part of the group and fit in just like everybody else .
It will just take a little more work than before .
We are lucky that there are many GF specialty food vendors who produce good GF flour mixes and food products for those who can not eat wheat / gluten .
Therefore , you can easily add more variety into your GF diet .
We suggest you start with GF mixes ( e.g. , GF brownie mixes , cookie mixes , GF bars , etc. ) rather than buy a lot of different flours .
More information is available from your support group , NCA , and the many good GF cookbooks .
Support groups play the important role of helping identify what foods are free from gluten , how to adjust recipes , and give updates on where to locate foods that are free from the offending grains .
These resource groups provide continuing education on CD , encouragement , and practical help in coping with this often frustrating condition in order to contribute to your continued health and well - being .
THE CHALLENGE OF CD
Grains are so prevalent in our modern culture that it is difficult to get away from them .
Wheat , at least , seems to be everywhere .
You will be surprised to learn just how many places grains can turn up .
They sneak their way into foods that on the surface seem completely harmless for celiacs .
You have to read labels , check menus , call restaurants , question cooks and do anything it takes to be doubly sure you are not eating any offending grain products .
HELP IS HERE
You may think you are the only person in the world with this unusual condition .
However , there are actually thousands of people in the U.S. with celiac disease .
These fellow celiacs are members of support groups all across the country and those sponsored by the National Celiac Association .
The support groups meet regularly to discuss issues related to celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis .

The message Are You Good Without God ?
Millions Are. will be appearing on ten TriMet buses for at least the next month .
Something tells me this campaign wo n’t be as controversial in Portland as in some other cities .
The Portland Area Coalition of Reason , with help from the national group , United Coalition of Reason , has purchased ad space on 10 buses in Portland .
Similar ads will also be appearing on transit vehicles in New York City , Philadelphia , and Boston , and on billboards in Chicago , Newark , San Diego , and three cities in Ohio .
The campaign is coordinated with the release of the book Good Without God : What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe by Greg Epstein , the humanist chaplain at Harvard University .
( He will be speaking about the book at Reed College on Thursday , November 19th . )
The Portland Coalition of Reason is a collection of non-theist groups in the Portland area , all of which are comfortable with people expressing skepticism , atheism , humanism , freethought , or other similar views , and exploring issues of the day based on reason and critical thought rather than religious dogma .
Hat tip to the Friendly Atheist
Does the Bible condone slavery ?
Question : " Does the Bible condone slavery ? "
Answer :
There is a tendency to look at slavery as something of the past .
But it is estimated that there are today over 27 million people in the world who are subject to slavery : forced labor , sex trade , inheritable property , etc .
As those who have been redeemed from the slavery of sin , followers of Jesus Christ should be the foremost champions of ending human slavery in the world today .
The question arises , though , why does the Bible not speak out strongly against slavery ?
Why does the Bible , in fact , seem to support the practice of human slavery ?
The Bible does not specifically condemn the practice of slavery .
It gives instructions on how slaves should be treated ( Deuteronomy 15:12 - 15 ; Ephesians 6:9 ; Colossians 4:1 ) , but does not outlaw slavery altogether .
Many see this as the Bible condoning all forms of slavery .
What many fail to understand is that slavery in biblical times was very different from the slavery that was practiced in the past few centuries in many parts of the world .
The slavery in the Bible was not based exclusively on race .
People were not enslaved because of their nationality or the color of their skin .
In Bible times , slavery was based more on economics ; it was a matter of social status .
People sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay their debts or provide for their families .
In New Testament times , sometimes doctors , lawyers , and even politicians were slaves of someone else .
Some people actually chose to be slaves so as to have all their needs provided for by their masters .
The slavery of the past few centuries was often based exclusively on skin color .
In the United States , many black people were considered slaves because of their nationality ; many slave owners truly believed black people to be inferior human beings .
The Bible condemns race - based slavery in that it teaches that all men are created by God and made in His image ( Genesis 1:27 ) .
At the same time , the Old Testament did allow for economic - based slavery and regulated it .
The key issue is that the slavery the Bible allowed for in no way resembled the racial slavery that plagued our world in the past few centuries .
In addition , both the Old and New Testaments condemn the practice of “ man-stealing , ” which is what happened in Africa in the 16th to 19th centuries .
Africans were rounded up by slave - hunters , who sold them to slave - traders , who brought them to the New World to work on plantations and farms .
This practice is abhorrent to God .
In fact , the penalty for such a crime in the Mosaic Law was death : “ Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death ” ( Exodus 21:16 ) .
Similarly , in the New Testament , slave - traders are listed among those who are “ ungodly and sinful ” and are in the same category as those who kill their fathers or mothers , murderers , adulterers and perverts , and liars and perjurers ( 1 Timothy 1:8 – 10 ) .
Another crucial point is that the purpose of the Bible is to point the way to salvation , not to reform society .
The Bible often approaches issues from the inside out .
If a person experiences the love , mercy , and grace of God by receiving His salvation , God will reform his soul , changing the way he thinks and acts .
A person who has experienced God ’s gift of salvation and freedom from the slavery of sin , as God reforms his soul , will realize that enslaving another human being is wrong .
He will see , with Paul , that a slave can be “ a brother in the Lord ” ( Philemon 1:16 ) .
A person who has truly experienced God ’s grace will in turn be gracious towards others .
That would be the Bible ’s prescription for ending slavery .

White House announces end to HIV travel ban
Your Browser Does Not Support IFrames .
Updated 12:30 p.m.
By Garance Franke - Ruta
President Obama called the 22 - year ban on travel and immigration by HIV - positive individuals a decision " rooted in fear rather than fact " and announced the end of the rule - making process lifting the ban .
The president signed the Ryan White HIV / AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 at the White House Friday and also spoke of the new rules , which have been under development more more than a year .
" We are finishing the job , " the president said .
The regulations are the final procedural step in ending the ban , and will be published Monday in the Federal Register , to be followed by the standard 60 - day waiting period prior to implementation .
A ban on travel and immigration to the U.S. by individuals with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , was first established by the Reagan - era U.S. Public Health Service and then given further support when Sen. Jesse Helms ( R - N.C. ) added HIV to the travel - exclusion list in a move that was ultimately passed unanimously by the Senate in 1987 .
A 1990 -1991 effort to overturn the regulatory ban failed in the face of outcry and lobbying from conservative groups and bureaucratic turf disputes .
The ban was upheld in 1993 when Congress added it to U.S. immigration laws .
The Senate finally voted to overturn the ban as part of approving legislation reauthorizing funding for the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , or PEPFAR , in 2008 , and President Bush signed it into law on July 30 of that year .
Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and then - Sen. Gordon H. Smith ( R - Ore. ) led the process in the Senate .
" This really proves that immigration laws that exclude families and stigmatize individuals are destined to fail , " said Rachel B. Tiven , executive director of Immigration Equality , a group that has mobilized more than 20,000 comments in support of ending the ban .
" The climate has really changed , " she said , attributing the end of the ban to a diminishment in " misinformation about HIV and AIDS . "
The lifting of the ban removes one of the last vestiges of early U.S. AIDS policy .
" We 're thrilled that the ban has been lifted based on science , reason , and human rights .
Our hope is that this decision reflects a commitment to adopting more evidence - based policies when confronting the AIDS epidemic and developing a comprehensive national AIDS strategy , " said Kevin Robert Frost , CEO of amFAR , an AIDS research foundation .
Until today 's announcement , the U.S. was one of only 7 countries with laws that bar entry of people with HIV , the group noted .

Today ’s guest is Dr. Margaret Wehrenberg .
Dr. Wehrenberg is a clinical psychologist in Naperville , Illinois .
She is the author of six books on the treatment of anxiety and depression published by W.W. Norton , including , “ The Ten Best - Ever Depression Management Techniques : Understanding How Your Brain Makes You Depressed and What You Can Do to Change It ” and “ Anxiety + Depression : Effective Treatment of the Big Two Co- Occurring Disorders . ”
An international trainer of mental health professionals , Dr. Wehrenberg coaches people with anxiety via the internet and phone .
She ’s a frequent contributor to the award - winning magazine , Psychotherapy Networker and she blogs on depression for the magazine Psychology Today .
Dan :
What is the difference between sadness and depression and why do people confuse the two so often ?
Dr. Wehrenberg :
Because depression comprises sadness .
Sadness is a response to a specific situation in which we usually have some kind of loss .
The loss of a self - esteem , a loss of a loved one , the loss of a desired goal .
Depression is really more about the energy – whether it ’s mental energy or physical energy – to make an effective response .
So , sadness is an appropriate and transient emotion , but depression sticks around and affects all of our daily behaviors and interactions .
It is mostly a montage of flattering , still images of Saddam - some of him dressed in military uniform , others in a suit , even one astride a white horse .
One image shows his sons Odai and Qusai smiling with their father , and another their bodies after they and Saddam 's grandson , Mustafa , were killed in a July 2003 gunfight with US troops .
Push Button Objects ( or PBO ) is the alias of Edgar Farinas , a producer of IDM .
His style of music uses hip - hop as a underlying foundation , but with the addition of DSP - processed sounds , unusual samples , elements of electro , Detroit techno , Miami bass , jungle , and other musical rudiments somewhat alien to the genre of hip - hop , but with unique results .
PBO 's sound is comparable to his contemporaries like Prefuse 73 and Dabrye .
Farinas is also one - half of Ko- Wreck Technique , with DJ Craze , as well as recording an EP under the name Guineo .

Earlier this week , Opeth 's tour bus crashed into another car that made an unexpected U - turn in the middle of the highway as the band ( minus Åkerfeldt , Axenrot , Äkesson who had flown home to Sweden ) and their crew were on the way to Brussels / Belgium .
Nobody in the band or crew got hurt , but apparently the driver of the other car got critically injured ( and passed away later ) .
Opeth will go ahead and play the Brussels date on the 17th as well as the remaining shows of the Progressive nation tour .
Guitarist / vocalist Mikael Åkerfeldt has issued the following : " Myself , Axe , Fredrik and our soundman , Pontus Norgren decided to fly home to our families for a few days as the option would have been three days off in Brussels .
Now I hear that our bus apparently crashed into this other car making a unexpected U - turn in the middle of the highway .
Mendez [ bassist ] and Per [ keyboards ] were on the bus together with the rest of our crew but nobody got hurt .
They are however shocked and very shaken of course .
The driver in the other car was critically injured .
I 've not heard back from anyone yet regarding his progress but apparently it 's not looking very good .
Hoping for the best however .
I do n't know where or when this happened but I know the bus was heading from Dublin to Brussels .
I 'll let you know more as soon as I get some information , but as for now everyone in the band are safe and same with our crew .
As far as I know the only injured person was the driver of the other car , which obviously is horrible enough !
To be honest , I rarely think about things , accidents like this , but fuck man , it happens !
My mind 's all over the place and right now I do n't want to go back out .
But ... the show in Brussels on the 17th and the remaining part of the tour will go ahead as planned .
" But now it appears that the Opeth bus accident was actually the result of a suicide : their tour bus crashed into a driver aiming to take his own life .
Mikael Åkerfeldt explains : " I just got a text from [ Martin ] Mendez who says that the driver of the other car ( who made the U - turn ) that our bus crashed into , sadly passed away from his injuries .
On top of that it seems as if it was a deliberate death - stunt from his side as the police had found a suicide - letter in the car - wreck .
This is just getting more odd and scary , I tell ya .
I 've no idea who he was but I have to say our condoleances goes out to his family and loved ones anyways either though we do n't have a name at this point .
I 'm kinda lost for words here . "
The Benetton - Ford which Michael Schumacher won his first world championship with in 1994 is up for sale on eBay .
According to the seller it is the very car which Michael Schumacher used in the last race of the season , when he infamously crashed into title rival Damon Hill .
A bidding war has broken out for the Benetton B194 pushing the price up to ?�? �2.34 m (?����? �2.6 m ) with six days left before the auction closes .
The seller says the chassis is “ the F1 race car with which Michael Schumacher won his first Formula One Driver ?
������s Championship at the Adelaide GP of Australia . ”
That suggests it is chassis B194/ 8 which he started the race with .
He damaged his original chassis in a crash in Friday practice and the team had to build a new car from another monocoque .
Interestingly , the car is described as being : “ in condition as in the 1994 Formula One season with paddle shift and traction control . ”
The B194 was at the centre of controversy in 1994 when it was alleged the team were using a traction control system , which had been banned at the end of 1993 .
The car was found to have a hidden traction control system under a blank menu option – but the team went unpunished .
Schumacher won eight races in 1994 in the B194 ( not all of them in this car ) .
He also finished first at Spa but was disqualified .
More information on the car from the seller :
The car is in racing condition , with the painting and sponsoring scheme as in 1994 .
The engine was overhauled by Langford Performance Engineering / Wellingborough ( UK ) and was since then just running a few minutes for test and check reasons .
As you can see on the pictures , there are a lot of spare parts with the car .
The pictured boxes are full with brake , suspension , gear and axle parts .
Also the complete starter equipment is with the car , including the pre-heat unit and the hydraulic charging unit .
( see last two pictures ) .
Even with the car are two sets of wheels ( the mounted for raining condition and a set of slicks ) , front and rear wing and a laptop with software for configuration of the race car .
This is just a small and exemplary list of parts , it ?
������s a further bigger amount of parts with it .
For some F1 Grand Prix of the 1994 season absolved with this car are the FIA scrutineer passes given with the car .
The car is located in Canada / Toronto , a visit is possible and welcome .
Import duty and VAT for Germany are paid by the seller , car shipment will be done after a 30 % pay down on the price of sale .
If you ’ve got two - and - a - half million pounds burning a hole in your pocket , and some room in your garage , you can make a bid here .
Here ’s some more pictures of Schumacher ’s championship - winning 1994 Benetton - Ford B194 :

If you open Karen Armstrong 's new book , The Case for God , expecting to find a list of mysterious cures , scientific curiosities , or certified miracles all pointing toward the physical presence of a divine influence in the world , you will be sorely disappointed .
Armstrong has no interest in , and is in fact completely antithetical to , trying to prove God 's existence .
Despite this , her book is positioned -- both in marketing and from its opening pages -- as a direct challenge to books like Richard Dawkins '
The God Delusion , Sam Harris ' Letter to a Christian Nation , and Christopher Hitchens ' God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything .
How can you make a defense of God if you 've no interest in the existence of God ?
Quite well , actually , and if you do it as sharply as Armstrong , you can make hundreds of pages of what is basically theological analysis both entertaining and informative .
Armstrong argues for an idea very similar to the " non-overlapping magisteria " that were put forward by evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould ( and in fact , Gould gets several nice mentions in The Case for God ) .
She refers frequently to the idea that , in the past , people tended to break arguments into two groups for which she uses the Greek terms logos and mythos .
Logos reflects practical , immediate reasoning -- how do we build that aqueduct , what can we make from this wood , which crop would grow best in that field ?
Mythos is more aimed at the why -- what does it mean that my friend has died , how can I recapture the joy I felt in a moment of pure experience , how can I find meaning and peace among the world 's noise and violence ?
This sort of approach could easily fall into a gooey cheer for " being spiritual , " but Armstrong is not talking about having a nice little breathing session now and then .
She focuses on the 3000 year history of monotheism and the great effort that was put into building flexible , thoughtful religions , on how those religions continue to have a meaningful role in the life of millions , and how the recent history of those religions has led to unfortunate developments that are unique over those three millennia .
No civilization of the past thought it could get by without logos .
Pyramids were built with extensive use of mathematics and the most advanced technology of the time .
The same could be said of the Acropolis and of medieval cathedrals .
When we see those past societies as ignorant and driven out of unreasoning " myths " it 's because we are the oddities of history .
Having acquired so much new data to feed logos over such a short time , we 've become completely centered in scientific reasoning and entirely dismissive of mythos -- perversely , that 's even true when we talk about fundamentalist religion .
We look back on some ritual of the past and dismiss it as mindless following of tradition and superstition .
You do n't need to plant at midnight , or sacrifice a lamb , or ferry a statue around the town to satisfy some some dumb animal - headed deity .
We search for the hint of reasoning that might be behind these rituals , and discount the idea that they served to establish meaning in lives that were just as busy , joyful , tragic , and brief as our own .
We 've turned " myth " into another word for fantasy , or lie .
In doing so :
We lost the art of interpreting the old tales of gods walking the earth , dead men striding out of tombs , or seas parting miraculously .
We began to understand concepts such as faith , revelation , myth , mystery , and dogma in a way that would have been very surprising to our ancestors .
In particular , the concept of faith comes in for a close examination .
We understand faith today as a kind of blind acceptance -- like Indiana Jones stepping off into space in his quest for the Holy Grail .
Religious people cheer this kind of " faith " and many Christians tout this as the one and only qualification to be among Christ 's chosen .
But that 's not what the word translated as " faith " meant in Biblical times .
It 's not even what it meant when the Bible was first translated into English .
The term used in most New Testament texts ( the Greek word pistis ) meant something closer to loyalty or commitment , than unreasoning belief .
When Jesus chastised his followers for their lack of faith , or commended a non-Jew for having faith , he was n't talking about some unspoken creed .
He certainly was n't praising them for seeing that he was divine .
He was talking about follow - through , about living up to ideas of selflessness and humbleness .
Even the word " belief " has changed from a Middle English sense of " prize " to our modern idea of " accept at face value . "
Imagine how different every Christian creed would sound today if we replace " believe in " with " value " and " have faith in " with " commit myself to . "
Unquestioning acceptance does n't figure into the vigorous ethical and theological debates that ran through street conversations and popular songs of previous centuries , and Armstrong sees it as an invention of modern religion .
Unable to separate logos and mythos , and trying to view everything through a lens of the logos - based society in which they live , fundamentalists reacted not by rediscovering the transcendent ideas of the past , but by inventing something new .
Instead of science and religion , they tried to build a scientific religion in which every aspect of the world must conform to a literal interpretation of scripture ( one that ignores the inherent , and quite intentional , contradictions built into that text ) .
Blind acceptance had to be inserted into the mix because only blind acceptance allows stepping around the wreck trying to force mythos to conform to logos makes of both .
If you look for reviews of Amrstrong 's book , you 'll find that that the harshest reviews are not from the general " secular " press , but from fundamentalists .
" Demon inspired " is one of the milder phrases you 'll encounter if you make a search for reactions from Christian fundamentalists .
Though the heart of the book is a lengthy examination of theology that starts with the paintings of Neolithic caves and ends with twenty - first century philosophers , do n't get the impression that Armstrong asserts that the meaning of religion can be found in a text -- whether that text is the Bible , the Torah , or her own book .
The Case for God might as well be called The Case for Religious Practice .
And by practice she does n't mean doing something once , she means doing it over , and over , and over -- like practicing piano -- until you discover the passion at the end of all that rote , mechanical repetition .
Religion ... was not primarily something that people thought , but something they did .
It 's truth was acquired by practical action .
It is no use imagining that you will be able to drive a car if you simply read the manual or study the rules of the road .
You cannot learn to dance , paint , or cook by perusing text or recipes .
The rules of a board game sound obscure , unnecessarily complicated , and dull until you start to play , when everything falls into place .
There are some things that can be learned only by constant , dedicated practice , but you find that you achieve something that seemed initially impossible .
Instead of sinking to the bottom of the pool , you can float , you may learn to jump higher and with more grace than seems humanly possible , or to sing with unearthly beauty .
You do not always understand how you achieved these feats , because your mind directs your body in a way that bypasses conscious logical deliberation , but somehow you learn to transcend your original capabilities .
Some of these activities bring indescribable joy .
A musician can lose herself in her music , a dancer becomes inseparable from the dance , and a skier feels entirely at one with himself and the external world as he speeds down the slope .
It is a satisfaction that goes deeper than merely " feeling good . "
It is what the Greeks called ekstatis , which means a stepping outside the norm .
Religion is a practical discipline that teaches us to discover new capacities of mind and heart .
...
It is no use magisterially weighing up the teachings of religion to judge their truth of falsehood before embarking on a religious way of life .
You will discover their truth -- or lack of it -- only if you translate those doctrines into ritual or ethical action .
Like any skill , religion requires perseverance , hard work , and discipline .
Not only does Armstrong see the blind acceptance of doctrine as an impediment to religious practice , she discounts the idea that religious beliefs can have any value unless they are placed into a framework of daily practice , commitment , and ethical action .
If you 're waiting for her to stop explaining where the fundamentalists went wrong and start her case against " Dawkins , Harris , and Hitchens , " you 're going to be disappointed again -- because Armstrong seems them as both as flip sides of the same coin .
Like all religious fundamentalists , the new athesists believe that they alone are in possession of the truth ; like Christian fundamentalists they read scripture in an entirely literal manner and seem to never have heard of the long tradition of allegoric or Talmudic interpretation ...
Harris seems to imagine that biblical inspiration means that the Bible was actually " written by God . "
Hitchens assumes that faith is entirely dependent on a literal reading of the Bible , and that , for example , the discrepancies in the gospel infancy narratives prove the falseness of Christianity : " Either the gospels are in some sense literal truth , or the whole thing is a fraud and perhaps a moral one at that . "
Like Protestant fundamentalists , Dawkins has a simplistic view of the moral teaching of the Bible , taking it for granted that its chief purpose is to issue clear rules of conduct and provide us with " role models , " which , not surprisingly , he finds lamentably inadequate .
He also presumes that since the Bible claims to be inspired by God it must also provide scientific information .
Dawkins ' only point of disagreement with the Protestant fundamentalists is that he finds the Bible unreliable about science while they do not .
Armstrong is not worried about the claim that God can't be found in science .
Which is , in fact , a very old claim .
In fact , the new atheists are not radical enough .
Jewish , Christian , and Muslim theologians have insisted for centuries that God does not exist and that there is " nothing " out there ...
Her concern is that the Hitchens , Harris , Dawkins camp concern themselves only with tackling a theology that is itself " decidedly unorthodox " and limited -- they want to knock down a sickly child and then proclaim they 've won the heavyweight title .
By taking on fundamentalism at both ends of the scale , Armstrong has assured that her book will draw the ire of both camps .
In the process she 's written a book that 's fascinating , packed with information about the history of religion and philosophy , and illuminating when it shows the paths we followed to end up where we find ourselves today ( from a political point of view , it 's very instructive to look at the origins of modern Christian fundamentalism and in particular to look at how mainstream Protestantism fanned the flames of a dying fundamentalist movement by heaping on ridicule ) .
If nothing else , The Case for God is a terrific reference -- and a splendid bit of long form argument .
If you 've read any of Karen Armstrong 's books in the past -- including her biography of the Buddha , or her personal account of losing faith as a young novitiate -- you 'll find some of the same points repeated here , but in new historical contexts .
If you have n't read her works before ... well , she warns you right in the introduction that this is n't exactly light reading .
If you do n't want to face detailed descriptions of theological conflicts and the development of religious frameworks , turn back now .
Whether anyone will find that argument convincing , in a world that 's increasingly divided into extremes , is difficult to say .
But at least it should inspire some good conversations .
Update [ 2009 - 11-8 11:6:2 by Devilstower ] :
One thing that I greatly regret leaving out of the initial review : if there is a " hero " in this book , it 's not God .
It 's Socrates .
You can see the admiration that Armstrong has for that Socratic dialog -- a deep challenging of beliefs , but one that takes place in a friendly and open environment .
The point of drawing a line between the fundamentalists and the Dawkins , Hitchens , Harris camp is n't to make an equivalence in beliefs , but an equivalence in approach .
That is , yelling past each other does n't lead to either side moving toward the middle .
In fact , that kind of approach has , many times in the past , been the spark for more extremism .
No matter what position we hold , I 'd like to think that in this place we can take that Socratic approach -- challenging , tough , but still friendly and not resorting to punching below the belt .

* Russia ’s powerful PM Putin meets local rappers
* Rappers chant : “ Respect , Vladimir Vladimirovich ”
MOSCOW , Nov 13 ( Reuters ) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin rubbed shoulders with rappers and was hailed with “ respect ” in a television show on Friday that could help boost his flagging ratings .
Putin , wearing a turtleneck sweater and jacket , went on stage to present awards to participants in “ Battle for Respect ” , a hip - hop music contest run by Muz TV , a Russian rival to MTV .
“ It would have been cool to record a joint track with Vladimir Putin because he is a legendary man and our idol , ” sang rapper Zhigan who won the contest .
“ Let ’s make so much noise in his honour that the whole world can hear . ”
A presenter told the audience of about 100 young rappers in a makeshift television studio in an abandoned Moscow factory building that he wanted “ smiles to stay on your faces throughout the evening ” .
Despite hip - hop ’s violent image , Putin had a stern message for the rappers about healthy living .
“ I do not think that ‘ top - rock ’ or ‘ down - rock ’ breakdance technique is compatible with alcohol or drugs , ” Putin told cheering hip - hoppers who responded with chants of “ Respect , Vladimir Vladimirovich ” .
Putin ’s approval ratings last month had the sharpest fall since he stepped down as Kremlin chief in May 2008 .
His rating fell 6 percentage points to 66 percent on Oct. 24 - 25 , according to leading pollster FOM .
[ ID :nL2370140 ]
Putin ’s aides responded with plans for a flurry of prime ministerial appearances , including a televised question - and - answer session with the Russian people this month .
Putin ’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied there was a link between the hip - hop appearance and the ratings fall .
“ Putin has a high and stable rating which does not require any support , ” said Peskov .
“ The main goal of this event was to contribute to the promotion of a healthy lifestyle . ”
Putin , who stepped down as president last year , remains Russia ’s most popular and powerful politician .
Most Russians believe he will run for President again in 2012 .
Putin ’s carefully orchestrated image also include bare - chested photos on fishing trips in Siberia , appearances with rare animals such as Siberian tigers , leopards and beluga whales and encounters with fringe social groups like bikers .
“ He communicates to all social groups .
Hip - hop culture is very popular and youths from all corners of our country are fans of this culture , ” Peskov said .

Coffs Harbour is on track for its wettest year since records began in 1942 .
So far the city has received 2,821 millimetres of rain .
Bureau of Meteorology climatologist , Agata Imielska , says the average rainfall is 1,683 millimetres .
She says the city only needs another 63 millimetres of rain to break the record .
" Going by what we expect to see in November and December , around 130 millimetres , we do expect that record to be broken by the end of the year , " she said .
" It 's a number of factors , for example having an upper level feature as well as a low pressure trough or an upper low or any of those things combined with a supply of moisture to Coffs Harbour can result in heavy falls in the area . "
Ms Imielska says the excess rainfall has been caused by an unsteady synoptic situation as well as warmer than normal ocean temperatures .
" In the previous events we 've had very warm temperatures , an easterly flow and a few other factors contributing to the falls that you 've had , " she said .
" So it 's already the second highest rainfall total on record and going by what we expect to see in November and December around 130 millimetres , we do expect that record to be broken by the end of the year . "
Bellingen has already had its wettest year on record , with a record 3,416 millimetres for the year so far .
The previous highest rainfall was 2,895 millimetres in 1921 .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Looking to work overseas ?
Head to Canada , Australia or Thailand , according to an annual global survey which found recession - hit Britain was one of the worst locations to live for expatriates .

The second annual Expat Experience survey , commissioned by HSBC Bank International , revealed that expats in Canada have the best quality of life and found it among the easiest places in the world to integrate with the local population .
Australia and Thailand also came in the top three in the survey of 3,146 people working in 30 different industries and 50 countries , even though Thailand was one of the countries worst - hit by the recession for expats .
“ We have seen that there is a distinct trade - off between income and overall quality of life , as many of the top performers ... scored toward the bottom of this report ’s league table ( of the best places to make and save money ) , ” said Betony Taylor , spokeswoman for HSBC Bank International .
“ What is clear is that the locations where salaries may not be as high , such as Canada and Australia , are where expats are really enjoying not only an increased quality of life but are also finding it easy to fit in to their new communities . ”
Last year Germany , Canada and Spain were the top three countries deemed to have the best lifestyle for expats .
This year Britain was one of the lowest ranked locations when it came to lifestyle after being named as one of the most expensive places for expats with the recession taking its toll .
About 44 percent of expats in Britain are considering returning home , compared with only 15 percent of expats overall .
About 41 percent of expats in Britain find it difficult to find somewhere to live , most find the quality of their accommodation drops after moving to Britain , and a third claim their health has deteriorated since moving there .
“ Despite this , the UK does hold the crown for being expat entertainment capital of the world , with over half ( 58 percent ) of expats in the UK saying that the quality of entertainment had increased , ” said Taylor .
She added that 62 percent of expats also said that employment prospects were the main reason keeping them in the region .
Results from a different section of the survey , which was conducted by research company FreshMinds , released earlier found Russia was home to the highest proportion of expats earning more than $ 250,000 with 30 percent of international workers there banking that amount , followed by Hong Kong and Japan .
The lowest - paid expats live in Australia and Belgium with the majority -- 63 percent and 61 percent respectively -- earning less than $ 100,000 .

Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan , the 39 - year - old Army psychiatrist accused of Thursday ’s mass shooting at Fort Hood , Tex. , had recently expressed deep concerns about being sent to Afghanistan .
His cousin , Nader Hasan , said that Major Hasan had counseled scores of soldiers with post - traumatic stress disorder and was “ mortified ” about being deployed .
So much is still unknown about the case , but among the many issues raised is the question of post - traumatic stress among caregivers .
Is this an issue experts in trauma treatment consider ?
Secondary Stress Disorder
Charles Figley holds an endowed professorship in disaster mental health and trauma at Tulane University .
He is founding president of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies , founding editor of the “ Journal of Traumatic Stress ” and editor of “ Traumatology . ”
Exposure to case after case of combat - related stress injuries often has negative effects for the caregivers who handle these cases .
Yet in many instances , those professionals ( not to mention family members ) do not get proper attention and care for their emotional needs .
Service branches are recognizing the extraordinary problems of secondary trauma on caregivers .
My research on secondary traumatic stress — defined as the consequent stress and emotions caused by helping a traumatized and suffering person — has found that the negative effects can be similar to those of primary exposure .
Military caregivers are especially vulnerable because ( a ) the high concentration of trauma patients they see ; ( b ) inability to change jobs ; ( c ) their focus is on readiness and keeping the troops sufficiently healthy to be re-deployed ; ( d ) the expectation of being deployed ( often multiple times ) , and ; ( e ) the complexity of providing treatment while fighting the fear , stigma and embarrassment of active duty personnel who are forced to seek such treatment .
Read more …
All branches of service recognize the extraordinary problems of secondary trauma and have implemented programs to help .
The Army , for example , has the formed the Provider Resilience Training Program for this very purpose .
In many cases , the caregivers can suffer from intrusive imagery , avoidance of reminders and cues , hyperarousal , distressing emotions , and functional impairment including anxiety disorders .
In the most extreme cases , secondary stress may warrant a diagnosis of post - traumatic stress disorder .
There are other names for this effect , including “ compassion fatigue ” and “ vicarious trauma . ”
This is more than “ burnout ” or even anxiety caused by poor social support at a difficult workplace .
Much can be done to help promote wellness and resilience among military caregivers .
First is self - awareness to identify changes as a result of working with the traumatized .
The first sign is elevations in stress and / or depression that is accompanied by problems of sleep .
Second , developing a trusting relationship with another — fellow counselor , chaplain , or other type of caregiver — to disclose what is being experienced .
Third , the caregiver needs to get the right kind of help .
Sometimes , but not always , that means therapy .
While military installations need to create supportive work environments , it is critical that family members be assertive with the caregiver if they see problems and make them get the help they need .
What Caregivers Need
Laurie Anne Pearlman , a clinical psychologist , is a member of the complex trauma task force of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies .
Trauma treatment experts are increasingly aware of the potential negative effects of providing assistance to traumatized persons .
Even seasoned clinicians can , at times , need clinical help .
These effects can take any or all of the following forms : vicarious trauma ( a personal transformation in the caregiver that results from engaging with and feeling a sense of responsibility for a traumatized patient or client ) , compassion fatigue ( an exhaustion of the helper ’s ability to respond compassionately ) , burnout ( a gap between what the caregiver can give and what s/he is expected to give ) , and countertransference ( an activation of the helper ’s personal issues in response to a particular client or patient ) .
Read more …
Everyone who provides care to traumatized people needs his or her own support systems , both personal and professional .
Personal support includes making time for non-work and non-trauma - work experiences , community , and connection with whatever gives meaning to each caregiver ’s life .
Professional support should include training in working with trauma survivors and on - going clinical consultation , even for seasoned clinicians .
In addition , trauma therapists and counselors require adequate time off , access to mental health care , and opportunities to talk about the work in confidential professional settings .
What I Worry About
Kristin Henderson is married to a Navy chaplain and the author of “ While They ’re at War : The True Story of American Families on the Homefront . ”
My husband just left on his third war zone deployment .
So far , this one has been the easiest — we know more and knowledge is empowering .
Plus , for the first time he ’s not constantly on the move and under fire .
Instead , he ’s on a base , the chaplain at a combat hospital .
Rockets and mortars sometimes hit the base but rarely result in casualties .
Physically , he ’s safer than ever before .
That ’s not what I worry about .
Who takes care of the caregivers in the military ?
What worries me is that for the next six months he will help care for children and young service members who ’ve been blown apart or shot .
He ’ll support the medical staff who fight to save their lives .
He ’ll absorb their pain .

By regulation , a chaplain is the only person in the military to whom you can confess anything and trust that the conversation will remain confidential .
The chaplain ca n’t talk about it with anyone else unless you give the chaplain permission .
That ’s why , if you ’re on the edge and want help but fear it might hurt your career , the chaplain is often the first person you tell .
Chaplains are n’t equipped to treat something like post - traumatic stress disorder , but they , like my husband , can and do help suffering service members realize they ’re not alone .
He helps them reach out to mental health caregivers , provides spiritual and moral guidance , and keeps all the details to himself .
My husband wants to do this work .
It ’s the most worthwhile , satisfying part of his job .
Yet it takes a toll , and who takes care of the caregivers ?
The price of pain is usually hidden from the public because most caregivers , like most suffering service members , do n’t go on rampages .
Usually , if there ’s a price to be paid , only the family pays it .
As a military wife , that ’s my biggest worry .
Healing Oneself
Peter P. Vitaliano is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences , psychology and health services at the University of Washington , Seattle .
Given the horrific events that took place on Thursday at Fort Hood , many are asking why and how this could have happened and if it could have been prevented .
Caregivers all bring their own vulnerabilities to their work .
There is no question that there is extensive research to suggest that full time caregivers , whether they are paid or not paid , are at risk for problems of their own .
Of course , many caregivers do not have problems and others do seek help .
It ’s important to understand that individuals who perform services for others , whether they are physicians , airline pilots , or unpaid family caregivers , all bring their own vulnerabilities to their work and these interact with their environments to influence their thoughts , emotions and behaviors .
We do n’t yet know all the facts about the Fort Hood gunman or his motives .
News reports have indicated that he told relatives that other soldiers harassed .
Many organizations that employ mental health workers have venues for them to express their feelings and to receive feedback .
It is unclear if Dr. Hasan had ever articulated his beliefs to colleagues who could have helped him .
Read more …
If he had been isolated , he may not have been able to express his beliefs and receive constructive feedback about their validity .
What we do know is that his situation was not unique .
But his reported anxiety about deploying to a war for which he had counseled returning soldiers may have been a factor that made him snap .
His horrific action ca n’t be explained rationally .
Still , the fact is , professional caregivers who have been trained to spot trouble in others are not necessarily able , when under stress and isolation , to see that they themselves need help .
Combat Stress
Is on the Rise
Helen Benedict , a professor of journalism at Columbia University , is the author of “ The Lonely Soldier : The Private War of Women Serving in Iraq ” and a novel , “ The Edge of Eden . ”
Whatever drove Major Hasan to shoot 13 people to death and wound 28 more at Fort Hood yesterday is still unknown , but his violence draws attention to the bitter toll taken on U.S. troops by this country ’s seemingly endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
P.T.S.D. takes a toll on the troops , their loved ones and the people who take care of them .
The veterans of these wars are suffering higher rates of trauma and breakdown than this country has seen for decades , so high that neither the military nor the Department of Veterans Affairs appears to able to cope .
Veterans often have to wait months for treatment , and many have to travel for miles to find a VA hospital or clinic .
Apple has made a new resource available to iPhone application developers called the App Store Resource Center intended to assist devs in steps such as app submission and managing applications once they are in the store .
The move is no doubt a reaction to displeasure with the way the store is being run , particularly the submission and approval process .
In an e-mail sent to registered iPhone developers announcing the service , Apple touts the new section as a place for questions and guidance .
This sounds good on the surface — until you talk to the developers .
According to one developer who spoke to Ars on the condition of anonymity , the App Store Resource Center is merely " a collection of documents that were already out there , just condensed into one place . "
Additionally , Apple " did n't really fix anything that was broken " and has " done nothing as far as I 'm concerned . "
The developer in question went as far as calling Apple 's latest attempt at helping the developer community " totally useless . "
A second developer we spoke to echoed those statements , agreeing that the resource seemed fairly useless .
According to this dev , what the community really needs is " a simple , straightforward list of criteria .
The list should be sectioned , and ideally provide example scenarios that they 've actually rejected apps for , and what people fixed / change to get it re-approved thereafter . "
Giving an average time for review is n't what people want — they want a page that shows their applications and where they are in the process .
The consensus seems to be that this is nothing more then a lame stunt aimed at taking some of the heat off the review and approval process .
Apple knows what it needs to do to make the store more app - friendly , and it is n't a webpage full of already available information aimed at placating frustrated developers .
The first question is simply : why ?
What 's wrong with the existing copyright laws , and the powers that they offer , that Lord Mandelson think they need tweaking so that anyone can be given powers to hunt down someone thought to be infringing copyright , and new powers have to be given so that certain acts are deemed to be illicit ?
If you 're not up to speed , Lord Mandelson wants sweeping new powers , which involve changing the Copyright , Designs and Patent Act of 1988 .
Let 's pause for a moment and look at the single part of the letter to Harriet Harman where he actually cites some particular problems .
He talks about " cyberlockers " – online digital storage – which he acknowledges have perfectly legal uses , but which he says are also used by people to share files illegally .
Well , he 's right .
This is true .
You may recall Apple 's " iTools " service – which is what its online cloud service was called when it was launched in January 2000 for free ( 20 whole megabytes of storage ! ) and before it was made paid - for in July 2002 and rebranded as " . Mac " .
Part of the reason for shifting to paid - for , I learnt from an Apple employee ( who for obvious reasons must remain nameless ) , was that Apple discovered rather quickly that if you offer people free storage on the web , then while lots of people will use it for good , honest reasons , a small percentage will use it for bad ones .
Chasing the people who were storing warez such as cracked copies of Photoshop on the iTools servers became a cat - and - mouse game where there were rather more mice than cats .
That was part of why Apple turned it into a paid - for service .
However , at no point did the US government step in and try to close Apple down .
Nor did it find it necessary to create new laws nor offences to criminalise the warez - storers ( who were perfectly aware that what they were doing was n't legal ) , nor did it find any need to give Apple new powers to stop its service being abused .
So the question over this proposal is : what is n't working at present in our laws that means we need changes to strengthen copyright and delegate powers to " any person as may be specified with or for the purposes of facilitating prevention of reduction of online infringement of copyright " ?
It 's especially ironic during a week when Gordon Brown and Tim Berners - Lee pledged to loosen the ties of copyright on government - collected map data , as the government recognised that public data ought to belong to the public .
The particular objection that Mandelson seems to have to " cyberlockers " ( ca n't we just say " cloud storage " ? ) is that someone can share a private URL with someone else , and nobody on the outside is any the wiser that the file exchange has taken place .
In its way , it 's like a very slow peer - to - peer system ; certainly there 's no real way that it threatens to become anything like the volume of file - sharing , because sending people URLs and getting them to download stuff puts noticeable load on the servers of the storage company .
If it 's anything like Apple , it 's going to notice the demand .
Believe me , every company that offers cloud storage knows about the warez problem : they run all sorts of tests against uploaded files , and even files that traverse their networks : thus I discovered , for example , while cleaning out the Free Our Data site from a hacker attack , that I could n't email a hacker control panel I 'd discovered to someone who was helping : Google analysed the file and blocked it from passing over its servers .
Yet it seems to be that aspect of the invisibility of the URLs that 's really troubling the people who are lobbying Mandelson ( because this is obviously not something he 's discovered from surfing the net ; I do , a lot , and I 've not seen anyone complaining about the Evil of Cyberlocker Copyright Infringement ) .
Search engines are n't allowed into those " cyberlockers " to index their content ; it 's as private as robots .
txt can make it .
Yet in my subsequent conversation with Stephen Timms , the minister who is now the financial secretary to the Treasury but oversaw much of the drafting of the digital economy bill while at the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , I did n't get any clear answer to what part of the existing Copyright Act does n't work against cyberlockers .
Is there some concern that hackerz are going to put cracked copied of Photoshop onto Amazon 's S3 and run it as a web app ?
If they can manage that , they deserve to be hired by a Microsoft - killer , not hunted down by what BoingBoing is calling " The Pirate - Finder General " .
All in all , I 'm left severely puzzled by the consultation process that has n't gone on here .
The DBIS says it has had its public consultation on the Digital Britain plans .
So where , and when , did this cyberlocker business come from ?
It 's said to be a last - minute insertion by Mandelson into the bill , published earlier today .
Who came to him with it ?
And finally , Timms says that any suggestion of changing the copyright act would first go through a " very , very public consultation " .
Is that like the " big debates " that we hear so much about from the government ?
Fat lot of good they 've done for things like the status of cannabis .
While I think we can all agree that cracking software is n't ethical , legal , or moral , neither is taking on powers that could be used in entirely unpredictable ways .
And I still come back to the self - correcting nature of the internet , and businesses .
What 's been killing file - sharing ?
Not the action of record labels or ISPs ; it 's been the action of businesses like Spotify and We7 , offering better models for access to music of guaranteed quality .
What 's been stopping cracked software being uploaded to online storage sites ?
The self - interest of the companies owning the sites , which know that the crackers will use above - average amounts of bandwidth and storage ( indeed , that 's almost the metric for finding cracked stuff on one of those sites : investigate the busiest , most demanding users ) .
We could do with similar action to cut out botnets and spam , but there are n't any big - money lobbyists coming to Mandelson pleading loss of business through those .
Perhaps if the banks were forced to bear all the costs of online fraud , they 'd suddenly discover an interest in handing out properly secure systems – such as Linux systems on memory sticks which you'd be obliged to boot into if you wanted online banking via a PC .
But for now , the logic behind this government 's desire to take on more powers than it can demonstrate any need for is worrying .
As Tony Hirst of the Open University observed on Twitter , we have n't needed to alter the law on murder , despite the invention of electricity and other means of carrying out the act : it 's still illegal in itself .
The mechanisms of copyright infringement are irrelevant to the act .
So what is it exactly that Lord Mandelson actually wants ?
Peter Pan would be so happy .
About a year from now , if all goes well , a box about the size of a loaf of bread will pop out of a rocket some 500 miles above the Earth .
There in the vacuum it will unfurl four triangular sails as shiny as moonlight and only barely more substantial .
Then it will slowly rise on a sunbeam and move across the stars .
LightSail - 1 , as it is dubbed , will not make it to Neverland .
At best the device will sail a few hours and gain a few miles in altitude .
But those hours will mark a milestone for a dream that is almost as old as the rocket age itself , and as romantic : to navigate the cosmos on winds of starlight the way sailors for thousands of years have navigated the ocean on the winds of the Earth .
“ Sailing on light is the only technology that can someday take us to the stars , ” said Louis Friedman , director of the Planetary Society , the worldwide organization of space enthusiasts .
Even as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration continues to flounder in a search for its future , Dr. Friedman announced Monday that the Planetary Society , with help from an anonymous donor , would be taking baby steps toward a future worthy of science fiction .
Over the next three years , the society will build and fly a series of solar - sail spacecraft dubbed LightSails , first in orbit around the Earth and eventually into deeper space .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday banned overdraft fees on automated - teller - machine and debit - card transactions unless consumers have actively selected an overdraft protection service .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke addresses an audience in Chatham , Massachusetts October 23 , 2009 .

The rules go into effect on July 1 .
“ The final overdraft rules represent an important step forward in consumer protection , ” Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement .
The rules do not cover fees for overdrawn checks , Fed officials told reporters .
The Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- found that consumers were willing to pay fees to ensure that any overdrawn checks are paid , the officials said .
Nor do the rules bar fees on transactions from recurring debit - card transactions , such as ones consumers set up to make regular payments , the officials added .
Overdraft fees charged by banks total some $ 25 billion to $ 38 billion a year , officials said .
ATM and debit card transactions are typically discretionary purchases , the officials said .
Consumers frequently use checks for bills that they want paid no matter what .
Bank regulators have been under pressure to beef up consumer protections following a financial collapse brought on in part by reckless lending practices .
Lawmakers critical of regulators ’ failure to rein in those practices are considering stripping consumer protection functions from the Fed and other financial regulators and entrusting them to a dedicated consumer protection agency .
U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd has introduced legislation limiting bank overdraft fees , and Representative Carolyn Maloney has introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives .
The Fed , which has stepped up consumer protection efforts , in September proposed credit card rules that would shield customers from costly fees .
It has also said it would investigate consumer complaints against financial companies that are not banks , and barred mortgage brokers from earning more when they sell high - cost loans .
Dodd has proposed stripping the Fed of its authority to regulate banks , calling the institution ’s performance as a regulator an “ abysmal failure . ”

Dylan Ratigan sums it better than any financial analyst has been able to do so far : " giving people $ 23 trillion in taxpayer money , especially the banks , it makes their stock price go up . "
And some observations on the Chairman 's Moral Hazard Doctrine : " Ben Bernanke said he would print an unlimited amount of money , against the future of our taxpayer , that 's why our dollar continues to collapse , to support the banks which is working pretty well . "
Dylan : CNBC misses your optimism .
Extremism and Idiocy
It has probably been over five years now that I have had in mind the notion that I should write something about the constant accusations by various people that MRAs are mostly extreme , or that they are just idiots .
I have certainly been accused of both in my time .
But , then again , so has just about everybody who puts their views in the public domain .
Ask any newspaper columnist .
Fortunately , however , it does not take long for most writers to realise that most of these types of accusation are made by people who do not know what they are talking about .
Indeed , I remember Jon Ronson - a well - respected investigative journalist - doing a whole TV series on various people with ' extreme ' views , and concluding that , for the most part , these people were , in fact , nowhere nearly as extreme as the mainstream media usually portrayed them to be .
And , from what I have seen over the years , I concur with what he says .
There are , indeed , some people with extreme views , and some of them do , indeed , appear to be idiots , but , for the most part , people who are accused of being extreme or idiots are mostly just advancing views that their accusers disagree with .
The politically - corrected and the feminists , however , have made it a firm policy of theirs to describe absolutely everybody who disagrees with their views as extremists ( e.g. as ' racists ' or ' misogynists ' ) and / or as idiots .
And this tactic has been very effective indeed for the past three decades at silencing those who might disagree with them .
Thankfully , however , the internet is helping their opponents to destroy their stranglehold over the public discourse , and my guess is that it will not be too long now before these people are finally exposed fully to the public as being the malicious , anti-democratic bullies that , quite clearly , they are .
Disappointingly , however , even activists concerned with men's issues seem often to describe others who are in the same camp as them as extremists or as idiots .
And yet , one would have thought that they would have learned by now that undermining their own support base is not a very clever thing to do .
So , perhaps , when it comes to idiocy , they should look more closely at themselves if they want to find examples of it .
Is Angry Harry an Idiot ?
On occasion , I will receive an email describing me as an idiot .
It will usually have come from someone who has taken only a cursory look at my website .
Needless to say , such an email gets deleted straight away - giving me much pleasure when the email is long and detailed , because I will barely have bothered to read more than a few sentences , and I chuckle at the thought of the emailer 's wasted time .
I no longer have any interest at all in what self - proclaimed feminists want to say .
Indeed , many of the longer emails often start off with such words as , " I am a feminist from such - and - such a place ... " and such emails are deleted before I even reach the end of the very first sentence - because I no longer have any interest at all in what self - proclaimed feminists want to say .
I used to read emails from self - proclaimed feminists if they were polite , but I gave up doing so because their content was always so vapid and insignificant .
Occasionally , I also see MRAs suggesting that I might be an idiot .
Does it annoy me ?
A bit .
Does it worry me ?
No .
Because , quite simply , 95 % of MRAs are n't in my league when it comes to effective activism .
And so , if I am an idiot , then so must they be .
But , given that I know that , for the most part , they are not idiots , then I can safely presume that I , too , am not one .
Indeed , I know full well that most of my readers are not idiots - on the contrary , many of them are extremely intelligent - and so any claim that I might be an idiot myself just does n't ring true !
Is Angry Harry an extremist ?
This kind of accusation makes me laugh more than anything else .
There is nothing ' extreme ' on my entire website .
Living in the UK - where freedom of speech is limited compared to the USA - I would soon be hauled up for questioning by the police if there was anything on my site that , for example , advocated breaking the law , was seen as an incitement to hatred , was seen as subverting ' democracy ' , was considered to be dangerous to others , and so on .
Or , just as likely , I would receive a curt email warning me to remove something from my website or face some legal consequences .
after ten years of aggressive online activism , not a peep have I heard from any law enforcement agency
Thus far , however , after ten years of aggressive online activism , not a peep have I heard from any law enforcement agency - despite the fact that I often harass such agencies with emails of complaint .
Indeed , when a few years ago the Status of Women in Canada produced its long blacklist of men's alleged ' anti- feminist hate sites ' - sites that needed to be monitored closely by the authorities - Angry Harry was not one of them ; even though , at the time , it was clearly one of the most popular anti-feminist sites on the internet .
Let me put it this way : Having a big mouth does not make somebody ' extreme ' , and it does not mean that they have extreme views .
It just means that they shout a lot - something that I am prone to do , with much justification .
Time and time again , politicians and government officials have been caught blatantly lying over issues of concern to men .
They have not made innocent mistakes , or slightly exaggerated their cases , they have been engaged in wholesale dishonesty and deception .
Worse , they have used their lies to corrupt the judicial process and to treat men absolutely appallingly , and it is quite clear that many of these very same people are in the process of selling out their own countries and countrymen in order to serve some aspect of the globalist agenda from which they , themselves , expect to profit .
And one of their main techniques through which they are serving this agenda is to destroy the relationships between men , women and children .
As such , I have every right to get angry , to shout , and to portray these people for the scumbags that they are .
And I do not intend to stop doing this .
Here in the UK , over the past few months , we have caught numerous politicians lying over their expenses claims - with the former Home Office minister , Jacqui Smith , sneakily defrauding the taxpayer out of $ 200,000 .
We have discovered that politicians , police officers and academics have continually lied about the sex - trafficking issue
We have discovered that politicians , police officers and academics have continually lied about the sex - trafficking issue - claiming , at one stage , that some 25,000 women were being trafficked into the UK when , in fact , not one such woman had been discovered .
And they knew all along that this was the case .
We have discovered recently that UK ministers and officials have been lying to the public about immigration , and that they have purposely and knowingly sought to undermine any reasonable form of control over it - with the secretly - declared specific intention of changing the demographics of the country and to make it impossible for future generations ( or politicians ) to reverse this process .
And we know that when it comes to matters such as rape , domestic violence , sex - assault etc , these people have done virtually nothing but lie over these past three decades or so .
Liars , manipulators , hate - stirrers and cheats are words that describe these people perfectly accurately .
And I see no reason at all why I should not describe them as such .
Some people call this type of language ' extremism ' .
No .
It is n't .
It is an accurate description of these people .
Is Angry Harry winning ?
Absolutely .
There is not one single issue repeatedly addressed on this website that is not nowadays increasingly being similarly advanced out there in the public domain .
From issues ranging from the legalisation of medical marihuana to the teaching methods being used to teach children to read , from the alleged gender wage - gap nonsense to the question of false rape accusations , as well as to the issue of excessive immigration , the views of this website are getting more and more support .
Indeed , everywhere I look these days , I see people who now sound like me - not only in tone but in substance .
Even the new editor of MND , Paul Elam , often sounds more like Angry Harry than I do .
MRAs all over the internet these days make me look pretty tame .
And , in fact , MRAs all over the internet these days make me look pretty tame .
This was not the case a few years ago .
So , Yes , I am winning .
Furthermore , apart from the sex - trafficking hokum recently exposed and mentioned above , over the past two weeks , here in the UK , we have had Harriet Harman - man-hating feminist and deputy leader of the Labour government - told by the government statistical office that she can no longer continue to provide skewed statistics to the public concerning the wage - gap issue , and we have had the Court of Appeal rule that false rape accusers must go to jail .
We have had some councils threatening domestic violence shelters with removal of their funding if they fail to provide help to men .
We have had a massive change in the way our children are being taught to read .
And we have had a major swing in the public 's attitude away from the politically - corrected Left .
To repeat myself ; there is not one issue of concern to me where the public 's mood is not going my way .
Why does n't Angry Harry campaign like Glenn Sacks ?
This question comes up often .
So , here is my answer , in brief .
Firstly , I am not an American , nor an Australian , nor an Irishman .
Am I supposed to rush over to each country in turn , learn their different laws , and then try to get on the TV or the radio or , perhaps , lobby some local politician or some local group in connection with men's issues ?
You must think that I am Superman .
Look .
I run a website , with an international flavour .
I am just a columnist , if you like .
Anything wrong with this ?
I tell you what .
YOU go out there and do what Glenn Sacks does .
Secondly , I do n't have what it takes to make good public appearances .
I would be useless at doing such things .
You would not want to see me on your TV screens Trust me .
You would not want to see me on your TV screens .
Thirdly , I do engage in quite a lot of activism that is not reflected on this website .
For example , I do lobby politicians and various groups in the UK , just like Glenn Sacks does in America .
And I imagine that the only major difference between us is that I am probably far more hostile in my approach than he is , and I keep myself out of the picture .
Quite simply , I see no reason to be polite to liars , manipulators and cheats , particularly if they are also promoting hatred towards men and promoting policies that harm men .
Glenn
Sacks thinks that politeness works best in these circumstances .
I do n't .
And the evidence is almost entirely stacked on my side rather than his .
Do n't get me wrong , I think that he is one of the most effective activists that there is at the moment - but this is mostly because he manages to get quite a large audience for himself .
Indeed , the larger is your audience , the less persuasive you need to be in order to effect change ; and so , if you like , he does not need to be so aggressive in order to be effective .
But only I know what it is like to run a site like Angry Harry .
No -one else in the entire world has had any experience at all of running this site .
I also know who its readers are , and I know what they think .
And I also know that , as far as feminists are concerned , this site is like one of those electrical zizzers that zaps bugs who fly into it .
They are mostly terrified of this site getting any publicity among their followers lest they lose them - which means that they believe that this site undermines their position very effectively ; which it does .
Finally , at the end of the day , all my rantings and ravings about how politicians , officials and academics have been lying through their teeth to us , in so many areas , have proven to be accurate .
You only need to look at the Times , the Telegraph , the Daily Mail - and even at the Guardian - over the past few months to see that I have not been so crazy or ' extreme ' at all over these past ten years or so .
I was right about the disgusting depths to which these greedy people have sunk in order to feather their own nests - at our expense - and I have been quite justified in calling them liars and cheats - because this is exactly what they are .
Worse still , they are purposely and willfully destroying our countries and our relationships - at every level - in order to profit themselves .
And YOU need to wake up to this .

If you have not yet seen the Fall of the Republic ( a film by Alex Jones - YouTube Video - 2h 20 min ) then please find the time to do so .
It is not a typical Alex Jones film .
It is not at all outlandish .
Its tone is very reasoned .
And the evidence which justifies his beliefs is very compelling .
It will not provide you with all the answers , and I think that it gets some things wrong , but it really does give you a very good insight into the kind of people who are in control of what is happening to us - and into why they are doing what they are doing .
And if you do watch it , keep bearing in mind throughout the film how much those people ' at the top ' ( certain politicians , government officials , bankers , corporate chiefs etc etc - i.e. the governing elite ) stand to profit from the breaking down of our nations and our relationships .
Millions upon millions of extra dollars for those at the top .
Feminism is , therefore , a veritable gold mine for them .
Let me put it this way .
if you sneakily promote on your website feminism , relationship breakdown and the destruction of the borders to your country , I will give you a million dollars
If somebody said to you , " Hey , if you sneakily promote on your website feminism , relationship breakdown and the destruction of the borders to your country , I will give you a million dollars every year , " you would surely be tempted .
After all , money talks !
Well , there are thousands of VERY POWERFUL people out there who have been receiving such an offer , and they have been accepting it ; with millions ( literally ) of people further down the food chain having accepted a similar offer but for a lesser amount .
Please wake up .

One reason given for the rising number of women who choose to deliver their babies by optional Cesarean section is that this mode of delivery protects the pelvic floor from damage that may cause incontinence or sexual dysfunction .
A new study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine suggests vaginal birth does take a toll on a couple 's sex life up to one year after the baby is born .
Researchers in Tehran , Iran , surveyed 912 pregnant women and their husbands .
All the women were healthy and first - time mothers .
The women were divided into groups based on their type of delivery : spontaneous vaginal delivery without injuries , vaginal delivery with episiotomy or perineal laceration , operative vaginal delivery ( includes instrumental delivery such as forceps ) , planned C-section and emergency C-section .
At first intercourse , eight weeks after delivery , women who had operative vaginal delivery had the highest pain scores and women who had planned C- sections had the lowest .
A year after birth , women with instrument - assisted deliveries had the worst sexual satisfaction .
Overall , any type of vaginal delivery or complicated mode of delivery led to an increase in sexual dysfunction .
At the one - year mark , sexual desire had decreased an average of 3.2 % in women who had a planned C-section compared to 28.7 % among women who had operative vaginal delivery and 14.4 % in women who had spontaneous vaginal delivery .
Intercourse frequency declined 10.2 % among women who had a planned C-section , 32.1 % among women who had operative vaginal delivery and 31.4 % in women who had spontaneous vaginal delivery .
" Since the turn of the last century , investigators have hypothesized that pregnancy and delivery of an infant can result in anatomical and functional derangement in pelvic floor and intrapelvic organs , " the authors wrote .
" Many issues that were not previously incorporated into the planning mode of delivery may now be considered to be of great importance .
Among these is sexual function ....
We think the results of this study are quite convincing in demonstrating an association between mode of delivery and sexual function . "

Some like to paint world history as an epic conflict between deeply divergent visions of civilization , which come down to disputes over a few key values .
But if so , just what are those key disputed values ?
For many decades , our best data on this key value variation has been the World Value Survey :
The WVS grew out of its eurocentric origins to embrace 42 countries in the 2nd wave , 54 in the 3rd wave and 62 in the 4th wave . …
The questionnaires from the most recent waves have consisted of about 250 questions , … with an average in the 4th wave of about 1330 interviews per country and a worldwide total of about 92000 interviews . …
A number of variables were condensed [ by factor analysis ] into two dimensions of cultural variation ( known as “ traditional v. secular - rational ” and “ survival v. self - expression ” ) , and on this basis the world ’s countries could be mapped into specific cultural regions .
The WVS claims : “ These two dimensions explain more than 70 percent of the cross-national variance in a factor analysis of ten indicators ” .
Here is a map of the world using those two main value factors :
Note that similar nations are grouped together , with rich nations to the upper right and poor nations to the lower left .
Note also that the main antagonists of the most recent global conflict , the Cold War , are nearly at opposite sides ; Russia and its allies are to the upper left while USA and its allies are to the lower right .
Clearly this 2D space represents key value disputes .
But what values exactly ?
Here are the projections of some particular value answers into this same 2D factor space :
WVS leaders ’ views on the key value disputes are found in their diagram labels : “ survival vs. well - being ” and “ traditional vs. rational - legal . ”
But we need not accept their labels .
Given many data points in a high dimensional vector space , factor analysis strongly suggests the most informative subspaces to consider , but says less about the best axes to consider , and nothing about the best axis names .
Now we have good reasons to think that values change in response to wealth .
And while wealth should also change in response to values , we have much less reason to expect small value changes to translate immediately into small wealth changes – it is growth rates that should respond to values .
Yet national value positions have been moving steadily to the upper right as nations have become richer .
So it seems pretty clear that differing wealth is a key factor driving values differences .
Given that one factor is the lower left to upper right wealth factor , the other factor is an upper left to lower right factor , stretching from Russia to the USA .
But what is the essence of that factor ?
It should make sense of the particular value positions in the diagram , for poor nations toward the lower left , and for rich nations toward the upper right .
With that in mind , what do the particular values toward the Russia side have in common ?
What about those toward the USA side ?
I ’ll take my cue from a key value difference postulated in Strauss and Howe ’s Generations : an “ inward ” vs. “ outward ” focus .
It seems that USA side values make sense when the priority is making families and personal relations work well , while Russian side values make sense when the priority is larger community health and threats .
Religious commitment , pride , a work ethic , and having many kids makes sense for families struggling against poverty , while families seeking comfort and happiness from their wealth prefer leisure , health , ecology , sexual freedom , and tolerance .
Poor communities struggling against outsiders want solidarity and ( they think ) central authority , with each family carrying its own load , even if no one is happy .
Rich but still competing communities attend more to politics , achievement , determination , and thrift .
Rich communities achieve more when divorce and abortion limit the harm of volatile families , while poor communities can’t afford such breakups .
Poor competing communities can’t afford arbitrary cultural barriers to getting cash or tech , but such arbitrary restrictions hurt a family less if its neighbors are similarly restricted .
So why would Russia side nations focus more on community , while USA side nations focus more on family ?
My story is much like that Diamond ’s Guns Germs and Steel : geography made some places more vulnerable to invasion .
The central Asia history of invasion after invasion is deeply ingrained in their culture , while island and geographically peripheral cultures were less obsessed by it .
England was relatively safe , and the Americans had few invasions after European colonization .
Cultures where invasion was less an issue tended to evolve family oriented values , while cultures where invasion was more common focused more on larger community solidarity .
So there you have it : I suggest the two main value disputes in the world are rich vs. poor and family vs. community priorities .
It is ironic that the cultures like Russia with values focused on competing against other communities lost the last big community conflict , the Cold War .
Have China , Korea , Japan , etc. learned their lesson about over - centralization , enough to win the next big conflict ?
If , as I have suggested , within roughly a century whole brain emulations appear and induce rapidly falling wages , world values may fall to the poor folk values of the lower left in the above diagrams .
On the other hand , there should be strong selection among em candidates for those with the most productive values , and it is not so clear what exactly those will be .

Paying a woman for her eggs to use in stem cell research has been a bioethical no - no for years .
But this past June , New York State decided to allow just that , becoming the first state to permit public money to be used in this way .
The decision , which allows payment of up to $ 10,000 , will likely jump - start donations — and thereby research .
Many bioethicists , however , worry that the financial incentive could exploit women and compromise their health .
Ethical issues surround egg donation because the process is not without risk .
It requires a series of hormonal stimulation injections as well as an invasive procedure to retrieve the eggs .
The long - term health effects and risks of complication are not well known .
A woman who provides eggs for research is “ assuming unknown risk for unknown benefits , ” says Debra Mathews , a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University .
The lingering unknowns prompted the National Academy of Science to issue in 2005 nonbinding guidelines to prohibit payment ( but allow direct reimbursement for expenses ) , as a means to protect underprivileged women in particular .
Various research teams have observed those guidelines and tried to recruit women to donate their eggs for free .
But these altruism - dependent attempts failed to find any takers .
Instead scientists have primarily relied on eggs left over from in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) procedures .
The secondhand supply , however , is small , and some question the quality of these eggs .
Many may have been rejected for implantation because they were subpar to begin with .
Storage and transport can also be problematic ; as Mathews explains , “ We ’re not good at freezing and thawing eggs yet . ”
The lack of quality eggs , along with an 11 - year , $ 600 - million directive from the New York State legislature to further stem cell research , persuaded New York ’s Empire State Stem Cell Board to allow payment to women for egg donation .
The board governs publicly funded stem cell work and is in charge of overseeing grants for related research .
Proponents of the board ’s decision note that payment for similar services is not unheard of .
“ We pay people to participate in research that has zero benefit to them [ but carries ] risk all the time , and we trust people to make that decision for themselves , ” says Mathews , who is also a member of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics .
Other bioethicists , including Insoo Hyun of the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine , echo that sentiment .
Hyun wrote a 2006 commentary piece in Nature in which he argued that just like others who volunteer for research , women should be paid to donate eggs for stem cell studies .
( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group . )
Moreover , research donations do not have to be seen as something different from fertility donations , points out Ronald Green , director of the Ethics Institute at Dartmouth College .
“ In a sense , infertility is a disease , so women are helping [ other ] women overcome a disease , ” just as they could be helping to find treatments for additional diseases .
Opponents worry that offering up large sums of money for egg donation may be too good an offer for some women to pass up — especially those who might not qualify for paid fertility donation , which screen women based on intellectual and physical attributes .
The financial incentives might also drive some to overdonate , Green notes .
He says that some “ serial egg donors ” have donated some 20 - odd times , risking their own health and reproductive abilities .
He recommends some kind of national register to keep track of donations and ensure that women give no more than a few times .
The move to pay for eggs destined for research may also reflect changing mores .
In 1978 the birth of Louise Brown , the world ’s first baby to be conceived by IVF , set off much debate about the control of embryos , women ’s reproductive rights and ominous Brave New World correlations .
Yet test - tube babies became common , and since 1978 more than three million have been born worldwide .
Except when it is used to select and screen embryos for certain characteristics , the procedure brings along little ethical hand - wringing today — even with its hefty financial rewards to female donors .
The debate might eventually be a moot point , as researchers continue to make convincing headway with induced pluripotent cells , which seem to have all the properties of embryonic stem cells but which are created from adult cells .
But both Mathews and Green acknowledge that creating a functional egg from skin or other cells still looks to be a long way off .
“ Generally the science moves pretty slowly and incrementally , ” Mathews says .
“ It ’s always difficult to predict , but if we could predict it , it would n’t be science . ”

Marc Emery , self - proclaimed Prince of Pot and marijuana activist , was released from jail temporarily yesterday as he awaits his extradition to the United States .
“ It was a difficult experience because it is maximum security , so that you do n’t get outside and you do n’t get far from your eight by 10 ( jail cell ) …
But I wrote some good material and read a lot , ” he said .
Emery is free on a $ 50,000 bail bond .
He is to be sent to Seattle where he will be sentenced for selling marijuana seeds ordered over the Internet to Americans .
He said the experience toughened him up for an American jail .
“ The isolation would get to me know and then , but the thing about prison is it ’s very well run by guards who are very professional . ”

DNA cited as reports of rape tumble
FBI data show cases are at 20 - year low
Reported rapes have fallen to the lowest level in 20 years at a time when DNA evidence helps lock up more rapists , and victims are more willing to work with police and prosecutors , victims advocates and crime experts say .
The FBI estimates 89,000 women reported being raped in 2008 — 29 women for every 100,000 people .
That 's down from a high of 109,062 reported rapes in 1992 — 43 women for every 100,000 people .
Data for 2009 are not yet available .
" We have seen reform in how police work with victims , gather evidence and investigate rape ; we 've seen increased awareness of the crime , and we 've seen better prosecution , " says Michael Males , senior researcher for the Center on Juvenile & Criminal Justice in San Francisco .
" Hospitals now have rape kits that they did n't have 40 years ago " that make it easier to collect a rapist 's DNA and other evidence .
Rape prosecutions have improved over the past two decades as advances in DNA testing can pinpoint a rapist rather than forcing prosecutors to rely solely on a victim 's identification of her attacker , says Kim Gandy , past president of the National Organization for Women and a former prosecutor .
Gandy recalls prosecutors ' reluctance in the 1970s and early 1980s to take rape cases to trial because " no district attorney wants to have a low conviction rate on rape . "
In 1994 , the federal Violence Against Women Act provided $ 1.6 billion to bolster rape prosecutions .
" Interest and professionalism dealing with sexual assault cases increased as a result , " says Scott Berkowitz , president of the Rape , Abuse & Incest National Network , a victims advocacy group .
Yearly rape prosecution data are unavailable , he says , but prosecutors now know how to pursue such cases .
Use of DNA evidence has expanded gradually over the past 15 years and can put a rapist in prison the first time he 's caught , preventing him from harming other women , Berkowitz says .
Many rapists are repeat offenders .
Attitudes about rape also have shifted since schools started awareness campaigns about the crime in the late 1970s and early 1980s , he says .
His group 's surveys show women are more willing to report rape now than two decades ago because they expect police will believe them .
" You do n't see the nightmarish trials of the 1960s where a woman 's reputation would be brought into question and people would conclude she deserved it , " Males says .
Crime experts say an overall drop in violent crime in the last decade does n't fully explain decreases in rape .
Some factors that pushed crime down , such as the decline in crack cocaine markets , are unlikely to affect rape , says Richard Rosenfeld , criminology professor at the University of Missouri - St. Louis .
" We 've still got a long way to go , " Berkowitz says .
" We need to encourage more victims to report to police and guarantee that when they do report , the case is properly investigated . "
Our offshore newspaper proprietors have won .
Parliament will now be of the rich , by the rich , for the rich .
For the millionaires in David Cameron 's Shadow Cabinet there is nothing to fear from the Kelly proposals .
They can afford homes in London and their constituencies and the chance to see their children grew up , which Kelly now denies to those who have only a parliamentary salary to live on .
Evelyn
Waugh famously complained that it was no fun living under a Tory government as they never turned the clock back on anything .
He should be alive now as Kelly takes us back to a Commons in which private wealth is needed if a normal family life is to be sustained for an MP .
Of course , MPs will adjust .
The supreme privilege and , if truth be told , the high pleasure of being an MP will continue to attract men and women of calibre .
If Labour MPs have to stay in boarding houses while Tory MPs retire to their Notting Hill homes , so be it .
In his entertaining memoirs , Paddy Ashdown recalls sharing his office as a new MP with a fellow Liberal from Cornwall .
Captain Paddy convened breakfast meetings only to find his colleague was still in his sleeping bag on the floor as there was no allowance then to live in London .

Now all MPs have their own office so , with a bit of juggling of chair cushions , it should be possible to make a bed .
There are three showers and one bath for 650 MPs , so things might get a bit pongy in the chamber but if that assuages Kelly , so be it .
Other changes will follow .
The report is deeply misogynist with its demand that women MPs of all ages who live within a 60 - minute train journey from London should leave the Commons after late - night votes to travel home to arrive at one in the morning to unstaffed , unlit stations on a cold night in November .
Thanks , Sir Christopher .
Of course , that problem can be solved by the political parties making sure that all our Home Counties MPs are men .
Evelyn
Waugh was n't keen on women politicians either , but it has taken one of the finest products of Whitehall to tell women that they really should n't bother thinking of a parliamentary career .
The Whitehall mandarin mentality of the Kelly recommendation is on display in his insistence that MPs ' staff should stop political activity .
If that means David Cameron 's and Nick Clegg 's employees cease putting out partisan press releases attacking Gordon Brown I suppose I should welcome Kelly .
Actually I will be sorry to see disappear the thousands of earnest young men and women clogging up the cafeterias of the Commons as they plot and plan politics for their MP bosses .
What Whitehall wants is politics - free politicians , and thanks to the stupidity and cupidity of some MPs who abused the allowances and expenses system , we are well on our way to achieving this .
Until 30 years ago , it was accepted that MPs would be London - based and , as with Denis Healey or Keith Joseph , would just make occasional fleeting visits to their constituencies .
Something changed , and from 1980 onwards it became impossible to be selected as an MP without having a home in the constituency as well as in London .
In the 19th and much of the 20th century , the Commons met only six months a year .
Now we expect our MPs to do a five - day week and be in their constituencies most weekends , and constituents want instant replies to their emails 365 days a year .
Kelly – or rather the mass panic of party leaderships trying to outbid each other in sanctimoniousness – will make it impossible for a John Smith or a Ken Clarke to be both a QC and and MP .
Farewell to future Roy Hattersleys making a handsome living as a journalist while also being a stellar Labour politician .
No more the likes of Roy Jenkins and Michael Heseltine , whose outside earnings dwarfed their MP 's pay .
For centuries , British citizens have chosen highly individual men and women to represent them in Parliament .
Unlike civil servants or the professional classes , MPs have not been obliged to fit into a mould decided from above .
Some are good , a few are great , others are sad , mad , bad and boring or dangerous to know .
That is the glory of the Commons .
For five years , an MP is accountable to his or her constituents and to no one else .
Whips may bully .
The ambitious may toe the line .
But there are plenty of MPs who can plough their own furrows and speak their own minds .
Now , thanks to Kelly , Legg , and a new standards body which will control much of what MPs can say and do and write , we are inventing a new Parliament .
Will it be a better , purer Commons firmly under control thanks to new rules and supervisory bodies ?
We shall see .

A kiss - a simple act that can convey a diverse array of meanings .
A kiss can be intimate and private , or meant for public display , it can convey love and affection , or simply provide comfort .
Its use as a greeting is under fire in our current climate of H1N1 fear , as the French government has begun encouraging citizens to forgo " la bise " , their traditional cheek - to - cheek kiss , for health reasons .
Gathered here are 33 recent photos of kisses expressing greetings and farewells , congratulations and joy , respect and , above all , love .

On the plains of Marsabit the heat is so intense the bush seems to shiver .
The leafless scrub , bleached white by the sun , looks like a forest of fake Christmas trees .
Carcasses of cattle and camels are strewn about the burnt red dirt in every direction .
Siridwa Baseli walks out of the haze along a path of the dead and dying .
He passes a skeletal cow that has given up and collapsed under a thorn tree .
A nomad from the Rendille people , he is driving his herd in search of water .
He marks time in seasons but knows that it has not rained for three years : " Since it is not raining there is no pasture , " he says .
Only 40 of his herd of sheep and goats that once numbered 200 have survived .
Those that remain are dying at a rate of 10 every day .
Already a herder before Kenya 's independence he has never seen a drought like this .

" If I was young I would go to look for cash work .
I am old .
I may just die with my animals . "
Across East Africa an extraordinary drought is drying up rivers , and grasslands , scorching crops and threatening millions of people with starvation .
In Kenya , the biggest and most robust economy in the region , the rivers that feed its great game reserves have run dry and since the country relies on hydropower , electricity is now rationed in the cities .
And yet , it is in the semi-desert on the southern fringe of the Sahel zone where the most dramatic changes are being felt .
Droughts are nothing new here and the nomadic way of life where herders follow patchy rains across the seasons developed centuries ago as a response to precarious natural resources .
The herds of cattle , sheep , goats and camels – which are venerated by the nomads – were built up in the good years to pad the margins of life when the rains failed .
But this way of life is being overwhelmed , even the camels are dying of thirst .
Naibari Arara lives in a typical Rendille village , a broad circle of domed shelters ringed by a barricade of thorny branches or bomas .
Inside there are corrals for the animals on whom life depends and huts fashioned from hides , rags and sticks , designed to be collapsed , packed and rebuilt in a single day .
But the village does n't move anymore .
The animals are gone and so are the men .
They left 12 months ago with the herds in search of pasture , she explains .
In the meantime the women and children wait .
" We can't leave from here .
We can't move without milk . "
The Rendille have survived for generations on a diet of milk , blood and occasionally meat .
Now they are living on food stamps and milk powder .
" When I was a young girl we would move every two or three months but now there are no rains .
I cannot explain this . "
An hour 's walk away in the town of Korre , Rendille elders have been discussing the crisis .
Monte Wambile , reed thin with a weather - beaten face says that what 's unfolding is not a drought .
According to folklore , a climatic disaster struck the same region about 120 years ago and is remembered in the local language as the " arbah " , or catastrophe .
Starving families were forced to sell their children in return for cattle to survive .
Now , he says it has returned .
" Since I was a young man the droughts would come but these were just changes we could cope with .
Now there are carcasses all over and most of the people have lost their animals .
Soon the people will start dying . "
Sariticho Lenelo is already dead .
A 10 - year - old Rendille boy in Loglogo , he was killed along with two young men when armed raiders attacked herders at the town 's water pump and stole nearly 300 livestock .
Across the north of Kenya competition for water , grazing land and surviving cattle has sparked ethnic conflict .
Cattle raids were always a feature of nomadic cultures but as the battle for survival intensifies the death toll climbs .
Sixty - five people have been killed in the Turkana region alone since January .
Despite being a disaster three years in the making , the drought is in danger of catching Kenya and the UN unprepared .
Failed harvests mean high food prices , the national government is crippled by infighting and corruption , and international aid groups have seen funding squeezed by the credit crunch .
The food vouchers sustaining hundreds of Rendille families will run out in less than a fortnight as the Irish aid agency paying for them , Concern , has run out of money for the project .
In the last week , other big organisations such as Oxfam and Cafod have launched emergency appeals .
The UN has received less than half the £ 350 m it has called for .

In reality no one can deliver the rain that is really needed .
Leina Mpoke has been working to unravel the cycles of drought , local deforestation and global influences for the Kenya Climate Working Group .
" The drastic changes we 're experiencing can not be explained by local activities , " he says .
" Across the southern Sahel we 're seeing a huge trend . "
In the 1970s there was a major drought once in the decade .
In the 1980s this quickened to once every seven years , in the 1990s , once every five years .
At the beginning of this decade the rains failed every other season and what we now see is " perennial drought " .
" What 's being seen , " says Mr Mpoke , who works with Concern , are " the consequences of global climate change " .
Marsabit mountain rises up from the semi-desert of northern Kenya to touch the clouds at nearly 2,000 metres .
Its highland slopes have always offered respite from the heat and dust of the savannah .
The mountain was known as " Saku " or mist , and its elevated forest sheltered elephants , kudus , lions and high altitude lakes .
It is now home to climate refugees who have swollen the population to more than 40,000 .
Ibrahim Adan grew up in Marsabit and is sad to see how it 's changed : " It used to be all green , now it 's horrible and dusty . "
" I remember as a child we had food we did n't know what do with . "
He now runs a local organisation called Cifa that is working with struggling nomadic communities and distributes food stamps .
He describes what 's happening as a " national crisis " .
" The climate has forced people to the mountain .
The number of poor people is increasing every day .
They are cutting down the forest for firewood , the environment is totally degraded . "
Everything in town is coated in a choking layer of red dust , the two mountain lakes have dried to a green - black crust and rangers at the Marsabit National Park say that eight elephants have starved to death in recent months .
" If it was n't for climate change we would n't have this concentration of people , it 's a vicious circle , " says Mr Adan .
Many of the climate refugees come to Petro Namweni Lojich when they arrive .
He is the local chief of the Turkana , proud and warlike nomads whose homeland is more than 200 km west of Marsabit .
Every time a vehicle arrives in town , he says , it brings another five or six Turkana .
" Drought and conflict are forcing them to come , " he explains .
These outlanders are shunned by many of the jostling communities in Marsabit and live on the margins .
Their fate is a bleak harbinger for other nomads .
Stripped of their livestock and " prestige " there is no way back for them .
The chief insists he is " still a Turkana " but admits that without a herd he would be treated as inferior even if he could go home .
Without rain , he believes , the rest of the Turkana will be forced to do what he has done : " What is the alternative ? " he shrugs .
Remembering the first time he stayed inside a building , he says : " I felt like my eyes had been closed .
I could n't see the night sky . "
Looking older than his 44 years , he admits to not liking urban life .
" When we lived outside we could see who was our enemy and see him coming .
Here it is more complicated . "

Generally , following a terrible disaster , we tend to closely watch others ' behavior and comments to get some idea of how we should react .
In this case , an erroneous retelling of an interview with Billy Graham 's daughter is being co-opted by two different viewpoints as an example of how to , or not to react .
Finally , The Truth on National TV .
Billy Graham 's daughter was being interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her " How could God let something like this happen ? "
And Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response .
She said " I believe that God is deeply saddened by this , just as we are , but for years we 've been telling God to get out of our schools , to get out of our government and to get out of our lives .
And being the gentleman that He is , I believe that He has calmly backed out .
How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand that He leave us alone ? "
Ironically , this apocryphal retelling of the Clayson / Graham interview has been used by religious interests to encourage faith as well as by other groups to point out the " outrageous idiocy of the religious right . "
Anne Graham Lotz , evangelist Billy Graham 's second daughter , appeared via satellite on CBS ' The Early Show on September 13 , 2001 .
She discussed with Jane Clayson ( not Bryant Gumbel , Jane Pauley or Katie Couric , as some versions of this rumor assert ) the role God played in the events of September 11 , among other topics .
The actual exchange went more accurately like this : CLAYSON : I 've heard people say , those who are religious , those who are not , if God is good , how could God less this happen ?
To that , you say ?
LOTZ : I say God is also angry when he sees something like this .
I would say also for several years now Americans in a sense have shaken their fist at God and said , God , we want you out of our schools , our government , our business , we want you out of our marketplace .
And God , who is a gentleman , has just quietly backed out of our national and political life , our public life .
Removing his hand of blessing and protection .
We need to turn to God first of all and say , God , we 're sorry we have treated you this way and we invite you now to come into our national life .
We put our trust in you .
We have our trust in God on our coins , we need to practice it .
Some well - meaning forwarders have tacked on other popular " we 've forsaken God " diatribes that are marginally related to the Lotz quote .
Unfortunately , it 's been blended with the quote so well , that many are led to believe Lotz said it as well .
In light of the many perversions and jokes we send to one another for a laugh , this is a little different :
This is not intended to be a joke , it 's not funny , it 's intended to get you thinking .
Billy Graham 's daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her " How could God let something like this happen ? " ( regarding the attacks on Sept. 11 ) .
Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response .
She said " I believe God is deeply saddened by this , just as we are , but for years we 've been telling God to get out of our schools , to get out of our government and to get out of our lives .
And being the gentleman
He is , I believe He has calmly backed out .
How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone ? "
In light of recent events ... terrorists attack , school shootings , etc .
I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare ( she was murdered , her body found recently ) complained she did n't want prayer in our schools , and we said OK .
Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school .... the Bible says thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not steal , and love your neighbor as yourself .
And we said OK .
Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we should n't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self - esteem ( Dr. Spock 's son committed suicide ) .
We said an expert should know what he 's talking about .
And we said OK .
Then someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave .
The school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we do n't want any bad publicity , and we surely do n't want to be sued ( there 's a big difference between disciplining , touching , beating , smacking , humiliating , kicking , etc . ) ..
And we said OK .
Then someone said , let 's let our daughters have abortions if they want , and they wo n't even have to tell their parents ..
And we said OK .
Then some wise school board member said , since boys will be boys and they 're going to do it anyway , let 's give our sons all the condoms they want so they can have all the fun they desire , and we wo n't have to tell their parents they got them at school .
And we said OK .
Then some of our top elected officials said it does n't matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs .
Agreeing with them , we said it does n't matter to me what anyone , including the President , does in private as long as I have a job and the economy is good .
Then someone said let 's print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome , down - to - earth appreciation for the beauty of the female body .
And we said OK .
And then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then further again by making them available on the Internet .
And we said OK , they 're entitled to free speech .
Then the entertainment industry said , let 's make TV shows and movies that promote profanity , violence , and illicit sex .
Let 's record music that encourages rape , drugs , murder , suicide , and satanic themes .
And we said it 's just entertainment , it has no adverse effect , nobody takes it seriously anyway , so go right ahead .
Now we 're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience , why they do n't know right from wrong , and why it does n't bother them to kill strangers , their classmates , and themselves .
Probably , if we think about it long and hard enough , we can figure it out .
I think it has a great deal to do with " WE REAP WHAT WE SOW . "
Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world 's going to hell .
Funny how we believe what the newspapers say , but question what the Bible says .
Funny how you can send ' jokes ' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord , people think twice about sharing .
Funny how lewd , crude , vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace , but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace .
Are you laughing ?
Funny how when you forward this message , you will not send it to many on your address list because you 're not sure what they believe , or what they WILL think of you for sending it .
Funny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what God thinks of us .
Pass it on if you think it has merit .
If not then just discard it ... no one will know you did .
But , if you discard this thought process , do n't sit back and complain about what bad shape the world is in !
The " Funny how " portion at the end has been offending Christians for years and has been attached to sappy stories about an atheist girl and a handicapped boy , among others .
Break this chain !

Frederick S. Calhoun , the Chief Historian for the United States Marshal 's Service , at the Department of Justice , recently wrote a 200 year history of Federal Marshals , entitled , The Lawmen : United States Marshals and their Deputies , 1789 1989 ( Smithsonian Institute , Washington , D.C. 1989 ) .
This historical study gives a detailed account of an arrest warrant , signed by President Abraham Lincoln , in the early days of his administration .
The warrant was to arrest the Chief Justice of the United States , Roger B .
Taney , following his opinion in the case of Ex parte Merryman ( May , 1861 ) .
The account is found in the chapter entitled , " Arrest of Traitors and Suspension of Habeas Corpus . "
It was taken from the private papers of the Federal Marshall , Ward Hill Laman , at the Huntington Library in Pasadena :
Taney 's opinion seriously embarrassed Lincoln and his advisers .
Southern sympathizers and Northern opponents of the war praised Taney as a partisan of civil liberties standing alone against military tyranny .
Taney 's opinion exacerbated the delicate situation in Maryland , a border state yet undecided in its commitment to the Union .
According to Marshal Lamon , " After due consideration the administration determined upon the arrest of the Chief Justice . "
Lincoln issued a presidential arrest warrant for Taney , but then arose the question of service .
" Who should make the arrest and should Taney be imprisoned ? "
It was finally determined to place the order of arrest in the hands of the United States Marshal for the District of Columbia .
Laman then recalls that " Lincoln gave the warrant to him , instructing Lamon to " use his own discretion about making the arrest unless he should receive further orders . "
The account of the warrant to arrest the Chief Justice cannot be found in any of the innumerable Lincoln biographies or accounts of the early days of the Civil War .
Since it only recently surfaced , Lincoln historians and biographers have never mentioned the story , probably because it has been outside the main stream of historical information , and hence has not been known .
Once it surfaced , Lincoln apologists and Civil War gatekeepers , have been quick to attack the account as a fabrication , because Lincoln would never have done such a thing ; and , it would have set off " a political firestorm , " so they say ; and hence , it is just too preposterous to be true .
It does seem too preposterous to be true , probably because of all the grave errors and wrongs allegedly committed by Lincoln 's administration , this would rank at the top of the list .
It would have destroyed the separation of powers ; destroyed the place of the Supreme Court in the Constitutional scheme of government .
It would have made the executive power supreme , over all others , and put the President , the military , and the executive branch of government , in total control of American society .
The Constitution would have been at an end .
But as outrageous as this may appear , during those chaotic first months of the Civil War , it would not have been so unthinkable to arrest and silence Taney .
The military arrested people in all walks of life .
Charles W. Smith , a biographer of Taney ( 1973 ) , gives this account of the scope of the arrests of civilians :
Without the sanction of law the federal government arrested men by the thousands and confined them in military prisons .
The number of such executive arrests was certainly over 13,000 , and it has been estimated to have been as high as 38,000 ( Columbia Law Review , XXI , 52728 , 1921 ) .
This policy was bitterly criticized in some quarters , but it is generally assumed that the people as a whole supported the arrest policy .
Taney 's
Ex parte Merryman decision , if followed by the executive branch of the government , would have given comfort to the enemy , so it was claimed , by letting an accused traitor go free .
His decision was condemned , " steeped in the crown of treason , " wrote one editor .
The New York Times wrote that he used " the powers of his office to serve the cause of traitors . "
The editor of The Missouri Democrat , went so far as to suggest that getting rid of Taney " will be a good riddance for the country . "
Northern editors for weeks after the decision enflamed their readers with hate for Chief Justice Taney .
But this attack was just plain nonsense .
All the Merryman decision did , was to require the government to follow the ancient rule of English liberty  which was set forth in the Constitution  that only the Congress could take away the right of habeas corpus .
That would have required Lincoln to call Congress into session , and ask Congress to suspend the right to habeas corpus .
How was that so bad ?
Thus Merryman decision , it was erroneously claimed , loomed as a serious obstacle to the government 's policy of stamping out secessionists and secessionist sympathizers .
If Lincoln obeyed the Court 's order thousands of those arrested illegally would have been freed .
Lincoln and most Northerners , during the war , accepted the Machiavellian doctrine that the end justified the means , when the end was to preserve the Union , and was to be achieved regardless of the Constitution and rulings of the Supreme Court .
Lincoln expressed that policy to a Chicago clergyman :
" As commander in chief of the army and navy , in time of war , I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy . "
Taney continued to irritate the Lincoln administration after his Ex parte Merryman decision .
When Lincoln was ignoring the Supreme Court 's ruling , Taney sent copies of his opinion to other judges , urging them to issue writs of habeas corpus , and many of them did , even enforcing writs against military arrests of civilians .
In his circuit in Maryland , Taney delayed a number of treason trials , as it was his right to do controlling the docket , because with the passion of the times , he doubted a fair trial could be had .
No doubt Taney 's obstructionism reached the ears of the President .
And it was then that the plan was hatched to arrest and silence old Justice , who just would n't shut up .
Lincoln sent a letter to Taney following his decision in the Merriman case , but the letter has never been found .
( New York Herald , June 2 , 1861 ) .
But that could explain why Taney told others , " The government had considered the possibility of arresting him . "
Someway , he got the word .
The near - arrest of the Chief Justice is not just found in the history of the United States Marshal 's Service .
Until recent research , there was a second account supposedly corroborating the story of the Federal Marshal Laman .
This second account was in a footnote in Professor Harold Hyman 's A More Perfect Union ( 1973 ) , p. 86 , n. 15 , citing the private papers of Frances Lieber , also at the Huntington Library .
Lieber wrote the Lieber Code which became the Laws of War for Northern armies .
That should have been enough proof , with two independent sources .
Unfortunately , the Curator at the Huntington Library reports that the Lieber papers contain no reference to Lincoln 's warrant to arrest the Chief Justice .
That left only the papers of Ward Hill Laman .
When this became known , Laman 's character was attacked by the gatekeepers , to support the theory that the whole story was a fabrication .
It seems he was a heavy drinker .
Lincoln 's apologist could relax and maintain the whole account was a fabrication by the Federal Marshal .
Unfortunately , for Lincoln 's apologists , research recently unearthed two other solid sources to corroborate the account set forth in the private papers of the Federal Marshal , Laman .
In 1887 , George W. Brown , the mayor of Baltimore , later a Supreme Court judge for Baltimore , wrote in his book , Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April , 1861 : A Study of War , ( John Hopkins University , 1887 ) p. 90 , of a conversation he had with Taney following the Merryman decision :
" Mr. Brown , I am an old man , a very old man , ( he had completed his 84th year ) but perhaps I was preserved for this occasion . "
I replied , " Sir , I thank God that you were . "
He then told me that he knew his own imprisonment had been a matter of consultation , but the danger had passed , and he warned me from information he had received , that my time would come .
It did .
Eight years before in 1879 , The Memoirs of Benjamin Robbin Curtis 's were published .
Justice Curtis was one of the most prominent lawyers in that period .
He represented President Johnson in his trial before the Senate following his impeachment .
Most important , he served as a Justice on the Supreme Court .
He wrote the dissenting opinion in Dred Scott , which Lincoln carried in his pocket while debating with Stephen A. Douglas .
He resigned from the Court after a dispute with Taney over that case .
Yet he admired the Chief Justice for his Merryman decision , and makes reference to the plan to arrest Taney , calling it a " great crime . "
If he had never done anything else that was high , heroic , and important , his noble vindication of the writ of habeas corpus and the dignity and authority of his office against the rash minister of State who , in the pride of a fancied executive power , came near to the commission of a great crime , will command the admiration and gratitude of every lover of constitutional liberty so long as our institutions endure .
Vol. 1 , p. 240 .
Commenting on this , Mayor Brown wrote 8 years later :
" The crime referred to was the intended imprisonment of the Chief Justice .
Although this crime was not committed , a criminal precedent had been set and was ruthlessly followed . "
Brown then cites the oft quoted remark by Secretary Seward to Lord Lyons ( British ambassador to the United States ) , boasting of his power to imprison just about anyone .
Finally , it was Secretary of State , William Seward , who signed the executive orders suspending the right of habeas corpus throughout the war , when it should normally have been the President .
Curtis 's account refers to " the rash minister of State , " who could be none other than William Seward .
History shows that it was Seward who urged the President to embark on a policy of unrestrained arrests of private citizens by the military .
Most likely it was Seward who urged the President to sign the warrant to arrest Taney , and most likely on second thought , Lincoln did not permit the arrest to take place .
Chief Justice Taney and Seward were bitter enemies .
So much so that Taney said , if Seward were elected President , he would not administer the oath of office to him .
So arresting and imprisoning Taney would have been Seward 's final triumph over the Chief Justice .
And so the case stands , the Presidential warrant to arrest the Chief Justice is on solid ground .
It represents just one more tough nut the apologists and gate keepers have to live with ; it can not be swept under the rug , so to speak , as a fabrication .

There is a myth that in order to stand out on the radio , your song needs to be louder than anyone else’s .
Bollocks .
Maybe this was true during the first Loudness Wars , back when every Motown release was louder than the previous one , but not any more – not for a long time .
Radio stations use very aggressive multi-band compression to control the level of everything they broadcast , for two reasons :
To ensure decent reception in low - signal areas and To even out any differences in playback volume without the DJ having to adjust everything “ on - the - fly ”
What this means is that really high - level CDs wo n’t sound any better on the radio , just more squashed and distorted .
Do n’t believe me ?
Read this :
Loudness means NOTHING on the radio – the proof
The Evidence
It really leapt out at me recently when I heard Paul Simon ’s “ 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover ” back to back with Lily Allen ’s “ 22 ” while I was driving home from work .
There was no obvious difference in volume , despite the fact that one is a pristine 70’s classic , whereas the other is a tragic current Loudness War casualty .
There was one other , very obvious sonic difference , though .
“ Fifty Ways ” sounded fantastic , and Lily sounded dreadful .
Even more dreadful than it does on CD , because the song was already so loud that the broadcast compression was mauling it to death .
And Radio 2 ’s broadcast compression is mild , in comparison to most commercial UK stations , let alone in the US .
An in fact , Lily ’s album is n’t even that loud , by recent standards …
For more proof , check out my interview with the BBC about Metallica ’s infamous “ Death Magnetic ” , in the side - bar over there on the right .
The show includes two clips from the album , one of which had 14 dB more dynamic range (! ) than the other , before they were broadcast .
Or , check out this blog post along similar lines .
So , how do you stand out on the radio these days ?
Simple .
Hit the “ sweet spot ” where your track is loud and punchy but still dynamic , and sits just underneath the broadcast compression thresholds .
It will sound exactly the way you want , without any extra processing – and as a result a great deal more ear - catching than most modern releases , which will be fighting the limiter all the way to the scrapheap .
“ But how loud is that ? ! ” I hear you cry .
Well , sadly I can’t give you an exact answer to that – different radio stations use different amounts of compression and processing , so this is tough to call .
( I said it was simple , not easy !)
But if we take Lily and Paul as examples – our old friend the TT Dynamic Range Meter tells us that “ 50 Ways ” has a dynamic range of 12 dB or more for most of the song , as opposed to Lily who averages only 8 dB in the choruses , down to 6 dB for the really loud bits .
So my advice is , predictably enough – keep it dynamic .
A dynamic range of DR8 is the most compressed anything ever needs to be – and , I ’m talking heavy rock there , not catchy pop like Lily .
Stay in the DR14 - DR10 range except for the very loudest bits and you ’ll be doing just fine .
Of course , the very best ( and easiest ! ) way to achieve this is to get your music professionally mastered by an engineer who knows what he ’s up to .
Oh – you will also need great songs , catchy hooks , superb recordings and fantastic performances , but you knew all that already , right ?!

( CNN ) -- Meet " network man . "
He has basic desires of his own , but has many arbitrary preferences , such as in music or clothes , that have been influenced by the people he knows .
A new book finds that our likes and dislikes are influenced by our social networks , both online and off .
Network man 's likes and dislikes , in turn , affect the behavior of his friends , and their friends , and their friends .
For example , when he gets into an obscure indie rock band , he shares an album with his friend , who likes it so much that he recommends it to his cousin , who spreads the word to her friends .
This is the view of human behavior put forth in " Connected , " a new book by Dr. Nicholas Christakis , professor at Harvard University , and James Fowler , associate professor at the University of California , San Diego .
Examining years of research of their own and from others , the authors conclude that social networks , both offline and online , are crucial in understanding everything from voting patterns to the spread of disease .
People have profound influences on each other 's behavior within three degrees of separation , the authors find .
That means that your friends , your friends ' friends , and your friends ' friends ' friends may all affect your eating habits , voting preferences , happiness , and more .
At the fourth degree , however , the influence substantially weakens .
Read about their research on how happiness is contagious
These are not small effects .
" If a mutual friend becomes obese , it nearly triples a person 's risk of becoming obese , " the book said .
Even geography does n't matter ; you 're still at risk for gaining weight if a friend 1,000 miles away gets bigger .
Listen to James
Fowler talk about social networks »
Why is that ?
Obesity seems to spread in networks because of behavioral imitation -- you copy what people close to you are doing -- and shared expectations called " norms , " the authors said .
When you see people close to you gaining weight , that makes you readjust your own idea of what is an acceptable body size .
Read more about how " overweight " is relative
Still , this does not mean you should get rid of your overweight friends , Fowler said .
In fact , the researchers re-examined the same data set and found that people who dumped their friends who gained weight were even more susceptible to obesity .
" On the one hand , yes , our work showed that if you keep your friend , you are going to be susceptible to their bad behaviors , " he said .
" On the other hand , time and again , what our work shows is that every friend makes you healthier and happier . "
Watch CNN 's Elizabeth Landau talk about the book »
Finding the hubs of social networks can be invaluable from a public health point of view , the authors say .
For example , instead of vaccinating everyone in a population against a disease , it may be just as effective to choose people at random and ask them to name their closest friends , then vaccinate those friends .
The idea is that if someone names you as a friend , you are likely to be more central to the network than a participant chosen at random .
That means you 're probably less socially isolated , and more likely to come into contact with a lot of people , than someone randomly selected .
" You can achieve the same level of protection for the population at one - third the cost doing an intervention like this , " Fowler said .
In fact , the authors hope to do a preliminary experiment monitoring the spread of the novel H1N1 virus on a college campus , Fowler said .
Using the " friend " method for the vaccine against that virus , distributed for the first time this week , would not be a bad idea , although it is still a new concept that needs to be tested , Fowler said .
" What you are seeing is a lot of people who are experimenting with these ideas in trials , and trying to figure out how can we use all of this great new information about social networks to make everybody 's life better , " he said .
Social networks were crucial to understanding how sexually transmitted diseases broke out among teenagers in 1996 in Rockdale County , Georgia , a quiet upper - middle - class suburb near Atlanta .
An investigation found that a collection of young girls , mostly under 16 , had been having sex with various clusters of boys , the book said .
This epidemic of syphillis and other diseases stopped when the network changed , the authors argue .
" They actually figured out a good intervention there , which was to break apart this central group of girls that were essentially promoting the spread of this norm of a heightened sexuality at a very young age , " Fowler said .
" By essentially quarantining them , the norm could n't spread anymore , and pretty soon they were able to get control of the epidemic . "
It turns out online social networks have n't necessarily expanded the number of friends the average person has .
Christakis and Fowler looked at all of the Facebook pages of students at a particular unnamed university and tried to figure out who was close friends with whom based on " picture friends . "
Their reasoning : Two people who post and " tag " each other in photos on Facebook are likely to be more socially close than those who do not .
They found that , on average , students had between six and seven close friends on Facebook , which is not far from sociologists ' estimate that most people have four to six close friends in real life .
Moreover , the expected size of social groups in humans , based on their large brain size and the behavior of other primates , should be about 150 , according to British anthropologist Robin Dunbar .
At the time " Connected " was finalized , the average Facebook user had 110 registered friends on the site , Fowler said .
The " Three Degrees Rule " may have evolved with the human species , the authors argue .
Having a social network in which influence spreads is useful , as is knowing who is a potential ally or enemy based on friends ' associations .
But humans evolved in small groups , not large collectives , so during early human history there may not have been people who were four degrees removed from anyone , they write .
The Iranian blogosphere , despite having a government that blocks access to several Web sites , expresses many viewpoints on the Internet .
In June , Iranian citizens used Twitter to organize and protest against what they viewed as an unfair election .
Read more about the power of retweeting
" In closed societies , the sheer value of being able to spread information quickly is going to be the reason why social networks play such a strong role , " Fowler said .
An important caveat is that political organizing through social networks , just like choosing financial investments , depends on what you believe other people believe , he said .
Bubbles in the stock market .
for example , are created when a lot of people believe a lot of other people highly value a company 's stock .
" The same thing happens with these protests , " he said .
" You 're kind of afraid to go out and do it yourself , but if you think that other people are going to go show up , then you 're more likely to show up yourself . "
While social networking sites such as Friendster have risen and fallen , online social networking in general is here to stay , Fowler said .
He likened it to the introduction of the telephone , which had its initial skeptics too .
" This is just yet another way through which humans exert their inherent natural tendency to try to connect to other people that they care about , " he said .

There is concern that our continued efforts in Afghanistan are being undermined by widespread corruption within the administration of President Hamid Karzai .
What few people are talking about is the opium cultivation and heroin production that is fueling this corruption .
But should we do anything about it ?
Can we do anything about it ?
Not really .
Controlling opium production is a Sisyphean task -- hopelessly futile .
Trying to eradicate the crop creates perverse incentives that actually lead to increased production , as NATO allies learned in the years following the ouster of the Taliban in 2001 .
However , if we do nothing about opium cultivation , farmers will naturally overproduce , stocks of stored opium will accumulate , prices will fall further and farmers will eventually abandon the crop of their own free will ( as they did in 2000 and as they are starting to do now ) .
This year , the United Nations issued two reports suggesting significant drops in opium crop cultivation , suggesting that U.S. - and British - funded crop eradication and alternative development schemes were finally paying off .
But the continued drop in the number of acres planted with poppies is not all that it seems .
Thanks to increasing crop yields ( because of more intensive planting and more efficient techniques ) , new opium production has fallen by far less than the numbers would suggest .
Annual production levels are still double what they were in the decade before 9/11 and during the first few years of this war .
We should not be surprised .
Western anti-drug policies are founded on three misguided assumptions , most of which have been refuted by highly respected academic studies that policymakers have rarely bothered to read .
Advertisement
The first false assumption is that crop eradication actually leads to a reduction in production .
Graham Farrell , who worked with the U.N. Drug Control Program in the 1990s , looked at the impact of crop eradication efforts in different parts of the world and found that , in most cases , cultivation increased in the growing season following a crop eradication effort .
It ’s a counterintuitive conclusion , but it makes sense .
If farmers know that some crops will be destroyed , they will plant more in the expectation that prices will rise from the induced scarcity .
Sometimes they will plant separate fields in outlying areas , or farmers in countries and provinces neighboring the area targeted for eradication might increase their cultivation .
The second false assumption is that subsidized crop substitution programs help poor farmers .
Discovering too late that eradication was counterproductive , the U.S. government decided this summer to switch its efforts from eradication to subsidized crop replacement schemes .
However , rarely have alternative development programs worked , unless farmers are growing new crops that yield a naturally higher profit margin .
Crop subsidy schemes are limited in duration and lack the funds to be sustainable .
The third false assumption is that these counter - narcotics programs will win the hearts and minds of Afghanistan ’s rural poor .
Improving transportation and trade infrastructure to help get legal crops to market would go further .
But for those efforts to be sustained , the security situation needs to be improved first .
If all of these policies are counterproductive , what should NATO allies do in Afghanistan ?
Nothing at the extreme upstream end of the supply chain .
Opium and heroin production has increased at such an alarming rate in the last eight years that the resulting supply glut has led to a dramatic fall in prices .
Consequently , farmers in many parts of the country are switching to legal crops of their own free will .
Advertisement
Opium production levels have been so high in recent years that the United Nations estimates Afghan drug traffickers have stockpiled enough opium and heroin to supply the world ’s addicts for more than two years .
While it has been suggested that the Taliban might be stockpiling supplies in order to corner the market , a more likely explanation is that drug traffickers within the Taliban and the Karzai government are holding on to excess stocks as they wait for prices to recover .
The temporary elimination of opium production by the Taliban in 2000 - 2001 was also because of massive overproduction in preceding years and a resulting price collapse in raw opium .
The Taliban issued a “ ban ” on production that year to drive up prices so farmers and traffickers could sell off excess stocks .
The most sensible solution is to leave farmers alone and instead crack down on traffickers in the border regions .
That is the only strategy that will squeeze the market .
And if the farmers cannot find buyers for their opium , prices will be driven down even further , providing more incentive to voluntarily switch to crops such as dried fruits , pomegranates and spices .
So how does all of this fit in with the Obama administration ’s new counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan ?
We know the Taliban is raising money from taxing and trafficking opium and heroin .
But that has little to do with Afghanistan ’s farmers .
We need to leave the farmers alone and focus our efforts on controlling Afghanistan ’s border crossings , targeting both drug traffickers and militants .
And an effort to remove the 2/3 majority vote required to make fiscal changes to the budget ...

California , a state which , at $ 1.8 trillion , has the world 's eighth largest economy , now finds itself at the edge of an economic abyss .
Despite Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Draconian cuts to health care and education of more than $ 15 billion , purportedly to close a $ 26.3 billion gap in the state 's finances , despite a pending 32 % increase in student tuition at all University of California campuses and three " furlough " days per month in which state employees are forced to stay home without pay , California now faces a 2010 budget deficit estimated to range from $ 21 billion to $ 25 billion .
As shocking as it may seem , this looming fiscal catastrophe did not arrive by accident .
It is , according to a number of progressive policy experts , the intended product of a Republican - led privatization scheme ...
Privatization Madness and The Shock Doctrine
During a Nov. 17 appearance on Democracy Now ( video at end of article ) George Lakoff , a professor of linguistics at the University of California , asserted the source of this looming economic disaster stems from a greed - based , Republican agenda which seeks to destroy government , replacing its public functions --- health , education , safety --- with a privatized , for profit system --- an agenda which has succeeded in large measure in California because it is the only state where a 2/3 majority approval is required on all revenue and budget legislation .
Right now we have an economic disaster and an ecological disaster upon us , and those two disasters have the same cause : namely , short - term greed combined with a lack of an understanding of systemic risk , of how systems work both in ecology and in the economy .
What Lakoff discusses is by no means limited to California .
In The Shock Doctrine , Naomi Klein refers to a form of " disaster capitalism " applied on a global scale , where disasters , both natural and man-made ( war , deliberately engineered economic collapse ) , are utilized not merely to permit a tiny class of global economic elites to loot national treasuries but to radically alter national economies by placing everything , e.g. , water , health , safety , prisons , even fire fighting , into private hands --- vastly increasing the cost of living for ordinary citizens while transferring enormous wealth to an already wealthy investor class .
In Wealth and Democracy historian Kevin Phillips underscored the obscene gap in wealth that already exists for that investor class , noting that by 1999 the net worth of just three individuals , Bill Gates , Paul Allen , and Warren Buffet , was larger than the gross domestic product of the world ’s 41 poorest nations and their 550 million people .
It was a point again underscored when a pair of government reports exposed the stark contrast between the four largest Wall Street firms reporting $ 22.5 billion in profits for the first three quarters of this year even as " 50 million Americans — including a quarter of all children — struggled to get enough to eat .... "
Both Klein and Phillips point to the hard - right economic theories of Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics , which Phillips refers to as a " vice - into - virtue " philosophy , noting :
To Friedman , greed was the basis of society .
The challenge of social organization , he said , was to ‘ set up an arrangement under which greed will do the least harm : capitalism is that kind of system .
’… He dismissed the idea of a res publica --- a public interest apart from individual and group self - interests .
It is this radical theory that is embodied in the infamous call by the right - wing anti-tax guru Grover Norquist , referenced by David Brock in Blinded by the Right , to create such a massive sea of red ink that the federal government “ could be drowned in a bathtub ; ” a perverted wish that metaphorically came to fruition when thousands of New Orleans ' mostly African - American residents were left to sink or swim in a toxic soup of flood waters , petrochemicals , and decaying bodies because they were too poor to own vehicles in which they could flee the path of Katrina .
In Moyers on America , Bill Moyers described the hard - right 's agenda as a movement that is " systematically stripping government of its capacity ... to do little more than reward the rich and wage war . "
And even the war - making function has been increasingly privatized , first with the logistics and support function turned over to private firms like KBR and then by increasing reliance on private mercenary firms like Blackwater / Xe , all at an enormously inflated , taxpayer - funded price .
California 's Electric Shock
The telling blow to California 's economy came shortly after the Bush / Cheney cabal seized power .
California 's energy market , deregulated under former Republican Governor Pete Wilson , was ripe for the picking .
In swooped the Texas - based energy mafia .
What was thought at the time to be a series of rolling black - outs brought on by excessive consumer demand was ultimately exposed by the Alex Gibney documentary , Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room , to be the product of deliberate manipulation .
The market was scammed .
A hapless Democratic Governor Gray Davis , faced with soaring spot market prices and stonewalled when he sought federal price - control assistance from the Bush / Cheney cabal , was left with no alternative but to enter inflated long term contracts with the Texas - based energy traders .
The combination of lost revenue secondary to the collapse of the dot - com bubble and the Republican - aided scamming of the state 's energy market produced what was then a record California budget deficit .
Enter Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) , who , with an estimated $ 251 million net worth , is the richest member of Congress and therefore wealthy enough to have bankrolled the Recall of Gray Davis .
During the Recall , the Republican 's slick media campaign blamed Davis for the fiscal crisis the Republican - allied and aided energy traders had engineered .
Ironically , at the height of this manufactured crisis , on May 17 , 2001 , Arnold Schwarzenegger took part in a private meeting at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills with Enron CEO Ken Lay and Michael Milken , the infamous " Junk Bond King " who , in 1989 , was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and securities fraud .
According to Greg Palast , a 34 - page Enron internal memorandum revealed that the true purpose behind the meeting and subsequent Recall was Lay 's desire to head off an unfair business practice lawsuit brought by then Democratic Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante .
The suit sought to recoup some $ 9 billion from the rapacious energy traders .
While the deception and Schwarzenegger 's celebrity status permitted the Republican Party to capture the governor 's mansion , and while this permitted the Republicans to , for example , stack the U.C. Board of Regents with well - connected individuals bent on privatization of the U.C. system , * Democrats remained firmly in control of both the California Senate and Assembly , yet powerless to prevent Republicans from carrying out their radical privatization agenda due to the 2/3 rule which permitted the Party of No to simply stonewall , refusing to pass any budget that was not favored by wealthy corporations and individuals .
As the radical privatizing state legislative Republicans held out well beyond the last budget deadline , the state 's ledgers were clogged with $ 470 million in IOUs as the state 's credit dropped to near junk bond status .
The absurdity prompted Ronald M. George , Chief Justice of the CA Supreme Court and a moderate Republican , to conclude that the 2/3 rule had placed elected officials inside " a fiscal straitjacket . "
George Lakoff and the California Democracy Act
Absent another expensive recall , California will be stuck with Schwarzenegger until January 2011 .
But it does not have to remain hostage to the insanity of the privatization agenda .
Lakoff 's solution is the California Democracy Act , a proposed ballot measure which reads : “ All legislative action on revenue and budget must be determined by a majority vote . ”
Unfortunately , this straightforward measure has already encountered an obstacle from an unexpected source .
Lakoff submitted the the proposed initiative to the office of CA Attorney General Jerry Brown , which , while not altering its content , erroneously described the act as [ emphasis added ] one which “ changes the vote requirement to pass a budget and to raise taxes . ”
Per Lakoff , the CA Attorney General 's description is misleading :
You can raise revenue without raising a tax rate at all , say , by plugging loopholes .
If you say ' raise taxes , ' most people think it means raise taxes on them significantly .
But if the majority runs the state , then the majority can decide whether or not taxes should be raised on them , or whether taxes should be raised at all , or lowered , or whether loopholes should be plugged to raise revenue , or whether revenue should be raised by selling oil to oil companies rather than just giving it away .
Hopefully , Lakoff can educate Brown on the importance of an accurate description of this vital measure so as to prevent the hard right from pointing to the Attorney General 's description in support of a deceptive claim that a " yes " vote on the California Democracy
Act equates to raising everyone 's taxes .

Board of Regents have perverted the U.C. system , turning it from an institution devoted to undergraduate education to a profit - making and risk - taking financial venture ...

‘ You could hear the blows ’ says a nun in his office
Pope John Paul , who died four years ago at 84 , is being considered for sainthood by the Catholic Church – the ultimate accolade and a tribute to his holiness .
As part of the Vatican ’s investigation , thousands of documents have been examined by officials from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints .
Among them is the testimony of Polish nun Tobiana Sobodka , a member of the Sacred Heart of Jesus order .
She worked for Pope John Paul in his private Vatican apartments and at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo near Rome .
Sister Sobodka said : “ Several times he would put himself through bodily penance .
“ We would hear it – we were in the next room at Castel Gandolfo .
You could hear the sound of the blows when he flagellated himself .
He did it when he was still capable of moving on his own . ”
Imagine some idiot in a bank sends you a mail by mistake , thinking you are someone else .

It all happened thanks to the Wyoming - based Rocky Mountain Bank and Judge James Ware — a U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of California who , according to the Wikipedia , fabricated " the story of being the brother of Virgil Ware , a 13 year old black boy shot by teenage racists in Alabama in 1963 on the same day as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing . "
So nice !
This is the story : A Rocky Mountain Bank employee sent a confidential document containing the names , addresses , tax identification numbers , and loan information of 1,325 people and businesses .
Instead of sending it to the right person , the employee used another email address by mistake , only to realize his mess a little bit later .
They tried to contact the person at the wrong address , but that person did n't reply .

As a result , and probably panicking they were going to be sued themselves if their imbroglio was uncovered , they decided to sue Google , asking them to release the identity of the person who owned the Gmail account .
At the same time , they filed a motion asking the court to keep the lawsuit secret .
Fortunately , Judge Ronald M. Whyte — who at the time was acting on behalf of Judge Ware — denied the secrecy of the case .
Then came the real Judge Ware and his shiny big fat gavel , to screw up everything a little more :
When Google said that the idiotic bank 's fuzzuckup was not their problem , and refused to provide the identity of the user , the judge ordered Google to shut down the Gmail account .

New York Times op - ed , The Department of Lucrative Athletics , by Gilbert M. Gaul :
If college presidents really wanted to halt the college sports machine , they could try two options .
They could insist that athletic departments operate within their university budgets , like the English or biology departments ; or they could ask Congress to rescind the tax breaks on the commercial income earned by athletic programs .
Many booster clubs are recognized as charities under the federal tax code .
At Florida and Georgia , to name just two universities , the athletic departments are set up as charities .
Universities also have access to tax - exempt financing when building ever - larger stadiums and arenas .
Boosters and donors benefit from generous tax deductions when they buy the best seats or endow an athletic scholarship .
That ’s right : colleges now endow their quarterbacks and linebackers the same way they do a distinguished chair of American literature .
Another key element fueling the [ college sports ] arms race is the increasingly indefensible tax treatment of sports revenues .
Decades ago — before the lucrative television contracts , Internet marketing , Nike sponsorships and luxury boxes —
Congress essentially exempted colleges from paying taxes on their sports income .
The legislators ’ reasoning now appears shockingly quaint : that participation in college sports builds character and is an important component of the larger college experience .
Long viewed as an integral component of higher education , sports in many universities have become highly commercialized .
Successful athletic programs are very rewarding financially :
The NCAA men ’s basketball tournament alone garnered about $ 143 million in revenue for athletic departments in 2008 , and college football bowl games generated a similar amount .
Such large sums raise the questions of whether those sports programs have become side businesses for schools and , if they have , whether the same tax preferences should apply to them as to schools in general .
This CBO paper compares athletic departments ’ share of revenue from commercial sources with that of the rest of the schools ’ activities to assess the degree of their commercialization .
It also discusses some of the issues that might arise if the Congress decided to alter the treatment of intercollegiate sports programs in the tax code .
...
The study also examines the issues that might arise if policymakers decided that some or all of the activities of the schools ’ athletic programs were primarily commercial rather than educational — a decision that would greatly reduce or eliminate the rationale for giving those activities preferential tax treatment .
The Congress could change the tax treatment of revenue from those activities in several ways , for example , by limiting the deduction for contributions , limiting the use of tax - exempt bonds , or limiting the exemption from income taxation .
...
[ R]emoving the major tax preferences currently available to university athletic departments would be unlikely to significantly alter the nature of those programs or garner much tax revenue even if the sports programs were classified , for tax purposes , as engaging in unrelated commercial activity .
As long as athletic departments remained a part of the larger nonprofit or public university , schools would have considerable opportunity to shift revenue , costs , or both between their taxed and untaxed sectors , rendering efforts to tax that unrelated income largely ineffective .
Changing the tax treatment of income from certain sources , such as corporate sponsorships or royalties from sales of branded merchandise , would be more likely to affect only the most commercial teams ; it would also create less opportunity for shifting revenue or costs .

The price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline remained relatively flat over the past week , however , the year - over - year price increase continues to climb higher .
Currently , the national average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline is $ 2.65 per gallon , down slightly from $ 2.66 per gallon a week ago .
This leveling off is due in large part to a pretty substantial drop in the price of oil due to increased concern that consumer and economic activity would remain extremely weak for an extended period of time .
Today ’s price is up from $ 2.50 a month ago and $ 2.11 a year ago .
Â
The year - over - year price gain represents just over a 25 % increase .
Â
Considering the United States and much of the rest of the world are stuck with sluggish economies and high unemployment , this significant jump in the price of gasoline has to be a cause for concern .
However , 2hile the jump in the price of gasoline is pretty steep , it certainly could be worse .
Â
Over the past year , the price of oil is up close to 40 % , and is up over 135 % since the January 1 , 2009 .
Only Hawaii ( $ 3.38 ) and Alaska ( $ 3.32 ) have a state - wide average price above $ 3 per gallon .
Â
There are 11 states with an average price below $ 2.50 per gallon , with Missouri having the lowest average price at $ 2.42 per gallon .

Fijian villagers are not the first to puzzle over Freemasonry 's rituals
A group of freemasons have had to spend a night in jail in Fiji , after local villagers complained they were practising witchcraft .
The 14 men , including eight Australians and a New Zealander , had been holding a night - time meeting on Denerau island .
The New Zealand man told reporters he had spent a " wretched " time in jail , and blamed the mix - up on the actions of " dopey village people " .
Police also seized wands , compasses and a skull from the freemasons ' lodge .
Freemasonry is a centuries - old club that practises secret rituals and has more than five million members worldwide .
' Nothing sinister '
The New Zealander , who did not want to give his name , told the New Zealand Herald that Tuesday night 's meeting was " interrupted by a banging on the door , and there were these village people and the police demanding to be let in " .
Nothing sinister was going on , he claimed , but " such is the nature of life in Fiji " they were taken to a nearby police station .
The freemasons insist they had a permit for the meeting and were released after spending an uncomfortable night there .
Police director of operations Waisea Tabakau told Legend FM News in Fiji that the group was being investigated for " allegedly practising sorcery " , the Fiji Village website reported .
The New Zealand man said that when they were freed the following morning , they were told their release was on the orders of the prime minister 's office .
Emergency regulations imposed by Fiji 's military regime allow police to detain people for up to 48 hours without charge .
Well , we did it .
Today we crossed Dow 10,000 .
Can Dow 36,000 be far behind ?
Let me explain my mockery : no one knows what the stock market is going to do next and , as I ’ve argued time and again , ordinary investors should n’t particularly care .
Sure , some of us like to pretend that all of this 1 ) matters a great deal , and 2 ) can be figured out with a moderate amount of concentrated thought .
Take , for example , my story from yesterday about how the rally might be running out of steam .
Yet in the bright light of day , most people will admit that what the stock market does in any given session is n’t all that significant — even if it crosses a threshold that seems like it should be really important for creatures that count in base 10 .
Here are some more reasons not to care about Dow 10,000 :
1 . This is n’t your father ’s Dow .
Or even your Dow .
Remember back in June when we took Citigroup and General Motors out of the Dow and put in Travelers and Cisco ?
We ’re comparing apples to rotten apples here .
If GM were still in the Dow , coming off its post - Cash for Clunkers high , do you think we ’d be talking Dow 10,000 ?
I doubt it .
In a way , we ’ve stacked the deck .
2 . The Dow is n’t terribly important to people who actually do things with money .
“ Dow 10,000 ” looks great in a headline , but very few professional investors pay the Dow much mind .
We are talking about only 30 stocks , after all .
Fund managers tend to care much more about the S&P 500 , Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 — broad indexes that , as such , give a better gauge of how companies overall are doing .
3 . The Dow has been a laggard of late , which should tell us something .
Since the beginning of the year , the Dow has risen about 14 % .
Meanwhile , the S&P 500 is up some 20 % .
Foreign stock indexes have risen even more .
If the Dow were keeping pace with these other averages , we would n’t be having this conversation about Dow 10,000 ; we would have already had it .
That underscores the artificiality of the link between the number 10,000 and what ’s actually going on in the world .
4 . The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an average , not an index .
If you turn to page 19 of your hymnal , you ’ll see that since the Dow predates Irving Fisher ’s push to bring indexing to the stock market , it ’s actually just a plain old mathematical average .
Meaning : companies with higher stock prices pull more weight , irrespective of how many shares they have outstanding .
To quote Justin : “ This measure generates some deeply weird results . ”
In 2007 , GE sold at $ 36 a share and Caterpillar at $ 72 .
So Caterpillar had twice the impact on the Dow as GE — even though Caterpillar ’s overall stock market capitalization was just 12 % of GE’s .
In summation : Dow 10,000 — yay !
Now everyone back to what you were doing .

The Four Color Theorem
Are there human checkable proofs of the Four Color Theorem ?
Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken made the Four Color Conjecture into the Four Color Theorem ( 4CT ) in 1976 .
Their proof , as you probably know , relies essentially on computer aided checking , which makes it not checkable by a human .
Today I want to talk about their proof , the nature of computer aided proofs , and new alternative approaches to the 4CT .
I also want to draw a parallel between their great achievement and some of our open problems .
I was at Yale University , in the Computer Science Department , when they discovered their proof .
The Yale mathematics department quickly invited Haken to give a talk on their proof .
As you might expect the room was filled , and Haken give a wonderful talk : on the history of the famous problem , on previous approaches , and on their proof .
I remember two things vividly about his visit–even though it was over thirty years ago .
During the talk , he was asked what type of computer they used , since the proof required extensive computation .
Today no one would probably ask this question , since the computations could be done easily on laptops .
However , by 1970 ’s standards , the computation was huge : over 1200 hours was needed on a “ super- computer ” .
Haken answered that he did not know what type of computer they used , but it was “ blue . ”
That got a good laugh ; in those days blue meant an IBM mainframe .
The other recollection is what Haken said to me during a private conversation I had with him , before his talk .
I quickly realized that Haken , who previously had been a Siemens engineer , had a very pragmatic approach to the four color problem .
To him it was more like an engineering project , then a delicate mathematical proof .
One of the central issues was discovering whether certain graphs were reducible , which I will define later on .
The proof required that a specific set of about two thousand small planar graphs were reducible .
What impressed me was that Haken had heuristic rules .
He could look at a small graph and almost always see instantly whether or not the graph was reducible : even though the computer took a long time to actually decide reducibility .
He also said that if one of the graphs later turned out to not be reducible , then he could easily find another one that would work in its place .
Somehow he had “ over - engineered ” the proof , as you would a bridge for safety .
The Computer Assisted Proofs of 4CT
Subsequently , Neil Robertson , Daniel Sanders , Paul Seymour and Robin Thomas created a new proof based on the same basic approach as Appel and Haken , but they simplified some technical parts .
There even is some belief that perhaps the “ new ” proof is the first complete one .
The Appel and Haken proof had a number of details that were found to be wrong , and had to be fixed .
They also used some technically tricky arguments that the new proof avoided .
I tend to believe that Appel and Haken have a correct proof , but I base this not on any first hand knowledge .
I know Appel ’s son well , he has been a professor at Princeton and has told me some details of how he helped his dad and Haken with the programming .
Many times , Haken has stressed that he and Appel should not deserve full credit for solving the four - color theorem .
“ We did the last 20 percent , Ó he says .
We were the fifth generation of people working on the problem , so four - fifths had been done by others .
Ó
Someone like that deserves to be right .
In any case both proofs rely on an extensive computer computation , and they both have roughly the same overall structure .
As Haken says , they were just following the path that previous researchers had travelled .
The proofs of the 4CT are both inductive .
Assume by way of contradiction that the 4CT is false , then let be a planar graph that is the smallest size counter - example .
Let be a finite set of planar graphs , this set of graphs is cleverly chosen to have two key properties .
First , is unavoidable .
This means that every planar graph has one of the graphs as a subgraph .
In both proofs the size of this set is large , but not too large .
For example , in the original proof the size was about , in the newer proof the size is less than half that .
The proof that is unavoidable is based on a clever argument that uses the famous Euler ’s relationship
for planar graphs , where are the number of edges , is the number of vertices , and the number of faces .
The way that is proved to be unavoidable is based on a discharging argument , that was created by Heinrich Heesch .
Roughly “ charges ” are assigned to the vertices of a planar graph .
The charges are moved based on certain local rules : total charge is preserved by all such moves .
The key is the rules eventually yield a negative charge as long as no subgraph of is in .
But the charge can be shown to be positive initially by Euler ’s formula , so this is impossible .
Now for the computer aided part .
The set of unavoidable graphs are proved to be reducible .
Roughly this means that they cannot be a subgraph of any counter - example to the 4CT .
This is where the computer checking occurs .
The computer needs to do an exponential calculation of all possible boundary colorings to show that these graphs are reducible .
Note , it is not the number of graphs that is a problem .
Checking that even one is reducible seems to be an impossible task for a human .
This implies the 4CT , since is seen not be a minimal counter - example graph .
Conventional Wisdom was Wrong–Again
One of the great achievements , I believe , of Appel and Haken was the not the proof of 4CT .
It was believing that the structure I just outlined would work .
The general structure of unavoidable graphs and reducibility , had already been used before them .
The previous proofs were all of the following type :
If a planar graph has less than vertices , then it is four colorable .
Researchers believed that could be made larger and larger with greater work , but the conventional wisdom was that one could never prove that , i.e. use the method to completely solve the four color conjecture .
Note , some believed that the method could not work in principle , while others believed that it could work in principle , but could not be done in practice .
However , Appel and Haken “ really ” believed and push on , where others had stopped .
Everyone before them had used sets that came with both good and bad news .
The bad news was that the set was not unavoidable , it was true that a graph could only avoid by being larger than some bound , say vertices .
The good news was that the graphs in were small enough that their reducibility could be checked by hand .
The brilliance , I believe , of Appel and Haken was to believe that there would be a set of unavoidable graphs with two properties :
First , that the set would be finite and unavoidable for all planar graphs , not just small ones , Second , that the graphs in the set could be checked for reducibility by computers that were available to them at the time .
The search to test reducibility grows roughly exponential in the size of the boundary of the graphs .
Haken told me that he had heuristic arguments that showed that he could keep the size of graphs small enough so that the computer calculation would work , yet large enough so they would be unavoidable .
The conventional wisdom at the time was mixed whether or not this approach could ever prove the 4CT for all planar graphs , but Appel and Haken believed in the method .
It sounds almost silly , but sometimes problems get solved when someone believes that a method will work , where others believed it would not .
This has happened over and over in mathematics ; for example , the same phenomena happen with Hilbert ’s Tenth problem on Diophantine Equations .
More on that in the future .
I think this is a lesson for us .
Is there some method that we have tossed aside , yet it can be made to work to solve P=NP ?
Are They Proofs ?
I was at a meeting at the Royal Society in 2004 , on : What is the nature of proof ?
Rich DeMillo and I are ( in ) famous for writing a paper on the role of proof in the correctness of computer programs .
I will discuss our paper another time .
They invited Rich , but since he was unavailable I got to go and give a talk at the conference .
In any event , I was honored to be at a Royal Society meeting .
One talk was given by Robert MacPherson on another proof that is based on large computer computations and has no known human checkable proof .
To quote MacPherson :
In 1609 , Kepler made a beautiful conjecture about spheres in space .
It was one of the oldest unsolved problems in mathematics .
In 1998 , Tom Hales produced a brilliant computer - assisted proof of the Kepler conjecture .
By now , the theoretical part of Hales ’ proof has been refereed as usual mathematical papers , but the parts involving the computer have resisted all efforts at checking by humans .
Should we think of the Kepler conjecture proved ?
As you might expect there was quite a lively discussion about what are proofs and is a computer assisted proof a proof ?
No consensus was reached by the group , but it is interesting that most ( all ) the heavy hitters – Michael Aschbacher , Michael Atiyah , Paul Cohen , Jean - Pierre Serre–argued against computer aided proofs .
Their main point , stated strongly by Cohen , was that proofs were not to check that something is true .
Rather the role of proof is to give insight into the problem at hand .
A humanly understand proof can lead to additional insights , can open up new avenues of discovery .
That is missing , in their opinion , in any proof that is not understandable .
I will say more about this in the future , for I think it is a fascinating issue .
One that is at the core of much of what we do in theory .
Human Proofs of 4CT ?
As you might expect there continues to be considerable interest in finding a proof of the 4CT that does not use any computer search .
Even recently , new restatements of the theorem have been discovered .
Yuri Matiyasevich , of Hilbert ’s Tenth Problem fame , has proved that the 4CT is equivalent to the statement that a particular Diophantine equation
has no solution in natural numbers .
He has also showed that 4CT can be proved by proving certain statements about a probabilistic space on the triangulations of a sphere .
The statements concern the positive correlation among pairs of events .
In the same spirit , I wish to report a new restatement of the 4CT .
To my knowledge , this is the first restatement to an “ Erdös - type ” approximate combinatorial problem .
This is joint work with three of graduate students : Atish Das Sarma , Amita Gajewar , Danupon Nanongkai of Georgia Tech .
Our Approach
Peter Tait proved in 1880 that the 4CT is equivalent to showing that certain planar graphs have edge 3 - colorings .
More precisely , Tait proved the following theorem :
Theorem :
Let be a cubic two - edge connected plane graph .
has an edge 3 - coloring if and only if has a face 4 - coloring .
Tait ’s proof of his theorem is constructive .
In modern terms he actually proves that each implication can be done in linear time .
Thus , if a graph has an edge 3 - coloring , then the face 4 - coloring can be constructed in linear time .
Tait used his theorem to claim a “ proof ” of the 4CT .
He assumed that every two - edge connected cubic planar graph has a Hamiltonian tour .
This assumption is unfortunately false as shown years later , in 1946 , by William Tutte : there are such planar graphs without any Hamiltonian tours .
Note , the existence of such a tour easily proves that the graph is edge 3 - colorable .
The proof of this is simple : Color the edges of the tour alternatively red / green .
Color all other edges blue .
It is easy to see that this is a valid edge 3 - coloring of the graph .
Note , the reason this works is that a cubic graph must have an even number of vertices .
Our approach to the 4CT is this :
Theorem :
If every two - edge connected , cubic , planar graph can be edge 3 - colored with errors , then the Four Color Theorem is true .
By a 3 - coloring with errors we mean an assignment of 3 colors to the edges of the graph so that at most vertices have two edges of the same color .
Thus , the theorem says that we can strengthen Tait ’s theorem to allow errors , where is the number of vertices .
The hope , that we have made no progress on yet , is that there is a clever combinatorial argument that colorings with few errors always exist .
We think that allowing errors in the coloring could allow powerful tools from modern combinatorics to be applied to the 4CT .
We will see .
In the our theorem we regard the four color theorem as a conjecture ( otherwise , the theorem statement is trivial ) .
One way of looking at our theorem is we ask for a proof of the fact that every two - edge connected cubic planar graph , on vertices , can be decomposed into a union of disjoint cycles covering all vertices , with at most odd length cycles .
If such a decomposition exists , we can color the edges on every cycle with red and green alternatively , and color all other edges with blue .
This way , there will be at most errors .
In fact , we do not even need a cycle cover , it is sufficient to have a cover of paths and cycles with paths and odd cycles .
This is a weaker requirement than Tait ’s , as he needed a Hamiltonian tour .
For the full details of the proof see our paper .
However , the basic idea is based on an amplification “ trick ” .
Suppose that is a two - edge connected , cubic , planar graph that can not be 3 - edge colored .
We will take copies of and glue them together to form a new graph .
The gluing together yields a two - edge connected , cubic , planar graph .
By assumption it has an approximate 3 - edge coloring with at most
errors .
For large enough , we get that one of the copies of is colored with no errors .
However , there is a small problem , the subgraph that is a copy of has been modified : it has extra vertices and edges .
These were added so it could be connected to other copies of .
Thus , the last step is to show that this can be overcome .
We finally , get a 3 - edge coloring of , which is a contradiction .
Open Problems
There are several open questions .
The main one is to find a non-computer based proof of the 4CT .
Either use Matiyasevich ’s approach , or our approach , or one of your own ; but make it humanly checkable .
Another question is to make the known computer proofs human proofs .
The issue is the reducibility step needs to be made humanly checkable .
A way to do this , at least in principle , is to show that checking whether a graph is reducible or not is in NP .
Then , we could use the computer to generate a short proof that we could check by hand .
The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) last week launched a campaign against Microsoft Corp .'s upcoming Windows 7 operating system , calling it " treacherous computing " that stealthily takes away rights from users .
At the Web site Windows7Sins.org , the Boston - based FSF lists the seven " sins " that proprietary software such as Windows 7 commits against computer users .
They include : Poisoning education , locking in users , abusing standards such as OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) , leveraging monopolistic behavior , threatening user security , enforcing Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) at the request of entertainment companies concerned about movie and music piracy , and invading your privacy .
" Windows , for some time now , has really been a DRM platform , restricting you from making copies of digital files , " said executive director Peter Brown .
And if Microsoft 's Trusted Computing technology were fully implemented the way the company would like , the vendor would have " malicious and really complete control over your computer . "
The result is that Microsoft could do things like Amazon.com , which last month went into customers '
Kindle e-readers and deleted illegally - sold copies of novels such as George Orwell 's 1984 , he said .
" This is treacherous computing , " Brown said .
Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The group , best - known for overseeing the General Public License ( GPL ) used by most open - source software , including Linux , will hold a rally at noon in Boston Common , where it will unveil a 12 - foot - tall art installation depicting Windows 7 " being trashed , " Brown said .
The group is also sending a letter ( available at the group 's Web site ) to top executives at Fortune 500 companies that argues their companies would benefit ethically , technically and , in the long - term , financially , from switching away from Windows and Microsoft Office to free alternatives such as Linux and OpenOffice.org .
Founded in the mid-1980s by hacker - activist Richard Stallman , the FSF argues that free software and source code is a moral right .
It takes pains to distinguish itself from the open - source movement , which advocates sharing of source code but tolerates charging for software .
Both groups , however , view proprietary software vendors such as Microsoft , Adobe Systems Inc. , and Apple Inc. as the enemy , Brown said .
Even with DRM , users running Windows PCs still maintain more freedom and privacy than those who foolishly use cloud computing services such as Google Docs and store their data there .
" That is the ultimate giving - away of your freedom , " he said .
" That 's not a software freedom issue , it 's a stupidity issue . "
While Brown acknowledges that many Fortune 500 companies base their businesses around proprietary business models similar to Microsoft , he also points out that most of them , at least regarding software , are more consumer than vendor .
" Large corporations spend an awful lot of money on software .
They face numerous software audits and more vendor lock - in than you or me , " Brown said .
" Do you think they would rather be driving on a freeway , or always be paying on toll roads ? "
" I 'm not expecting an instant wave of companies switching off XP to Linux , " he said .
" But we would like get that debate going .
Hopefully , some will re-evaluate and say no to Windows 7 . "

Today , Minneapolis - based activists Carrie Feldman and Scott DeMuth refused to testify in front of a grand jury in Davenport , Iowa , and were found to be in contempt of court .
They were immediately handcuffed and hauled off by U.S. Marshalls .
According to District Judge John Jarvey , who presided over the contempt hearings , both will remain incarcerated until they agree to testify .
The state can lock them up for the duration of the grand jury –another 11 months .
For reasons all too familiar and valid to anyone who has followed the escalation of Green Scare repression , both Carrie and Scott refused to cooperate with the grand jury by providing information about themselves and their comrades .
We stand in solidarity with them for refusing to be complicit in their own persecution .
We will stand with them every day until they are free .
While the law does not compel the U.S. Attorney ’s Office to disclose the subject of the grand jury investigation , supporters believe that it is likely related to an unsolved Animal Liberation Front action in 2004 at the University of Iowa .
At the time , Carrie was only 15 years old and Scott was only 17 years old ; both were residents of the Twin Cities .
However , both have more recently been involved in supporting political prisoners , specifically those incarcerated as a result of the government ’s targeting of animal - rights and environmental activists .
Carrie , Scott , and their communities feel that this support work has now made them targets as well .
Prior to their grand jury appearances today and the contempt hearings that followed , between 30 and 40 supporters rallied outside the Federal Courthouse in Davenport .
The support rally was characterized by a disproportionate law enforcement presence , and the proceedings themselves by a sense in the courtroom that the state ’s actions were perfunctory at best .
District Judge Jarvey dismissed out of hand arguments offered by both Carrie and Scott ’s counsel regarding the need for them to remain free .
For instance , Carrie is her ailing grandmother ’s caretaker and Scott is currently a graduate student whose intellectual and professional integrity would be irreparably damaged by participating in a sealed investigation .
In response , the judge simply read verbatim the legal language about contempt charges and then ordered the two taken into custody immediately .
For his part , U.S. Attorney Cliff Cronk not only ignored the calls that flooded his office on Monday demanding that the subpoenas be quashed , allowing Carrie and Scott to continue on with their lives , but went substantially further down the rabbit hole .
In Carrie ’s case , in particular , his arguments and implications were egregiously over - the - top .
Cross - examining Carrie ’s father , for instance , Cronk cynically implied that the elderly grandmother she cares for was a sort of pawn in an elaborate ruse to avoid incarceration .
He suggested that a shirt Carrie had been photographed wearing , in which the letters “ L ” and “ F ” were visible , was evidence of “ membership ” in either the ALF or ELF .
And he even cited the fact that she has a white rat companion animal as evidence of … something or other .
It would all be a rather inspired piece of satire if he were kidding .
With both Carrie and Scott currently incarcerated , it ’s unfortunately clear he ’s not .
But the community members who attended the morning ’s rally – as well as those who publicly gathered in support from Minneapolis to Dallas , TX – are n’t laughing , either .
They have vowed to mount pressure on Cronk ’s office , demanding Carrie and Scott ’s immediate release .
Since the grand jury process gleans much of its power from its secrecy , they intend to increase the attention currently being cast on these Orwellian proceedings .
Prior to appearing before the grand jury , Carrie and Scott prepared statements regarding the repression they are facing :
Carrie Feldman
Today I have my second appearance before a federal grand jury that is investigating animal rights actions that occurred at the University of Iowa in 2004 .
Last month , after being subpoenaed in Minneapolis with one day ’s notice , I appeared before this grand jury and plead my Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent .
Today , that right will be sidestepped with technical legal “ protections ” that have little or no substantive value .
I will once again be put in front of a grand jury with no lawyer present in the room , and once again they will attempt to coerce me to testify .
The prosecutor has filed to grant me immunity .
I do not need immunity from prosecution for a crime that I was not involved in and have no relation to .
This will not change my decision to refuse to cooperate with the grand jury .
I stand here today in solidarity with everyone who has stood up to resist the exploitation of the environment and animals , the repression of the state , and the abuses of the justice system .
In anticipation of my refusal to cooperate , the court has scheduled a contempt hearing for today at ten o’clock .
And they ’re right .
I do feel contempt for a justice system that prosecutes people for property damage that is done in defense of life , while real violence is committed at the hands of vivisectors , the police , and the military on a daily basis .
I feel contempt for the federal agents that would use these prosecutions as a pretext to investigate above ground movements and activists like me , with no apparent grounds other than my political beliefs and legal activities .
I will not help them to do this , and I will not let them violate my rights and privacy .
Today , I may be taken to jail for up to eleven months , solely for taking a moral stand against an institution that I believe to be corrupt and obsolete .
I have not been accused of any crime .
So let me ask you this , Clifford Cronk .
Is it worth it to you ?
Is it worth it to you when my friend ’s eight year old sobs , wondering if her mother could be going to jail next ?
Is it worth it , Tom Reinwart ?
Is it worth it to you when my elderly grandma is without a caretaker ?
Is this what you work for , Melissa Hendrickson ?
Is it worth it to tear an innocent 20 - year - old woman away from everyone that she loves and cares for ?
Is this justice ?
Thank you for your support .

Hello all my relatives .
With a good heart , I greet you all with a handshake .
It is good to see all of you here today .
My name is Scott .
My place name is Dakota is Hepan .
I am from Bdote , the confluence of the Mnisota and Mississippi Rivers , where the creation of the Bdewakantunwan took place .
Before anything else , I wanted to address you all in the Dakota language .
State repression is n’t anything new to this country , or even to this city .
One hundred and forty - six years ago , only a few
miles from this courthouse , over 300 Dakota prisoners of war were held in a concentration camp .
Over a third of them died in their captivity .
Whatever happens to me today , whatever I face , it will be easy in
light of the hardships those men faced .
Right now , my heart is really good .
I am glad to see so many people from so many of the communities I am a part of here to support me today .
Being part of a community means we help each other .
We support each other .
We strengthen each other .
And sometimes , we must make sacrifices for each other .
Grand juries started as an important part of our justice system to prevent over - reaching prosecuting powers .
However , this process has been used historically against political movements .
In the context of
this history , most recently in the Green Scare , when investigative techniques of law enforcement have been halted by the silence of political movements , grand juries have been used as a tactic to intimidate our communities and as an attempt to coerce testimony from movement members .
This is an abuse of a constitutionally mandated process by using it as an investigative tool rather than its intended purpose .
Grand juries can be very disempowering for us all , and especially for those targeted by them .
We face questioning without legal counsel present or a right to remain silent .
We can be threatened , coerced ,
and jailed .
However , no punishment could be worse than surrendering our values .
And this decision , whether we cooperate or resist , is the one thing we , as individuals , have control of in this process .
Luckily , this is the choice that allows these grand juries to succeed or to fail .
Our willingness to cooperate and to be complacent , our willingness to be intimidated and to be scared , not only serves to legitimize these proceedings , but it also empowers the tactics of state repression .
However , when we as individuals , with the strength and backing of our communities , are no longer afraid of their punishment , choose to resist this process and refuse to cooperate , we dis -empower this
tactic and give strength to our communities .
We return the strength that is given to us .
So thank you all for giving me that strength .
And I only hope to give back as much as has been given to me .

The Naked Emperor
( Author 's Note : After sending an email to a CNN reporter about his story on Rom Houben , the Belgian man who was misdiagnosed as being in a coma for 23 years and who is now able to communicate about his experience via Facilitated Communication , I was contacted by someone from Campbell Brown about a possible appearance on the show to talk about why we should doubt the validity of the communications .
It turns out that they did not use me , and instead interviewed neuropsychologist Joseph Giacino , who they also interviewed the week before when the story first broke .
After watching the segment , I penned the following , which I have slightly modified for Swift . )
It seems obvious that Rom Houben is not able to communicate .
One does n't even need to test it , although I would bet James Randi's $ 1,000,000 offer that even the simplest test -- blocking the assistant 's view of the keyboard -- would yield proof .
Has anyone thought to ask how Mr. Houben is able to type on a keyboard , especially so fluently , when his eyes are closed or if he is not looking at the keyboard ?
Or how he is able to move his hands or fingers after 23 years of immobility and muscle atrophy ?
Do we simply take the word of his assistant , who is heavily invested , that she can feel slight movements in his hand guiding hers ?
Dr. Giacino , whom Campbell Brown asked about this , is mistaken that " that there is no way to determine Mr. Houben 's contribution to these typewritten sentences relative to the assistant 's contribution . "
In fact , it is quite simple to make that determination .
There are a number of tests that can be easily carried out , including a double - blind test in which Mr. Houben and his assistant are each shown both the same and different pictures or objects and then asked what they saw .
It was laudable that Campbell Brown showed a brief comment by Dr. Arthur Caplan questioning the communication .
But that was not enough , because there is more than just doubt or skepticism about it .
All on has to do is watch the video .
What it shows is n't even subtle cueing , as in the Clever Hans case , or an example of the ideomotor effect such as one experiences with a Ouija Board .
It 's really a no - brainer to see that the assistant is doing the typing .
Her eyes are constantly on the keyboard as she moves his hand to the letters ; Mr. Houben 's eyes are not .
It is not correct to describe a " controversy surrounding " Facilitated Communication ( FC ) , or to suggest that there is " skepticism " about it , as though there were any lingering debate about its validity .
The matter was long ago settled : FC does n't work with anyone .
It has never been shown to be reliable ; not once in over 25 years .
And it is not " often " the facilitator who is responsible for what is written as was mentioned by Brown ; it is always the facilitator who is responsible , albeit usually unconsciously .
It is also not correct to state , as CNN did on the screen during the Campbell Brown show , that " Houben 's brain is fully functional . "
How can anyone make that claim ?
He appears to still be in a persistent vegetative state .
If he can " follow commands " or " do simple things " as Dr. Giacino and Houben 's doctors claim , then why can't he move a finger to type on his own ?
Or blink his eyes in response to questions ?
Why do n't they show us that ?
I do n't know what kind of neuroimaging was done or what it showed , but there is no question that Mr. Houben still has significant brain damage .
And no brain imaging method can determine that someone is " conscious , " if by " consciousness " we mean the ability to understand and describe what is going on .
Only some form of communication can allow that determination to be made .
In the case of Mr. Houben , it appears that the communication is a sham .
The tragedy in all of this is that Mr. Houben is being exploited by everyone , including the doctors and media , even while many of them may have good intentions .
When one realizes that he is not likely producing his own communications , then the scene of reporters " interviewing " him becomes macabre .
Someone is " speaking " for him , and that raises serious ethical concerns .
This emperor truly has no clothes .

The veteran defenceman , one of Toronto 's big - ticket free agent signings over the summer , missed the last three weeks with a small tear in his quad muscle but he suited up for full practice Sunday and coach Ron Wilson declared him ready to go .
Goaltender Vesa Toskala also practiced after missing the last week with a tweaked groin .
Wilson said the incumbent No. 1 netminder would " have to practice hard for a few days before I 'm convinced he 'll be ready to even backup . "
With Komisarek healthy , that gives the Leafs eight healthy defenceman and the coach said it was more than likely that Garnet Exelby and Jeff Finger would be the two to sit as healthy scratches .
Wilson said he did n't anticipate Komisarek having any trouble playing games on successive nights .
The Leafs travel to Montreal to face the Canadiens on Tuesday .
" It felt great .
Its never fun watching from the sidelines or watching your teammates on TV when they 're on the road .
I 'm anxious to get back that 's for sure , " said Komisarek , who has been skating on his own for a week .
Komisarek , paired again with Tomas Kaberle during Sunday 's practice , said the forced hiatus was a chance for him to " clear " his mind and come back into the lineup feeling confident with a " fresh start . "
The 27 - year - old left Montreal to sign a five - year , $ 22.5 million contract with the Leafs during the summer but he struggled noticeably during the 16 games he played before getting hurt .
He is a minus 9 rating which is tied with François Beauchemin as the worst on the team .
GRABOVSKI TAKES SWING AT BEAUCHEMIN
Mikhail Grabovski created an interesting distraction towards the end of practice when he angrily tried to get at François Beauchemin , first grabbing his visor and then punching the veteran defenceman in the face with a bare right hand .
Jason Blake , then assistant coach Tim Hunter stepped in to break up the pair before it became more heated .
" After day off , everybody wants to play hard because tomorrow is a game , " said Grabovski , who would not say what set him off .
" We need to be ready for tomorrow .
No comment .
I 'm okay . "
Grabovski , in his second year with the team , has been accused in the past of not respecting veteran teammates at practice .
He got into a fight with Blake during a practice last season .
Beauchemin declined to make himself available to reporters .
Wilson said it was no different than a minor family spat and a product of hard work at practice .
" It happens .
It 's hockey .
People get physical and upset with themselves or other people and it leads to a minor , little skirmish .
It 's nothing more than that .
You have more crap like that going on at home when you were 10 years old , fighting with you brothers .
It 's the same situation here , " said Wilson .
11:34 a.m. : As the Leafs ' practice in Etobicoke Sunday morning , they 've clearly received some good news on the injury front .
Defenceman Mike Komisarek is back on the ice practicing for the first time since suffering a small tear in his quadriceps muscle on Nov. 10 .
It was anticipated he would miss three weeks at the time and he appears to be right on schedule .
Komisarek is partnered with Tomas Kaberle at practice , which would suggest he will be in the lineup Monday night when the surging Leafs host Buffalo at the Air Canada Centre .

With eight healthy defenceman , the Leafs will have to sit two .
A likely option would be to sit the pair of Garnet Exelby and Jeff Finger .
Goaltender Vesa Toskala , who has been out with a groin injury , is also at practice .
That gives the Leafs three goalies .
If Toskala is ready to suit up Monday , Joey MacDonald will likely be returned to the Marlies .

Bottom Line
The HTC Droid Eris packs lots of good stuff into a small , sleek package , but it can't run Android 2.0 .
It does make the most of Android 1.5 , with all the bells and whistles you 'd expect from a modern smartphone .
It ca n't compare with the iPhone 3G or 3G S in most ways , but for our money it 's the better Droid .
It 's apparently not common knowledge that there are actually two Droids : the Motorola Droid and the HTC Droid Eris .
They 're both Android - based phones , but significantly different in form and firmware .
The Motorola Droid is a slider phone with a large screen and a physical keyboard that runs Android 2.0 .
The Droid Eris is cheaper , with a slower CPU and no dedicated GPU , but it 's also far slicker than the Motorola Droid .
I played with both Droids for a few minutes at my surprisingly uncrowded local Verizon store , and it quickly became clear that the HTC Droid Eris was the sleeker unit .
At $ 199 with a one - year contract and $ 100 mail - in rebate , it 's cheaper , too .
In fact , it seemed that most of my fellow shoppers gravitated to the Eris over the Motorola , which feels and looks like a brick and sports a nearly unusable keyboard .
So I picked the Eris .
[ Is Android 2.0 the iPhone killer at last ?
| Video preview : See the Android 2.0 Droid in action . ]
For a longtime iPhone user , the Eris is at once familiar and totally foreign .
The touchscreen has similar functions such as simple scrolling and wiping to change screens , but also includes four function buttons below the screen .
These buttons provide quick access to the home screen or a menu for the current application ; return you to the previous screen ; and launch a search function .
Thus , to someone used to dealing with only a touchscreen , the flow of application interaction is somewhat stilted , with commands and selections requiring taps to the screen intermingled with taps to one of these buttons .
These buttons are in addition to the standard call answer / call hangup buttons and the inexplicable rollerball .
For someone coming to a Droid from a mobile other than an iPhone , these interface elements are unlikely to be as noticeable , but when your reflexes are aligned to iPhone functions , they can be distracting .
Android inside
The initial layout of Android 1.5 on the Eris is quite pleasing .
The home screen offers a customizable selection of application shortcuts and a heads - up display with the current time and weather .
Off to each side of this screen are three " desktop " screens that can be populated with widgets , application shortcuts , or any mixture of the two .
The standard widgets , including an e-mail quick - viewer and a text messaging app , are extremely handy .
The e-mail quick - viewer , for example , shows the last received e-mail and lets you flip back in your inbox easily , without opening the full e-mail client .
On the other desktop screens , you can easily drop in launchers for any application , additional widgets such as the one for Google search , and shortcuts to common tasks such as turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on or off .
Once you grok the concept of having multiple configurable screens rather than , say , the iPhone 's launcher - only screens , you 'll appreciate the wealth of possibilities .

The Art of Engineering by David Kirkham
This book documents the project build from beginning to end .
It was n't until after the book was printed that there was any real thought to distributing it in any fashion beyond a few copies for those intimately involved in the project and a few close friends .
As people have begun to see copies of the book , we 've had requests to sell the billet aluminum bound book .
The billet bound book is available on an extremely limited basis for $ 4,500 per copy .
This is the ultimate hardcover book .
To make the machined aluminum binding requires more than 35 pounds of aluminum plate and over 30 hours of CNC mill time for each book .
Every page is printed on premium 12 " x 12 " cover stock .
For the story of the creation of the billet aluminum bound book , see chapter 22 .
People have asked for a more affordable alternative .
We are looking into the possibility of publishing a standard hardback version .
Meanwhile , a free download is available above .

The processes we use to obtain fuel , from pumping fossil fuels up from beneath the ocean to harvesting crops to turn into ethanol , create many environmental and practical concerns .
These types of fuel work fine with the current generation of cars , but hydrogen has sometimes been touted as the fuel of the future .
A publication in Nature Nanotechnology describes how researchers have found a way to use the photosynthetic machinery of a bacteria to produce the hydrogen equivalent of up to 79 gallons of gas per-acre , per-day .
Their technique involved capturing the electrons produced during photosynthesis and binding them to some strategically placed protons .
The production of fuel has accelerated lately , from waiting millions of years for fossil fuels to waiting a few days or weeks for biomass - derived fuels such as ethanol .
However , biomass fuels still present some difficulties : the fuel produced relative to the land area required is pretty small ( the equivalent of a little more than a gallon of gas per acre ) , the conversion to ethanol requires a distilling period , and all the materials for making the fuel must be harvested , handled , and transported , all of which requires a significant energy expenditure .
The problem can be boiled down to one relationship : the more directly solar energy can be used , the more efficient the fuel production will be .
In the case of ethanol , plants process the solar energy through photosynthesis , but we lose a good deal of that when we process the plants .
Researchers have been trying to catch the energy earlier in the photosynthetic process , hoping to divert it into a fuel with a high energy density .
In order to manipulate photosynthesis , the researchers worked with a thermophilic cynobacterium , T. elongatus .
Scientists isolated its photosystem I ( PSI ) , which is one of two reaction centers that the bacteria use to conduct oxygenic photosynthesis .
At the most basic level , the PSI helps to transfer electrons from water to systems that use them to produce sugar and oxygen .
The researchers found that they could intercept these electrons if they coupled nanoclusters of platinum or convalently linked hydrogenase to the acceptor end of PSI complexes .
The electrons would then bond with extra protons , or H+ , that were adsorbed onto the platinum , resulting in hydrogen ( the process is outlined in the picture above ) .
The experiments were also performed on the PSI obtained from both spinach and another variety of bacteria , the mesophilic cynobacterium Synechocystis .
They found the T. elongatus version remained stable at higher temperatures than the one from Synechocystis ; its chlorophyll became less efficient at temperatures above 130�F .
The T. elongatus version remained sufficiently functional up to 194�F , and in fact worked better at temperatures above 130�F .
The spinach 's PSI 's ability to absorb light reached an early plateau ; researchers found that the productivity of the PSI from T. elongatus could continue to scale with light four times brighter than the PSI of the spinach .
For this method of hydrogen harvesting , the T. elongatus proved to be the best choice of the three .
Given the functionality of the PSI of T. elongatus , the researchers calculated that a one - acre solar collector that is 10 centimeters deep and operated at a temperature of at least 130�F could produce the energy equivalent of 79 gallons of gas per day .
The collector could operate continuously for about three months before the PSIs would be exhausted and need to be replaced , but during that time , it would pump out the hydrogen equivalent of over 7000 gallons of gas .
Unlike the PSI , the platinum catalyst could be reused for many more cycles .
The scientists point out that this method has many advantages over the production of biofuels .
Notably , it does n't involve a single - use crop that has to be planted , harvested , fermented , and distilled to obtain more fuel .
However , there 's still the challenge of delivery .
Since the proteins work best in the warmest parts of the planet , it would be hard for most people to produce hydrogen in their backyard .
Nor does the paper consider the cost of isolating the protein or the use of precious metals in hydrogen production .
There is also the small issue of hardly anyone currently owning anything that runs on hydrogen , aside from the occasional concept car .
Still , the 79 - gallon yield per day of the collectors is impressive , and further modification of the basic approach may make the hydrogen economy look relatively practical .

The issue in the United States of how bystanders react — or do not react — to a crime that has unfolded before them has now emerged in Italy , on a somewhat smaller scale in an incident that seems right out of The Godfather , The Sopranos or GoodFellas .
Italian police have released this video of an authentic mafia hit .
And it ’s double deja vu : its a scene seemingly copied from Hollywood ( when it ’s the opposite ) — and the issue of bystanders ’ behavior .
The issue of what bystanders do if they see a crime unfolding or after a crime has emerged bigtime in the Richmond High School rape case , where some 20 teenagers stood by and watched for more than 2 hours as a teenage girl was gang raped — a case that also entailed several other issues including media reaction .
Here ’s a CNN report on that as well :
In the case of the mafia hit , it ’ll be argued that the bystanders did n’t react due to the shock of the event , fear of the mafia and fear of becoming involved and themselves being targets .
But in the case of the Richmond High rape other factors — which will be analyzed by experts and pundits for some time to come — were also at work .
Indeed : in the case of the Richmond High School event , it could be argued that if Hollywood had put a scene like that in a movie , indicating a rape had gone on for more than 2 hours while more than 20 teens stood by and watched and even took picture and filmed it , critics would pan the movie for putting a scene in there that was both gratuitous and totally unbelievable .
Once again the bar on even reprehensible behavior — bystanders or witnesses doing nothing — has been lowered .
“ There were a lot of new people that came in with the new chairman , ’’ Fisher said .
“ It was unclear who they were and what they did exactly .
It was a very internal matter .
Ken felt he was not acquainted with all the people and the trips that they were conducting . ’’
Myers was not intending to make any political statement with his decision , said Andy Fisher , a spokesman for Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana , the ranking Republican on the committee .
For instance , earlier this year , Republican staff director Kenneth A. Myers Jr. stopped signing off on the travel requests of Democrats .
Under the rules of the committee , the ranking minority member must approve travel , but in practice , the chairman of the committee has final say .
In past years , Republicans and Democrats have typically spent roughly equal amounts on trips , often traveling together to present a united front overseas .
But this year , the eight Republicans have not sought to travel nearly as frequently as the 11 Democrats , and the two parties have had far less cooperation .
But there are signs that the Democrats ’s foreign trips have become a source of tension on the committee , which has a long - held reputation for bipartisan collegiality .
“ You ca n’t evaluate the effectiveness of opium poppy eradication in southern Afghanistan or investigate alleged human rights violations in Sri Lanka - both recent trips by committee staff - from a desk in Washington , ’’ said Kerry ’s spokesman , Frederick Jones .
“ This is a Democratic administration pushing a Democratic foreign policy , based on engagement , so it makes sense that there would be more Democratic travel . ’’
Kerry ’s staff says the pace of travel is proof that an energetic new chairman who took the helm in January is eager for firsthand information on the world ’s most contentious problems .
The trips have included priority foreign policy destinations , such as Afghanistan and Israel , but also less prominent places such as Iceland , Laos , and Moldova .
From January through September , Kerry , his fellow Democratic senators , and their staff spent $ 746,000 on more than 75 trips to more than 50 countries .
That is double the number of trips and nearly three times the costs accumulated by their Republican colleagues on the committee during the same period .
The totals for the first three quarters of this year under Kerry are also more than Democrats traveled or spent during all of 2008 .
WASHINGTON - Democrats and their staff members on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have spent more on international travel in 2009 than they have in any other year , reflecting a greater focus on up - close tours and investigations in foreign countries by its new chairman , John F. Kerry of Massachusetts , according to a Globe analysis of expense reports filed in Congress .
Partisan wrangling over travel on the committee came into public view two months ago , when Kerry issued a rare rejection to a travel request by GOP Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina - a move that Republicans decried as an unprecedented use of the chairman ’s powers .
Kerry refused to approve the trip to Honduras because DeMint was blocking two diplomatic appointments .
DeMint found alternative funding for his trip , and Republicans say Kerry has not blocked any other trips .
Still , the incident suggests a break from the committee ’s past bipartisan cooperation .
“ It ’s a terrible trend , ’’ said Graeme Bannerman , a former staff director for Lugar , who blamed the development on US politics in general , not Kerry himself .
“ It is symbolic of the partisanship that is taking over the Hill .
It ’s very sad indeed . ’’
As recently as last year , under the previous committee chairman , Joseph Biden of Delaware , foreign trips would not go forward without Myers ’s approval , said a former Biden staff member .
If Myers raised questions about the value of a trip , Biden ’s staff director , Antony Blinken , would work to address his concerns , said the former staffer , who was not authorized to speak about committee procedures and requested anonymity .
Jones said Kerry ’s staff did not object to Myers ’s decision to stop signing Democratic travel requests and described the requirement of Myers ’s signature as an outdated practice .
Still , since a Globe inquiry on the subject , Myers has begun to sign off again , because the requirement is written into the committee ’s rules , Jones said .
The increased Democratic travel reflects Kerry ’s ambitious portfolio , which now includes global warming , Afghanistan , and issues related to international finance .
Kerry , whose name is often mentioned as a possible future secretary of state , has also hired at least seven additional staff members , including two traveling investigators .
Jones said the travel was already paying off , citing Kerry ’s successful effort to persuade Afghan President Hamid Karzai to accept a runoff election , as well as Virginia Democrat Jim Webb ’s trip to Burma , which helped release an imprisoned American citizen .
Decades ago , the committee ’s travel was far more restricted and most trips included members of both parties , making the amount spent on travel fairly equal , according to interviews .
When Lugar first became chairman in the mid-1980s , he mandated that any staff member who wanted to travel abroad had to invite a staff member of the other party , according to Jeffrey Bergner , Lugar ’s staff director at the time .
“ There were a number of times the Democratic staff came to me and said they wanted to go somewhere , to Asia or Africa , and they wanted to go on their own , but we would say that it would be a bipartisan staff delegation or they would n’t go at all , ’’ said Bergner , who said the policy was designed to prevent one - sided committee reports .
Later , the rules were relaxed , but bipartisan trips were still the norm , said Bannerman , who was staff director until 1987 .
“ When you end up going out there together , you get the same briefing .
You bond in ways that you ca n’t at other times , ’’ said Bannerman , who became so close to his Democratic counterpart that they still play tennis together today .
In the 1990s , when Jesse Helms , the iconoclastic North Carolina Republican , took charge of the committee , Republicans and Democrats consulted closely and traveled together more often than not , said Edwin Hall , Biden ’s staff director in 2001 .
“ Even though there were significant differences between Senator Helms and Biden on some policy issues , we made a big effort to run the committee together , ’’ Hall said .
Both Jones and Fisher described the current relationship between Republicans and Democrats on the committee as friendly and cooperative .
“ The senator has gotten wonderful cooperation from his Republican colleagues , ’’ Jones said .
“ In a highly partisan town at a highly partisan time , clearly there are philosophical differences , but I do n’t think they are any more extreme than they would be under any chairman . ’’

President Obama and his predecessor differ significantly in their approach to America ’s wars .
They differ at least as much in their relationship with their top battlefield commander .
During the Bush administration , Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the then - ground commander in Iraq , assumed the role of a trusted advisor who frequently visited the White House or talked to the president by phone .
But Obama ’s commander in Afghanistan , Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , occupies a defined place in the chain of command .
The two have met face - to - face twice -- and one of those was after the general infuriated the White House by discussing U.S. strategy in an overseas speech .
The reasons for the marked contrasts run deeper than personal preferences .
Under Obama , top Pentagon officials have worked to keep McChrystal out of the spotlight , in part to avoid creating “ another celebrity general ” as the White House debates its Afghan strategy .
Advertisement
Senior military officials have pushed for a more traditional relationship between Obama and his field commander than existed between President Bush and his field commanders , in particular Petraeus .
Whether that approach will succeed in persuading the White House to endorse McChrystal ’s plan for Afghanistan is not yet clear .
McChrystal has made recommendations on strategy and troop levels for Afghanistan that are the subject of intense debate within the administration .
Obama is expected to decide over the next two weeks whether to approve his general ’s strategy and request for 40,000 additional troops .
Some in the Pentagon think that with strong backing from Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Michael G. Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , much of McChrystal ’s request will be approved .
Others worry that the lack of a personal connection between McChrystal and Obama may have made it more difficult for the commander to explain his proposal and answer concerns .

“ There is no division ” between Obama and McChrystal , said a Defense official , one of several speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing the relationship .
“ It is just an absence of a relationship . ”
Officials close to Mullen and Gates say the two men have been forceful in presenting McChrystal ’s views to Obama and are comfortable with how the president prefers to be briefed on the war .
“ There is a general comfort level with the manner with which the president has chosen to get his military advice , ” said a military officer in Washington .
The preference appears to appeal to the Pentagon as well .
Top Pentagon officials , including Mullen , wanted to avoid a repeat of 2007 , when the job of defending plans to increase the number of troops in Iraq fell to Petraeus .

Some officials felt that Petraeus was unfairly pushed into the political fray and became the subject of political attacks , such as when the liberal group MoveOn.org branded him “ General Betray Us ” in a newspaper ad .
Others thought Petraeus held too much of the spotlight and that other military voices failed to get a proper hearing .
“ No one wants another Petraeus , ” said the Defense official .
“ No one wants another celebrity general . ”
One military officer based in Kabul , Afghanistan , said that the McChrystal command ’s regular contact with Gates and Mullen made up for less communication directly with the president .
“ Too many people were trying to make this out to be a lack of communication .
It is really just the opposite , ” said the officer .
“ There has been great communications with the chain of command to include the secretary of Defense . ”

The Bush - Petraeus relationship left perceptions that the chain of command had been left out .
“ The problem is not that Petraeus and Bush had a one - on - one relationship , ” said an Obama administration official .
“ The problem was that other people were cut out of the conversation . ”
Many disagree that the relationship between Petraeus and Bush subverted the chain of command .
Current and former officials noted that both Mullen and Gates participated in Bush ’s weekly conference calls with Petraeus .
Eliot A. Cohen , the author of “ Supreme Command , ” which examines the wartime relationships between civilian and military leaders , said presidents must have regular conversations with their field commanders .
Advertisement
“ It has to be a dialogue , ” Cohen said .
“ One way you judge what is going on is the body language , the look in the eye of your commander .
That is basic leadership . ”
Cohen , a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a former senior official in the Bush administration , argues that the Obama White House has been too quick to dismiss some things the previous administration did .
“ Whatever Bush did , they are going to do the opposite without much reflection , ” he said .
“ But it is a mistake to keep your theater commander at arm ’s length . ”
Some Pentagon officials think the Obama White House is a bit wary of the military .
Administration officials who are veterans of the Clinton White House may recall jarring collisions with the uniformed services .
The Clinton White House and military officials clashed openly on the issue of gays serving in the military , for instance , leading to the disputed “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy in effect now .
Thomas X. Hammes , a retired officer and military theorist , says each president must nurture his own relationships .

“ It is about personalities , ” he said .
“ What is the best formula for a marriage ?
It is two personalities that have to do something difficult together . ”

One of the Arab world 's biggest pop stars has provoked a torrent of outrage after releasing a song which refers to black Egyptians as monkeys .
Haifa Wehbe , an award - winning Lebanese diva who has been voted one of the world 's most beautiful people , is now facing a lawsuit from Egyptian Nubians claiming the song has fuelled discrimination against them and made some Nubian children too afraid to attend school .
The row has cast fresh light on the position within Egyptian society of Nubians , who are descended from one of Africa 's most ancient black civilisations and yet often face marginalisation in modern Egypt .
Wehbe , a 35 - year - old model turned actress and singer , is widely regarded as the Middle East 's most prominent sex symbol and has been no stranger to controversy in the past .
Her skimpy outfits and provocative lyrics ( one previous hit was entitled Ya Ibn El Halal , roughly translated as Hey , Good Little Muslim Boy ) have earned her the wrath of religious conservatives and forays into the political arena have also sparked debate , including her very public praise for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah during the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon .
The latest accusations of racism came after the release of her new song , Where is Daddy ? , in which a child sings to Wehbe , " Where is my teddy bear and the Nubian monkey ? " .
Wehbe has since apologised profusely for the offending lyrics , insisting they were penned by an Egyptian songwriter who told her that " Nubian monkey " was an innocent term for a popular children 's game .
That has n't stopped a group of Nubian lawyers submitting an official complaint to Egypt 's public prosecutor and calling for the song to be banned .
" Everyone is upset , " said Sayed Maharous , 49 , the Nubian owner of a coffee shop in Cairo .
Adul Raouf Mohammed , who runs a nearby store , agreed .
" To compare a human being to an animal is insulting in any culture .
She has denigrated an entire community of people , and now some of our children are afraid to go into school because they know they will be called monkeys in the playground . "
The row over Wehbe 's song has highlighted a growing sense of communal identity among Nubians in Egypt , a country where the government has traditionally promoted a very monolithic brand of nationalism , sometimes to the exclusion of religious or ethnic minorities .
Despite breaking through into the cultural mainstream – several Nubian novelists are well - regarded within Egyptian intellectual circles and Nubian singers such as Mohammed Mounir are among the most popular in the country – Egypt 's estimated two million Nubians remain largely invisible on television and film , except as lampooned stereotypes .
• This article was amended on Wednesday 17 November 2009 to include the transliterated Arabic title of one of Haifa Wehbe 's hits , Ya Ibn El Halal .
Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon located in Arizona on Navajo land .
It was formed over the years by flash flooding that eroded the sandstone .
Flash flooding is still a danger to visitors today with the last major flash flood occurring in 2006 .
Tourists may only visit the canyon with a guide because of this flood danger .
There are two sections of the canyon : Upper Antelope Canyon ( also called The Crack ) and Lower Antelope Canyon ( also called The Corkscrew ) .
The Navajo call the Upper Canyon Tse ’ bighanilini , meaning “ the place where water runs through rocks . ”
The Lower Canyon is called Hasdestwazi , meaning “ spiral rock arches . ”
The canyons can both be found within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation , in Lake Powell Navajo Tribal Park .
There are entrance fees for both canyons , and these fees provide the Navajo Nation with much needed income .
Patrick Swayze : 5 Things You Didn't Know
Patrick Swayze :
5 Things You Didn't Know
Page 1 of 2
Today , we join untold millions worldwide to say a sad goodbye to Hollywood icon Patrick Swayze .
Although he played dozens of roles , Patrick Swayze 's legacy as a true leading man , profoundly stamped into the anguished hearts of so many women , stems from just two unforgettable roles : Johnny Castle ( Dirty Dancing ) and , to a lesser extent , Sam Wheat ( Ghost ) .
Castle was , by far , Patrick 's most iconic role .
Dirty Dancing is a film - turned - phenomenon that has practically become required watching material for teenage girls the world over , and it has a permanent place in the collections of grown women everywhere .
Sound like an exaggeration ?
A recent British poll found that Dirty Dancing was the movie that women reported having seen the most times — on average : 15 .
A musical based on the film shattered box office records worldwide , from Canada to Germany to London 's famed West End , where it sold out for six months solid — before it even opened .
Of course , a man is more than the sum of his roles , and Patrick Swayze 's passing brings to an end an uncommon life — one marked by a wide pendulum that routinely swung him between peaks reaching into the constellations and valleys deep in tragedy and despair .
It was a life Patrick Swayze led , regardless of where the pendulum was , with exceptional dignity and humility .
In deference to such an understated ladies ' man and one hell of a guy , we present five things you did n't know about Patrick Swayze .
1- Patrick Swayze landed a Cessna in the suburbs
Like his wife , Patrick Swayze was a licensed , experienced pilot with Instrument Rating ( authorized to fly using only the instrument panel to navigate ) .
In 2000 , while flying with his dogs in a twin - engine Cessna from Southern California to his ranch in Las Vegas , Patrick Swayze experienced what he called a " pressure bump " or pressurization failure while flying over Prescott Valley , Arizona .
He began looking for an emergency air strip .
After passing on two options once he spotted people on them ( it was the middle of the afternoon ) , Swayze finally found a street inside the Mingus West suburban community .
Before the plane came to a stop , Swayze 's Cessna first bounced off the ground , knocked out a pair of street light poles , clipped a street sign , and thumped a utility box .
2- Patrick Swayze was married to the same woman for over 30 years
In a display of player defiance rarely seen in Hollywood beyond Paul Newman , Patrick Swayze was always a one - woman man .
Patrick Swayze was 19 years old when he first met Lisa Niemi , a girl four years his junior and a student at his mother 's Houston - area dance studio .
Although , by his own account , he did plenty of flirting with many of his mother 's students , Niemi was different and they began a chaste relationship that survived the four years he spent in New York City .
About five years after they first met , in 1975 , they married .
Somehow they managed to stay together through enormous personal loss ( such as the death of Patrick 's father in 1982 ) , alcohol abuse and , most significantly , his steady rise from obscurity to iconic movie star and sex symbol to millions of women .
Patrick Swayze was one of Hollywood 's greats , and he will be missed by all ...

Mark has already extensively blogged the Google Books Settlement Conference at Berkeley yesterday , where he and I both spoke on the panel on " quality " — which is to say , how well is Google Books doing this and what if anything will hold their feet to the fire ?
This is almost certainly the Last Library , after all .
There 's no Moore 's Law for capture , and nobody is ever going to scan most of these books again .
So whoever is in charge of the collection a hundred years from now — Google ?
UNESCO ? Wal - Mart ? — these are the files that scholars are going to be using then .
All of which lends a particular urgency to the concerns about whether Google is doing this right .
My presentation focussed on GB 's metadata — a feature absolutely necessary to doing most serious scholarly work with the corpus .
It 's well and good to use the corpus just for finding information on a topic — entering some key words and barrelling in sideways .
( That 's what " googling " means , is n't it ? )
But for scholars looking for a particular edition of Leaves of Grass , say , it does n't do a lot of good just to enter " I contain multitudes " in the search box and hope for the best .
Ditto for someone who wants to look at early - 19th century French editions of Le Contrat Social , or to linguists , historians or literary scholars trying to trace the development of words or constructions :
Can we observe the way happiness replaced felicity in the seventeenth century , as Keith Thomas suggests ?
When did " the United States are " start to lose ground to " the United States is " ?
How did the use of propaganda rise and fall by decade over the course of the twentieth century ?
And so on for all the questions that have made Google Books such an exciting prospect for all of us wordinistas and wordastri .
But to answer those questions you need good metadata .
And Google 's are a train wreck : a mish - mash wrapped in a muddle wrapped in a mess .
Start with dates .
To take GB 's word for it , 1899 was a literary annus mirabilis , which saw the publication of Raymond Chandler 's Killer in the Rain , The Portable Dorothy Parker , André Malraux ' La Condition Humaine , Stephen King 's Christine , The Complete Shorter Fiction of Virginia Woolf , Raymond Williams ' Culture and Society , Robert Shelton 's biography of Bob Dylan , Fodor 's Guide to Nova Scotia , and the Portuguese edition of the book version of Yellow Submarine , to name just a few .
( You can find images of most of these on my slides , here — I 'm not giving the url 's since I expect Google will fix most of these particular errors now that they 're aware of them ) .
And while there may be particular reasons why the 1899 date comes up so much , these misdatings are spread out all over the place .
A book on Peter Drucker is dated 1905 , a book of Virginia Woolf 's letters is dated 1900 , Tom Wolfe 's The Bonfire of the Vanities is dated 1888 , and an edition of Henry James 1897 What Maisie Knew is dated 1848 .
It might seem easy to cherry - pick howlers from a corpus as exensive as this one , but these errors are endemic .
Do a search on " internet " in books written before 1950 and Google Scholar turns up 527 hits .
Or try searching on the names of writers or famous restricting your search to works published before the years of their birth .
You turn up 182 hits for Charles Dickens , more than 80 percent of them misdated books referring to the writer as opposed to someone else of the same name .
The same search turns up 81 hits for Rudyard Kipling , 115 for Greta Garbo , and 29 for Barack Obama .
( Or maybe that was another Barack Obama . )
A search on books mentioning candy bar that were published before 1920 turns up 66 hits , of which 46 , or 70 percent , are misdated .
I 'd be surprised if that proportion of errors or anything like it held up in general for books in that range , and dating errors are far denser for older works than for the ones Google received from publishers .
But even if the proportion is only 5 percent , that suggests hundreds of thousands of dating errors .
In discussion after my presentation , Dan Clancy , the Chief Engineer for the Google Books project , said that the erroneous dates were all supplied by the libraries .
He was woolgathering , I think .
It 's true that there are a few collections in the corpus that are systematically misdated , like a large group of Portuguese - language works all dated 1899 .
But a very large proportion of the errors are clearly Google 's doing .
Of the first ten full - view misdated books turned up by a search for books published before 1812 that mention " Charles Dickens " , all ten are correctly dated in the catalogues of the Harvard , Michigan , and Berkeley libraries they were drawn from .
Most of the misdatings are pretty obviously the result of an effort to automate the extraction of pub dates from the OCR 'd text .
For example the 1604 date from a 1901 auction catalogue is drawn from a bookmark reproduced in the early pages , and the 1574 dating ( as of this writing ) on a 1901 book about English bookplates from the Harvard Library collections is clearly taken from the frontispiece , which displays an armorial bookplate dated 1574 :
Similarly , the 1719 date on a 1919 edition of Robinson Crusoe in which Dickens ' name appears in an advertisement is drawn from the line on the title page that says the book is reprinted from the author 's edition of 1719 .
And the 1774 date assigned to an 1890 book called London of to - day is derived from a front - matter advertisement for a firm that boasts it was founded in that year .
Then there are the classification errors .
William Dwight Whitney 's 1891 Century Dictionary is classified as " Family & Relationships , " along with Mencken 's The American Language .
A French edition of Hamlet and a Japanese edition of Madame Bovary both classified as " Antiques and Collectibles . "
An edition of Moby Dick is classed under " Computers " : a biography of Mae West classified as " Religion " ; The Cat Lover 's Book of Fascinating Facts falls under " Technology & Engineering . "
A 1975 reprint of a classic topology text is " Didactic Poetry " ; the medievalist journal Speculum is classified " Health & Fitness . "
And a catalogue of copyright entries from the Library of Congress listed under " Drama " — though I had to wonder if maybe that was just Google 's little joke .
Here again , the errors are endemic , not simply sporadic .
Of the first ten hits for Tristram Shandy , four are classified as fiction , four as " Family & Relationships , " one as " Biography & Autobiography , " and one is not classified .
Other editions of the novel are classified as " Literary Collections , " " History , " and " Music . "
The first ten hits for Leaves of Grass are variously classified as " Poetry , " " Juvenile Nonfiction , " " Fiction , " " Literary Criticism , " " Biography & Autobiography , " and mystifyingly , " Counterfeits and Counterfeiting . "
Various editions of Jane Eyre are classified as " History , " " Governesses , " " Love Stories , " " Architecture , " and " Antiques & Collectibles " ( " Reader , I marketed him " ) .
In his response on the panel , Dan Clancy said that here , too , the libraries were to blame , along with the publishers .
But the libraries can't be responsible for books mislabeled as " Health and Fitness " and " Antiques and Collectibles , " for the simple reason that those categories are drawn from the BISAC codes that the book industry uses to tell booksellers where to put books on the shelves , not from any of the classification systems used by libraries .
And inasmuch as BISAC classifications were n't in use until about 20 years ago , only Google could be responsible for their misapplications on books published earlier than that : the 1904 edition of Leaves of Grass assigned to " Juvenile Nonfiction " ; the 1919 edition of Robinson Crusoe assigned to " Crafts & Hobbies " ; the 1845 number of the Edinburgh Review assigned to " Architecture " ; the 1907 edition of Sir Thomas Browne 's 1658 Hydriotaphia : Urne-Buriall , or a discourse of the sepulchrall urnes lately found in Norfolk assigned to " Gardening " ; and countless others .
Google 's fine Bayesian hand reveals itself even in the classifications of works published after the BISAC categories came into use , such as the 2003 edition of Susan Bordo 's Unbearable Weight : Feminism , Western Culture and the Body ( misdated 1899 ) , which is assigned to " Health & Fitness " — not a classification you could imagine coming from the University of California Press , though you can see how a probabilistic classifier could come up with it , like the " Religion " tag on the Mae West biography subtitled " Icon in Black and White . "
But whether it gets the BISAC categories right or wrong , the question is why Google decided to use those headings in the first place .
( Clancy denies that they were asked to do so by the publishers , though this might have to do with their own ambitions to compete with Amazon . )
The BISAC scheme is well suited to organizing the shelves of a modern 35,000 foot chain bookstore or a small public library where ordinary consumers or patrons are browsing for books on the shelves .
But it 's not particularly helpful if you 're flying blind in a library with several million titles , including scholarly works , foreign works , and vast quantities of books from earlier periods .
For example , the BISAC " Juvenile Nonfiction " subject heading has almost 300 subheadings , including separate categories for books about " New Baby , " " Skateboarding , " and " Deer , Moose , and Caribou . "
By contrast , the " Poetry " subject heading has just 20 subdivisions in all .
That means that Bambi and Bullwinkle get a full shelf to themselves , while Schiller , Leopardi , and Verlaine have to scrunch together in the lone subheading reserved for " Poetry / Continental European . "
In short , Google has taken the great research collections of the English - speaking world and returned them in the form of a suburban mall bookstore .
These do n't exhaust the metadata errors by any means .
There are a number of mismatches of titles and texts .
Click on the link from the 1818 Théorie de l'Univers , a work on cosmology by the Napoleonic mathematician and general Jacques Alexander François Allix , and it takes you to Barbara Taylor Bradford 's 1983 novel Voices of the Heart , whereas the link on a misdated number of Dickens ' Household Words takes you to a 1742 Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences .
The link from the title Supervision and Clinical Psychology takes you to a book called American Politics in Hollywood Film .
Numerous entries mix up the names of authors , editors , and writers of introductions , so that the " about this book " page for an edition of one French novel shows the striking attribution , " Madame Bovary By Henry James " :
More mysterious is the entry for a book called The Mosaic Navigator :
The essential guide to the Internet Interface , which is dated 1939 and attributed to Sigmund Freud and Katherine Jones .
My guess is that this is connected to Jones ' having been the translator of Freud 's Moses and Monotheism , which must have somehow triggered the other sense of the word mosaic , though the details of the process leave me baffled .
For the present , then , linguists , humanists and social scientists will have to forego their visions of using Google Books to assemble all the early nineteenth - century book sale catalogues mentioning Alexander Pope or tracking the use of " Gentle Reader " in Victorian novels : the metadata and classifications are simply too poor .
Google is certainly aware of many of these problem ( if not on this scale ) and they 've pledged to fix them , though they 've acknowledged that this is n't a priority .
I do n't doubt their sincere desire to get this stuff right .
But it is n't clear whether they plan to go about this in the same way they 're addressing the many scanning errors that users report , correcting them one - by - one as they 're notified of them .
That is n't adequate here : there are simply too many errors .
And while Google 's machine classification will certainly improve , extracting metadata mechanically simply is n't sufficiently reliable for scholarly purposes .
After some early back - and - forth , Google decided it did want to acquire the library records for scanned books along with the scans themselves , and now it evidently has them , but I understand the company has n't licensed them for display or use — hence , presumably , the odd automated stabs at recovering dates from the OCR that are already present in the library records associated with the file .
In our panel discussion , Dan Clancy suggested that it should fall on users to take some of the responsibility for fixing these errors , presumably via some kind of independent cataloguing effort .
But there are hundreds of thousands of errors to pick up on here , not to mention an even larger number of of files with simply poor metadata or virtually no metadata at all .
Beyond clearing up the obvious errors , the larger question is whether Google 's engineers should be trusted to make all the decisions about metadata design and implementation for what will probably wind up being the universal library for a long time to come , with no contractural obligation , and only limited commercial incentives , to get it right .
That 's probably one of the questions the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department should be asking as it ponders the Google Books Settlement over the coming month .
Some of the slack here may be picked up by the HathiTrust , a consortium of a number of participating libraries that is planning to make available several million of the books that Google scanned along with their WorldCat records .
But at present HathiTrust is only going to offer the out - of - copyright books , which are about 25 percent of the Google collection , since libraries have no right to share the orphan works .
And it is n't clear what search functionalities they 'll be offering , or to whom — or , in the current university climate , for how long .
In any event , none of this should let Google off the hook .
Google Books is unquestionably a public good , but as Pam Samuelson pointed out in her remarks at another panel , a great public good also implies a great public trust .

Ever since somebody suggested that eating one a day kept the doctor away , the health benefits of the apple have been trumpeted by grandmothers and government ministers alike .
The fruit 's only drawback is its tendency to lose its glossy sheen and crunchy texture within a few days – a problem that a team of scientists in Australia now claims to have solved .
For the past 20 years , researchers at Queensland Primary Industries and Fisheries ( QPIF ) , a department of the Queensland government , have been developing a new variety of apple which they claim can stay fresh for months .
Its name , RS103 - 130 , might not have quite the same ring as popular varieties such as Golden Delicious , Pink Lady or Braeburn , but the scientists have described it as " the world 's best apple " thanks to its sweet taste , longevity and ability to resist disease .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The apple , which is a deep red in colour , stays " crispy " for up to 14 days if kept in a fruit bowl , and if stored in a fridge it can remain edible for four months .
The Queensland government is seeking a commercial supply partner to distribute the fruit and hopes to begin selling it next year .
Tim Mulherin , Queenland 's primary industries minister , said : " This new variety is sweet .
It ticks the other boxes too because it is disease resistant , so requires few or no fungicides .
Initial taste tests have been outstanding .
Out of the five apple types tasted , the new variety scored the highest . "
The RS103 - 130 variety has a naturally strong resistance to apple scab , also known as black spot , a disease caused by the fungus venturia inaequalis which affects both the foliage and fruit .
The apple is not genetically modified but is produced conventionally using a gene from the Asiatic apple variety Malus floribunda which has a proven resistance to black spot .
In Britain , apple producers need to spray each crop 14 times to protect against the disease , a process which costs the £ 200 m - a - year industry up to 10 per cent of its turnover .
A variety which did not require spraying could mean huge savings for the producers .
" If you 're an apple grower and this [ new apple ] lives up to its promise , then it really is quite a breakthrough , " said Dez Barbara , a senior research scientist at the University of Warwick 's Horticulture Research International .
However , he added that the new apple was not guaranteed success in Britain and would have to be trialled .
The Saturn variety , which used the same gene , was introduced to the UK in 1980 but did n't catch on .
" With apples , you 've got to take into account things such as how easy they are to grow and pick , " Dr Barbara said .
" Above all , consumers have got to like them – if consumers wo n't buy them , producers wo n't grow them . "
Guy Barter , chief horticultural adviser for the Royal Horticultural Society , said the new variety 's longevity could give it a major advantage .
" Apples that have ripened in storage are never quite as nice as those that ripen naturally .
There 's also a huge environmental cost in running the cold stores to keep the apples , so if you had a variety that required less cold storing , that would be valuable , " he said .
After a rough spring that saw as many as 20 to 40 percent of New Yorkers exposed to H1N1 , subway riders have resorted to defending themselves with their fists .
Violence struck on a southbound D train Monday morning after two women got into an argument over one 's refusal to cover her mouth while coughing .
It ended with her spitting on the other , a punch , and the second woman dragging the first to the floor of the car by her hair .
Here 's the play - by - play account , as witnessed firsthand by The Business Insider 's Lawrence Delevingne :
" No one got the conductor -- it just seemed like a shouting match -- but as the train pulled into 42nd Street , the coughing woman spit on the other , provoking what sounded like a punch from the reaction of the crowd ( we did n't directly see it ) .
Then the cougher attempted to exit the train as the doors were open , but the second woman grabbed her by the back of the hair , violently yanking her down to the floor . "
Be careful out there transit riders , and remember , cover your mouth , wash your hands , and do n't spit on each other .

Associated Press Republican Rand Paul speaks on Aug. 1 at the 129th annual Fancy Farm Picnic in Fancy Farm , Ky. ( AP Photo / Daniel R. Patmore , File )
But now the younger Paul , an ophthalmologist , is making his own bid for office , and he is doing so in the family tradition : Making Republicans uncomfortable .
Paul is running in the GOP primary for U.S. Senate in Kentucky , his home state since 1993 .
He is leading in the most recent poll and raising buckets of money .
He is outperforming Secretary of State Trey Grayson , who has the support of Kentucky ’s most powerful pol , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
Like his father who became an Internet phenomenon during his presidential run , Rand Paul also seems to be somewhat of an Internet sensation .
But whether he can actually win is an open question .
The Kentucky race is featured in a Wall Street Journal story today looking at efforts by underdog Republicans to catch the wave of anti-establishment fervor in their party .
Here are excerpts of our conversation with Rand Paul :
Washington Wire :
Are there any areas where you disagree with your father ’s views on issues ?
Paul :
There are some minor areas where we disagree .
One is on taking the pledge not to put earmarks in bills .
He ’s probably the most fiscally conservative member of the House , but he ’s just taken the position that when his constituents ask for a particular road or museum , he puts them through .
I think the whole system is broken down , and it ’s my opinion that we should n’t put earmarks on bills .
Washington Wire :
So do you think drugs should be legalized ?
Paul :
It ’s a state issue .
All issues of crime are better addressed at the state level …

Internet users who illegally download films and music will run the risk of being cut off from the web under new laws published by the Government today .
Others who abuse copyright laws could also have their internet connection slowed down as part of an attempt by Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , to fight back against online piracy , which costs the creative industries billions each year .
Under the powers set out in the Digital Economy Bill , finally published yesterday , internet service providers ( ISPs ) will be obliged to send letters to those suspected of online piracy .
The owners of illegally downloaded material will also be entitled to the name and address of serial offenders , allowing them to take legal action against them .

Other measures set out in the bill include the outlawing of the sale of video games suitable for 12 and older to under - age children .
However , despite a year of intense debate around reforming Britain ’s media industry , key decisions over the switchover to digital radio and the funding of local independent news have been left unresolved .
It is thought the controversial issues were omitted to help speed the bill through the Commons before the next election .
However , though the measures are supported by the Tories , doubts have already arisen that the bill can reach the statute books by the time of the next poll , expected in the Spring .
The Government will be prioritising bills designed to reform social care and education , leaving precious little time in the Commons to push through the new anti-piracy laws .
Jeremy Hunt , the shadow Culture Secretary , said that the bill was a “ rushed job ” drawn up by a Government living on borrowed time .
“ It kicks so many decisions into the long grass that we 've ended up with a dithering economy bill , " he said .
Stephen Timms , the minister for Digital Britain , disputed that time was running out to pass the new laws .
“ We remain very firmly committed to the vision set out in the Digital Britain report in June .
I think it ’s an impressive document and we will deliver it , ” he said .
“ We ’re on track for Digital Britain . ”
The bill contains measures allowing Lord Mandelson to force ISPs to apply “ technical measures ” against offenders .
He would need to ask parliament before ISPs could be pressed into disconnecting repeat offenders and the powers will only be used if less severe punishments fail to produce a 70 per cent reduction in illegal filesharing .
An appeals procedure will also be put in place for those who believe they have been treated unfairly .
“ Better protecting our creative communities from the threat of online infringement will ensure existing and emerging talent is rewarded , and will bring new choices for online consumers , ” Lord Mandelson said .
Music industry figures welcomed the bill and called on the measures to be implemented quickly .
“ The introduction of the Digital Economy Bill is an important milestone towards a sustainable future for British music in the digital age , ” said Geoff Taylor , chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) .
“ We can all be proud in Britain of our world - beating music industry , and we hope that all parties will work to ensure the measures are swiftly implemented to spur further investment in our legal online market . ”
But privacy campaigners have vowed to fight the changes .
Andrew Robinson , the leader of the pro-file sharing party , Pirate Party UK , described the measures as an attack on free speech .
The Government also faces opposition from the former digital engagement minister , Tom Watson .
If we lived in North Korea we would n’t dare say anything about this photograph which was taken of their Dear Leader at the Dongbong collective farm ( snicker , snicker ) .
Instead , we ’d be afraid of being sent with our families to a labor camp .
And so we’d be forced to bite our lip and put on one of those grim faces like the men behind him – completely missing out on a great opportunity for some crass comedy .
That ’s why totalitarianism sucks .

ISLAMABAD : Amid an army offensive against the Taliban stronghold of south Waziristan , a suicide bomb blast struck a busy commercial area near the Pakistan 's military headquarters in Rawalpindi on Monday killing at least 29 people , several of them military officials .
Dozens of others were also wounded .
The explosion happened just few hundred meters away from the entrance of the army headquarters and close to a bank and a hotel ( Shalimar hotel ) on the Mall Road in the heavily guarded Rawalpindi city .
The army headquarters was subjected to a 22 - hour siege by militants last month .
According to police officials , Monday���s attack came when a suicide bomber on a motorbike detonated his explosives outside a crowded bank .
Many people , including serving and retired military officials and pensioners , who had come to a state - run National Bank near the Shalimar hotel to collect their salaries and pensions were among the dead and injured .
The Rawalpindi police chief , Rao Muhammad Iqbal , told media that around 22 people had been killed in the attack but hours later several TV stations were quoting a figure of 29 .
Soon after the attack , the military personnel cordoned off the area and diverted traffic from the road in front of the hotel .
All hospitals in Rawalpindi declared an emergency as rescue services rushed to help the dead and injured .
Schools across the city were also closed .
The explosion was so intense it destroyed window panes of the several nearby buildings .
Raja Sajid , an eye witness who rushed to the scene said that he saw nearly 20 people , dead and dozens of others wounded , adding several of them were in military uniforms .
�� �I helped the rescuers and put several of them in the ambulances .
An old man stained in blood was crying for help��� he said .
Citing the ongoing violence across the country , the United Nations announced on Monday that it was pulling international staff from the north - west Pakistan .
In a statement , the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said that the decision had been taken keeping in mind the intense security situation in the region .
There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but suspicion fell on the Taliban , who have taken credit for a series of attacks since early October .
The militants have said the strikes will continue until the military pulls back from the south Waziristan tribal area .
Hours before the attack , the military claimed to have killed 124 militants in their stronghold of South Waziristan while lost 18 of their soldiers .
The government also announced on Monday a bounty worth millions of dollars for the capture of the Taliban leadership .
In a front - page newspaper advertisement , the government offered a reward of five million dollars for information leading to the capture , dead or alive , of the Tehreek - e - Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud and his two close aides , Waliur Rehman and Qari Hussain described as a master trainer of suicide bombers .
Pakistan has been relentlessly rocked by a wave of militant attacks in recent weeks .
Taliban militants retaliate against a military offensive in the volatile South Waziristan region and target security installations and crowded markets .
Since mid October , when the army launched an operation against Taliban militants in South Waziristan about 300 people have been killed in similar attacks .
Less than a week ago , a massive car bomb ripped through the heart of a crowded marketplace in Peshawar , killing at least 100 people and injuring at least 200 others .
On October 20 , two explosions took place at Islamabad 's International Islamic University that killed at least nine people died .
And on October 10 , militants held dozens of hostages inside the army headquarters in Rawalpindi .
Nearly two dozen people , eleven military personnel , three civilians , and nine militants were killed in the siege .

Tools : Mind your netiquette ( CNN ) --
With e-mail now a primary form of communication for many , you want to ensure that what you send is well - received .
We took a look at a few strategies for sharpening your netiquette .
The toughest part of communicating effectively over e-mail is that you do n't have your usual set of tools : facial expressions and tone of voice .
Using " emoticons " -- those sideways faces composed of punctuation marks -- you can enhance emotion in your messages and maintain the level of politeness you intend .
Even when in a hurry , you can remain polite by using abbreviations and shorthand .
Acronyms like the following are popular : BTW = By The Way
LOL = Laughing Out Loud
ROTFL = Rolling On The Floor Laughing
TTFN = Ta -Ta For Now
IMHO = In My Humble Opinion
BBFN = Bye Bye For Now
IYKWIMAITYD = If You Know What I Mean And I Think You Do
JK = Just Kidding
NP = No Problem
WBS = Write Back Soon

Another tip is to avoid being a bandwidth bandit .
Not everyone can download with a fast connection , and not everyone has the right software .
So before you send an animation or those photographs of the new house , baby , or car , send a short message asking if it 's OK to send your favorite file their way .
Good manners aside , e-mail prudence is becoming more important as courts recognize e-mail messages as evidence .
Keep in mind that for company - owned e-mail accounts , the company owns the e-mail messages , not the employee .
So use these litmus tests :
How would you feel if your boss read this ?
Or if you saw it in a newspaper ?
What if the person was in the same room ?
How would you feel if you received this e-mail message ?

Science has never given much credence to claims that you can learn Chinese or French by having the instruction CDs play while you sleep .
If any learning happens that way , most scientists say , the language lesson is probably waking the sleeper up , not causing nouns and verbs to seep into a sound - asleep mind .
But a new study about a different kind of audio approach during sleep gives insight into how the sleeping brain works , and may eventually come in handy to people studying a language , cramming for a test or memorizing lines in a play .
Scientists at Northwestern University reported that playing specific sounds while people slept helped them remember more of what they had learned before they fell sleep , to the point where memories of individual facts were enhanced .
In a study published online Thursday by the journal Science , researchers taught people to move 50 pictures to their correct locations on a computer screen .
Each picture was accompanied by a related sound , like a meow for a cat and whirring for a helicopter .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
One million people could lose unemployment benefits in January if Congress does n't extend federal aid , according to a report released Wednesday .
The report is likely to turn up pressure on lawmakers and the president , who earlier this month enacted a record - long extension of federally paid benefits .
But the law only helps those who exhaust their lifelines by year 's end .
As it stands now , the deadline to apply for federally paid benefits is Dec. 31 .
So while unemployment benefits now run as long as 99 weeks , depending on the state , not everyone will receive checks for that long a stretch .
" Congress has less than four weeks left on its schedule to legislate this year , and unless it acts to renew the unemployment provisions during this period , the clock will run out for a million workers , " said Christine Owens , executive director for the National Employment Law Project .
Those who run out of their 26 weeks of state - paid coverage in 2010 will not receive any additional benefits .
The jobless currently receiving extended federal benefits , which are divided into tiers , will stop getting checks once they complete their tier .
In addition , come Jan. 1 , workers will no longer receive the $ 25 boost in benefits or be able to apply for a 65 % subsidy to continue their company health insurance coverage under the Cobra program .
These benefits , along with the Dec. 31 deadline , are part of the $ 787 billion stimulus program passed in February .
Some 9 million people currently depend on jobless benefits as the unemployment rate continues to soar .
Some 10.2 % of Americans are out of work - a 26 - year high - and more than a third have been unemployed for at least six months .
Wrangling on Capitol Hill
Though the recent unemployment benefits extension had bipartisan support , it took nearly seven weeks to make it from the House to the president 's desk .
The bill stalled in the Senate as Democrats and Republicans bickered over several amendments , including extending the $ 8,000 first - time homebuyer credit .
The law extends jobless benefits in all states by 14 weeks .
Those that live in states with unemployment greater than 8.5 % will receive an additional six weeks .
The additional weeks are funded by extending a longstanding federal unemployment tax on employers through June 30 , 2011 .
The recent extension was the third time Congress has lengthened benefits during this economic downturn .
Another extension would likely garner support on Capitol Hill , but it 's too early to say what form it would take .
It could be a stand alone bill or it could be part of a bigger jobs package the Obama administration is considering .
" We 're going to work as quickly as we can to get this thing passed , " said Mike DeCesare , spokesman for Rep. Jim McDermott , D - Wash . , who crafted the most recent extension legislation for the House .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , plans to push for passage of an extension before stimulus program 's provisions expire , a spokeswoman said .
The president 's jobs forum
The expiring benefits are ramping up the pressure on the Obama administration to do more to spur job creation .
The president is already trying to counter claims that his $ 787 billion stimulus package , which administration officials say created 640,000 jobs , is a flop .
The administration plans to hold a jobs forum at the White House in early December to brainstorm on how to get companies to start hiring again .
Those invited to the forum will include CEOs , small business owners , economists , financial experts , and representatives from labor and non-profits .
Some economists are arguing that lawmakers should approve another round of stimulus to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits .
But that suggestion would likely receive a rocky response on Capitol Hill .
" We all know that there are limits to what government can and should do , even during such difficult times .
But we have an obligation to consider every additional responsible step that we can to encourage and accelerate job creation in this country , " President Obama said last week when he announced the forum .
In a blog entry for Islamist Watch , David J. Rusin shows how the word " jihad " continues to be euphemized in the West .
Despite Islamic law 's unequivocal portrayal of it as a military endeavor to empower Islam , jihad is still being peddled as " nothing more than a student laboring to pass algebra , a mom driving her kids to soccer practice , or , in the words of the Cambridge study , a civic - minded person engaged in ' lobbying , activism , and writing ' — a community organizer of sorts . "
Rusin concludes by observing : " Why Islamists peddle such specious definitions should be clear .
More baffling and disturbing is why they gain traction among so many Westerners . "
Indeed , therein lies the irony : Islamist perfidy is only to be expected ; Western naivety , on the other hand , which , if anything , should have begun to dissipate in our post - 9/11 world , has burgeoned to the point of nearly making the former unnecessary .
For while there is no doubt that Islamists ( and their misguided Western cronies ) distort the meaning of jihad , increasingly , even when the true meaning is in plain sight , America 's leaders and media still fail to discern it .
In other words , apathy — or willful blindness — regarding jihad has become so deep - seated in the West that Islamists need no longer actively dissemble .
Consider : When President Barack Hussein Obama addressed the Islamic world from Cairo on June 4 , 2009 , he said : " As the Holy Koran tells us , ' Be conscious of God and speak always the truth ' [ Sura 9:119 ] .
That is what I will try to do — to speak the truth as best I can , humbled by the task before us . "
Let us for the moment put aside the fact that Sura 9 , from whence Obama quotes , contains the most violent and intolerant exhortations in all the Koran ( which is saying something ) .
The problem here is that the original Arabic text of Sura 9:119 says absolutely nothing about " speaking the truth . "
The word " speaking " is nowhere in the text , and " truth , " as an abstract , is a wrong translation for sadiqin , which refers to people .
The verse most literally translates as " fear Allah and be with the truthful . "
In other words , Muslims should stand firm with fellow Muslims ( " truthful " serving as a Koranic epithet for " Muslims " the same way " believers " often does ) .
It is , as ever , a call for divisiveness — of Muslims ( the " truthful " ) versus infidels ( the " false " ) .
Had Obama or his Mideast advisors and speechwriters simply bothered to read this verse in context — verse 9:111 , a jihadi all - time favorite , looms just above , promising believers paradise in exchange for their killing and being killed — or if they had bothered consulting mainstream Muslim exegeses , they might have known that this verse is part of a Koranic segment that deals exclusively with fighting infidels : Muhammad and several Muslims were preparing to invade Byzantine territory ; some Muslims wanted to stay behind .
It was then that Allah / Muhammad threatened them with this verse to " fear Allah and be with the truthful " ( i.e. , join ranks with your fellow Muslims on the warpath ) .
Sentences later , this exhortation culminates in one of the most famous calls to violence in all the Koran , regularly evoked by modern - day jihadis : " O you who believe , fight those infidels who dwell around you , and let them find harshness in you ! " [ 9:123 ] .
Incidentally , the infidels mentioned here are the Christians of Byzantium ( or in Arabic , al - Rum , " the Romans " ) .
That modern - day jihadis , such as Osama bin Laden , often liken the United States to Byzantium , which for long thwarted the caliphate 's expansionist designs into Christendom , makes Obama 's choice of verse — " be[ing ] with the truthful " — further ironic .
Speaking of infidels and irony , here is a more recent , a more comical , anecdote : On September 11 , 2009 , NPR ran a story called " For NYC Muslims , a New Kind of Police Attention , " which tells of how " the NYPD hosts an annual Ramadan program , during which the police get to know members of the Muslim community and Muslims are free to speak their minds . "
Lest the theme of this story eludes you , words such as " outreach , " " diversity , " and " building bridges " predominate .
Here 's the problem ( first brought to my attention by the Washington Times ' Diana West ) :
In the audio version of this report ( around 0:25 - 0:50 ) , the NPR narrator says that " there was not an empty seat to be had at the NYPD 's auditorium at One Police Plaza .
NYPD brass , Muslim clerics , and community members all stood and listened to the cadences of the call to prayer from the NYPD 's imam , " Khalid Latif .
While this is being said , you can hear part of the imam's Arabic recitation from the Koran in the background .
The narrator 's enthusiastic talk of NYPD brass standing in awe of the " cadences of the call " makes it difficult to discern exactly which verse is being recited .
Only the last few words — qawm al - kaffirin , " nation of infidels " — are crystal clear , raising red flags .
Thanks to my trusty Arabic - Koranic concordance , I have placed this phrase as part of Koran 2:286 , which supplicates Allah " to make us [ Muslims ] victorious over the nation of infidels . "
Bear in mind that , from an Islamist point of view , the United States is the " nation of infidels " par excellence .
And there it is : From an American president who publicly defines his mission by quoting a jihadi - related verse , to American - Muslim leaders who publicly pray for the subjugation of non-Muslims ( in the middle of an NYPD auditorium , no less ) , it is clear that the ultimate threat comes more from Western carelessness and indifference — in a word , naivety — than it does from active Islamist machinations .
In short , Islamists peddling misleading interpretations for the word " jihad " is but the very tip of the iceberg .
Modern History Sourcebook :
President Lyndon B. Johnson :
The War on Poverty , March 1964 Proposal for A Nationwide War On The Sources of Poverty ' Lyndon B. Johnson 's Special Message to Congress , March 16 , 1964 [ ]
Because it is right , because it is wise , and because , for the first time in our history , it is possible to conquer poverty , I submit , for the consideration of the Congress and the country , the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 .
The Act does not merely expand old programs or improve what is already being done .
It charts a new course .
It strikes at the causes , not just the consequences of poverty .
It can be a milestone in our one - hundred eighty year search for a better life for our people .
This Act provides five basic opportunities .
It will give almost half a million underprivileged young Americans the opportunity to develop skills , continue education , and find useful work .
It will give every American community the opportunity to develop a comprehensive plan to fight its own poverty - and help them to carry out their plans .
It will give dedicated Americans the opportunity to enlist as volunteers in the war against poverty .
It will give many workers and farmers the opportunity to break through particular barriers which bar their escape from poverty .
It will give the entire nation the opportunity for a concerted attack on poverty through the establishment , tinder my direction , of the Office of Economic Opportunity , a national headquarters for the war against poverty .
This is how we propose to create these opportunities .
First we will give high priority to helping young Americans who lack skills , who have not completed their education or who cannot complete it because they arc too poor .
. . . I therefore recommend the creation of a job Corps , a Work - Training Program , and a Work Study Program .
A new national job Corps will build toward an enlistment of 100,000 young men .
They will be drawn from those whose background , health and education make them least fit for useful work .
. . . Half of these young men will work , in the first year , on special conservation projects to give them education , useful work experience and to enrich the natural resources of the country .
Half of these young men will receive , in the first year , a blend of training , basic education and work experience in job Training Centers .
. . . A new national Work - Training Program operated by the Department of Labor will provide work and training for 200,000 American men and women between the ages of 16 and 21 .
This will be developed through state and local governments and non-profit agencies .
. . . A new national Work - Study Program operated by the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare will provide federal funds for part - time jobs for 140,000 young Americans who do not go to college because they cannot afford it .
There is no more senseless waste than the waste of the brainpower and skill of those who are kept from college by economic circumstance .
Under this program they will , in a great American tradition , be able to work their way through school .
. . . Second , through a new Community Action program we intend to strike at poverty at its source - in the streets of our cities and on the farms of our countryside among the very young and the impoverished old .
This program asks men and women throughout the country to prepare long - range plans for the attack on poverty in their own local communities .
. . . Third , I ask for the authority to recruit and train skilled volunteers for the war against poverty .
Thousands of Americans have volunteered to serve the needs of other lands .
Thousands more want the chance to serve the needs of their own land .
They should have that chance .
Among older people who have retired , as well as among the young , among women as \vell as men , there are many Americans who are ready to enlist in our war against poverty .
They have skills and dedication .
They are badly needed .
. . . Fourth , we intend to create new opportunities for certain hard - hit groups to break out of the pattern of poverty .
Through a new program of loans and guarantees we can provide incentives to those who will employ the unemployed .
Through programs of work and retraining for unemployed fathers and mothers we can help them support their families in dignity while preparing themselves for new work .
Through funds to purchase needed land , organize cooperatives , and create new and adequate family farms we can help those whose life on the land has been a struggle without hope .
Fifth , I do not intend that the war against poverty become a series of uncoordinated and unrelated efforts - that it perish for lack of leadership and direction .
Therefore this bill creates , in the Executive Office of the President , a new Office of Economic Opportunity .
Its Director will be my personal Chief of Staff for the War against poverty .
I intend to appoint Sargent Shriver to this post .
. . . What you are being asked to consider is not a simple or an easy program .
But poverty is not a simple or an easy enemy .
It can not be driven from the land by a single attack on a single front .
Were this so we would have conquered poverty long ago .
Nor can it be conquered by government alone .
. . . Today , for the first time in our history , we have the power to strike away the barriers to full participation in our society .
Having the power , we have the duty .. . .
. We are fully aware that this program will not eliminate all the poverty in America in a few months or a few years .
Poverty is deeply rooted and its causes are many .
But this program will show the way to new opportunities for millions of our fellow citizens .
It will provide a lever with which we can begin to open the door to our prosperity for those who have been kept outside .
It will also give us the chance to test our weapons , to try our energy and ideas and imagination for the many battles yet to come .
As conditions change , and as experience illuminates our difficulties , we will be prepared to modify our strategy .
And this program is much more than a beginning .
Rather it is a commitment .
It is a total commitment by this President , and this Congress , and this nation , to pursue victory over the most ancient of mankind 's enemies .

New York 's Gov. David Paterson is not happy with the White House 's decision to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other enemy combatants to New York for civilian trials , reports WCBS -TV :
Whoa , hold on a second , Governor ?
The White House told you six months ago that they were going to put your constituents through this ?
Gee , thanks for letting us know .
Here 's ...
Washington ( CNN ) --
The push to overhaul health care received a major boost Thursday as the American Medical Association and AARP endorsed legislation drafted by top House Democrats .
The AARP , the nation 's largest organization of older Americans , is a nonpartisan group that advocates for people 50 and older .
The AMA , historically an opponent of health care reform , is considered one the nation 's most influential doctors ' advocacy groups .
" I want to thank both organizations again for their support , and I urge Congress to listen to AARP , listen to the AMA and pass this reform for hundreds of millions of Americans who will benefit from it , " President Obama said at the White House .
The backing of those two groups comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , oversees final changes to the $ 1.1 trillion health care bill .
The measure likely will come to a final vote Saturday .
Read the House health care bill ( PDF )
A 42 - page manager 's amendment on the health care legislation posted Tuesday night made mostly technical changes in the nearly 2,000 - page bill compiled from three Democratic proposals passed by three House committees .
By making the changes public Tuesday , House Democratic leaders could open floor debate on the bill Friday , while fulfilling their pledge to allow 72 hours of review before bringing the measure to the full chamber .
Pelosi insisted Thursday she will have the 218 votes necessary to pass the bill .
Meanwhile , President Obama is set to huddle Saturday with congressional Democrats on Capitol Hill to review the legislation .
Check out the key parts of the bill
In a statement , AARP CEO Barry Rand said , " We started this debate more than two years ago with the twin goals of making coverage affordable to our younger members and protecting Medicare for seniors .
" We can say with confidence that [ the House bill ] meets those goals with improved benefits for people in Medicare and needed health insurance market reforms to help ensure every American can purchase affordable health coverage . "
The AMA 's president , Dr. J. James Rohack , told reporters Thursday that the legislation is " not a perfect representation of our views " but is close enough to warrant his group 's support and keep the reform process moving forward .
Rohack said the bill needs to be accompanied by legislation reversing scheduled Medicare reimbursement payment reductions to physicians .
Responding to the AMA endorsement , Obama said the doctors ' group is " supporting reform because [ its members have ] seen firsthand what 's broken about our health care system , " Obama said .
" They would not be supporting it if they really believed that it would lead to government bureaucrats making decisions that are best left to doctors . "
Watch Obama say health care reform is moving forward
Meanwhile , House Republicans on Thursday continued to signal their opposition to the measure .
GOP leaders held a rally on Capitol Hill along with " Tea Party " movement protesters and other activists to warn that the House legislation would translate into a full - blown government takeover of the health care system .
Rep. Michele Bachmann , R- Minnesota , told CNN's " American Morning " on Thursday that Democrats had forgotten the lessons of August 's town hall meetings when angry conservatives criticized health care legislation .
" I think what we 're going to see is the town hall coming to Washington , D.C. , just to remind members of Congress [ that ] we 're the ones we would like you to pay attention to , not lobbyists .
And we do n't want the government to own our health care , " Bachmann said .
Speaking at Thursday 's opposition rally , actor John Ratzenberger , who played Cliff on the sitcom " Cheers , " slammed the Democratic bill as a form of socialism .
" These are Woodstock Democrats , " Ratzenberger said .
" We have to remember where their philosophy comes .
It does n't come from America .
It comes from overseas .
It comes from socialism .
And socialism is a philosophy of failure . "
House Democrats have rejected an alternative $ 60 billion Republican plan as inadequate for meeting the goals of expanding health coverage to most of the nation 's 46 million uninsured while bringing down costs and ending controversial industry practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions .
Pelosi's bill would extend insurance coverage to 36 million uncovered Americans and guarantee that 96 percent of Americans have coverage , according to the Democratic leadership .
The claim is based on an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
Among other things , the bill would subsidize insurance for poorer Americans and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to purchase coverage .
It also would cap annual out - of - pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions .
Pelosi's office has said the bill would cut the federal deficit by roughly $ 30 billion over the next decade .
The measure is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and spending constraints in Medicare and Medicaid .
Specifically , individuals with annual incomes more than $ 500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $ 1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge .
Growth in Medicare expenditures would be cut by 1.3 percent annually .
The House bill also includes a government - run public option .
Under the House plan , health care providers would be allowed to negotiate reimbursement rates with the federal government .
Pelosi and other liberal Democrats had argued for a more " robust " public option that would tie reimbursement rates for providers and hospitals to Medicare rates plus a 5 percent increase .
Several Democrats representing rural areas , however , killed the proposal after complaining that doctors and hospitals in their districts would be shortchanged under such a formula .
One thorny issue yet to be resolved among House Democrats is the bill 's final language on abortion .
Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Michigan , has been pushing leaders to add stronger language prohibiting the use of federal money to pay for abortions under the health care overhaul .
Stupak has vowed that if he is n't allowed a vote on the issue , a group of 40 anti-abortion Democrats will work to block the bill from getting to the House floor .
The House bill differs from legislation the Senate is considering in a number of critical ways .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , also favors a public option but would allow individual states to opt out of the plan .
An $ 829 billion bill recently passed by the Senate Finance Committee does not include a tax surcharge on the wealthy but would impose a new tax on high - end health care policies , which critics have dubbed " Cadillac " plans .
A large number of House Democrats are opposed to taxing those policies , arguing that such a move would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous benefits .
Individuals under the $ 829 billion Finance Committee plan would be required to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 .
The House bill imposes a more stringent fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income .
Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans .
The Finance Committee bill would require large companies to contribute to the health care costs of lower income workers if those workers received a government subsidy for insurance .
The House legislation would require larger companies to provide employee insurance for everyone or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of total revenue .
Democratic leaders in both chambers agree on establishing nonprofit health care cooperatives and stripping insurance companies of an anti-trust exemption that has been in place since the end of World War II .
Reid refused earlier this week to predict when the chamber would pass a health care bill , possibly signaling difficulty in generating support from his entire Democratic caucus .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Lisa Desjardins and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .
Microsoft has unleashed the public beta of Microsoft Office 2010 .
The Office 2010 beta includes updated versions of Word , excel , PowerPoint , Outlook , OneNote , Access , Publisher , InfoPath , SharePoint Workspace , and Communicator .
You can download it right now from the Microsoft Office 2010 beta site .
Like Windows XP versus Windows Vista , a fair percentage of users never made the jump from Office 2003 to Office 2007 .
The Windows Vista backlash had a residual effect which led customers to adopt a ' my - current - version - works - fine - why - change - it ' mentality .
Well , for those users ( as well as those users who have adopted Office 2007 ) , here are five reasons that you should download the beta and check out what Microsoft Office 2010 has to offer .
1. Ribbons .
OK .
I admit that the ribbon interface takes some getting used to .
If you are still using Office 2003 and you are used to the standard menu options across the top of your Office application screens , prepare yourself for a little learning curve when you start using Office 2010 .
That said , once you familiarize yourself with ribbons you will find it hard to go back .
The ribbon interface is more intuitive and helps you operate more efficiently ( after that requisite learning curve we were talking about ) .
Ribbons existed in Office 2007 , but only in certain applications .
With Office 2010 Microsoft has built the ribbon interface into the entire suite .
2. Backstage View .
This feature is more relevant for users of Office 2007 .
In Office 2007 a round Office button replaced many of the functions commonly accessed from the menu bar such as saving and printing .
That button never really seemed to catch on .
In Office 2010 , the button has been replaced with something that looks like one of the ribbon tabs at the top .
Clicking on the tab at the far left brings up a separate screen called Backstage View .
The Backstage interface displays a list of tasks in a panel on the left , but most of the screen is dedicated to displaying the options available for the selected task .
3. Paste Preview .
Microsoft collected user feedback and found that very frequently users end up undoing a paste action once it is completed .
Basically , the text or image pasted ends up not looking the way the user intended so they remove it and start over .
Paste Preview allows you to see what the paste will look like if you complete the action , enabling you to save some time and energy and get it right the first time .
It also gives you the choice of maintaining the formatting from the source , merging the formatting , or pasting just the text with no formatting .
4. Excel Sparklines .
Excel has always had a variety of charts and graphs available to visually depict data and trends .
With Excel 2010 , though , Microsoft has added a new feature called Sparklines , which allows you to place a mini - graph or trend line in a single cell .
The Sparklines are a cool way to quickly and simply add a visual element without having to go through the effort of inserting a graph or chart that overwhelms the worksheet .
5. Social Networking Integration .
Microsoft recognizes the social networking trend by adding Outlook Social Connector to the Outlook 2010 application .
Outlook Social Connector will let you see emails , status updates , shared files and photos , and more all in a single view .
You will also be able to see who your mutual friends are and other information to help you maintain and extend your social network .
As of the release of the beta there are no social network add-ins , but Microsoft promises to release them over the coming months .
With the position Facebook has in social networking , and the relationship Microsoft has with Facebook , it seems safe to assume a Facebook social network add - in might be one of the first available .
There you have it -- five reasons to download the Office 2010 beta and check it out .
There are a number of other reasons as well , but there is only so much you can fit in one article .
The integration with Microsoft Office Web Apps , as well as with other recent and upcoming release like Exchange 2010 and Office Communications Server 2010 .
This is not a good year to be anti-Microsoft -- Microsoft is on a roll .
Bing , Internet Explorer 8 , Windows 7 , and now Office 2010 have all received a fair amount of praise as they have been unleashed .
While other platforms like Windows Vista and Windows Mobile 6.5 have not succeeded in generating much excitement , these other software titles demonstrate that Microsoft still has the ability to develop innovative software that works .

T hey made the oddest of couples , the beanpole Dalton McGuinty and bearish George Smitherman .
The Ontario premier grew up a socially conservative , impeccably polite Irish Catholic from the Ottawa suburbs – probably convinced into adulthood he did n't even know any homosexuals .
The man who would become his unlikely political lieutenant was an out - and - then - some gay man , a hockey - playing , Whitney Houston - loving brawler who never went to college , started in politics as a lowly driver , confessed while in cabinet to a fondness for party drugs , and rose to become the second most powerful politician in the province .
Through McGuinty 's years in opposition and during the first term of Liberal government , the partnership worked marvellously , easily surviving Smitherman 's verbal indiscretions , emotional excesses and considerable appetite for attention .
Smitherman was the premier 's alter ego , the fist in his dainty white glove , the attack - trained partisan , the let - George - do - it handler of tough jobs and dirty work .
Even so , it had become increasingly clear recently that Smitherman 's continued presence was more liability than asset to the government , and that both men will be better off for his resignation from cabinet Sunday .
Smitherman quit as deputy premier and minister of energy and infrastructure renewal to free himself for a bid for the Toronto 's mayor job .
It was two months ago that he clearly signalled he intended to jump to municipal politics – in part because he'd pretty much peaked at the provincial level , in part because his temperament and Toronto pedigree seemed well suited to city hall .
Still , that posturing alone showed an audacity bordering on arrogance by a minister whose free rein in cabinet had evidently inclined him to believe his personal ambitions topped the obligations of his day job and the needs of his premier .
Smitherman was further diminished – and his continued presence in cabinet questioned – with the auditor general 's report on the spending and contract abuses at eHealth Ontario , much of which happened under Smitherman 's watch as health minister .
It was his successor in health , David Caplan , who paid with his job , but most observers knew it was the premier 's pet minister who 'd essentially run out on the tab .
It may be that some cabinet colleagues , in addition to feeling the popular Caplan had been shafted , had grown alarmed at what problems might arise from Smitherman 's assiduous wooing of the South Korean Samsung Group as an energy investor in Ontario .
That Furious George was , as the Star 's Robert Benzie has reported , " gang - tackled " by his cabinet colleagues on the concessions he was making to Samsung was remarkable .
That word of this leaked out spoke volumes about the declining regard in which he was held .
The damage done to Smitherman over the eHealth scandal – and the boost it gave potential mayoral rival John Tory , who essentially launched the investigation with his inquiries while PC leader – had reportedly caused second thoughts about leaving Queen 's Park .
But Smitherman is now all but out the door .
And the truth is there will be few tears .
As one Liberal said , " take away the gay and he 's a centre - right guy who likes to throw his weight around . "
For too long , Smitherman set an unfortunate example for more junior ministers of knee - jerk partisanship , robo- rhetoric over reflection , the bloviated shouting down of any and all critics .
For too long , too much power had been centred in the hands of one man , while talented MPPs twiddled their thumbs and the face of the McGuinty government grew more tired and cynical by the day .
Still , Smitherman did give the premier a parting gift .
One more chance to learn there 's no such thing as an indispensable man .

Jim Coyle 's provincial affairs column appears Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
Gary McKinnon says he acted out of curiosity , not malice A Briton accused of hacking into secret military and Nasa computers has had his extradition to the US put on hold as new psychiatric evidence is considered .
Glasgow - born Gary McKinnon , 42 , was denied permission to appeal to the Supreme Court against his removal .
He then had 14 days to appeal to the European Court , but the Home Office has agreed to consider new evidence and has put that 14 - day deadline on hold .
Mr McKinnon , who has Asperger 's syndrome , could face decades in jail .
' Extremely vulnerable ' A Home Office spokesman said : " On 12 October his solicitors submitted further representations to the Home Secretary and we are considering what response to give to this latest material .
" In the meantime , we have confirmed to his solicitors that we do not consider the 14 days for a Strasbourg application as running . "
Karen Todner , Mr McKinnon 's lawyer , said she hoped Home Secretary Alan Johnson would " show some compassion to someone who is extremely vulnerable " .
It does not matter if it takes some time to consider it , as long as they give it proper consideration
Karen Todner Ms Todner said : " We appreciate the home secretary may feel otherwise , but very eminent lawyers have given the advice that he does have the power to intervene , in fact we would say he has a duty to intervene .
" We hope he will stop this extradition process , and of course there is still the option to prosecute him ( Mr McKinnon ) here .
" I do not know when we will hear from him .
It does not matter if it takes some time to consider it , as long as they give it proper consideration . "
She added that they had to exhaust " all domestic remedies " if they were considering taking the case to Europe .
Mr McKinnon has admitted breaking into the computers , but says he sought information on UFOs and only got in because of lax security .
The US government , however , insists he committed a malicious crime - the biggest military computer hack ever .
They say he stole passwords , deleted files and left 300 computers at a US navy weapons station unusable immediately after the September 11 terrorist attacks .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Family Dollar Stores Inc said on Monday that the U.S. Supreme Court has decided not to hear its appeal of a $ 35.6 million verdict finding in favor of store managers who said they were denied overtime pay .
The suit alleged that Family Dollar violated the Fair Labor Standards
Act by classifying the plaintiffs and other store managers as exempt employees who were not entitled to overtime compensation , according to Family Dollar ’s latest quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
Family Dollar has said it believed the store managers were exempt employees and that they were properly compensated .
A Tuscaloosa , Alabama , jury found in 2006 that Family Dollar should have classified the plaintiffs as hourly employees entitled to overtime pay , and the trial court entered a judgment for $ 35.6 million .
Family Dollar appealed the ruling .
In its regulatory filing , Family Dollar said that as of May 30 , it had accrued liabilities of approximately $ 51.2 million related to the suit .
The retailer said on Monday that the court ’s decision not to hear the case will not have a material impact on its financial condition .
The suit was originally filed by Janice Morgan and Barbara Richardson on January 30 , 2001 .
Family Dollar shares were up 19 cents , or 0.7 percent , at $ 26.82 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .

Updated to further clarify MySpace ’s involvement : Google ( s goog ) is set to lift the lid on its new music search system this afternoon , with a party at the Capitol Records building in Hollywood to celebrate the occasion .
The product is a lot like what I ’d expected : a helpful revamp of Google ’s search results that gives users access to song streams from various third - party providers .
It is n’t a full - fledged music service , but it does make Google a better music search engine , with some unexpected twists — such as exclusive content — that could broaden its edge on its big-media peers and search rivals such as Microsoft ’s ( s msft ) Bing .
Music search queries will now return streams from either of two featured providers , Lala.com or MySpace - owned iLike.com , which will play in a popup window within Google ’s results page , as well as links to hear the same songs via Imeem , RealNetworks ’ ( s rnwk ) Rhapsody , MySpace - owned iLike and web radio provider Pandora on their own web sites .
Lala ’s streams can be played once as full songs by each user , then they revert to 30 - second clips ; the other services collectively offer a mix of full - song streams and previews .
( Lala allows users to buy permanent song streams for 10 cents , or downloadable MP3 files for various higher prices . )
You do n’t have to be searching for an artist or song title to get music results — a half - remembered chorus will do .
A search for a snippet of lyrics brings back an opportunity to stream the song itself from Lala or the other partner sites .
Google will use Emeryville , Calif . - based Gracenote ’s database to match up lyrics with titles , artists and songs .
Google and Lala will be offering exclusive songs through the service , showing that Google is willing to go beyond reorganized search .
Beginning Monday , artists will begin releasing songs that ca n’t be heard anywhere but a Google search results page — not even on Lala ’s own site — for a one - time stream or subsequent purchase .
The revamped results with song streams will likely keep visitors around on Google ’s own pages for longer , boosting ad rates .
Six percent of Google ’s top 1,000 song streams last week were music - related and 1.48 percent of its total searches sent users to music sites , Hitwise ’s Heather Dougherty noted in a blog post today .
Many music searches on Google result in quick exits to MySpace , YouTube or Wikipedia ; the chance to hear a song will surely make users linger for awhile .
And while Google is still stomping the competition in terms of overall market share , it ’s actually only now catching up to what Yahoo has been doing for about a year with music search .
Today ’s announcement is a clear win for Lala — and MySpace , whose bargain - basement acquisition of iLike this summer now looks like a steal — and increases the pressure on Microsoft ’s ( s msft )
Bing and other search rivals to offer a more alluring product .
( Microsoft appeared to have acquired assets of music search engine Seeqpod several months ago , although no formal announcement was ever made . )
Specialized music search engines such as Amie Street - owned Songza may still be more satisfying for deeper music queries , but for casual listeners and everyday music search , Google ’s new product represents a modest improvement .

Tomorrow is Election Day !
You will probably not vote , because there are no contested races for anything important in 90 % of the nation .
But if you are a New Yorker , we have one message : do n't vote for Michael Bloomberg .
You know those idiots who do n't know anything about politics but think it sounds smart to say " I am a social liberal and an economic conservative ? "
Bloomberg is the candidate for them , if they love a liberal nanny state and a conservative religious fervor for the eternal goodness of private enterprise .
For all the talk of Bloomberg the power - player who at least gets things done without worrying about the unions and special interests , he 's been unable to win any political battle with anyone he could n't literally buy off .
Like Sheldon Silver , who ( thankfully ) killed the West Side Stadium and ( annoyingly ) ended all that " Congestion Pricing " talk .
And those unions and special interests were just bought off , which worked fine back when the boom whose end Bloomberg never saw coming was in full swing .
And about that stadium : what the fuck was that ?
And the Olympics thing ?
After bitching about Giuliani 's disgraceful subsidizing of the fucking Yankees , Bloomberg both turns around completely on that particular issue and attempts to build the fucking Jets a stadium , so that New York could get an Olympics that it did not want .
And that failed , and everyone forgot about it .
Meanwhile : 40,000 people in shelters !
Bloomberg could personally buy every single one of those people an apartment in a vacant Williamsburg luxury condo building and still have enough left over to bribe a City Council member into supporting his fifth term .
And those luxury Williamsbug condo buildings , by the way , that stand vacant ?
Yes , well , that was part of this brilliant plan to utilize rezoning to spur the free market ( which always allocates resources more efficiently than anything else in the history of civilization but sometimes it needs government help , like with tax breaks and stuff ) to create affordable housing all over the waterfront .
This did not work , as developers decided to just not bother to build all those affordable housing units they were supposed to build .
More than 2,200 promised new affordable apartments in Williamsburg and Greenpoint have turned out to be 768 , 20 percent of which are renovations of apartments that were already affordable .
There are lots more of these stories .
His record on housing , like his record on nearly everything having to do with the outer boroughs and poverty and human beings who make less than $ 100,000 a year , has been a ridiculous disgrace .
His entire philosophy of development solving everything turned out to be precisely , 100 % wrong , and suddenly the city itself was driving the real estate boom , driving up land prices to absurd levels across the boroughs and tearing down neighborhoods only to replace them with vacant lots and half - filled cheaply built hideous high - rises once the bottom fell out of the City Hall - inflated market .
But hey , we got the High Line and 311 !
So you can sleep in that fancy park while you call 311 asking if there is room in a shelter because you can no longer afford your home .
Eight years into the Bloomberg administration , Ground Zero is a still a hole that everyone continues fighting about .
The MTA has raised fares while cutting service ( without actually cutting service , officially — it 's just that whatever line you happen to ride is suddenly experiencing a whole lot of track work every single goddamn weekend ) .
The Gays : still not married !
And also a lot of them are getting beaten up on the streets these days for some reason ?
Bloomberg is also the beneficiary of the most friendly news coverage of any big city mayor in the nation .
Easily .
It helps that , you know , he is a media mogul , himself , and he is good , close , personal friends with the three publishers who run the newspapers that went after each one of his predecessors for shit they 've let slide under this mayor , because they know he 's a good , decent guy , at heart , and the only one who can Fix New York , because of his Money .
Can you imagine how the Post would 've blown up if David Dinkins lied about taking the Subway to work every day ?
The Daily News response to discovering that John Lindsay flew to Bermuda every weekend ?
Let 's talk about the cops , for a second : they are still operating under Giuliani levels of complete disregard for the law .
They are getting drunk and running people over and shooting unarmed black people and sodomizing people in subway stations .
The Civilian Complaint Review Board has become a joke , unless your case gets a lot of publicity .
There 's obviously no accountability , whatsoever , and no attempt to recruit and train more cops from the communities they actually police .
The NYPD remains , primarily , the home of roided - out white people from outside the city with a great deal of contempt for civil liberties .
The Mayor always sounds properly upset when some of them rape someone , but he 's never done a damn thing to rein them in or change the culture .
What he has done is Keep Us Safe by never once giving a shit about Civil Liberties .
The cops stop and frisk thousands more people every year , your 4th Amendment rights do not apply in the Subway system , and expensive and completely ineffective new rings of cameras are going up across Manhattan .
Bloomberg deserves to be run out of town on an inadequately funded public rail line for the 2004 GOP convention alone .
Remember that ridiculous farce ?
No , of course not , no one does , besides the thousands of people improperly spied on , arrested , harassed , and detained by the NYPD .
All of this was completely illegal .
No heads rolled .
One more special bonus factoid : New York leads the world in marijuana arrests !
Specifically , marijuana arrests of black people !
And he is personally a jerk .
He is a thin - skinned , unpleasant , sanctimonious asshole .
His company is being sued for a culture of sexual discrimination that plaintiffs say Bloomberg himself contributed to .
He is a tremendous dick to reporters whenever he gets cranky .
He is fucking race - baiting with Rudy Giuliani again , because why not ?
He has been a shitty mayor and he does not deserve the support of anyone who claims to be a liberal .
Though what all of his most destructive missteps as mayor have in common is that they do not in any way upset or inconvenience the well - off self - professed liberals who support him .
Besides maybe a couple Critical Mass riders arrested in illegal sweeps .
( Though he sure does like bike lanes , so it 's a wash , right ? )
We cannot encourage you to vote for the Democrat in the race , because even we still are n't sure if we 'll go for him or the much more delightful Billy Talen .
Just do n't fucking vote for Michael Bloomberg .
When it comes to role - playing games , there is n't a bigger name than Square - Enix .
PopCap Games enjoys a similar reputation , albeit in the casual games market .
When the company behind the Final Fantasy series and the developer responsible for titles like Peggle and Plants vs. Zombies announced they were going to join forces on a new project called Gyromancer , people wept for their free time .
Now , the game is here , both on Xbox Live and Steam , and the enthusiasm surrounding the game certainly seems well - placed .
The bottom line is that Gyromancer is wonderful title , an amalgamation of the two companies ' strengths .
PopCap 's fast - paced and addictive gameplay , coupled with the high amount of gloss and polish that Square - Enix is known for , is a winning combination .
Everything about the game is fun , and once you start playing , you 're not going to want to stop .
Title Gyromancer
Developer PopCap Games / Square - Enix Publisher Square - Enix Price 1200 MS
Points / $ 14.99 ( Steam ) Platform 360 ( reviewed ) , PC
Taking a note from Puzzle Quest , the game tells an epic fantasy story via still portraits and text narration .
It 's a tried - and - true method , and one that feels fairly appropriate here , thanks to the elegant - yet - dramatic style of the pictures and the extremely flowery wording .
Players take on the role of Rivel , a summoner / knight errant who is on a quest to both bring a murderer to justice and recover his lost memories .
True to the finest traditions of Square - Enix , it 's all a little complex , and mildly ridiculous , but it 's also entertaining .
In each stage of the game , you direct Rivel around a map that is crawling with enemy creatures , some mobile , some stationary , and some sub - bosses that reside in lairs .
If you 're willing to explore the maps , you can find extra items , cash , and new creatures to summon , too .
While Rivel meanders across each of the game 's twelve stages , he encounters monsters that randomly move around the map .
In order to progress past them , he has to summon creatures of his own to do battle against them , in a style that seems like it 's mixed from Pok?mon and Bejeweled .
Gyromancer is deceptively simple at first , incorporating play elements that will feel instantly familiar to anyone who 's ever played Bejeweled or Puzzle Quest .
However , it quickly and competently introduces players to more advanced / challenging modes of play as they start progressing through the game .
The core game mechanics of Gyromancer are pulled straight from Bejeweled Twist : you select four jewels at a time and rotate them clockwise until you can match at least three gems of the same color .
These color matches generate energy that shows up in bars under your creature 's portrait .
Eventually , you can build up enough power to generate a charged gem , which can then be matched in order to deliver an attack on the match opponent .
Of course , things get much more complex pretty quickly .
" Idle Spins " ( when you spin gems but do n't make a match ) do n't generate any penalties early on , but enemy monsters will gain a major power boost later on in the game from these .
Eventually , things like locked jewels ( which can be matched , but not twisted ) and rocks ( which block area effects and generally get in the way ) start popping up to give higher - level players more challenges .
Which monsters you choose to use plays an important role in the jewel battles , too .
Certain creature / color types have advantages over others , which can make a battle either a lot easier or much harder , depending on your creature choice .
This is sort of like how color types in Magic : The Gathering or creature choices in Pok ? mon work in their respective games .
Also , every creature is attuned to a specific color , providing an additional power boost when you create matches from the corresponding crystals .
There 's a ton of replay value in the game , too , as players can revisit previous stages with Rivel for multiple benefits .
Trampling through these levels allows you to level up your character and creatures , easing your further journeys .
Also , clearing out levels with increasing speed and effectiveness , as well as performing feats like eliminating sub- bosses , will unlock awards that eventually translate to Xbox Achievements .
As a result , it 's easy to spend four or five hours on the first couple of stages .
However , the one problem with Gyromancer is that , for the moment , there is n't a multiplayer mode to the game .
This is a shame , mainly because it seems like an online battle mode could be a ton of fun .
Granted , the single - player combat system , which does n't trade turns between combatants , might be difficult to adapt into an online experience , but the end result could be stellar .
In spite of this one minor downfall , it 's practically impossible not to love this creation from Square - Enix and PopCap .
It combines beast collecting , puzzle / RPG elements , and Final Fantasy style to create something that is both familiar and unique .
As a result , if you 're a fan of puzzle games — especially ones that are challenging and fast - paced — then Gyromancer can do you no wrong .

( CNN ) -- China plans to make " every effort to rescue " a merchant ship and crew hijacked in the Indian Ocean , the country 's state news agency reported on Tuesday .
The Chinese - owned bulk carrier De Xin Hai was hijacked on October 19 with 25 crew members on board .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu , speaking to reporters , said the government was monitoring developments and has developed an emergency response procedure , the news agency Xinhua reported .
Monday 's hijacking is the first of a Chinese ship this year , according to the International Chamber of Commerce 's International Maritime Bureau .
Ma said the ministry warned ships and citizens to avoid traveling along waters where the incident occurred , an area not far from the Somalia coast where pirates have seized many vessels .
See a live map of hijackings in 2009
" We will watch closely developments in the incident and make every effort to rescue the hijacked crew and carrier , " Ma said .
There are 25 crew members aboard and they are all Chinese nationals .
A European Union official Monday incorrectly said the total of crew members was 146 .
The bulk carrier De Xin Hai was hijacked Monday about 550 nautical miles northeast of the Seychelles and 700 nautical miles off Somalia 's eastern coast .
The European Union Naval Force said Tuesday the ship was 650 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia and appears to be headed toward there .
See where the ship was hijacked »
John Harbour , a commander with the British Royal Navy who serves with the EU Naval Force , said the UK Maritime Trade Organization in Bahrain called the ship but received no response .
An EU force aircraft is monitoring the ship and reported seeing four pirates on deck .
The De Xin Hai is owned by the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company and was carrying coal from South Africa to India , Harbour said .
Xinhua reported that the total capacity of the ship is 40,892 tons , and that the vessel is 225 meters ( 246 yards ) long .
It said that the last time the ship sent a communication was at 4:35 a.m. EDT Monday ( 4:35 p.m. Beijing time ) .
The ship was dragging two skiffs behind it , much like the kind of skiffs that pirates have been known to use to hijack ships in the waters off Somalia .
So far in 2009 , 14 ships have been hijacked in the ocean off Somalia 's coast , and 33 have been hijacked in the Gulf of Aden , the body of water that lies between Yemen and Somalia , the International Maritime Bureau said .
Most of Somalia 's coastline is on the Indian Ocean .
At present , the bureau knows of four ships that are being held .

Washington D.C. – After voting against H.R. 3962 – Affordable Health Care for America Act , Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) today made the following statement :
“ We have been led to believe that we must make our health care choices only within the current structure of a predatory , for - profit insurance system which makes money not providing health care .
We cannot fault the insurance companies for being what they are .
But we can fault legislation in which the government incentivizes the perpetuation , indeed the strengthening , of the for - profit health insurance industry , the very source of the problem .
When health insurance companies deny care or raise premiums , co-pays and deductibles they are simply trying to make a profit .
That is our system .
“ Clearly , the insurance companies are the problem , not the solution .
They are driving up the cost of health care .
Because their massive bureaucracy avoids paying bills so effectively , they force hospitals and doctors to hire their own bureaucracy to fight the insurance companies to avoid getting stuck with an unfair share of the bills .
The result is that since 1970 , the number of physicians has increased by less than 200 % while the number of administrators has increased by 3000 % .
It is no wonder that 31 cents of every health care dollar goes to administrative costs , not toward providing care .
Even those with insurance are at risk .
The single biggest cause of bankruptcies in the U.S. is health insurance policies that do not cover you when you get sick .
“ But instead of working toward the elimination of for - profit insurance , H.R. 3962 would put the government in the role of accelerating the privatization of health care .
In H.R. 3962 , the government is requiring at least 21 million Americans to buy private health insurance from the very industry that causes costs to be so high , which will result in at least $ 70 billion in new annual revenue , much of which is coming from taxpayers .
This inevitably will lead to even more costs , more subsidies , and higher profits for insurance companies — a bailout under a blue cross .
“ By incurring only a new requirement to cover pre-existing conditions , a weakened public option , and a few other important but limited concessions , the health insurance companies are getting quite a deal .
The Center for American Progress ’ blog , Think Progress , states “ since the President signaled that he is backing away from the public option , health insurance stocks have been on the rise . ”
Similarly , healthcare stocks rallied when Senator Max Baucus introduced a bill without a public option .
Bloomberg reports that Curtis Lane , a prominent health industry investor , predicted a few weeks ago that “ money will start flowing in again ” to health insurance stocks after passage of the legislation .
Investors.com last month reported that pharmacy benefit managers share prices are hitting all - time highs , with the only industry worry that the Administration would reverse its decision not to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices , leaving in place a Bush Administration policy .
“ During the debate , when the interests of insurance companies would have been effectively challenged , that challenge was turned back .
The “ robust public option ” which would have offered a modicum of competition to a monopolistic industry was whittled down from an initial potential enrollment of 129 million Americans to 6 million .
An amendment which would have protected the rights of states to pursue single - payer health care was stripped from the bill at the request of the Administration .
Looking ahead , we cringe at the prospect of even greater favors for insurance companies .
“ Recent rises in unemployment indicate a widening separation between the finance economy and the real economy .
The finance economy considers the health of Wall Street , rising corporate profits , and banks ’ hoarding of cash , much of it from taxpayers , as sign of an economic recovery .
However in the real economy — in which most Americans live — the recession is not over .
Rising unemployment , business failures , bankruptcies and foreclosures are still hammering Main Street .
“ This health care bill continues the redistribution of wealth to Wall Street at the expense of America ’s manufacturing and service economies which suffer from costs other countries do not have to bear , especially the cost of health care .
America continues to stand out among all industrialized nations for its privatized health care system .
As a result , we are less competitive in steel , automotive , aerospace and shipping while other countries subsidize their exports in these areas through socializing the cost of health care .
“ Notwithstanding the fate of H.R. 3962 , America will someday come to recognize the broad social and economic benefits of a not - for - profit , single - payer health care system , which is good for the American people and good for America ’s businesses , with of course the notable exceptions being insurance and pharmaceuticals . ”

Spying on Terrorist Cash Flows EU to Allow US Access to Bank Transaction Data
As part of the war on terror , American intelligence services have been monitoring European bank transactions since 2001 .
When the EU found out about it in 2006 , they were outraged .
But now it looks like the bloc will agree to a controversial deal that will allow the covert data transfer to continue .
There are so many reasons to be blown away by the SEC 's incompetence and failure to catch Madoff .
It has been said that all the agency had to do was make one phone call or send one email to one of the banks where Madoff supposedly traded to confirm that none of the money was there .
But they actually did that !
And the bank confirmed that Madoff was lying !
It was UBS .
Go to the SEC 's big Madoff document dump and click through exhibits 363-373 .
Basically , it 's a trail of emails from SEC staffers about how they were eager to check out Madoff 's trading accounts supposedly with UBS .
Eventually they got a response with UBS and find that Madoff did n't have the account he claimed to have with them .
They caught him in a lie that would have been totally unnecessary if he were legit .
But that got them nowhere .
The first document here is UBS saying it does n't have the account Madoff claimed it had , and the second one is the SEC's Simona K . Suh acknowledging that Madoff had given them bad info .

Wikipedia is under a censorship attack by a convicted murderer who is invoking Germany 's privacy laws in a bid to remove references to his killing of a Bavarian actor in 1990 .
Lawyers for Wolfgang Werle , of Erding , Germany , sent a cease - and - desist letter ( .pdf ) demanding removal of Werle 's name from the Wikipedia entry on actor Walter Sedlmayr .
The lawyers cite German court rulings that " have held that our client 's name and likeness cannot be used anymore in publication regarding Mr. Sedlmayr 's death . "
German media have already ceased using Werle 's full name regarding the attack .
Jennifer Granick , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , says German publications must also alter their online archives in a bid to comport with laws designed to provide offenders an avenue to " reintegrate back into society . "
" It 's not just censorship going forward .
It 's asking outlets to go back and change what is already being written , " Granick said in a telephone interview .
It 's not the first time Wikipedia , the world 's most popular online , public - driven encyclopedia , has been targeted by would - be censors .
And it likely wo n't be the last .
The site went offline overseas for a day in December , as British censors blacklisted it over an entry on the German rock band Scorpions .
The entry included the cover art of the Scorpions ' 1976 Virgin Killer album , which depicts a nude young girl .
Werle is suing Wikipedia in a Hamburg court to try and get it to comply with the German law .
" Our client has served 15 years of his life sentence for murdering Mr. Sedlmayr in 1990 .
He has been released on parole [ sic ] in August 2007 .
His rehabilitation and his future life outside the prison system is severely impacted by your unwillingness to anonymize any articles dealing with the murder of Mr. Sedlmayr with regard to our client 's involvement , " according to the Oct. 27 cease - and - desist letter , which demands legal fees and compensation for " emotional suffering . "
Wikipedia did not respond for comment .
Granick said the First Amendment protects San Francisco - based Wikipedia .
But it could find itself in the same position as Yahoo , which has been fined millions by a French court for allowing users to auction Nazi paraphernalia , which is illegal in France .
In that case , Yahoo asked the American courts to intervene .
So far , the U.S. courts have refrained , because France has not moved to collect the fine .

As voters in several states head to the polls today to decide Governor and city council races it seems appropriate to ask : “ Why are most politicians still inexplicably silent on marijuana law reform ? ”
The recent legislative hearings on cannabis regulation in Massachusetts and California notwithstanding , the fact remains that these debates are the exception , not the rule .
In fact , voters in Maine and Colorado will decide on marijuana law reform ballot proposals today ( Note : Check back here tonight for the results . ) precisely because their elected officials outright refused to vote on the issues when they were put before them .
In short , prominent politicians continue to run away from sensible marijuana law reforms at the same time that the public is demanding them .
Two longtime NORML allies , former High Times editor Steve Wishnia and former NORML Board Member Richard Evans , recently explored this phenomenon and offer some insight and possible explanations :
Pot Is More Mainstream Than Ever , So Why Is Legalization Still Taboo ?
via Alternet.org
Almost every voter under 65 in this country has either smoked cannabis or grew up with people who did .
Among its erstwhile users are the last three presidents , one Supreme Court justice and the mayor of the nation ’s largest city .
The pot leaf ’s image pervades popular culture , from Bob Marley T - shirts to billboards for Showtime ’s Weeds .
So why is actually legalizing it still considered a fringe issue ?
Why have n’t more politicians — especially the ones who inhaled — come out and said , “ Prohibition is absurd and criminal .
Let ’s treat cannabis like alcohol ” ?
… One reason for the lack of urgent political pressure , says Deborah Small of Break the Chains , is that the people most likely to get busted for pot are the ones who “ do n’t have a political voice ” — young people of color from poor neighborhoods .
… Washington State Sen. Jeanne Kohl - Welles says that many legislators , particularly in the state ’s more conservative rural areas , “ buy into the cultural stereotypes about marijuana , ” such as the idea that it ’s a gateway to harder drugs .
The Seattle Democrat , who is sponsoring a bill to reduce the penalty for less than 40 grams of pot from a misdemeanor to a civil infraction , says … that law enforcement has largely opposed her decriminalization bill .
Writing locally in the Massachusetts Daily News Tribune , Evans questions why none of the state ’s major party candidates have reached out to the 65 percent of state voters who elected last year to decriminalize marijuana possession statewide .
The Senate race and marijuana prohibition
via The Daily News Tribune
Odd , is n’t it , that all the U.S. Senate candidates , and the people who ask them questions trying to elicit their positions on issues people care about , seem to have forgotten that in the last election , a whopping 65 percent of the voters went for marijuana decriminalization ?
If that many voters care about the marijuana laws , why do these candidates , who claim to have their fingers on the public pulse , ignore the subject ?
… Politicians report little “ noise ” on this issue , mistaking silence for indifference , not fear .
People are justifiably fearful about writing a letter , showing up on a mailing list , even sending an email with the “ m ” word in it .
They have to be very careful about their jobs , their drivers licenses and the kids in school whose parents will talk .
But put them in the privacy of a voting booth , and stand back !
… No living person is responsible for the marijuana prohibition laws .
They were conceived three generations ago in a cultural and racial climate far different from our own , and very different from that to which we aspire .
Are we ready for a serious , sober discussion about repeal , without the usual winks , smirks and puns ?
Can we handle it ?
Will someone lead it ?
And finally , speaking of “ serious discussions , ” it does n’t get much more serious — and mainstream — than the persuasive and well - articulated arguments from longtime NORML - ally Jessica Corry , who has an amazing ability to tongue - tie both probitionists and Fox News hosts within three minutes !
I ’m just glad that she ’s on our side .

3 - 2-1 Countdown for Equality : No Bittersweet Victories
Progressives are closer than ever to a victory on health care reform .
As 2009 comes to a close , we 've moved forward on other issues .
But what 's looming up ahead could be a disappointment .
On Tuesday , November 3rd , 2009 - less than a week away - there will be critical votes on on LGBT equality in three states : Washington State , Maine , and Michigan .
With so much attention devoted to other issues in the political realm , bloggers have banded together to ensure we do n't forget the ones with a firm deadline next week .
For that reason , we 've joined with these three campaigns to put together a summary of who , what , and how .
If you have n't heard of these campaigns , and / or have n't done anything yet to support them , please consider helping out .
If you are a blogger please feel free to grab this content whole cloth and use it for your blog posts .
Scroll down to the bottom to grab the formatted HTML to drop into a post .
Last year , as Obama and Democrats were winning across the country , we lost marriage equality in California .
It was a bittersweet victory .
Pitch in to make sure 2009 is n't a bittersweet year .
Take action to support LGBT equality TODAY .
Who we are : Approve Referendum 71 is the campaign to preserve domestic partnerships in Washington State .
By voting to approve , voters retain the domestic partnership laws that were passed during this year 's legislative session , including using sick leave to care for a partner , adoption rights , insurance rights , and more .
What we need :
We need phone bankers to get our supporters out to vote .
Washington is an all mail - in ballot state , and we need to ensure our supporters put their ballots in the mail .
Also , youth turnout is a critical component of our campaign , and youth turnout historically drops in off - year elections .
So we need a lot of help to turn them out .
How you do it : Sign up here to make remote calls for Approve 71 .
We 'll then contact you for a training , and you can make GOTV calls .
Who we are : The No On 1 / Protect Maine Equality campaign is working to protect Maine 's recently - passed law legalizing marriage equality for same - sex couples .
Our opponents have put the issue on the ballot for Nov 3 , 2009 .
Because of Maine 's early voting election laws , people are already voting at the polls , so we need help immediately to turn out our side at the polls .
What we need :
We need you to devote a few hours to Call for Equality .
Call for Equality is a virtual phonebank set up so that you can call Maine voters wherever you are .
Much of Maine is rural , where canvassing is n't effective , so we need to reach these voters - along with other supporters - by phone .
All you need is a phone and internet connection .
No experience required !
We 'll provide the training , and all you need is a a few hours to help get a win in Maine .
How you do it : Click here to sign up for a training and your shift .
There are lots of times available for your convenience .
[ AND REMEMBER : DWT and our Blue America partners have an ActBlue page where you can contribute to No On 1 / Protect Maine Equality . ]
Who We Are : The Yes on Ordinance 1856 / One Kalamazoo campaign is working in Michigan to support the City Commission of Kalamazoo 's twice approved ordinance for housing , employment , and public accommodation protections for gay and transgender residents .
Opponents forced a public referendum on the ordinance so dedicated local volunteers , led by former Stonewall Democrats Executive Director Jon Hoadley , are working to ensure voters say YES to fairness and equality and keep Ordinance 1856 .
Why the Urgency :
In the final weeks , the opposition has gone all out with aggressive disinformation and misleading red herrings to try to defeat the ordinance .
This includes signs that say " No to Discrimination " ( even though voting No actually supports continued discrimination of GLBT residents ) , transphobic door hangers and fliers , and now radio ads that falsely suggest that criminal behavior will become legal when this simply is n't true .
The Yes on Ordinance 1856 supporters are better organized but many voters who want to vote for gay and transgender people are getting confused by the opposition .
How to Help :
1 ) Help the One Kalamazoo campaign raise a final $ 10,000 specifically dedicated to fight back against the lies on the local TV and radio airwaves and fully fund the campaign 's final field and GOTV efforts .
Give here : http://www.actblue.com/page/3-2-1-countdown
2 ) If you live nearby and can physically volunteer in Kalamazoo sign up here .
If you know anyone that lives in Kalamazoo , use the One Kalamazoo campaign 's online canvass tool to remind those voters that they need to vote on November 3rd and vote YES on Ordinance 1856 to support equality for gay and transgender people .

Let me say again that this should n't be happening .
People 's basic rights should n't be subject to anyone 's vote .
Do you think there 's any chance that , say , the First Amendment could survive a trip through the ballot box ?
Not hardly .
And yet respect for all citizens ' basic rights is as central to democracy as the principle of majority rules ; without it , all you 've got is a tyranny of the majority .
But here we are , in the last week before crucial votes are to be held in Maine , Washington State , and Kalamazoo , MI .
The issues are different in the three votes , but the same principle is at stake :
Does one group of people get to vote away another group 's basic rights ?
Luckily , my friends and colleagues at the Courage Campaign have thought it through a bit more thoroughly , so I 'm going to turn the floor over to them .
And they 've provided the following breakdowns of the three votes :

When , on what , and how much ?
Google released Chrome OS ' source code today , but one of Chrome 's lead engineers , Idan Avraham , said a finished Chrome OS arrives " about a year from today . "
They took pains to note that Google itself wo n't be offering Chrome OS as a download to install on any system you have .
They 're developing Chrome OS for machines with " specific reference hardware , " as their machines will boot directly from those machines and skip a lot of the hardware checking steps that standard operating systems run through .

The developers did n't offer pricing hints or targets from hardware partners .
They did say , however , that they intend to " push " manufacturers to release netbooks with larger keyboards and mousepads , and crisper resolutions , and devices will be released " in the price ranges people see today . "

How fast is it ?
From a single boot - up shown on a livecast , and some live demonstration , pretty darned fast .
The lead developer cited a seven - second boot - up to a universal sign - on screen on an eeePC , and then to the desktop after another four seconds .
It does this by working on specialized firmware , written for hardware Chrome OS ' developers work with , and relying on a Google Chrome browser written specifically for the Chrome OS .
It 's also written exclusively to run on solid - state , or non-hard - disk , drives , with a minimal amount of locally - stored data .

But even the small notepad application in Chrome , and your particular Wi-Fi and system settings , are backed up to your Google account as well .
You 'll be able to store data offline using HTML 5

So , it 's a Google OS for people obsessed with Google ?
Not exactly .
Avraham demonstrated the OS ' ability to assign specific webapps to different files and links by clicking an .xls ( Microsoft Excel ) file , which then opened in Microsoft 's online Office suite .
Advertisement
Will it ever arrive on laptops or desktops ?
Eventually , assuming it gains any foothold in the market .
Chrome 's developers said their primary focus for the year , and the immediate future , would be netbooks , and that laptops and desktop releases would follow , without offering any specific time frame .
Advertisement
Will it print ?
Oh , right — Avraham said " you will be able to print , " but said the OS would take a " more innovative approach " to supporting printers .
More to come .

So , how does Google Chrome OS strike you ?
Is it something you 'd want on a netbook , or were you expecting something more ?

GPS - based road train – Click above for gallery
It goes by the name " Sartre , " but it has nothing to do with existentialism and just a little bit to do with exits .
The Safe Road Trains for the Environment program is a three - year European study centering on the creation of ' platoons ' of drivers behind a lead vehicle on the highway .
It involves wiring cars to speak to each other , and to a lead vehicle – the platoon commander – behind which up to eight cars could follow in automated bliss .
One of the keys to the study is finding a way to make travel more efficient and lower gas usage without spending the treasury on putting sensors in roads , or creating an entirely new standard of equipment .
Also , using a lead vehicle that could take control of the vehicles behind – cars , trucks or buses – makes Sartre much more flexible since it can travel on any highway .
So say you need to get to the Alhambra in a hurry .
You see a Sartre platoon on the highway ahead , and if there 's room , you signal your wish to join .
The lead vehicle takes control of your car , and it is pulled into the formation , leaving you free to do whatever you want to do .
When you want to get out , you signal your intention , a gap is made and you get control of your car again .
The study will be conducted on test tracks in Spain , Sweden and the UK , with additional trials on public road in Spain .
Gentlemen , mount up ...

In April , we voiced serious concerns about the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 , a bill by Senators Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) , that sought to give the federal government unprecedented power over the Internet .
For months , the bill has been redrafted behind closed doors and has recently been circulated , but by all accounts , the changes are cosmetic and it 's sadly more of the same .
Like the original bill , the new version appears to give the President carte blanche to decide which networks and systems , private or public , count as " critical infrastructure information systems or networks . "
And alongside that authority , there still appears to be murky language that would permit the President to shut down the Internet .
Note the troubling provision in the original bill , which said :
The President [...] may order the disconnectionof any Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information systems or networks in the interest of national security ;
The new bill says :
The President [...] in the event of an immediate threat [...] may declare a cybersecurity emergency ; and may , if the President finds it necessary for the national defense and security , and in coordination with relevant industry sectors , direct the national response to the cyber threatand the timely restoration of the affected critical infrastructure information system or network ;
In other words , they appear to have packaged Presidential authority to shut down the Internet and other private networks behind a ribbon of red tape , and the words " national response . "
In addition , a CNET article by Declan McCullagh indicates that many of the early concerns about privacy , authority , and security effectiveness have gone unsolved : there is vague language about mapping federal and private networks ; there is an unexplained scheme to certify cybersecurity professionals at the federal level ; and the mandated implementation of a " cybersecurity strategy " before the completion of a legal review that could protect against inadvertent privacy violations or inefficiency .
Despite the many questionable provisions , the bill may snake its way through the lawmaking process by virtue of having been produced in large part by Sen .
Rockefeller , who is chairman of the committee in charge of reviewing and approving the bill .
Stay tuned to EFF
Deeplinks for news as the bill progresses -- we 'll be watching it carefully .

As I mentioned in my last post on our mobile site , one of the key features for our site was making sure that we do n’t use any javascript unless absolutely necessary .
If you use Google Analytics ( GA ) as your stats package , this poses a problem , since the supported way to run GA is via a chunk of javascript at the bottom of every page .
And to make matters worse , the ga.js file is not gzipped , so you ’re loading 9 K which would otherwise be about 4 k , on a platform where every byte counts .
By contrast , if you could just serve the tracking gif , it is 47 bytes .
And no javascript that might not run on B - grade or below devices .
A few weeks ago , Google announced support for analytics inside mobile apps and some cursory support for mobile sites :
Google Analytics now tracks mobile websites and mobile apps so you can better measure your mobile marketing efforts .
If you ’re optimizing content for mobile users and have created a mobile website , Google Analytics can track traffic to your mobile website from all web - enabled devices , whether or not the device runs JavaScript .
This is made possible by adding a server side code snippet to your mobile website which will become available to all accounts in the coming weeks ( download snippet instructions ) .
We will be supporting PHP , Perl , JSP and ASPX sites in this release .
Of course , you can still track visits to your regular website coming from high - end , Javascript enabled phones .
And that is the extent of the documentation you will find anywhere on Google on how to run analytics without javascript .
The code included is handy if you happen to run one of their platforms , but the Walker ’s mobile site runs on the python side of AppEngine , so their code does n’t do us much good .
Thankfully , since they provide us with the source , we can without too much trouble , translate the php or perl into python and make it AppEngine friendly .
How it works
Regular Google Analytics works by serving some javascript and a small 1 px x 1 px gif file to your site from Google .
The gif lets Google learn many things from the HTTP request your browser makes , such as your browser , OS , where you came from , your rough geo location , etc .
The javascript lets them learn all kinds of nifty things about your screen , flash versions , event that fire , etc .
And Google tracks you through a site by setting some cookies on that gif they serve you .
To use GA without javascript , we can still do most of that , and we do it by generating our own gif file and passing some information back to Google through our server .
That is , we generate a gif , assign and track our own cookie , and then gather that information as you move through the site , and use a HTTP request with the appropriate query strings and pass it back to Google , which they then compile and treat as regular old analytics .
The Code
To make this work in appeinge , we create a URL in our webapp that we ’ll serve the gif from .
I ’m using “ / ga / ” :
[ python ]
def main ( ) :
application = webapp .
WSGIApplication (
[ (‘/’ , home .
MainHandler ) ,
# edited out extra lines here
(‘/ ga/’ , ga. GaHandler ) ,
] ,
debug=False )
wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler( ).run( application )
[ / python ]
And here ’s the big handler for / ga / .
I based it mostly off the php and some of the perl ( click to expand the full code ) :

So now we know what to do with our requests at / ga / when we get them , we just need to make the proper requests to that URL in the first place .
So we need to generate the URL we ’re going to have the visitor ’s browser request in the first place .
With normal django , we would be able to use template_context to automatically insert it into the page ’s template values .
But , since AppEngine does n’t use that , we have our own helper functions to do that , which I showed some of in my last post .
Here ’s the updated helper functions , with the GoogleAnalyticsGetImageUrl function included :
[ code lang = ” python ” ]
import settings
def googleAnalyticsGetImageUrl(request ) :
url = " "
url += ‘/ ga/’ + " ? "
url += " utmac= " + settings .
GA_ACCOUNT
url += " &utmn= " + str(random.randrange(0 , 0x7fffffff ) )
referer = request .
referrer
query = urllib.urlencode(request .GET ) #$_SERVER [ " QUERY_STRING " ] ;
path = request .path # $_SERVER [ " REQUEST_URI " ] ;
if len( referer ) == 0 :
referer = " -"
url += " &utmr= " + urllib.pathname2url( referer )
if len ( path ) !=0 :
url += " &utmp= " + urllib.pathname2url( path )
url += " &guid=ON " ;
return {‘gaImgUrl’:url}
def getTempalteValues ( request ) :
myDict = {}
myDict.update( ua_test( request ) )
myDict.update(googleAnalyticsGetImageUrl(request ) )
return myDict
[ / code ]
Assuming we use getTemplateValues to set up our inital template_values dict , we should have a variable named ‘ gaImg Url ’ in our page .
To use it , all we need to do is put this at the bottom of every page on the site :
[ code lang = ” html ” ]
< img src= " {{ gaImgUrl }} " alt = " analytics " />
[ / code ]
My settings file contains the GA_ACCOUNT variable , but replaces the standard GA - XXXXXX - X setup with MO - XXXXXX - X . I ’m assuming the MO - tells google that it ’s a mobile so accept the proxied requests .
One thing to keep in mind with this technique is that you cannot cache your rendered templates .
The image you server will necessarily have a different query string every time , and if you cached it , you would ruin your analytics .
Instead , you should cache nearly everything from your view functions , except the gaImgUrl variable .
This list is a response to the one published a couple of days ago with the topic of ’ 10 great moments ’ in American history .
A lot of people objected and asked for a list with ’ 10 worst moments ’ in American history .
So here it is , just to present both sides of American history , good & bad .
It is in chronological order and if you have any suggestions to make , feel free to do so & constructive criticism is appreciated while argument for the sake of arguing will not lead us anywhere .
Anyway , here it is :
1 The Trail of Tears 1838
The Trail of Tears was the relocation and movement of Native Americans , including many members of the Cherokee , Creek , Seminole , and Choctaw nations among others in the United States , from their homelands to Indian Territory ( present day Oklahoma ) in the Western United States .
The phrase originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831 .
Many Native Americans suffered from exposure , disease , and starvation while en route to their destinations , and many died , including 4,000 of the 15,000 relocated Cherokee .
By 1837 , 46,000 Native Americans from these southeastern nations had been removed from their homelands thereby opening 25 million acres for settlement by European Americans
2 The Dred Scott Decision 1857
The Dred Scott Decision was a decision by the United States Supreme Court that ruled that people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves , or their descendants — whether or not they were slaves — were not protected by the Constitution and could never be citizens of the United States .
It also held that the United States Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories .
The Court also ruled that because slaves were not citizens , they could not sue in court .
Lastly , the Court ruled that slaves — as chattel or private property — could not be taken away from their owners without due process .
3 The battle of Antietam 1862
The battle of Antietam , fought on September 17 , 1862 , near Sharpsburg , Maryland , and Antietam Creek , as part of the Maryland Campaign , was the first major battle in the American Civil War to take place on Northern soil .
It was the bloodiest single - day battle in American history , with about 23,000 casualties .
The Union had 12,401 casualties with 2,108 dead .
Confederate casualties were 10,318 with 1,546 dead .
This represented 25 % of the Federal force and 31 % of the Confederate .
More Americans died on September 17 , 1862 , than on any other day in the nation ’s military history .
Several generals died as a result of the battle , including Maj. Gens. Joseph K. Mansfield , Israel B. Richardson and Brig. Gen. Isaac P. Rodman on the Union side ( all mortally wounded ) , and Brig .
Gens. Lawrence O. Branch , William E. Starke on the Confederate side ( killed ) .
4 The Stock Market Crash 1929
A massive drop in value of the stock market helped trigger the Great Depression which lasted until the increased economic activity spurred by WW2 got us going back in the right direction .
The Great Depression had devastating effects in virtually every country , rich and poor .
Personal income , tax revenue , profits and prices dropped , and international trade plunged by a half to two - thirds .
Unemployment in the United States rose to 25 % and in some countries rose as high as 33 % .
Cities all around the world were hit hard , especially those dependent on heavy industry .
Construction was virtually halted in many countries .
Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60 percent .
5 Interment Camps 1942
The US government came to the conclusion that interning Japanese - American citizens was the best of a number of bad options .
Roughly a hundred thousand Japanese - Americans ended up in camps .
U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066 on February 19 , uprooting Japanese Americans on the west coast to be sent to Internment camps .
The order led to the internment of Japanese Americans or AJAs ( Americans of Japanese Ancestry ) in which some 120,000 ethnic Japanese people were held in internment camps for the duration of the war .
Of the Japanese interned , 62 % were Nisei ( American - born , second - generation Japanese American and therefore American citizens ) or Sansei ( third - generation Japanese American , also American citizens ) and the rest were Issei ( Japanese immigrants and resident aliens , first - generation Japanese American ) .
6 Dropping of the Bomb 1945
A decision was taken to drop atomic bombs on Japanese civilians killing roughly 200,000 people in total to ‘ shorten ’ the war .
( It completely ignored the fact that war is between armies , not civilians ) .
On Monday , August 6 , 1945 , at 8:15 AM , the nuclear bomb ‘ Little Boy ’ was dropped on Hiroshima by an American B - 29 bomber , the Enola Gay , directly killing an estimated 80,000 people .
By the end of the year , injury and radiation brought total casualties to 90,000 - 140,000 .
Approximately 69 % of the city ’s buildings were completely destroyed , and about 7 % severely damaged .
On August 9 , 1945 , Nagasaki was the target of the world ’s second atomic bomb attack ( and second plutonium bomb ; the first was tested in New Mexico , USA ) at 11:02 a.m. , when the north of the city was destroyed and an estimated 40,000 people were killed by the bomb nicknamed “ Fat Man . ”
According to statistics found within Nagasaki Peace Park , the death toll from the atomic bombing totaled 73,884 , as well as another 74,909 injured , and another several hundred thousand diseased and dying due to fallout and other illness caused by radiation .
7 Bay of Pigs 1961
Kennedy ’s decision to go forward with the invasion and then deny them air support doomed the entire enterprise to failure .
Today , 44 years later , Fidel Castro , a diehard enemy of the United States , is still in power .
The plan was launched in April 1961 , less than three months after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency in the United States .
The Cuban armed forces , trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations , defeated the exile combatants in three days .
Bad Cuban - American relations were made worse by the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis .
The invasion is often criticized as making Castro even more popular , adding nationalistic sentiments to the support for his economic policies .
Following the initial attacks by 8 CIA - owned B - 26s on Cuban airfields , he declared the revolution “ Marxist - Leninist ” .
There are still yearly nationwide drills in Cuba during the ‘ Dia de la Defensa ’ ( Defense Day ) to prepare the population for an invasion .
8 Vietnam 1960s
The United States entered the war to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment .
Military advisors arrived , beginning in 1950 .
U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s , with U.S. troop levels tripling in 1961 and tripling again in 1962 .
The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities , including 3 to 4 million Vietnamese from both sides , 1.5 to 2 million Laotians and Cambodians , and 58,159 U.S. soldiers .
The Case - Church Amendment , passed by the U.S. Congress in response to the anti-war movement , prohibited direct U.S. military involvement after August 15 , 1973 .
U.S. military and economic aid continued until 1975 .
The capture of Saigon by North Vietnamese army in April 1975 marked the end of Vietnam War. North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year .
9 9/11 2001
Terrorist madmen attack the Twin Towers and Pentagon , kill nearly 3000 Americans , and set off a war on terrorism .
( Some accounts suggest it was an inside job , or a horrific case of neglect ) .
Afghanistan invaded to destroy the groups ( Taliban & al Qaeda ) America itself made , trained & armed to fight the Russian invasion .
The campaign is still going on and has spilled into neighboring Pakistan , India & Iran , highlighting the inability of American forces to contain the war .
The initial attack removed the Taliban from power , but Taliban forces have since regained some strength .
T he war has been less successful in achieving the goal of restricting al - Qaeda ’s movement than anticipated .
Since 2006 , Afghanistan has seen threats to its stability from increased Taliban - led insurgent activity , record - high levels of illegal drug production , and a fragile government with limited control outside of Kabul
10 Iraq 2003
The ‘ Invasion of Iraq ’ on the basis of alleged reports saying Iraq possesses WMD’s .
Nothing found but hundreds of thousands of lives shattered .
Bush later admitted that “ [ my ] biggest regret of the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq .
In 2005 , the Central Intelligence Agency released a report saying that no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq .
The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some traditional U.S. allies , including France , Germany , New Zealand , and Canada .
Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of WMD and that invading Iraq was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC ’s February 12 , 2003 report .
On February 15 , 2003 , a month before the invasion , there were many worldwide protests against the Iraq war , including a rally of three million people in Rome , which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally .
According to the French academic Dominique Reynié , between January 3 and April 12 , 2003 , 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war , but the decision remained & Iraq was invaded .
+ McCarthyism
McCarthyism is the politically motivated practice of making accusations of disloyalty , subversion , or treason without proper regard for evidence .
Originally coined to criticize the anti-communist pursuits of U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy , “ McCarthyism ” soon took on a broader meaning , describing the excesses of similar efforts .
During the post–World War II era of McCarthyism , many thousands of Americans were accused of being Communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private - industry panels , committees and agencies .
Many people suffered loss of employment , destruction of their careers , and even imprisonment .
Historian Ellen Schrecker wrote that “ in this country , McCarthyism did more damage to the constitution than the American Communist Party ever did . ”
The Lowell High School student newspaper published Friday included an advertisement for a white supremacist Web site , reportedly paid for by a group promoting a " campaign to inform , awaken and radicalize our White American youth . "
The site , www.victoryforever.com, features " white resistance music " as well as T - shirts , stickers and links to similar sites .
The ad in The Lowell said " Free Music Downloads " and included the Web site address in a small box below an Arby 's ad inside the paper .
The school distributes the newspaper , the Lowell , once a month to its 2,600 students as well as subscribers through the mail .
The contents of the online site caught school officials by surprise .
They pulled all remaining copies of the paper and wo n't be mailing out subscription copies , said district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe .
The ad cost $ 30 .
It appears as if the ad's creators attempted to deceive school faculty and students .
The Web link in the ad looked dramatically different Friday than it did prior to when the ad ran .
Internet records show that on Nov. 4 the Web site included an innocuous page offering music by independent artists , including an African American man , and links for music that went nowhere .
There was no hint of white supremacist views .
That cached version was removed from Internet archives late Friday afternoon .
The newspaper 's two faculty advisers said they took the " deceptive and misleading " ad at face value and never checked the Web site , Blythe said .
" If they had seen what it is , they would have worked with their student editors and made the determination that it was not appropriate content for the paper , " she said .
" We are appalled . "
An anonymous e-mail containing several misspellings and grammatical errors reportedly from the Web site 's authors sent to local media said the advertisements were placed in student newspapers across the country to appear Friday and would be running through next week " and in the future . "
" San Francisco was selected because it has long suffered the ravages of liberal insanity , vile degeneracy and criminal vicitmization of it's citzens by the very ' diverse ' populations it seeks to embrace , " according to an e-mail sent separately to The Chronicle .
The e-mails appeared to originate at a computer at Idaho State University .
There 's very little that 's more depressing to me than the first $ % #@ing Christmas carol of November .
Hackers can exploit a flaw in Adobe 's Flash to compromise nearly every Web site that allows users to upload content , including Google 's Gmail , then launch silent attacks on visitors to those sites , security researchers said today .
Adobe did not dispute the researchers ' claims , but said that Web designers and administrators have a responsibility to craft their applications and sites to prevent such attacks .
" The magnitude of this is huge , " said Mike Murray , the chief information security officer at Orlando , Fla. - based Foreground Security .
" Any site that allows user - uploadable content is vulnerable , and most are not configured to prevent this . "
The problem lies in the Flash ActionScript same - origin policy , which is designed to limit a Flash object 's access to other content only from the domain it originated from , added Mike Bailey , a senior security researcher at Foreground .
Unfortunately , said Bailey , if an attacker can deposit a malicious Flash object on a Web site -- through its user - generated content capabilities , which typically allow people to upload files to the site or service -- they can execute malicious scripts in the context of that domain .
" This is a frighteningly bad thing , " Bailey said .
" How many Web sites allow users to upload files of some sort ?
How many of those sites serve files back to users from the same domain as the rest of the application ?
Nearly every one of them is vulnerable . "
Bailey , who demonstrated how attackers could compromise a Web site and attack users in a post today on Foreground 's blog , outlined how a hacker would leverage the Flash flaw .
" It 's relatively simple , " he maintained .
" All they need to do is create a malicious Flash object , and upload it to the [ Web ] server . "
He used the example of a company that lets users upload content to a message forum to explain the process .
" If the user forum lets people upload an image for their avatar , someone could upload a malicious Flash file that looks like an avatar image , " Bailey said .
" Anyone who then views that avatar would be vulnerable to attack . "
Adobe has told Foreground that the flaw is " unpatchable , " Murray and Bailey said .
Instead , Adobe is trying to educate site administrators to close the hole on their end .
But they 've not had much success .
Brad Arkin , Adobe 's director for product security and privacy , agreed that the problem can't be solved with a patch to Flash .
" We see this as a generic problem that affects any site that allows active scripting , not just Flash , but things like JavaScript and Silverlight as well .
Even if Flash figured out some magical safeguard , this would be true for all active content sites that allow users to upload files . "
Instead , Arkin added , Adobe has tried to get the word out to Web application designers and site administrators about the danger of allowing users to upload content .
" Sites should not allow user uploads to a trusted domain , " Arkin argued .
" The real issue here is that developers should be cautious about using techniques that can be misused maliciously .
In general , this is a general challenge in managing active content . "
Bailey and Murray echoed that , but said most sites have n't taken that advice .
" Some of the big Web properties have figured this out , " said Bailey .
" In a lot of cases , they 're hosting user - generated content on another domain , perhaps for performance reasons . "
Among those site and services that have locked down their servers , Foreground cited Microsoft 's Windows Live Hotmail and Google 's YouTube .
" But very few system administrators are even aware of this , " Bailey added .
Even some of Adobe 's Web properties are vulnerable to such an attack .
" How can Adobe expect others to protect themselves when they can't do it themselves ? " asked Murray .
Google 's Gmail is also at risk from malicious Flash attack -- Gmail lets users upload and download file attachments -- although Bailey said that exploiting Google 's Web mail service would be " extremely tricky " with " lots of hoops to jump through . "
Although Foreground has not detected any in - the - wild attacks using the technique , Murray said that there 's evidence hackers are moving toward such tactics .
" We 're starting to see Flash used in these ways , " he said , and cited a recent worm that leveraged a similar vulnerability in Adobe 's software , which is pervasive on the Web and on users ' machines .
" The worst - case scenario is that someone would figure this out , and launch silent attacks against the entire Internet . "
That fear was a major consideration in Foreground 's decision to go public with its information , even though Adobe can't fix the problem with a global patch of some sort .
" We went back and forth on this a whole lot , " said Murray .
The only current defense users can employ against such attacks is to stop using Flash , or failing that , restrict its use to sites known to be safe with tools such as the NoScript add - on for Mozilla 's Firefox , or ToggleFlash for Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
" The best mitigation is to not use Flash , " argued Murray , " but we know that that 's impossible for most users , since Flash is so widely used on the Web . "
" Almost everyone using the Internet is vulnerable to a Web site that allows content to be updated inappropriately , " said Murray .
" That 's not hyperbole , it 's just fact .
This has the potential to affect any social media site , any career site , any dating site , many retail sites and many cloud applications .
That 's why this attack is so serious .
End users would never know they got exploited . "
Adobe was not immediately available for comment .
Former vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin has joined leading national Republican figures in rejecting the party 's nomination for this year 's congressional election in a northern New York state in favour of a fiercely conservative third - party candidate .
The local Republican party nominated Dede Scozzafava , a moderate , pro-choice candidate who backs same - sex marriage , to stand for the seat .
But Palin and other high - profile Republicans are backing a businessman , Doug Hoffman , running on the ticket of the Conservative party , leading many to question whether the party 's leaders have lost touch with rank - and - file voters .
Scozzafava 's positions on social issues and support for some Democratic causes have won her enmity from the increasingly hard - right national party .
" Unfortunately , the Republican party today has decided to choose a candidate that more than blurs the lines , " Palin said last week .
" There is no real difference between the Democrat and the Republican in this race . "
The endorsement indicates that many in the national party are more interested in ideological correctness than party affiliation .
They have irritated local Republican leaders who say support for Hoffman , who calls himself the real Republican in the race , will split the conservative vote and hand the election to the Democratic party candidate , Bill Owens , an attorney and retired air force captain .
The split illustrates a continuing debate over the future of the opposition party .
Republican activists have driven most moderates and social liberals from the national party in recent years , and its power base has shrunk to the south - eastern and great plains states .
• This article was amended on 26 October 2009 .
The original said that Republican voters nominated Dede Scozzafava .
This has been clarified .
Microsoft today unveiled a preview of its new MSN website , publicly viewable over at preview.msn.com .
The new site , which the software giant is touting as " its most significant homepage redesign in over a decade " will become broadly available in the US early next year .
Microsoft 's number one website will soon come with a new MSN butterfly logo ( which is supposed to be complementary to the Bing logo , hint : notice the font ) , a larger Bing search box and more integration with the search engine , local information from a new feature dubbed MSN Local Edition , as well as the addition of three social network streams : the Windows Live " What 's New " feed of course , Facebook , and Twitter .
We had a chance to talk to Lisa Gurry , Senior Director of MSN , to find out exactly what the company is showing off in the preview , and what else is yet to come .
The biggest change you 'll notice with the new MSN homepage is how much cleaner it looks , and that 's not just because it ditches the blue background for a white one .
Microsoft claims that the new site has 50 percent fewer links than the previous homepage .
If you look at them side - by - side ( old , new ) , you 'll see that this is definitely true .
This change comes with a downside , however , as most of the links are now in the following six categories : News , Entertainment , Sports , Money , Lifestyle , and More .
That means that while the page is much cleaner , it 's an extra click to get to most of the links available on the page .
Microsoft claims that it performed extensive customer research to find that people want less clutter and easier access to information and services they care about , and this is the result of their findings .
According to Gurry , the inline videos that appear in some of these categories and elsewhere throughout the site , will by default use Flash .
They will show higher - quality Silverlight videos if Microsoft 's plugin is installed on the user 's computer ( to be implemented later next year , if it has n't been already ) .
That said , there will also be a Silverlight App Bar that will arrive next year , which will ask to install Silverlight .
The tabbed approach
Microsoft took a while to embrace tabs in Internet Explorer ( and still has n't in Windows Live Messenger by the way ) , but the company has had information split into tabs on its websites for years .
Now though , they 've gone tab - crazy with the new MSN .
It seems that every module on the new site has tabs , even Hotmail , which only has one tab and does n't appear to give any option to add other e-mail services as tabs .
The new homepage continues to pull news and entertainment information from sources such as MSNBC , FOX Sports , Hulu , and Hearst .
Again , all this information is categorized into tabs .
Also , Microsoft is making sure to add a Bing search bar to every module that could possibly have a use for it .
It 's especially prominent in areas that Bing particularly excels at : shopping , travel , and local , but also with the ones it 's not particularly exceptional with : highlighting hot topics , trends , and people .
Customization is dead and speed is king
While Gurry did n't put it as bluntly as that , she did say " our research has shown us that the larger majority of users do n't want to take the time to customize their homepage . "
As such , none of the modules you see on the homepage can be removed : they can only be hidden .
Yes , the new MSN homepage is pretty much against customization .
In fact , the " Customize " tab in the top right is going to be renamed to " Settings . "
It has links to tour the new homepage , turn off Autosuggest , learn about search suggestions , change the font size , and access the MSN Directory , MyMSN , and MSN Latino .
So what 's Microsoft doing after cutting down on the customization options ?
It 's automating what content is shown to the user ( " personally relevant information " Microsoft calls it ) .
Over time , the new MSN website will learn what type of links you click on and will start choosing headlines for you based on the data it gathers .
The headlines will also be presented in a tabbed format : Latest , News , Sports , TV & Movies , Money , Games , and Featured .
However , these tabs will be programmable by the editor team , Gurry told us , so when the Olympics are happening , for example , there will be an Olympics tab , and say on the weekend , it will be more likely for there to be an Entertainment tab , and so on .
The MSN Local Edition seemed to be the feature that Gurry was most proud about , but we 're not particularly excited as it's US - only .
It aggregate local news , weather , sports , movies & events , restaurants , traffic & gas , into one place , sure , but it will be US - only at launch .
The information it gathers is based off Bing ( which limits many of its features to the US ) and other content partners .
Microsoft noted that the real - time community information provided is grouped by ZIP code .
Despite the cleaner look , the site seems to have much more functionality , so we wanted to know how the new site performs , compared to the old one .
" It 's designed to be significantly faster , " Gurry told Ars .
" We do n't have any metrics right now . "
She did say that Microsoft might release some of the data once the new site is finalized and goes live in early 2010 .
Gurry did agree with us that speed was important nowadays and that the team had made sure to pay particular attention to this area .
Finally , Microsoft also took the opportunity to pat itself on the back for doing so great with the MSN website .
The software giant used various sources to conclude that nearly 100 million people in the US visit MSN every single month , the site added over 10 million new customers in the last year alone , and that overall 600 million monthly use MSN .
" At the end of the day , our goal is to supply the best homepage on the Web , " Gurry told Ars .
" We expect to roll out several new features over the next few months . "

It was astonishing intellectual bravado – and utterly duplicitous .
David Cameron has taken 15 years of thinking on the left – Naomi Klein , Zygmunt Bauman , Richard Layard , Richard Sennett among others – and put the whole back catalogue on its head .
The critique of our present atomised , individualistic , fragmented lives was all there .
As Cameron lamented , what matters most is " our personal journey and our right to pursue our own happiness regardless of others around us " .
But having hijacked the leftwing analysis , he stripped out every reference to the corroding force of a free market economic system predicated on persuading us of a good life defined purely in terms of material goods because " we are worth it " .
He resolutely ignored the billions poured into an advertising and marketing industry that grooms us to believe in our own sense of entitlement .
In the place of this powerful amalgam of economic and cultural imperatives which have insisted that the individual 's primary purpose is the fulfilment of their own desires , who does Cameron blame but , unbelievably , the state .
It is all the fault of the beleaguered , derided public sector painfully trying to hold together basic standards of decency and social solidarity .
Who can he be thinking of ?
Replace his frequent and dismissive references to the " big state " and think instead of thousands of teachers trying every day to tell children to share , and respect each other , thousands of nurses trying to care for the frightened and frail , or thousands of park keepers and street cleaners trying to create liveable environments .
It is all their fault .
Yes , we can agree with Cameron that " obligation and duty are in danger of becoming dead concepts " ; yes , we can offer a cheer for his call for a " broad culture of responsibility , mutuality and obligation " ; but how dare he insult our intelligence to suggest that the blame for our ills lies at the door of millions of hard - working employees of the state .
It is this yoking of legitimate concerns to spurious diagnosis which infuriates .
This is a nonsense : European countries whose standards of welfare and education we most admire fully recognise that such common goods are expensive and complex to deliver effectively .
Try suggesting to the deeply civic Scandinavians that their " big " state erodes responsibility and they will choke ; how can Cameron be suggesting that the expansion of state services in the UK since 1997 has eroded my sense of responsibility ?
Strip out the references to shibboleths on the left such as the recent admirable work on inequality , The Spirit Level , and you find Thatcherism written into every paragraph of this speech .
" The state undermines personal responsibility " is an old theme ; Norman Tebbit was more blunt – " get on your bike , " he told the unemployed .
Or take another paragraph on the need to redistribute power and control from the central state to individuals and local communities .
That took me straight back to 1988 to an interview by Hugo Young with Kenneth Baker , then education secretary ; I was the lowly television researcher and I listened bemused to Baker waxing lyrical on how their government was pushing power back to the people , using the metaphor of a wheel .
Power pushed from the hub out to the rim .
Afterwards I asked Hugo : what about the spokes – how can a wheel hold together without them ?
He generously took on the idea , agreeing that the spokes are the institutions , the vital structures by which power is channelled effectively from the rim to the hub as well as back again .
Yet here we are , 21 years on , and still Conservativism shows no understanding of the importance of institutions in fostering the culture of mutuality .
For all Cameron 's forelock - tugging at friendly societies and the self - improving institutions of working - class life , his predecessors did more to smash those ethics of responsibility and solidarity than any previous government .
The irony of this extraordinarily incoherent speech is that in the end Cameron describes a state that sounds uncannily like the one he proposes to dismantle .
He tilts at windmills , knocks down his fictional state and erects this energetic , catalytic , galvanising state in its place .
If New Labour 's was a nanny state , this is a pester power state : not a lot of difference .
ST ANDREWS , Scotland ( Reuters ) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Saturday stressed the necessity of keeping global economic stimulus in place until recovery is assured and opposed the utility of a tax on financial transactions as a way to dampen risky bank behavior .
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling ( R ) chats with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner as they gather for the family photo at the G20 Finance Ministers meeting at a hotel in St. Andrews , Scotland , November 7 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Andrew Winning
Speaking at the conclusion of a two - day meeting of Group of 20 finance minister and central bankers , Geithner said there was broad agreement that “ growth remains the dominant policy imperative across our economies . ”
He said high U.S. unemployment , which hit a 26 - 1/2 - year high at 10.2 percent of the civilian workforce in October , highlighted a “ very tough economic environment ” that will a period of sustained growth to correct .
Earlier , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown had suggested that the G20 should levy on banks -- blamed for the excessive risk - taking that led the world into a now - easing financial crisis -- and used the proceeds to fund future bailouts .
Geithner played down that idea , noting that the Obama administration was already pushing an overhaul of financial market rules in Congress that would ensure that banks pay the costs of their failures in future from their own pocket .
“ A day - by - day financial transaction tax is not something we are prepared to support , ” Geithner said in an interview with Sky News .
In his concluding press conference , Geithner was asked repeatedly to say why he opposed such a tax on banks and indicated he doubted its effectiveness .
“ This idea ( of a bank transaction tax ) has been around for a long time ... I think frankly the experiences are mixed , ” he said , expressing an American view that there was no widespread backing for such a tax .
Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty was similarly skeptical .
“ It ’s one of the ideas that ’s on the table , but is not particularly attractive to me as finance minister of Canada .
We have been a government that has been reducing taxes , ” Flaherty said .
ON DANGEROUS GROUND
Geithner ’s key message was that recovery still remains on perilous ground and that it was too soon to discuss the timing for removing the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus that countries around the world have poured into their economies .
“ Government policy has to provide a bridge to growth led by the private sector , ” he said .
“ We ’re now in the middle span of that bridge . ”
That meant policymakers must move cautiously in trying to bring down huge budget deficits without choking off chances for growth led by consumer spending and business investment .
“ If we put the brakes on too quickly we will weaken the economy and the financial system , unemployment will rise , more businesses will fail , budget deficits will rise , and the ultimate cost of the crisis will be greater , ” Geithner said .
“ It ’s too early to start to lean against recovery . ”
The G20 includes key emerging - market countries like China , Brazil and South Korea as well as rich industrial nations and Geithner was asked about complaints among some members that China ’s policy of managing its yuan currency ’s value narrowly was hurting efforts to rebalance global growth .
He conceded a more flexible Chinese currency would be “ helpful ” but continued the Obama administration ’s practice of cooling the rhetoric toward Beijing over its currency .
The U.S. Treasury chief returned to Washington on Saturday night but leaves again on Monday for a visit to Tokyo next Tuesday and Wednesday followed by a stop in Singapore where he will attend a session of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum for one day next Thursday .

On their respective radio shows today Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh went on the attack against Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) because she voted for advancing the healthcare debate forward in the Senate .
Instead of criticizing her position on the bill , both Beck and Limbaugh took the lowest possible road by calling a female US senator a prostitute .
Here is the audio of Beck courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Beck accused the Senate Democratic leadership of bribing Landrieu to get her vote on healthcare , “ We ’re with a high class prostitute .
That ’s what we ’re with …
You ’re not sittin ’ there in a back alley and sayin ’ hey what do you say , five bucks ?
No , no , no this comes to your Four Seasons hotel room and does it right .
There ’s nobody that ’s going to look at her and say oh my gosh you ’re with a whore … ”
Here is the audio of Limbaugh , also from Media Matters :
Limbaugh said , “ That may be folks , that may be , the most expensive prostitute in the history of prostitution , and she ’s bragging about it .
Mary Landrieu bragging about a $ 300 million payoff from Dingy Harry to get her vote on this healthcare scam on Saturday night . ”
The “ prostitution ” that Beck and Limbaugh are so outraged by is actually a grant to help the state of Louisiana cover Medicaid costs for the poor .
The notion that Landrieu herself is benefitting from this deal is completely false .
It is convenient for Beck and Limbaugh to also forget that these kinds of deals were common place when Republicans were in the majority .
The Republicans frequently used both grants and tax breaks for corporations and industries in specific states to sway votes .
The idea that Mary Landrieu is a whore is strictly sexism .
How would Beck and Limbaugh react if their beloved Sarah Palin was labeled a whore and a prostitute because she decided to quit the post that the votes of Alaska elected her to in order to sell books and make money ?
They would be outraged by the notion that Palin is a whore , but it is fine for them to call a sitting US Senator , who got funding for the poor in her state , a whore .
If Mary Landrieu was a man , would she still have been called a whore ?
I doubt it .
This sexist attitude is one of the reasons why the GOP is going to continue to struggle to attract a majority of female voters .
There are lots of conservative women out there , but many Independent and Democratic women are pushed away by such sexist rhetoric , at a time when the Republican Party needs to attract more voters , instead of pushing them away .
The video is available in at least two places on YouTube , and between them they have received over 300,000 views at the time of writing .
Watching Tuesday ’s three - way meeting in New York between President Obama , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas -- and the administration ’s effort to spin it into a success -- reminded me that when breakthroughs in Arab - Israeli peacemaking come , they come with unforeseen and unpredictable urgency driven by big men and big events .
Today we have neither , just the prospects of a long , hard slog -- a thousand days of root canals created for the would - be mediator by Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are prisoners , rather than masters , of their political worlds , and by gaps on the core issues , such as Jerusalem , that are galactic in scale .
In the middle sits a potentially transformative American president who somehow hopes to compensate for their absence of leadership with his own strength and vision .
Having spent the better part of a quarter of a century as a negotiator working on the Arab - Israeli conflict , I know how easy it is for longtime observers to get cynical about the prospects for peace .
But that ’s unfair ; after all , the wheel turns , and with it comes a new administration , new circumstances and new ideas that can sometimes lead to movement in an all - too - often stagnant process .
Still , when William Faulkner wrote that “ the past is never dead ; it ’s not even past , ” he cautioned all of us to respect history ’s power .
And history , when it comes to the Arabs and Israelis , is worth pondering .
It teaches that only when the regional table is set with the realities of pain and gain can America , pursuing relentless and reassuring diplomacy , forge agreements between the two sides .

It was the 1973 war , for instance , that allowed Henry Kissinger to use crisis , pressure and incentives to broker three disengagement agreements in 18 months ; it was Jimmy Carter , rescued by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ’s extraordinary trip to Jerusalem in 1977 , who brokered an Egyptian - Israeli peace treaty .
And it was Iraq ’s August 1990 invasion of Kuwait that triggered Operation Desert Storm and opened the way for James Baker ’s tough and smart diplomacy that compelled three strong but recalcitrant leaders ( Yitzhak Shamir , Hafez Assad and Yasser Arafat ) to send their negotiating teams to Madrid in October 1991 .
The challenge , of course , for the Obama administration is that it lacks the stuff of which Arab - Israeli breakthroughs are made , particularly the leaders who must make the tough decisions .
On the West Bank , a Palestinian Humpty Dumpty offers itself up as a prospective peace partner for Israel .
Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad are good , reasonable men who know that history compels them to do pragmatic diplomacy .
But although they have the incentive to make peace with Israel , they do not have the power .
Hamas , on the other hand , has a different understanding of history ’s long arc .
Consequently , it has the power but not the incentive to settle with Israel .
Empowering Abbas makes sense on paper , but it is beyond the capacity of this Israeli government or even the United States .
To do so would require Israel to adopt a real freeze on settlements and to take positions in negotiations that meet Palestinian national aspirations , including parting with half of Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital .
And even if the Israelis were to promise all this , they might well be making concessions to a Palestinian partner who lacked a monopoly over the legitimate forces of violence in Palestinian society and did n’t control all of the guns .
Can any Palestinian leader really recognize Israel and accept it as a state of the Jews and also provide the security guarantees to allay its existential concerns ?
Israel ’s fears run deep .
“ We fight the Arabs during the day and win , ” goes an Israeli saying , “ and fight the Nazis at night and lose . ”

In Israel , meanwhile , a different battle rages within a deeply divided and rudderless society .
Israel is burdened by history and shackled by a settlement enterprise it may not be able to escape ; it is uncertain still about what price it is prepared to pay on Jerusalem , territory and refugees to end its conflict with the Palestinians .
The prime minister himself is a reflection of this terrible ambivalence .
The part of him that is a tough , suspicious Likud Party pol wrestles with the part of him that aspires to greatness and to lead Israel out of the shadow of the Iranian bomb to a lasting peace with the Arabs .
Which will win -- the surviving politician or the risk - ready statesman ?
Even he does n’t know .
They say an Israeli prime minister sleeps with one eye open ; this one is sleeping with two eyes open wide .
It ’s against this grim backdrop that Obama , the transformer , seeks to leave his mark .
Smart and savvy , he knows that governing is about choosing , about setting priorities .
Given all the other battles he ’s waging at the same time , the smart money is on his taking the easy road , the small deal , managing the Arab - Israeli issue , maybe nudging into being a Palestinian state with provisional borders .
But who knows ?
Maybe the president will conclude that it ’s worth taking a crack at breaking the Arab - Israeli impasse ; maybe an American vision is in store on borders , Jerusalem , security and refugees , and a package of security guarantees and real normalization with the Arabs to make it worth Israel ’s while .
Indeed , perhaps the president sees that the kind of good fortune that smiled on Kissinger , Carter and Baker wo n’t rescue America this time around , and that if he hopes to achieve what now seems unimaginable -- a conflict - ending Israeli - Palestinian solution -- he ’ll have to make his own breaks through tough , fair and reassuring diplomacy .

Homöopathie kann man an der Uni Magdeburg studieren und der Staat findet nichts daran , Menschen zu Astrologen auszubilden auf das sie in Zukunft von ihren Kunden echtes Geld für falsche Versprechungen verlangen dürfen .

ATLANTA --
In the waning days of the Great Recession , the federal government is still jumpstarting the economy and propping up financial markets .
It is also trying to sell Dresden Heights , a failed condo development on a noisy freeway ramp next to a Motel 6 , a Waffle House and a Do - It - Yourself Pest Control .

This post is about using GHC ’s rewrite rules engine to implement really really cheap type class instance resolution at compile time .
Have fun , and remember :
Those who would give up essential type safety , to purchase a little temporary liberty , deserve neither liberty nor type safety .
Haskell type classes are a powerful technique for bounded parametric polymorphism .
Consider the type class Eq :
class
Eq a where ( == ) , ( /= ) :: a -> a ->
Bool x /= y = not ( x == y ) x == y = not ( x /= y )
This defines the ( == ) and ( /= ) equality operators , and gives some default implementations ( that mean we need only define one of the two to get both functions ) .
Now , equality only makes sense on a bounded set of types — not all types support it .
Now , we can add a type to the set of types that support equality by writing an instance of Eq for it .
For example , with Floats , we can define equality in terms of primitive machine equality on floats :
instance Eq Float where ( F # x ) == ( F # y ) = x ` eqFloat # ` y
Or for unbounded integers , in terms of the GMP integer routines :
instance Eq Integer where ( == ) = gmp_eqInteger ( /= ) = gmp_neqInteger
So now we can write :
main = do print ( pi == exp 1 ) print ( 42 == 43 1 )
And everything works nicely .
We get to reuse the same symbol , ( == ) , for equality on any types that support it .
Now , type classes desugar to dictionaries , in GHC , passing the instance methods around .
That is ,
( == ) :: a -> a ->
Bool
Becomes :
( == ) :: EqDict a -> a -> a ->
Bool
where the dictionary stores the equality function to use when testing ‘a ’s for equality .
And when the type for ‘ a ’ is known statically , GHC usually does the right thing , and resolves it statically .
What is n’t widely known is that we can hack our own static dispatch system together in GHC , using the compiler ’s term rewriting capabilities — known as rewrite rules .
These are described in the paper “ Playing by the rules : Rewriting as a practical optimization technique in GHC ” .
First , to turn on rewrite rule syntax , enable - fglasgow - exts :
{-# OPTIONS - fglasgow - exts #-}
Now , we need to define the type class operation we want to overload :
class MEEq a where ( =-= ) :: a -> a ->
Bool
We ’ll just define the type here , no concrete default implementation .
The next thing to do is to tell the compiler which types we are going to have support ( =-= ) :
instance MEEq ( ) instance MEEq Bool instance MEEq Int
Now this is a bit evil , since there ’s still no concrete implementation of equality on any of these types .
So if you tried to use the code at this point it would fail .
Now , we ’ll write some standalone implementations of equality on these types .
This code would normally go in a instance body , but we ’ll just have them float free :
eq_Bool :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool eq_Bool True True = True eq_Bool False False = True eq_Bool _ _ = False eq_Unit :: ( ) -> ( ) -> Bool eq_Unit ( ) ( ) = True
Ok .
So we could write :
main = print ( True `eq_Bool` False )
But that does n’t let us do any overloading .
What we need is a way to spot ( =-= ) and have the compiler replace it with the appropriate function , based on the method type .
And we can do this .
GHC supports rewrite rules , which are used for a wide range of compile time optimizations , including sophisticated data structure transformations .
Normally , rewrite rules are used to match on a name , and replace the left hand side with some new right hand side .
For example ,
Is the rule for map fusion , replacing two traversals of a list with one .
A less used feature is the ability to match on an expression ’s type on either the left or right hand side of a rewrite rule ( the left and right hand sides must have the same type ) .
This let ’s us trivially encode compile - time instance resolution :
So , whenever you see ( = - = ) at Bool or ( ) type , replace it with the concrete implementation .
Overloading resolution , statically , for free .
The slight downside is that if the rule fails to fire , there ’s no concrete implementation of ( = - = ) to fall back on at runtime .
So you ’ll get a runtime failure :-)
We can see this in action with :
main = do print $ True =-= False print $ ( ) =-= ( ) print $ 7 =-= ( 8 :: Int )
We can compile this code , and check the optimizer did the right thing with ghc -core :
$ ghc- core A.hs ... 2 RuleFired 1 eq / Bool 1 eq / Unit ...
Excellent , the rules fired for Bool and Unit , replacing the abstract ( =-= ) with its concrete implementation .
Running the resulting code :
$ ./ a . out False True Class . hs : 10 : 0 : No instance nor default method for class operation Main .=-=
And all is good , well , except for the Int , which was n’t resolved , since we did n’t write a rule for it .
We ’d like to recover the property that real type classes have — that it ’s a type error to use a type class method at a type other than those that support it .
Thanks to Gwern Branwen for suggesting we try this .
The problem is : we want to replace any remnant calls to ( = -= ) with an expression that will fail to compile .
However , we ’re strongly constrained by the rewrite rules system — rewrite rules must always be syntactically and type correct .
However , and this is the deliciously evil part , they do n’t need to be confluent or terminating .
So we can encode the missing instance type error as a non-terminating rewrite rule !
And then there ’s no risk of runtime failure — as the compiler wo n’t terminate :-)
We do this very simply , with the rule :
This simply replaces itself with itself forever .
Now , our type correct programs work as expected :
main = do print $ True =-= False print $ ( ) =-= ()
Results in :
$ ./ A False True
However , if we introduce an unresolved overloading :
main = do print $ True =-= False print $ ( ) =-= ( ) print $ 7 =-= ( 8 :: Int )
We get a “ type error ” :
$ ghc - O2 A.hs ^C
in the form of the compiler failed to terminate .
As all good Haskellers know , this is morally sound : one bottom is as good as another , so a type error is as good as a divergent compiler !
And well - typed programs are still not going to go wrong .
We can also encode the type error as a ( compile time ) linker failure , by replacing ( =-= ) with an unknown foreign symbol that we import irregardless .
Of course , this is very evil .
Rewrite rules are a powerful way for users to extend the optimization suite of the compiler , and they ’re made so by purity and static type information , enabling a richer set of possible transformations than would be possible otherwise .
Many Argentine veterans have faced great difficulties since the war
Seventy former Argentine army officers are accused of crimes against humanity for the alleged abuse , torture and , in one case , murder of their own troops during the 1982 war with Britain over the Falklands , or Malvinas , Islands .
As the BBC's Angus Crawford reports , the case has divided Argentina 's veteran community .
In 1982 , Michael Savage was a student doing his military service , part of a force sent to invade the Falkland islands by the dictatorship then in power in Argentina .
One morning on patrol , his platoon came across a front line position .
" It was the coldest day of the war and , in the white snow , we saw a soldier staked to the ground , he was dying , " he said .
I asked him who was responsible for staking out the young man .
He told me it was his own corporal .
During his time on the island he saw many of the conscripts treated in the same way .
They lived in tents in sub -zero temperatures , their officers refused to issue proper rations and , fearing starvation , they stole food .
If caught they were brutally punished .
It 's justice .
It 's very edifying for society to look the past in the eyes , for it never to happen again
Michael Savage
" The punishment was ' estaqueo ' - they would peg you to the ground and leave you crucified for hours , with minus 20 , rain and even shelling , " he said .
One evening Michael was caught by a corporal stealing a tin of meat .
" He made me kneel down , pointed his gun on my head and I was crying and begging for him not to shoot , " he recalled .
He cannot forgive his superiors for what they did .
" They were our worst enemies , torturing us physically and psychologically , " he said .
Devastating effects
After the brief war with Britain , Argentine forces were defeated , and soon after the dictatorship fell .
The conscripts were sent home and , according to Michael , no - one wanted to hear their stories .
" Society looked at us as part of the dictatorship , and the dictatorship looked at us as witnesses of a crime that had to be silenced , " he explained .
The brutality inflicted on civilians by the dictatorship was slowly revealed .
Some 30,000 people had disappeared .
But no - one wanted to hear the stories from the conscripts .
Mario Volpe is a veteran , and explains that the military used the law to silence them .
" I was wounded and in a hospital and they came to see me and made me sign a document in which they told me I could n't talk about anything that happened , " he said .
He said ordinary people treated them like heroes , the government did not .
According to Cecim , a support group for veterans , the lack of recognition had a devastating effect .
Some 60 % of veterans have no stable work , and many have problems with violence and alcohol .
More than 350 have killed themselves since 1982 .
' Time for justice ' Ernesto Alonso , the president of Cecim , says things have improved on the financial front , but much of it has come too late .
All the evidence which has been offered , not only will it not lead to legal satisfaction or the punishing of whoever committed the illegal act , it will also generate an enormous amount of frustration
Cesar Trejo
Committee for the Families of the Fallen " It 's like a medical emergency .
If the doctor gets there in the first 10 minutes he saves your life , after that the complications begin ... if they had tried to support us in the first 10 years things would have been different , " he said .
The silence about the abuse was only broken in 2005 , with the release of a feature film , Blessed by Fire .
It showed the Argentine public in graphic detail how the conscripts were treated - and led directly to a criminal investigation .
Now 70 former officers face charges of crimes against humanity .
Edgardo Esteban wrote the book on which the film was based .
" Now is the time for justice .
Without justice , it 's impossible to reclaim the story of the Malvinas and the heroes who were there and fought with dignity , " he said .
But not all veterans agree .
Cesar Trejo represents the Committee for the Families of the Fallen .
" All the evidence which has been offered , not only will it not lead to legal satisfaction or the punishing of whoever committed the illegal act , it will also generate an enormous amount of frustration , " he said .
He thinks some campaigners have a political axe to grind .
Two women waiting in his office also express doubts about the wisdom of the prosecutions .
" We gain nothing .
You have to look to the future and toward the present with love , if not we can't build anything , " one said .
The other agreed .
" I think that God must be the one to judge . "
Michael Savage sees it very differently .
" It 's justice .
It 's very edifying for society to look the past in the eyes , for it never to happen again . "

Another Murder in Russia ’s Secret War
A few weeks ago , I visited the home of Maksharip Aushev — the 43 - year - old scion of a wealthy and politically influential family in Ingushetia — on the night of his youngest son ’s wedding .
It was a festive occasion despite the unrest in Russia ’s volatile North Caucasus , and hundreds of relatives and friends danced in the courtyard of the brick mansion in Nazran .
But Aushev , a cousin of the former Ingush president , Ruslan Aushev , did not join in .
He felt more like talking to reporters about the epidemic of violence in his republic .
His eyes were dark and his face serious as he described the abductions of his nephew and son two years ago .
Aushev , a millionaire nicknamed the " Marble Magnate , " devoted his money and connections to raising protests throughout Ingushetia .
He hoped to spur the regional president at the time , Murat Zyazikov , to do everything he could to save his son from the separatist insurgents .
" My son was rescued from a secret jail in Chechnya , " Aushev told us .
" I decided I would lead the opposition and help relatives of all the other victims in the republic . "
As the wedding continued into the night , young men began to shoot Kalashnikovs into the sky in celebration .
Aushev continued to speak to us , blaming the federal security service and police for committing some of the abductions and murders .
He complained that the local president , " no matter how much we all like him , " did not have any power over the " bandits . "
Plus , he feared , corrupt bureaucrats had been paying the insurgents protection money , eroding any semblance of civil order in Ingushetia .
Later that night , Aushev walked out to the balcony to watch fireworks .
Sad and quiet , wearing a traditional Ingush black wool top hat , he stared into the distance without smiling .
" The rebel leaders charm the hearts of all young people in the republic , " he said .
The Kremlin could n’t possibly counter them .
Last Sunday morning , Aushev was shot dead while driving his car .
Aushev is the third person I ’ve interviewed in the past two years gunned down in cold blood in Ingushetia or one of its neighboring provinces , Dagestan and Chechnya .
All three regions are mostly Muslim , highly politically unstable , and lie near Russia ’s southern border with Georgia .
Violence is endemic , I know too well .
In July , for instance , thugs dragged Natalya Estemirova , an indomitable human rights activist , and a dear friend of mine , into a van .
She was later found riddled with bullets .
Whether anyone admits it , Ingushetia is a war zone .
In Ingushetia , Dagestan , and Chechnya , each a semi-autonomous area , radical separatists seek to destabilize the region .
They commit kidnappings , murders , summary executions , and bombings in spite of crackdowns and arrests .
They fight against Russian police and state forces , or , at least , the ones they have n’t infiltrated and corrupted .
In Ingushetia , the Kremlin has responded by appointing regional governors and sending police and military reinforcements .
( It ’s arguably worse in Chechnya , where the Kremlin sent in troops in the 1990s that only left this year . )
In 2002 , Moscow appointed Zyazikov , whose brutal crackdowns sometimes seemed worse than the violence he hoped to stem .
Unrest escalated , and last fall , President Dmitry Medvedev named Yunus - Bek Yevkurov president of the region instead .
This appointment pleased Aushev .
At the time , he had taken over the management of the opposition Web site , ingushetia.org , after the loss of his partner , Magomed Yevloyev — who died from an " accidental " wound to the head , according to official state publications , received while being driven in a police car after his arrest .
But seeing that the Kremlin was at least attempting to stop the escalating violence between the state and the insurgents — violence whose perpetrators seemed less and less easy to tell apart —
Aushev slowed down his opposition activity .
He hoped that Yevkurov ’s lighter hand would help slow down the killings and abductions .
Aushev also took a job as a human rights representative for the Kremlin .
Still , the secret war metastasized .
Yevkurov did nothing to stop it .
Bloody reports from Ingushetia , Dagestan and Chechnya continued to flood news wires .
At one point , Russia was losing more police officers and soldiers in these regions than the United States was losing troops in Iraq .
Then , in June , Yevkurov nearly died in an assassination attempt .
Soon after , a suicide bomber rammed a van into a five - story police station in the Ingush capital of Nazran , killing 20 and injuring 138 more .
Insurgents killed a judge and a former prime minister as well .
The law forces meant to stop this violence resorted to more bloody tactics in response .
Medvedev continued to hold that government was making process towards peace , a risible assertion .
Lyudmila Alexeyeva , the head of Moscow ’s Helsinki Group , feared that escalation might spur regional outbreaks of fighting .
" People stand against the state measures , as they see no signs of authorities improving their methods .
People are killed and kidnapped .
Our leaders do not like to admit their mistakes , " Alexeyeva told me .
" All they say is that things are beautiful in Russia — by their blind management they push these burning problems into the corner .
They risk that the problems will be out of control . "
All the while , young people in Ingushetia continued to join the insurgency , the best source of jobs in the region .
Magomed Mutsolgov , the head of human - rights group Mashr , which is headquartered in Karbulak , Ingushetia , agrees .
" People are pushed into a corner .
Their friends , relatives and opposition leaders are abducted or killed .
Many join the insurgency , as they see no alternative , " he told us , sitting in his office , which is lined with portrait photographs of the missing .
He notes that 175 people have been kidnapped or disappeared in the region since 2002 .
Mutsolgov himself has been threatened multiple times ; once , he was nearly gunned down outside of his house : " By killing us they would not mute people , as there are hundreds of relatives willing to pay revenge for their loved ones , " he said , hopefully .
And so , the violence in Ingushetia escalates — and nobody in Moscow wants to do anything about it .
Aushev , at least , believed as much .
The day before his murder , the famed opposition leader and millionaire appeared in a documentary on television .
While he steered his car , he noted , " Both corrupt bureaucrats and insurgents have the same goal in Ingushetia today : To sabotage president Yevkurov . "
The next day , he died .
Thousands of local people came to his house to pay respects .
The opposition leader , Magomed Khazbiyev spoke at the ceremony .
" They kill you here for defending human rights .
They kill you here for opposition activity , " he later told me over the phone .
" The blame lies on the government , law enforcement , and President Yevkurov , the government of this country , and its bandit methods .
" The people give the government a week to find the killers of their hero .
If the president does not keep his word , a civil war will start in the republic , as that was the last drop of our patience . "
A Microsoft executive was quoted in an interview as saying " what we 've tried to do with Windows 7 ... is create a Mac look and feel in terms of graphics " .
The comments , by partner group manager Simon Aldous , appeared in UK computing trade magazine PCR .
Microsoft countered that Mr Aldous was not involved with the development of Windows 7 .
Microsoft 's Brandon LeBlanc said in a blog that Mr Aldous 's comments were " inaccurate and uninformed " .
Suggestions that Microsoft has borrowed technology ideas has been rife for as long as the Windows and Mac operating systems have been around .
The very idea of who invented the " windows " on a " desktop " in Windows 1.0 was the basis of a 1988 lawsuit and remains a point of contention .
' One of our own '
However , many of the significant graphical changes present in Windows 7 have analogues in Mac 's OS X - although neither firm has made an official statement about the apparent similarities .
" One of the things that people say an awful lot about the Apple Mac is that the OS is fantastic , that it 's very graphical and easy to use , " Mr Aldous told PCR .
" What we 've tried to do with Windows 7 - whether it 's traditional format or in a touch format - is create a Mac look and feel in terms of graphics .
We 've significantly improved the graphical user interface , but it 's built on that very stable core Vista technology , which is far more stable than the current Mac platform , for instance . "
Mr LeBlanc countered the claims in a post on the official Windows blog .
" Unfortunately this came from a Microsoft employee who was not involved in any aspect of designing Windows 7 , " he wrote .
" I hate to say this about one of our own , but his comments were inaccurate and uninformed . "

" So the 1079 emails and 72 documents seem indeed evidence of a scandal involving most of the most prominent scientists pushing the man-made warming theory - a scandal that is one of the greatest in modern science .
I ’ve been adding some of the most astonishing in updates below - emails suggesting conspiracy , collusion in exaggerating warming data , possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information , organised resistance to disclosure , manipulation of data , private admissions of flaws in their public claims and much more .
If it is as it now seems , never again will “ peer review ” be used to shout down sceptics . "
... as well as a torrent of the actual leaked emails and documents .
Elsewhere in the web , the heroic Bishop Hill provides us with an extensive collection of summaries of some of the more interesting " CRUgate " e-mails .

He enjoins us to particularly " check out the PDF in the documents folder .
It 's a five - page document titled The Rules of the Game .
It seems to be like a primer for propagating the AGW message to the average subject of the UK .

The detainees were allegedly tortured after the Canadians handed them over A senior Canadian diplomat has testified that many Afghan detainees captured by Canadian forces in 2006 and 2007 were likely to have been tortured .
Richard Colvin told a parliamentary committee in Ottawa that government bureaucrats had ignored his warnings .
He said the detainees were tortured by Afghan security officers after being transferred from Canadian custody .
But Conservative Party MPs on the committee were concerned he had spoken to just four alleged victims .
His testimony has raised serious allegations about Canada 's role in the transfer of prisoners in Afghanistan .
' Beatings '
Mr Colvin wasted no time in making his central allegation to Canadian members of parliament .
He said that Afghan detainees transferred from the Canadian military base in Kandahar to the Afghan intelligence service had been tortured .
" The most common forms of torture were beatings , whippings with power cables and the use of electricity , " he said .
Mr Colvin said that for 16 months , up to April 2007 , the Canadian military in Kandahar had no monitoring system for keeping track of an Afghan detainee after he had left Canadian custody .
" Was he still in detention ?
Had he been released ?
Had he been transferred to a third party ?
Had he died under torture or been executed ?
We had no idea , " he said .
Mr Colvin said he relied on what he called trusted sources for much of his information .
But he admitted that he had only spoken to four detainees himself .
That led to a scornful response on the committee by MPs from the governing Conservatives , who said that that fact alone discredited the intelligence officer 's testimony .
The issue of torture has been raised publicly in both the United States and Britain in the past but never in Canada .
Mr Colvin said that he and his colleagues had tried to warn senior officials in Ottawa about the torture allegations .
But he said that he was ordered by Canadian foreign ministry officials to stop putting his concerns on paper .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea on Tuesday signaled it could return to nuclear disarmament talks it had declared dead six months ago , but a report it was near restoring its atomic plant underlined the secretive state would keep the stakes high .
Leader Kim Jong-il told Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on a rare visit to Pyongyang that he first wanted talks with the United States .
The North sees such talks as key to ending its status as a global pariah that it argues gives it no choice but to have a nuclear arsenal .
“ The hostile relations between the DPRK ( North Korea ) and the United States should be converted into peaceful ties through the bilateral talks without fail , ” the North ’s KCNA news agency quoted Kim as saying .
“ We expressed our readiness to hold multilateral talks , depending on the outcome of the DPRK - U.S. talks .
The six - party talks are also included in the multilateral talks . ”
In April , a month before its second nuclear test , North Korea said the six - party talks -- between the two Koreas , China , Japan , Russia and the United States -- were finished for good .
It walked away from those talks last December .
This is the first time it has suggested it might return to what has been the only international forum to try to make the North give up dreams of becoming a nuclear warrior in return for massive aid to fix an economy broken by years of mismanagement .
One analyst said it boiled down to impoverished North Korea hoping to persuade Washington to end its economic squeeze and the United States wanting to be certain that Pyongyang will not sell any nuclear weaponry abroad .
“ North Korea wants sanctions removed ...
What the United States wants is some assurance about proliferation because the U.S. does n’t really care about restoration of an obsolete nuclear plant or how much nuclear material the North has got , ” said Cho Min of the Korea Institute of National Unification .
He said the focus was now on whether Washington sends an official , possibly special envoy Stephen Bosworth , to the North .
A State Department spokesman said on Tuesday U.S. diplomats were seeking a meeting with Chinese officials to obtain more details about the discussions in Pyongyang and what they mean for six - party talks .
Spokesman Ian Kelly said Washington was open to a bilateral dialogue as long as it led to a resumption of six - party talks .
“ If we ’re on a path leading to our goal , of course , that ’s ... encouraging , ” he said .
“ But ... I ’m not going to characterize it until we talk to our Chinese partners . ”

NEW ELEMENT
The North ’s chief source of material to build a bomb has been its Yongbyon facilities which it had agreed to dismantle during six - party talks but later said it would restore , accusing the United States of planning to attack it .
“ We have obtained indications that point to restoration work being in the final stages , ” an unnamed South Korean government source was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying .
North Korea says it is U.S. hostility , and the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea , that is the problem .

It has long sought direct talks with the United States , in part to agree a formal peace treaty to the 1950 - 53 Korean War and gain full diplomatic relations , which would in turn give it access to international financial aid .
The U.S. administration is under pressure to come up with a new tack in dealing with the reclusive state that has for years played cat and mouse in negotiations with the international community , never giving up trying to build a nuclear arsenal .
“ An effective American strategy toward North Korea will require a combination of tough measures with serious dialogue and engagement , ” Joel Wit , an academic and former U.S. State Department official working on North Korea , wrote in a report .
He said a policy of containment and isolation only conceded that North Korea will further develop its nuclear program .
“ That , in turn , will undermine stability in East Asia , sow doubts in Tokyo and Seoul about relying too much on the United States for their security and jeopardize cooperation with China . ”
CHINA BOOST
The visit by the Chinese premier has been a major boost for Kim , increasingly shunned by the international community for nuclear and missile tests earlier this year and facing tougher sanctions .
Analysts say the punitive measures hurt its weapons trade , an important source of scarce foreign income .
“ There is no doubt that Wen delivered a very clear cut message , China wanted to give a push -- which has been fruitful so far .
But you can also understand that North Korea will not just compromise very substantially after just one visit because it is not their style , ” said Zhu Feng , professor of international security at Peking University .
“ The key question is not just how to bring them back to the negotiating table but also how to change their behavior ... that ’s why my interpretation of Wen ’s visit is that he delivered a clear cut message and gave North Korea a very timely push , you ca n’t always hesitate , you ca n’t always fool around , you ca n’t always just play tricks ... otherwise time is running out and the effects will be very negative for North Korea . ”
In December 2006 Andrew ’s first attempt to cross the Tasman Sea in a standard one - man kayak was aborted after two days due to trouble keeping warm inside the cockpit .
Andrew ’s second attempt began on 11 January 2007 and ended on 12 February when the search for his missing body was called off following the recovery of his partly flooded kayak on 10 February just 30 nautical miles short of his destination Milford Sound .
The sleeping arrangements at sea involved deploying a sea anchor , squeezing his body down into the kayak and sealing the hatch with a bulbous fibreglass capsule ( dubbed “ Casper ” ) fitted with an air - only ventilator which , with its self - righting capabilities , made it possible to ride out the most severe storm conditions that are inevitable in that part of the ocean .
Unfortunately , when the capsule was pivoted to its stowing position behind the cockpit , it made it impossible to kayak roll due to being filled with water like a bucket .
Therefore , whenever he capsized , he had to swim out of the kayak , push it upright and perform full self - rescue .
When his kayak was recovered , only this capsule was missing .
It was presumed to have been torn off by a freak wave .
One of its pivot arms had already been damaged .
Veteran sailor Jonathan Borgais , who was directing the expedition by providing weather predictions , explained : “ From the beginning , my biggest concern was the approach to New Zealand .
And this part of New Zealand is notoriously dangerous .
On a good day you can get rogue waves : a two or three metre set that can come out of nowhere .
Not big , but powerful .
That ’s very dangerous .
I have no doubt that a wave got him . ”
The documentary of Andrew ’s journey Solo : Lost at sea incorporated video footage recovered from one surviving memory stick in his camera as well as interviews with people on his team during the expedition .
It begins with the distress call he made on 9 February .
On a windswept street in a bustling industrial area on the outskirts of town , a stocky man in a white shirt and dark jeans pulls out three Ziploc bags containing red , brown and silver pills .
Take two red and brown pills each day for a week , he tells the woman who says she is nine weeks pregnant , and your baby has an 85 per cent chance of being a boy .
Then he demands $ 750 in cash .
In the Indian state of Punjab , the culture is obsessed with boys .
Desperate to avoid giving birth to girls , women for decades have taken extreme measures .
They swallow herbs , drink pregnant cow 's milk , pray in marathon sessions , and since the widespread use of ultrasound technology , abort female fetuses .
It 's a huge topic of debate in India , with an alarmingly skewed birth ratio of boys to girls .
But this scene on an industrial strip was not played out in Punjab , but just west of Toronto , in an area a large number of Punjabis now call home – and where the latest Canadian census figures reveal significantly fewer girls than boys in the South Asian community .
Posing as a pregnant Punjabi woman , a Star reporter met the man after answering an ad in the Ajit Weekly , a Punjabi - language newspaper printed in Mississauga .
" A guaranteed and satisfactory medicine for having a son is available , " the ad says .
The man turned out to be Kanwar Bains , the newspaper 's news editor and the meeting took place outside the paper 's office .
He said a woman cannot be more than 12 weeks pregnant for the pills to work .
" There 's no 100 per cent guarantee , " he said in an earlier conversation by phone .
He offered to give the number of a Brampton clinic to check the sex of the fetus after 12 weeks of pregnancy .
" Then you can think about what you want to do .
If it 's a girl , ( whether ) you want to keep her or not , " he said .
" You know ... what you want to do is your decision . "
Later , when confronted by the Star , Bains said he was not preying on desperate women .
" So what 's wrong as a human being to aspire or desire a boy ... to balance your family . "
Young mothers from India , particularly from Punjab , often face intense pressure here to have baby boys , said Baldev Mutta , executive director of Punjabi Community Health Services in Peel Region .
Mutta said he has no doubt female feticide – aborting a female fetus – also is prevalent among Punjabis in Canada .
The agency sees several women every month seeking help .
One woman was forced by her family to have two abortions because they were girls , he said .
When she became pregnant again and found out it was a girl , she approached Mutta for help .
Amandeep Kaur , a counsellor at Punjabi Community Health Services , said she has seen dozens of victims of domestic abuse .
But nothing prepared her for a young Malton mother who sought help .
The woman , in her mid-20s , had two young daughters .
Her in - laws had subsequently forced her to have two abortions after ultrasounds indicated she was carrying girls .
Now she was pregnant again with a female fetus .
The woman was frail , constantly crying as her two young daughters clung to her , Kaur recalled of the meeting at a Mississauga coffee shop .
The woman's in - laws told her she could keep the baby and return to India , or have the abortion .
" I told her we would do everything to help her keep her unborn girl , " Kaur said , but she never saw the woman after two meetings .
When she finally managed to contact her again , the woman told her she 'd had a miscarriage .
" A lot of young mothers are newcomers , " Kaur said .
" They do n't know anyone here except for ( their ) in - laws .
They fear for what could happen if they do n't do what the family wants . "
The bias against girls is entrenched in traditional Indian culture , where a girl is considered a burden on the family .
Parents worry about finding her a good husband and providing a dowry .
For most parents , girls will get married and go live with their new families .
A son , they believe , will look after them in old age and also carry on the family name .
IN 2006 , a study published in the British medical journal Lancet found the boy - girl ratio changed markedly after ultrasound technology – that diagnoses fetal abnormalities and illnesses but can also identify sex – became popular in India 20 years ago .
The most dramatic decline of female births came between 1991 and 2001 , from 945 girls for every 1,000 boys to 927 , despite a ban in 1994 on sex- selective abortions .
According to India 's 2001 census , the northern state of Punjab has one of the worst gender ratios at 793 girls to 1,000 boys .
Canada does not collect statistics based on ethnicity at birth .
But statistics here , now home to more than a million Indo - Canadians , many from Punjab , also show a somewhat skewed gender ratio .
According to 2006 census figures , nationally there are 932 girls to 1,000 boys under age 15 in the South Asian community , compared to 953 girls to 1,000 boys in the general population .
The numbers in the South Asian community in the Toronto area become much more skewed : 917 girls to 1,000 boys in the Toronto Central Metropolitan Area .
Broken down further , it shows 904 girls to 1,000 boys in Mississauga , and 864 girls to 1,000 boys in Brampton .
" That means the sex - ratio is 50 per cent higher for under - 15 South Asians as compared to the general population ( in the Toronto CMA ) , " said David Foot , professor of economics at the University of Toronto and a demographics expert .
" I would say that is concerning . "
That 's a huge gap proportionally , says Myer Siemiatycki , a professor in immigration settlement studies at Ryerson University .
" In the Punjabi and South - Asian population , the numbers show a clear tilt in favour of men while it's the opposite in the national population ( where overall there are more Canadian women than men ) .
There 's no question something significant is happening in the under - 15 age group . "
BOY OR girl ?
It 's easy to find out .

Canadian law says a patient is entitled to all their own medical information .
In its national guidelines , the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada says sex determination of the fetus is part of the complete obstetric ultrasound .
" However , if no abnormalities are seen but determination is inconclusive , the examination should not be prolonged or repeated solely to determine fetal sex . "
Acknowledging " information may lead women to abort pregnancies when the fetus is not the wanted sex , " the society stipulates ultrasound clinics should not do scans only to determine gender .
In most cases , an ultrasound can indicate the sex of a fetus at 16 to 18 weeks .
If doctors know the gender , they will ask the patient if they want to know , says Jennifer Blake , chief of obstetrics and gynaecology at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre .
But Blake acknowledges an ethical quandary in revealing that information " if a doctor suspects an infant 's life would be terminated based on gender . "
Birinder Singh Ahluwalia , who owns four diagnostics clinics in the Toronto area , has seen women barely 10 weeks pregnant asking him to check the gender .
" I tell them I wo n't do it , " he says , adding , " I 've been told many people go to Buffalo ( for ultrasounds ) . "
Shruti Gandhi , who runs a fertility clinic in Rexdale , says some couples seeking fertility treatment ask if it is possible to have a boy .
Gandhi , in practice for 15 years with mostly South - Asian clients , tells them at the outset there is a 50 - 50 chance of having a boy .
" It makes me angry but I also know the young woman is probably under pressure . "
IT 'S A Saturday morning and some 40 men crowd into a room at a health centre in west Brampton .
They represent all age - groups and all are Punjabi .
They are here as part of mandated counselling for alcohol or drug addiction , or domestic violence .
Today 's topic is about discrimination against women , before they are born .
Mutta , in typical candour , asks if they , as parents , want boys .
For a few moments , the only sound is a creaking chair as a man shifts uncomfortably .
Then a heavy - set man replies he has nothing against girls , but boys do carry on the family name .
Then a man in the front row pipes up : it 's the women – mothers and sisters - in - law in most cases – who pressure young mothers to have boys .
" Ca n't the man explain it to his mother that it 's not important ? " Mutta asks .
No response .
Another man tells how his wife cried her heart out when she gave birth to a girl .
She felt she had let the family down .
Mutta calls it " indoctrination . "
An older man in a rust - coloured turban says : " It will stop only when we realize it 's wrong . "
At the end of the meeting , Mutta warns them of a day , not far in the future , when there will be few girls left for boys to marry .
There is nervous laughter as they leave .
Mutta warns education on gender equality is key .
" It 's a decades - old problem .
It wo n't go away overnight .
Even if we lose one girl , it 's a shame . "

I 'm not saying the stock market will crash , only that if it had any relation to the real U.S. economy that it should crash , and soon .
The current politics of experience ( a key concept in Survival + ) is so warped by misleading statistics and orchestrated propaganda that it feels strange to state the obvious and find it is " that which cannot be spoken " : the credit - dependent , consumer - dependent U.S. economy is going down , and going down hard , and the trillions of dollars borrowed and spent by the U.S. government and Federal Reserve to crank up a recovery have failed completely , utterly and totally .
The basic idea of Keynesian policy is simple : when the wheels fall off the private , quasi - free enterprise economy , then the government borrows and spreads mountains of money around like fertilizer which will stimulate " green shoots " of recovery .
The forgotten key to successful Keynesian policy is a government which has not been borrowing and spending trillions of dollars even during an era of so - called " prosperity . "
When a government like the U.S. has been propping up " prosperity " with trillions in borrowed money for a decade , then doubling or tripling the " stimulus " in the hopes that the green shoots will be enduring is truly farcical .
If the economy needed several trillion dollars in deficit spending to eke out the meager jobless growth of 2001 - 2007 , then why does anyone think that doubling or tripling that deficit spending will create an enduring boom ?
The truth is the U.S. economy has been dependent on Federal stimulus for years , both the indirect stimulus of artificially low interest rates and unlimited liquidity , and the direct spending of hundreds of billions of borrowed dollars .
Even before the financial crisis , the Federal government was borrowing and spending $ 400 billion a year to prop up " prosperity . "
All that spending simply papered over the rot at the core of the economy :
1 . The primary support of the U.S. economy is consumer spending which is ultimately based on household income and assets .
Earned income has been flat to down for most Americans for years .
The median income has been skewed upwards by the top 10 % whose earnings have risen significantly .
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , real disposable personal income -- income adjusted for inflation and taxes -- declined 3.4 percent in the third quarter after increasing 3.8 percent in the second quarter .
In an economy dependent on consumer spending for 70 % of GDP , how can GDP rise by 3.5 % while personal income plummeted by 3.4 % ?
Assuming that boost in GDP is real and not just statistical legerdemain , then where did it come from ?
From borrowed money , of course -- the Federal government borrowed and spent over $ 1.4 trillion in fiscal 2009 .
In the good old days of 2002 - 2007 , households would have borrowed and spent hundreds of billions as well .
But the consumer , beset by declining assets ( $ 13 trillion lost in the past two years ) , declining income ( see above ) , falling housing values and worrisome employment trends ( 17 % unemployment / underemployment , broadly measured ) , is actually cutting back on borrowing : Revolving Consumer Credit Drops 13.1 % in August .
Consumer credit decreased at an annual rate of 5 - 3/4 percent in August 2009 .
Revolving credit ( credit cards ) decreased at an annual rate of 13 percent , and nonrevolving credit decreased at an annual rate of 1 - 1/ 2 percent -- the longest decline in consumer debt since 1991 .
So while households are still burdened with almost $ 2.5 trillion credit card and nonrevolving debt ( auto loans , etc. ) , they are paying debt down , not adding more .
And let 's not forget that homeowners pulled out about $ 5 trillion in home equity in 2001 - 2007 , and the home equity ATM is closed for good .
That brings us to :
2 . The primary asset in most U.S. households is a home , and home values are still dropping , foreclosures are still rising and the only force keeping the market from falling faster is the Federal government 's defacto nationalization of the entire U.S. mortgage market .
Of the $ 1.5 trillion mortgage securities issued in 2009 , a mere 1 % ( $ 15 billion ) have been issued by banks 99 % are backed by the government .
The government owns over half the nation 's $ 10 trillion in mortgages via its defacto ownership of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and it has guaranteed virtually all the mortgages originated in the past year via FHA or VA .
The residential mortgage market is now effectively owned lock , stock and barrel by the Federal government and its private " central bank " , the Federal Reserve .
Should the Fed and Treasury reduce their subsidies ( that wonderful $ 8,000 giveaway tax credit to new home buyers or anyone claiming to be one ) , guarantees and outright purchases of mortgages ( $ 1.2 trillion this year alone ) , then the mortgage market would instantly freeze up or start pricing in the very real risk that housing is not " recovering " and that anyone holding a mortgage could suffer huge losses if real estate continues declining in value .
Here are a few charts to ponder :
Credit Creaks into Gear :
With a big boost from the feds , investors again like securities backed by assets like car loans  but it 'll take years for lending to flow freely .
Cracks in the Foundation of the Fed 's Housing Fix A Wall Street power broker worries about what happens when government aid ends
Foreclosures Continue to Put a Damper on Home Prices .
3 . So how have companies " surprised " with higher profits ?
By slashing payrolls , R&D and various accounting tricks .
Actual revenue growth is missing in action .
So how do you keep " surprising to the upside " after you 've slashed headcount , burned R&D and turned every accounting trick in the book ?
The GDP Mirage
By overlooking cuts in research and development , product design , and worker training , GDP is greatly overstating the economy 's strength
You do n't .
A stock market rising on the hopes of an actual , real , tangible recovery in household income , home equity and creditworthiness is seeing mirages and hallucinating that the lake just ahead is deep and wonderful and stretches to the horizon .
Only we never reach the " lake , " do we ?
" Stabilization " is a chimera ; the reality is the government is propping up the economy via unprecedented borrowing and spending , and there is absolutely no evidence that private capital , credit or spending are rising from the " stabilization . "
We are walking through the desert , kept alive by the sugar - water drip of Federal stimulus , guarantees and subsidies .
The " so near , yet so far " mirage of " recovery " has been propping up the stock market for nine months , and when a slight breeze blows away the thermal illusion , then the market will crash back to the March lows , or perhaps even lower .
That crash will simply reflect the state of the real economy .
" This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

In what could be a nightmare scenario for Republican Party officials , conservative activists are gearing up to challenge leading GOP candidates in more than a dozen key House and Senate races in 2010 .
Conservatives and tea party activists had already set their sights on some of the GOP ’s top Senate recruits -- a list that includes Gov. Charlie Crist in Florida , former Rep. Rob Simmons in Connecticut and Rep. Mark Kirk in Illinois , among others .
But their success in Tuesday ’s upstate New York special election , where grass - roots efforts pushed GOP nominee Dede Scozzafava to drop out of the race and helped Conservative Party nominee Doug Hoffman surge into the lead on the eve of Election Day , has generated more money and enthusiasm than organizers ever imagined .
Activists predict a wave that could roll from California to Kentucky to New Hampshire and that could leave even some GOP incumbents -- Utah Sen.
Bob Bennett is one -- facing unexpectedly fierce challenges from their right flank .
“ I would say it ’s the tip of the spear , ” said Dick Armey , the former GOP House majority leader who now serves as chairman of FreedomWorks , an organization that has been closely aligned with the tea party movement .
“ We are the biggest source of energy in American politics today . ”
“ What you ’re going to see , ” said Armey , “ is moderates and conservatives across the country in primaries . ”
These high - stakes primaries , pitting the activist wing of the party against the establishment wing , stand to have a profound impact on the 2010 election landscape since they will create significant problems for moderate candidates recruited by the national party precisely because they appear well - suited to win in places that are not easily -- or even plausibly -- won by conservative candidates .
With the taste of blood fresh in their mouths -- albeit their own blood -- teabaggers are already mapping out a game plan for challenging dozens of Establishment Republicans running for office -- incumbents and challengers alike .
Yesterday when Rush Limbaugh launched into his bestiality diatribe about Dede Scozzafava , it was thefor a contemporary movement of anti-American Know Nothings and misfits .
Listen as Limbaugh tries asserting primacy not just over Michael Steele ( dead meat ) , John Cornyn , John Boehner , and Miss McConnell , but , more to the point , over Glenn Beck , his arch rival : Today 's Politico painted a picture the Republican Inside - the - Beltway power structure is probably not ready for .
But probably has no way to resist :
And it goes beyond just draining off Republican dollars into costly primary battles with far right insurgents .
The real worry is that the sense of teabagger entitlement , stoked by the Hate Talk radio and TV the GOP has so carefully nurtured -- how soon beforestart asking Pelosi and Reid to revisit the Fairness Doctrine ?-- will force mainstream candidates to start taking extremist positions that play well to the Know Nothings , Glenn Beck crowd , birthers , deathers and teababggers -- but that can't win in moderate suburban districts the Republicans need to win back in order to regain some degree of national relevance .
Virginia Republican , Tom Davis , former chairman of the NRCC , has a warning for this party : " For me , what this says is , we need to take a deep breath and decide whether [ moderates and conservatives ] work together or not .
And if we do n’t , it can get very , very ugly .
” It already is very , very ugly down in Florida , where the once popular governor , Charlie Crist , considered a shoe - in for election to the Senate over a mediocre Democrat best known as a corrupt mama 's boy with no principles or values beyond advancing his own career .
Now Gov.
Crist looks like he 'll lose the Republican primary to Marco Rubio , darling of the national teabagger set , a charismatic extremist who is likely to scare off mainstream Florida voters in a general election .
Rubio sees what happened in NY - 23 as heralding in a new day for extreme right - wing fanatics like himself .
" NY - 23 , on some scale , is the first battle of a larger internal Republican debate over how to define the party .
They want us to vote for their candidates , but they do n’t want us to run for office .
” One thing about the teabaggers is that they are unified around a theme that they would rather see the GOP lose than see mainstream Republicans win elections .
One of the craziest of the kooks running for Congress is whacked - out wingnut Bradley Rees , a former Republican aspirant for the Virginia seat now held by Tom Periello .
About a week ago , seeing all the attention Doug Hoffman was getting in NY - 23 , Rees dropped out of the Republican primary and declared he would run as a third party ( teabagger ) candidate .
Rees seems eager to destroy the GOP .
“ It , " he remarks about his fledgling campaign , " may amount to only drawing enough votes from the Republican candidate to ensure Tom Perriello a second term .
If so , so be it .
Maybe then , the party will understand that we are trying to save the GOP from its worst enemy -- not the Democrats , but themselves .
"
The loon running the teabagger scene in Florida , Everett Wilkinson , one of the power brokers behind Rubio , basically parrots the same line : “ We would lose if Charlie Crist got elected or if another person who does n’t support our policies got elected .
Our members are actively going to get out there and create awareness of the governor ’s actions . ”
And a teabagging big shot in Illinois , Evert Evertsen , is just as explicit about his movement 's decision to wreck GOP candidate Mark Kirk 's campaign : “ We ’re going to work hard as hell to make sure Mark Kirk does n’t win .
Mark Kirk is about as liberal as Arlen Specter was .
" Lunatic fringe Republicans like Evertsen , Wilkinson and Rees are good news for Democrats is what could have been a tough electoral environment .
But with teabaggers and extremists forcing mainstream candidates off the ballot -- and replacing them with a bizarre assortment of radical right ideologues , it is Democrats who will stand to gain the most .
It would be ironic if the teabaggers ' biggest achievement is to elect Kendrick Meek , the weakest candidate the Democrats could have possibly put up in Florida , someone who stands for nothing and would have no chance whatsoever against Crist but who could actually wind up as a plausible bastion against the rise of a dangerous and ugly strain of American fascism .

Science fiction novelist Philip K . Dick wrote many letters to Claudia Bush ; a woman who , due to a thesis she was writing , had chosen to initiate contact with the author as he was the subject of her paper .
Below is one of the letters he wrote .
In it , Dick tells of a recurring dream he experienced for months in which a mysterious book made a seemingly important appearance , then goes on to conclude the letter with an amusing postscript .
Interestingly , the letter was written just 5 months after Dick experienced the life - changing visions he subsequently documented in Exegesis .
Transcript follows .
Transcript
July 5 , 1974
Dear Claudia ,
Since I last wrote you ( sending on the 7 page letter to Peter Fitting plus the 2 page letter to you ) I have continued to have the same dream again and again which I mentioned : a vast and important book held up before me which I should read .
Yesterday , for example , since Tessa and Christopher had gone off on a picnic , I took several naps and had four dreams in which printed matter appeared , two of them involving books .
For three months , virtually every night , I ’ve had these dreams involving written material .
And within the last few days it became obvious that a specific book was indicated .
That the ultimate purpose of these dreams was to call my attention to an actual book somewhere in the real world , which I was to find , then take down and read .
The first dream on July 4 was much more explicit than any before ; I took down my copy of Robert Heinlein ’s I WILL FEAR NO EVIL , a large blue hardback U.K. edition , for two men to look at .
Both men said this was not a book ( or the book ) they were interested in .
However , it was clear that the book wanted was large and blue and hardback .
In a dream a month ago I managed to see part of the title ; it ended with the word “ Grove . ”
At the time I thought it might be Proust ’s WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE , but it was not ; however , there was a long word similar to “ Budding ” before “ Grove . ”
So I knew by the first part of the day yesterday that I was looking for a large blue hardback book –very large and long , according to some dreams , endlessly long , in fact– with the final word of the title being “ Grove ” and a word before it like “ Budding . ”
In the last of the four dreams yesterday I caught sight of the copyright date on the book and another look at the typestyle .
It was dated either 1966 or possibly 1968 ( the latter proved to be the case ) .
So I began studying all the books in my library which might fit these qualifications .
I had the keen intuition that when I at last found it I would have in my hands a mystic or occult or religious book of wisdom which would be a doorway to the absolute reality behind the whole universe .
Of course the possibility existed that I did n’t have the book in my library , that I would have to go out and buy it .
In several dreams I was in a bookstore doing just that .
One time the book was help open before me with its pages singed by fire on all sides .
By that I took it to be an extremely sacred book , perhaps the one seen in the Book of Daniel .
Anyhow today I looked all day around the house , since Tessa has been sick with a sunburn , and all at once I found the book .
The three month search is at last over .
As soon as I took down the volume I knew it was to be the right one .
I had seen it again and again , with ever increasing clarity , until it could not be mistaken .
The book is called THE SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE , hardback and blue , running just under 700 huge long pages of tiny type .
It was published in 1968 .
It is the dullest book in the world ; I tried to read it when the Book Find Book Club sent it to me but could n’t .
It is a biography of Warren G. Harding .
Cordially ,
( Signed , ‘ Phil ’ )

P.S. This is on a level , and it goes to show you that you should never take your dreams too seriously .
Or else it shows that the unconscious or the universe or God or whatever can put you on .
A three - month gag .
( If you want to read the book I ’ll mail it to you .
Postage should be enormous .
You got three years ahead in which you have nothing planned ? )
As regular readers will know , we often note the passing of the regular British ritual where the UK government asks a group of scientific advisers to give evidence on the harmfulness of drugs and then ignores them .
The unwritten rule is that everyone feigns mild exasperation and then goes about their business as if nothing had happened , but the Home Secretary Alan Johnson has gone and spoiled the party by firing neuroscientist David Nutt , the head of the drugs advisory committee , for , well , waving that damned evidence about .
The home secretary ’s officially sacked the chief adviser for breaking what turns out to be a non-existent rule about discussing government policy in a recent lecture – using the carefully mischosen words “ I cannot have public confusion between scientific advice and policy ” .
Subsequently , two other scientists from the advisory committee have resigned and both the government ’s Chief Scientific Advisor and the Science Minister expressed their dismay .
An evidence free drugs policy is n’t a British speciality , unfortunately , as shown by a recent World Health Organisation study that showed that severity of drug laws around the world have virtually no relation to the drug use of the population .
So why did the home secretary break the unwritten rule about quietly ignoring the evidence in the service of some pointless sabre rattling ?
Surely nothing to do with the fact that a general election is coming up .
Today marks the end of an era , as The Pirate Bay team announces that the world 's largest BitTorrent tracker is shutting down for good .
Although the site will remain operational for now , millions of BitTorrent users will lose the use of its tracker and will instead have to rely on DHT and alternative trackers to continue downloading .
After its launch in 2003 , The Pirate Bay soon became one of the largest BitTorrent trackers on the Internet , coordinating the downloads of more than 25 million peers at its height .
Despite this success , The Pirate Bay operators today decided to pull the plug and close down the tracker permanently .
The evolution of the BitTorrent protocol has made trackers redundant they say , as BitTorrent downloads work well with trackerless solutions such as DHT and PEX .
“ Now that the decentralized system for finding peers is so well developed , TPB has decided that there is no need to run a tracker anymore , so it will remain down !
It ’s the end of an era , but the era is no longer up2date .
We have put a server in a museum already , and now the tracking can be put there as well , ” the Pirate Bay crew write on their blog .
Aside from this shutdown , there is also another major development quietly under discussion .
TorrentFreak has learned that behind the scenes the Pirate Bay operators are talking to other BitTorrent site owners to encourage them to follow suit and completely ditch torrents in the future .
BitTorrent has reached a point where trackers and torrents are no longer needed to download files successfully .
Supported by all of the major BitTorrent clients , DHT and PEX can handle the transfers and Magnet links can largely replace traditional torrent files .
“ We ’re talking to the other torrent admins on doing magnet links and DHT + PEX for all sites .
Moving away from torrents and trackers totally – like pick a date and all agree ‘ from this date , we ’ll not support torrents anymore ’ , ” a Pirate Bay insider told TorrentFreak .
Switching to trackerless and torrentless downloading on public BitTorrent sites does indeed seem to be an option .
Previously , many people thought that BitTorrent would collapse if a dominant tracker like the Pirate Bay went down , but this doomsday scenario never unfolded .
In fact , the recent downtime of the tracker did not slow down or stop many transfers , as DHT and PEX seamlessly took over .
Those BitTorrent users who do n’t want to go trackerless just yet can of course still use OpenBitTorrent and PublicBitTorrent , or indeed one of the many other alternative trackers currently available .
Whether or not The Pirate Bay and others will move away from torrent files in the future , the closure of the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker is nevertheless a milestone in the history of the Internet .
Starting today , the Pirate Bay has changed its tagline from “ The world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker ” to “ The world ’s most resilient ( magnetic ) BitTorrent site . ”
People who illegally download music spend more on official releases than those who obey download laws , a British survey published this weekend has suggested .
The think - tank Demos said it found illegal downloaders spent an average of £ 77 a year on genuine music , £ 33 more than those who claim never to have wrongly accessed music for free .
Nearly two thirds of people who admit to downloading music illegally also said that new and cheaper music services would encourage them to stop accessing illegal services .
The results come amid warnings from the British government that people who persistently download illegally face being disconnected from the internet .
A Digital Economy
Bill is expected to be introduced to parliament later this month , with its draft promising to create a " robust legal and regulatory framework to combat illegal file sharing " .
Demos 's research found that 83 per cent of people downloading music illegally claim to buy the same or more music as a result .
The 42 per cent of people who admitted breaking the law said they did so to " try before you buy " , suggesting that file sharing may encourage sales .
Illegal file sharers provide the music industry with an estimated £ 200 million in revenue , Demos added .
It found that by lowering the price of music available online to 45 p per track - compared to between 59 p and 99p on iTunes - providers could expect to double interest in legal sales .
The think - tank 's researcher Peter Bradwell said : " This research demonstrates that cutting file sharers off may not be the best solution for the Government if they are intent on helping the music industry . "
America Moving from Kingdom of Cash to Socialism Slowly but Surely
Obama ’s decision not to build the Missile Defense System in Poland and the Czech Republic and his Noble Prize have not yet been comprehended from a philosophical viewpoint .
It ’s time to do it .
America Moving from Kingdom of Cash to Socialism Slowly but Surely
Power of Money against Power of Spirit
The last turning point similar to the current one happened approximately 400 years ago .
The Western European society discovered a new hierarchy of values .
Feudalism that valued service and chivalry was replaced with capitalism .
Wealth became the measure of success , and everyone was to care about his own pocket only .
The cult of money replaced all other values , including religious .
Capitalism turned everything upside down and made people more excited about stuffing their bank accounts than anything else .
This system turned out to be extremely efficient in terms of production of goods , services , and comfort .
America benefited from the system the most , and decided that the rest of the world has to adopt it as well .
If some underdeveloped countries are unable to appreciate the benefits of capitalism , they should be forced to do it .
Collapse of the Illusion
Meanwhile , philosophers say that capitalism is driven not by hard cash , but rather , striving for hard cash .
It ’s driven not by the production of goods , but rather , striving for consumption of these goods .
If everyone had these values , the “ dog- eat - dog ” principal would be the major principal in the world history .
But America failed to do it .
There are plenty of “ underdeveloped ” people in the world who continue to cherish spiritual values .
There are not that many chances left to force them into worshiping money since these “ underdeveloped ” people adopt western technology and become stronger .
The appeal to adopt American values does n’t work either .
Why would we adopt the system if the system is in crisis ?
Pragmatic America realized that billions of people are not willing to live in the kingdom of hard cash and decided that it would be better off leaving this kingdom itself .
Now the USA is talking about introducing elements of socialism .
What does Obama ’s decision not to build the Eastern European Missile Defense System have to do with all of this ?
Well , it means that it ’s not capitalism that ’s undergoing the crisis , but the belief in its high efficiency .
And this , in turn , means that America , the bulwark of capitalism , is no longer the boss of the world .
And if it ’s not the boss any more , it has to be friends with everybody , including Russia .
And it ’s America ’s turn to offer Russia to push the reset button .
Or maybe it ’s just tired of imposing its rules on others and felt that friendship is more valuable than money and power ?
If this is the case , we will soon witness another turning point in the world history .
Arguments and Facts

A homeless man has been crushed to death in a bin lorry in Manchester .
The 31 - year - old had climbed into a rubbish bin to sleep , but it was loaded into a waste collection lorry which automatically crushes the contents .
His body was found when the vehicle emptied its load at a rubbish site in Ardwick at 1130 GMT on Wednesday .
A post -mortem examination revealed the man died from asphyxiation as he was crushed with the rubbish , said Greater Manchester Police .
The incident is not being treated as suspicious and police have passed the case to the coroner .
Hypothermia theory
Det Supt Julian Ross , from Greater Manchester Police , said : " It would appear this man was homeless and climbed into the bin to escape the bad weather and find somewhere warmer and dryer to sleep .
" This was a tragic accident and those involved are very upset that this man has died in this way . "
According to police it is unclear if the victim was suffering hypothermia which meant he was unable to alert bin men that he was inside , said police .
Police are urging homeless people to find a place to sleep out of the cold to avoid more deaths .
" Sadly , as in this case , sleeping in a bin can lead to this sort of tragic accident and someone losing their life . "
I am still surprised as to how someone willingly gets on a bike and takes a huge risk with cars , trucks and buses , often travelling well over 80 km /h .
Motorists get fined for not wearing a seat belt and not strapping their children in properly , for good reason .
It is unsafe to be in a vehicle without being belted in properly .
That leaves cyclists very vulnerable .
No one would suggest it is safe for pedestrians to be on the roadway , so why should it be any different if a pedestrian gets on a bike ?
While individuals do take all sorts of risk voluntarily every day , either by necessity , or for the thrill of it , the road is quite a different environment .
Government with its regulatory powers is the only way a safe playing field can be set for all who wish to use our roads .
The claim put to me often by cycling lobby groups , " that bicycles are non-motorised vehicular transport and have as much right to be on the road as any other vehicle " , was a claim I rejected firmly every time .
And they never spoke up at all for the thousands of mums , dads and kids who wanted to ride their bikes on a weekend and could n't because there were no safe facilities .
In rejecting the " we have a right to be on the road " mentality of cyclists and their lobby groups , I also took a measured and balanced policy position on how best to separate bicycles and vehicles from our roads over time .
Shifting cyclists off our roads or even banning them was neither fair nor entirely possible without providing off - road alternatives .
I made a decision that all future major road infrastructure would be built with off - road cycle ways .
This included any major cyclical maintenance on road surfaces , which would include a section of off - road cycle way along the length of the newly refurbished road .
This policy along with cycle ways along some rail corridors , started with the Wolli Creek Valley Cycleway with the M5 East , the parallel off - road cycle ways along bus only T - ways , running from Liverpool to Parramatta and on to Rouse Hill and finally the best of them all , the 40 - kilometre , 3.5 - metre wide , grade - separated , off - road cycle way along the length of the M7 motorway .
The M7 cycle way is probably the longest and best engineered off - road cycle way in the country .
To ensure a person could safely cycle non -stop for 40 kilometres , without crossing a road , or passing through a set of lights , the cycle way needed to go over and under numerous off ramps and intersections along its entire route .
A new electroshock weapon being developed by Taser could zap people up to 175 feet away – and keep on applying pain for as long as three minutes in a row .
Which is pretty tough to take , since it only takes a second or two of shocks to make most people cry out in agony .
The new 40 mm projectile resembles a super - sized version of the shotgun - fired XREP Taser projectile .
And like the XREP , it will attach itself to the target and incapacitate him or her with a series of electric jolts .
But this one will have some notable differences – from how far it flies to the dangers it might pose .
( I describe the project in New Scientist magazine . )
X26 Tasers already with the military have a range of about 35 feet .
" This project will likely increase the standoff range by at least a factor of five over already fielded electromuscular devices , " says Wes Burgei , a project engineer at the U.S. military 's Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate , which has given Taser $ 2.5 million to work on the weapon .
the initial version of the 40 mm
Taser should have a range in the region of 175 feet – almost doubling the XREP 's 100 - foot range .
The problem is making it safe .
A projectile that is accurate out to that distance may have a dangerous impact force at close range .
According to Burgei , much of the project is focusing on the design of the nose , which is likely to crumple or otherwise disperse the impact force .
Steve Wright , a specialist in nonlethal weapons at Leeds Metropolitan University in the UK , is concerned that that the projectile may be particularly dangerous to children .
" Children especially are vulnerable to a condition known as ' commotio cordis ' - a sudden and often fatal disturbance in heart rhythm sometimes caused by a blunt impact to the precordial region of the chest which is transmitted to the heart , " he tells Danger Room .
The problem was highlighted with a similar 40 mm electroshock projectile in the 1990's , the Jaycor Sticky Shocker .
It had a much less ambitious range of just 30 feet .
This Human Effects Advisory Reportnoted that " the Sticky Shocker ’s blunt impact could cause commotio cordis , which will cause death .
It also could cause serious injuries similar to those caused by sports projectiles such as a baseball .
These include contusions , concussions , fractures , internal injuries , eye injuries and dental injuries .
There also may be a low probability of liver fracture . "
Work on the Sticky Shocker was discontinued .
Mitigating the impact force will clearly be a major issue with the new 40 mm projectile .
Long range effectiveness may be a trade - off against a minimum range , and it may be that the weapon cannot be safely used at targets less than ( say ) ten meters away .
The duration of the shock is also likely to be a significant issue .
In Taser training , a one - second shock is administered .
Danger Room 's Editor Noah tried this earlier this year .
" It was brutal - like sticking your finger in a socket over and over and over again .
I screamed in pain as he zapped me .
I screamed some more after it was over , " he whined .
The standard Police Taser gives a five - second shock for each trigger pull .
The XREP projectile produces a twenty - second shock .
The greater standoff range means that it will take that much longer to reach the suspect and apprehend them , so the longer period is required .
The new projectile might continue shocking for as long as three minutes , according to theJNLWD 's own reference book .
Burgei says that the military and the manufacturer have n't yet agreed on the period of incapacitation , though .
" The actual required incapacitation time is still to be determined .
However , the projectile is designed such that the output is controlled by an onboard integrated circuit .
As such , when requirements become solidified , the incapacitation time can be adjusted to meet them . "
It might be less than three minutes –- but it might be more .
The proposed uses include " military law enforcement , detainee operations , vessel boarding , and access control . "
For vessel boarding in particular , it might be desirable to have a longer incapacitation period to ensure that it lasts for long enough for boarders to take control .
The standard Taser does not shock continuously but produces nineteen short shocks per second .
The effects of continuing this for a prolonged period do not seem to have been well explored – understandable , since human testing would amount to torture .
However , a Taser patent application does mention one of the major issues involved : " Because the strike stage and hold stage may immobilize by interfering with skeletal muscle control by the target 's nervous system , a rest stage may allow the target to take a breath . "
This suggests there may be issues with inacapicitation for an extended period .
Taser International takes spends quite a bit of time on safety testing , and the JNLWD have a very thorough vetting process , too .
However , once the technology is out there it is likely to inspire imitators who are less committed to the safety and well - being of the target .

Britain is full of license - plate cameras , cameras used to send you tickets if you 're caught speeding , or driving in the bus-lane , or entering London 's " congestion - charge zone " without paying the daily fee for driving in central London .
And because of Chekhov 's first law of narrative ( " a gun on the mantelpiece in act one will go off by act three " ) , the police have decided to also use these cameras as a surveillance tool , to " catch terrorists " ( and other bad guys ) .
So any police officer can add any license number to the database of " people of interest " and every time that license plate passes a camera , the local police force will receive an urgent alert , and can pull over the car , detain the driver , and search the car and its passengers under the Terrorism Act .
And , of course , police officers are less than discriminating about who they add to this list .
For example , " Catt , 50 , and her 84 - year - old father , John " were added to the list because a police officer noticed their van at three protest demonstrations .
And now Catt and John get pulled over by the police and searched as terrorists .
Environmental activists tend to be pretty forgiving of license - plate cameras , because they 're a critical piece of congestion - charge systems that charge people money for driving instead of using public transit .
This kind of regressive tax ( the £ 10 charge in London is a pittance and no disincentive to the wealthy , and is crippling to the marginal and the poor ) is also much beloved by the law - and - economics crowd , who assume that rational consumers will all be equally disincentivized by a little friction in the system .
But congestion charges require license plate cameras , and license plate cameras are an enormous piece of artillery to hand to the world 's police , who are increasingly pants - wettingly afraid of any sort of public protest — including environmental protests .
I support reducing driving as much as the next green , but environmental change will require lots of protest , and that protest will get exponentially harder with the growth of the traffic cameras that are absolutely integral to congestion charge schemes .
The two anti-war campaigners were not the only law - abiding protesters being monitored on the roads .
Officers have been told they can place " markers " against the vehicles of anyone who attends demonstrations using the national ANPR data centre in Hendon , north London , which stores information on car journeys for up to five years .
Senior officers have been instructed to " fully and strategically exploit " the database , which allows police to mark vehicles with potentially useful inform-ation such as drink - driving convictions .
The use of the ANPR database to flag - up vehicles belonging to protesters has resulted in peaceful campaigners being repeatedly stopped and searched .
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal Kent and Essex police deployed mobile ANPR " interceptor teams " on roads surrounding the protest against the Kingsnorth power station , in Kent , last year .
Activists repeatedly stopped and searched as police officers ' mark ' cars

Miss California USA 2010 Swimsuit Competition PHOTOS
It is Miss California USA pageant weekend and one of the highlights is the parade of swimsuits .
A total of 133 contestants took center stage in Rancho Mirage , California during the weekend of November 20 - 22 , 2009 to compete in the preliminary swimsuit competition .
The goal of these gorgeous contestants was to impress the panel of judges who crowned Miss California USA 2010 on Sunday evening .
Rumor had it that the judges planned to pick two winners after the problems they have had in the past two competitions , where the first runner - up picks stepped in after the 2008 winner Christina Silva was disqualified and the 2009 winner Carrie Prejean was fired .
That turned out to be false .
Winning the title Miss California USA 2010 was Miss Sherwood Nicole Johnson .
First runner - up was Miss Beverly Hills Nana Meriwether .
Second runner - up was Miss Citrus Valley Nia Sanchez .
Third runner - up was Miss Greater San Diego Jessica Morgan .
Fourth runner - up was Miss Tarzana Brandi Lea Milloy .

Susan Sobiegray 's attempts to help a homeless man backfired this week when he kicked in her front door and stole her Thanksgiving turkey .
Sobiegray and other neighbors had been helping the man with food and a place to stay in recent weeks .
But Jackson police say he broke into Sobiegray 's apartment about 11 p.m. Tuesday in the 400 block of W. Michigan Avenue .
" He raided the fridge like it was gold in it , " Sobiegray said .
" It was ridiculous .
He threw all the food all over the kitchen floor , which was n't much . "
The suspect , described as a 300 - pound , 6 - foot man who is bald with blue eyes , fled with Sobiegray 's 13 - pound bird , said Jackson police Lt. Chris Simpson .
" My kids and I are by ourselves , and there is no one to help us , " Sobiegray said .
" I feel really bad that I helped him to have him turn around and do this . "
After seeing the story Wednesday on mlive.com / jackson , Brian Giroux , owner of Engineered Building Systems , volunteered to help .
" Any type of situation like this at this time of year is unacceptable , " Giroux said .
Giroux provided the family with a turkey , stuffing , vegetables and a small ham .
She was also given groceries such as juice and milk .
The incident remains under investigation .
( CNN ) -- A U.S. - flagged ship that played a central role in a bloody hijacking drama last spring was attacked again Wednesday , a busy day for piracy in the dangerous waters off the east coast of Africa .
It was the first time a security team aboard a major merchant ship repelled a pirate attack , a top U.S. Navy officer said .
But a defensive weapon that emits a loud noise did not work , Vice Adm .
Bill Gortney said in a briefing .
" They tried to employ [ a long - range acoustical device ] and it did not have the effect , " said Gortney , the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command , which is responsible for the area favored by pirates .
He said he did not know why the device did not work .
The Maersk Alabama came under automatic weapons fire from pirates about 350 nautical miles east of the Somali coast , the European Union 's anti-piracy force said , but fought the attackers off .
The failed attack came on a day of dramatic piracy events :
The captain of a ship hijacked Monday was confirmed to have died , even as his ship was used to attack another , and a Spanish prosecutor demanded an investigation into reports that a ransom had been paid for a ship released Tuesday .
The failed attack Wednesday targeted the same ship that was hijacked in the Indian Ocean in April .
Its captain , Richard Phillips , was held hostage on a lifeboat for five days before U.S. Navy snipers shot three pirates dead .
A fourth pirate was arrested , and Phillips was rescued .
This time , private security guards on the Danish - owned ship fended off the pirates , EU and U.S. naval sources said .
Security had been beefed up on the vessel since the attack in April , Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers told CNN .
The ship 's owners did not immediately respond to a CNN question about whether Phillips is still captain of the ship .
Somali pirates vowed revenge for the killing of their compatriots by the U.S. Navy in April , but it was not immediately clear if the Maersk Alabama was targeted intentionally or if the latest attack was a coincidence .
No casualties were reported on the ship , but pirates on land in Somalia feared the pirates who attacked the Maersk Alabama may have been killed or wounded , or may have drowned , they told a local journalist .
There has been no contact with them since they attacked the Maersk Alabama , a pirate in the central Somali town of Harardhere said .
Their last communication came while they were battling the security guards on the cargo ship , the pirate said .
Pirates on land also exchanged gunfire -- with one another .
They fought among themselves Wednesday over a multimillion - dollar ransom they received for releasing a Spanish fishing boat , said a local journalist in contact with the pirates .
" There was a heavy exchange of gunfire between some of our friends " one pirate told the journalist , speaking of the other pirates .
" They fought over the 3 million euro ( $ 4.5 million ) received as a ransom from the Spanish boat . "
At least two pirates were wounded in the gunfight in Harardhere , a pirate stronghold in central Somalia , the local journalist told CNN .
Those two pirates are in critical condition and have been transferred to the town of Galka 'yo .
The Alakrana , the Spanish fishing vessel , was freed Tuesday along with its 36 crew members , Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said .
It had been held for 47 days .
Zapatero did not say how the ship was freed .
Spanish media -- including CNN sister station CNN+ , which cited a source it said was close to the negotiations -- reported that a ransom had been paid .
A top prosecutor in Madrid on Wednesday called for an investigation into the reported ransom .
National Court prosecutor Jesus Alonso sent a written request for the ransom investigation to Judge Santiago Pedraz , asking that the financial web involved in the alleged payment be untangled , including commissions paid to intermediaries in the negotiations , CNN + reported from the courthouse .
The prosecutor also called on the judge to take testimony from all the ship 's 36 crew members .
Various government ministers have sidestepped questions about whether a ransom was paid , but Spanish media reported the payment to the pirates totaled $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million .
A leading Spanish fishing industry executive , Juan Manuel Vieites , told CNN on Wednesday that he was certain a ransom was paid for the release of the Spanish tuna trawler .
But Vieites , who heads Euroatun -- a pan-European tuna fishing industry group -- and a Spanish tuna canning association , said he was n't sure about the amount of the ransom .
He declined to provide details .
A day after the hijacking , Spanish military monitoring the situation captured two pirate suspects as they left the fishing boat and later brought them to Madrid .
The two were indicted Monday on 36 counts of kidnapping and armed robbery .
They could face sentences of more than 200 years in prison each because of the multiple kidnapping counts .
Separately , the captain of a chemical tanker seized earlier this week died of a wound inflicted during the hijacking , a pirate said .
The ship , the MV Theresa VIII , was used to attack another ship off the Somali coast , the pirate said , but did not provide any other details .
The Virgin Islands - flagged vessel , with a crew of 28 North Koreans and operated from Singapore , was seized in the Indian Ocean on Monday , according to the EU naval force .
It was heading for Mombasa , Kenya , but was hijacked in the south Somali Basin , about 180 miles northwest of the Seychelles , the EU statement said .
Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia .
Mohamed Amiin Adow and CNN Madrid Bureau Chief Al Goodman in Spain contributed to this report .

Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang visited the site on Saturday afternoon to inspect the rescue effort , while President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao both “ made instructions on the rescue work , ” Xinhua said .
Expressions of concern by top offiicials after mine disasters have become frequent in recent years , as deadly accidents have continued despite repeated efforts to improve safety .
Image Rescuers waited on Saturday to go down a coal mine to search for survivors after a gas explosion at the Xinxing Coal Mine in Hegang , Heilongjiang Province .

Mine disasters are regular occurrences in China ; the worst previously this year appears to have been a blast at the Tunlan coal mine in Shanxi province in northern China in February , which killed 77 and was the largest such incident since 105 miners were killed in December 2007 .
Official data shows that the number of coal mining deaths has been cut in half since 2002 , to 3,210 last year , although some mine disasters continue to be covered up .
The explosion on Saturday was unusual in that it involved a large mine operated by one of China ’s biggest state - owned companies , the Heilongjiang Longmei Holding Mining Group .
Xinhua said that 420 miners had survived and reached the surface , out of 528 who were underground at the time of the blast , a shock so powerful that it partly collapsed mine buildings at the surface .
Most of the deaths in Chinese mines occur in small , unlicensed operations that the national government has tried to shut down .
But the authorities often meet resistance from mine owners , who find these operations profitable , and from local officials who want to create jobs and may have corrupt links to the mine owners .

White House counsel Greg Craig says he 'll resign ; he 'll be replaced by Democratic elections lawyer Bob Bauer .
Greg Craig steps down
President Barack Obama announced on Friday that White House counsel Greg Craig will resign and named as his replacement Robert Bauer , a Democratic election lawyer who also has served as Obama ’s personal lawyer .
Craig fell into disfavor with other top officials over his handling of Obama ’s plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison .
The announcement , made in a written statement , came just hours after the president arrived in Japan for a weeklong trip to Asia .

The White House said Bauer , currently lead counsel to the Democratic National Committee , would take over by year ’s end .
In the statement , Obama praised Craig as a “ close friend and trusted adviser who tackled many tough challenges as White House counsel . ”
He cited Craig ’s work in helping to select Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor , setting new ethics policies at the White House and crafting new legal policies regarding national security .
In a letter to the president , Craig said , “ It has been a busy first year , and I feel very lucky to have been part of it . ”
Neither man mentioned Gitmo .
But Craig ’s exit was announced on the same day that Attorney General Eric Holder will announce the U.S. is bringing five detainees from Guantanamo Bay — including self - proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed — to New York City to stand trial .
Holder told reporters Friday he was surprised by Craig ’s departure and said he should not shoulder all the blame for missteps in the Gitmo process .
“ It was a surprise , " Holder said .
" Greg Craig is a great lawyer .
He has , I think , contributed in a significant way to the success of this administration and I think to the success of the effort to close Guantanamo .
Greg is a friend of mine and those who have tried to place on him , I think , an unfair proportion of the blame as to why things have not proceeded , perhaps as we 've wanted , with respect to Guantanamo , that is simply unfair . "
Supporters of the administration ’s efforts to close Guantanamo said they were concerned that the timing of Craig ’s departure could be interpreted as a signal that Obama is wavering in his commitment to closing the prison , which currently houses about 200 terror suspects .
In recent weeks , officials have acknowledged that the administration is unlikely to meet Obama ’s self - imposed deadline to shutter the facility by Jan. 22 .
Craig ’s critics said he failed to anticipate the wave of criticism in Congress , which led to a series of lopsided votes last spring against bringing any Guantanamo detainees to the U.S.
While many observers said it was a mistake to ask Congress for $ 80 million to close Guantanamo before being ready to announce where the prisoners would go in the U.S. and how they would be tried , Craig ’s allies said the notion that he decided such issues of legislative strategy by himself was preposterous .
“ The policy on Guantanamo that Obama inherited was a complete mess — legally , practically , and every which way .
Cleaning it up was never going to be easy or pretty , and it was always going to involve difficult choices .
But the president identified it as an early priority , and he was fortunate to have Greg in there forcing people to make those choices , ” Elissa Massimino of Human Rights First said early Friday .
“ The guy charged with getting that done is never going to be popular .
But he has been effective .
And eventually , when the 9/11 plotters are finally brought to justice in federal court , Greg will deserve a portion of the credit . ”
According to officials , the White House took much of the Guantanamo portfolio away from Craig earlier this year , handing most policy issues to the National Security Council , legislative issues to Obama senior adviser Pete Rouse , and communications issues to deputy communications director Dan Pfeiffer .
Craig , 64 , also faced criticism for delays in the vetting process and for the White House being blindsided by a Justice Department legal brief which caused outrage among many of Obama ’s gay supporters .
Craig was also faulted for other law - related distractions for the White House , such as the release of Bush - era legal memos about interrogation of terror suspects and a decision , later reversed , to release photos of prisoners allegedly abused in U.S. custody overseas .
Craig ’s impending departure was widely rumored for months , though through most of the summer aides dismissed the talk as a “ parlor game . ”
In an interview last month , Craig steadfastly denied that he was on his way out .
" I have no plans to leave whatsoever , " Craig told the National Law Journal on Oct. 12 .
" The rumors that I 'm about to leave are false .
The reports that I 'm about to leave are wrong .
I have no plans to leave . "
The news of Craig ’s departure and Bauer ’s selection came just days after other personnel reshuffles that may have been related .
Last week , Craig ’s deputy , Cassandra Butts , announced she was leaving for a legal post at an international development and debt relief agency .
And earlier this week , the White House ’s interim Communications Director Anita Dunn , who is Bauer ’s wife , announced she was transitioning to a part - time , consultant role .
Obama said of Bauer , “ Bob has served as a trusted counselor for many years to many elected officials and is known as a tough and widely respected advocate , ” said Obama .
“ Bob is well - positioned to lead the counsel ’s office as it addresses a wide variety of responsibilities , including managing the large amount of litigation the administration inherited , identifying judicial nominees for the federal courts , and assuring that White House officials continue to be held to the highest legal and ethical standards .
As recently as late last month , Bauer had declined to say whether he was being vetted for the position as Obama ’s top in - house lawyer .
Bauer this year assumed the position of lead counsel to the Democratic National Committee .
He also continued to represent the Obama presidential campaign as it wound down its still considerable operations , as well as Obama and his family in personal matters , such as the federal investigation of disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , and political matters stemming from Obama ’s presidential campaign .
Bauer , a partner at the power law firm Perkins Coie , had long been a major player in campaign finance circles , but he transcended that wonky orbit during the presidential race , when he became a character in some key campaign story lines .
He explained Obama ’s broken promise to participate in a public finance system by asserting that the lead lawyer for Republican John McCain was unwilling to negotiate the terms of such an arrangement ( an account McCain ’s lawyer flatly rejected ) .
Bauer also famously ambushed a press conference call held by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ’s campaign to challenge her campaign ’s accusations that Obama supporters violated caucus rules .
Though Bauer is an unquestioned Obama insider , his legal track record and stances on the issues have n’t always jibed with Obama ’s stances .
Obama has long cast himself as an advocate for reducing the role of special interest cash in politics .
But Bauer until a few years ago had been a vocal critic of certain efforts to restrict political spending .
In fact , a case he brought in 2005 on behalf of EMILY ’s List recently resulted in a sweeping federal court ruling that experts predict could pave the way for a flood of new 527 spending that could target Obama in his 2012 reelection campaign .
In addition , while Obama has pledged to fix the public financing system as president , Bauer in a 2005 blog post suggested such effort could be futile because public “ support is needed and not forthcoming . "

Iarnród Éireann has said it expects there will be a reliable and punctual rail service on the Dublin - Belfast line tomorrow .
The company said it was forced into placing restrictions on the line this morning as services resumed after a three - month break .
Services had been curtailed since August after part of the Malahide Viaduct collapsed into the estuary at the north Dublin town .
Speaking on RTÉ Radio ’s Drivetime , Iarnród Eireann spokesman Barry Kenny apologised for delays this morning .
However , a spokesman for Rail Users Ireland , Mark Gleeson , said he was unhappy with services on the line today and how Iarnród Éireann communicated with its passengers .
An investigation into the cause of the collapse is expected to be completed early next year .
Driver has lucky escape
A train driver had a lucky escape this morning after his out of service train hit a landslide south of Wicklow forcing one carriage to come off the rail line .
Mr Kenny said the driver was not injured in the incident .
The Iarnród Éireann spokeman said up to 500 daily commuters will be affected by a decision to close the rail line between Wicklow and Gorey .
He said that a decision was taken on Saturday to close the Arklow to Gorey line due to the instability of an embankment .
He said that following this morning 's landslide , the line between Wicklow and Gorey will remain closed for two weeks .
Bus transfers are in operation for rail services between Wicklow and Gorey .
" You 're bringing together neuroscience , cognitive science , psychology , behaviour and robotics information system to look at the cross disciplinary projects we can do in this space , " Professor Wiles said .
" We 're doing a combination of the fundamental science and the translation into the technology and that 's one of the great benefits of our project . "
The group aims to advance robotic technology by decoding the way human and animal brains work to equip machines with the ability to operate in the real world .
" There 's a strong connection to cognition - the way the brain works as a whole - and navigation , so what we 've been doing is studying the fundamental of navigation in animals and taking the algorithms we 've learnt from those and putting them into robots , " Professor Wiles said .
Over the next two decades , she sees robots becoming more and more important , expanding from their current roles as cleaners , assemblers and drones and into smarter machines more closely integrated with human beings in the form of replacement limbs and joints .
" It 's not going to be the robots and us .
Already a lot of people are incorporating robot components ; people who have had a leg amputated who now have a knee and in the knee .
It is effectively a fully - articulated robotic knee [ with ] a lot of the spring in the step that a natural knee has , " Professor Wiles said .
" The ability of robots to replace component parts is an area which is going to be growing .
" This is where you 're going to blur the line between technology and biology when you start to interface these two fields . "
The bee , whose brain is a tiny as a sesame seed , already has better navigation abilities than even our best robots .
At UQ , the team is working on developing computer codes or algorithms that would enable a robot to " learn " rapidly about its near environment and navigate within it .
" Navigation is quite an intriguing skill because it is so intrinsic to what we do and we are really not aware of it unless we have a poor sense of navigation , " Professor Wiles said .
" The kind of navigation we are dealing with is how you get from one place to another , right across town or from one room in a building to another you can't see . "
With about four million robots in households right now , performing menial chores such as vacuuming the carpet , improvements in navigation has the potential to widen the scope of these creations to take a larger place in everyday life .
According to Professor Wiles , the ability to rapidly process information and apply it to the area they are working in will give robots the edge into the future .
" Robots need to learn new environments very rapidly and that 's what a lot of our work focuses on .
" When you take a robot out of the box you do n't want to program into it with the architecture of your house , you want the robot to explore the house and learn it very quickly , " Professor Wiles said .
" Household robotics is going to be really big in the next 15 years or so and this is one of the things you need is for robots to be able to look after themselves in space . "
But as Australian universities and international research institutes look into replicating the individual parts of biological creatures and mimic them in machines , the question of intelligence inevitably become more important .
While the sometimes frightening scenarios played out in science fiction novels and films - where so often robots lay waste to humanity - remains securely in the realm of fantasy , Professor Wiles believes that some day machines will think like us .
" There 's strong AI [ artificial intelligence ] and weak AI .
Strong AI says there will be artificially intelligent creatures which are not biological .
Weak AI says they will have a lot of the algorithms and they do already have a lot of those algorithms , " she said .
" The bee , whose brain is a tiny as a sesame seed , already has better navigation abilities than even our best robots .
" So we have a little way to go before robots reach biological intelligence let alone human intelligence but I do n't see why we should n't take steps towards it . "

Interesting Private Investigator and Private Detective Information
A private investigator or private detective is a person who can be contracted by individuals , companies and organisations etc to undertake a range of different investigations .
Private investigators often work for authorities .
Many private investigators work for insurance companies to investigate suspicious insurance claims .
Before the advent of no - fault divorce , many private investigators were hired to search out evidence of adultery or other illegal conduct within marriage to establish grounds for a divorce A private investigator and private detective will usually come from a background of police , military , government , home office , bodyguards and security guards .
A private investigator can be expected to keep detailed notes and to be prepared to testify in court regarding any of their observations on behalf of their clients .
A Private Investigator and Private Detective also engage in a large variety of work that is not usually associated with the industry in the mind of the public .
For example , many Private Investigators and Private Detectives are involved in process serving , the personal delivery of summons , subpoenas and other legal documents to parties in a legal case .
The tracing of absconding debtors can also form a large part of a Private Investigator 's work load .
Many Private Investigator and Private Detective agencies may specialize in a particular field of expertise .
Private investigators and private detectives can also perform various other types of surveillance and searches .
A private investigator will verify facts for example an individual 's income or the address of where a individual is employed and if required a private investigator may make phone calls or visit locations to verify particular details etc .
In other cases involving missing persons and background checks , a private investigator will interview people to gather as much information as possible .
Private investigators and private detectives can go undercover , in order to get information or to observe a subject inconspicuously .
A private investigator and private detective can carry out long - term covert observation of a person suspected of fraud .
If an private investigator observes the person performing an activity that contradicts claims that a individual has made in a compensation claim , the investigator can take video evidence or photographs to document / record all the activity and provide a detailed report it to the client etc
Private investigators will very often specialize in particular areas .
A private investigator for example will specialize in building financial profiles on individuals and carrying out asset searches .
The ending reports reflect information that is gathered by the private investigator and private detective through interviews , investigation , surveillance , and research , including reviews of documents .
A private investigator may collect information's on the parties to a litigation , take photographs , testify in court , and assemble strong evidence and reports for trials to be undertaken .
Women should be given the right to know whether their partner has a history of committing domestic abuse , and violent men who drive their wives and girlfriends to suicide could be charged with killing them , police said yesterday .
Recommendations made yesterday by senior officers will target Britain 's estimated 25,000 serial domestic abusers who could be required to register on a police database similar to that being piloted under anti-paedophile schemes .
It would give women the " right to know " whether they and their children were safe from aggressive men .
Alongside the proposals , which would need to be approved by Parliament , there would be a new offence of " liability for suicide " which could make it easier for prosecutors to secure successful convictions .
It is hoped this would reduce the suicide rate – one in three women who kill themselves have been abused by their partner .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Police say it could be instrumental in tackling so - called honour violence directed against Asian women in the UK who are two and a half times more likely to end their lives than white women .
A similar " abatement to suicide " law has been operation in India for 25 years and Swedish women also have similar protection .
One victim who was driven to the edge was Natasha Reilly , 19 , who was regularly attacked by her one - time boyfriend .
She became depressed and twice attempted suicide , and after a final attack was left nursing a number of injuries including a black eye , bruises and a cut face .
Despite the violence inflicted on her , she said : " He had beaten me up countless times and I had been a fool and forgiven him because I was so frightened . "
The review by the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) was ordered by former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith amid mounting concern that too little was being done to protect women from abusive partners and their families .
The report said the new laws would act as a " powerful deterrent " to potential abusers and that existing legislation was over - reliant on a single incident to establish proof when abuse cases come to court .
The Home Secretary , Alan Johnson , welcomed the recommendations which include the power of judges to issue " go orders " , preventing violent men visiting a woman 's home for two weeks .
" Violence against women and girls is never acceptable .
Our biggest challenge is preventing it from happening in the first place and changing attitudes that condone it , particularly among young men , " he said .
Wiltshire Chief Constable Brian Moore accepted there could be opposition to the creation of another database containing the personal details of abusers , some of whom may not have been convicted of a specific offence .
Under the scheme , offenders who repeatedly beat women would have to notify police if they moved house or changed their name .
Relevant agencies could approach a vulnerable woman if her new partner has a history of abuse or women could access information on their partners if they had reason to fear for their safety .
Mr Moore said that adding the name of every domestic abuser would " deluge " the authorities and the register should focus on repeat offenders .
A study based on data gathered by Northumbria Police found that 18 per cent of domestic offenders went on to attack another woman , supporting a 2004 study in the London area into 400 sexual assaults and domestic attacks .
Earlier this year , it was estimated that one in five of all violent crimes was related to domestic violence .
But Sandra Horley , of domestic violence charity Refuge , questioned the need for more laws .
" As it stands , almost three - quarters of abused women do not report the abuse they suffer to the police and many feel they have been badly let down by the system .
Clearly , this needs to change , " she said .
Jewish World Review Nov. 15 , 2009 / 28 Mar - Cheshvan 5770 A jihadist hiding in plain sight By Mark Steyn
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
Shortly after 9/11 , there was a lot of talk about how no one would ever hijack an American airliner ever again  not because of new security arrangements but because an alert citizenry was on the case :
We were hip to their jive .
The point appeared to be proved three months later on a U.S. - bound Air France flight .
The " Shoebomber " attempted to light his footwear , and the flight attendants and passengers pounced .
As the more boorish commentators could not resist pointing out , even the French guys walloped him .
But the years go by , and the mood shifts .
You did n't have to be " alert " to spot Maj.
Nidal Hasan .
He 'd spent most of the past half - decade walking around with a big neon sign on his head saying " JIHADIST .
STAND WELL BACK . "
But we ( that 's to say , almost all of us ; and certainly almost anyone who matters in national security and the broader political culture ) are now reflexively conditioned to ignore the flashing neon sign .
Like those apocryphal Victorian ladies discreetly draping the lasciviously curved legs of their pianos , if a glimpse of hard unpleasant reality peeps through we simply veil it in another layer of fluffy illusions .
Two joint terrorism task forces became aware almost a year ago that Maj .
Hasan was in regular e-mail contact with Anwar al - Awlaqi , the American - born but now Yemeni - based cleric who served as imam to three of the 9/11 hijackers and supports all - out holy war against the United States .
But the expert analysts in the Pentagon determined that this lively correspondence was consistent with Maj .
Hasan 's " research interests , " so there was no need to worry .
That 's America : Technologically superior , money no object ( not one but two " joint terrorism task forces " stumbled across him ) .
Yet no action was taken .
On the other hand , who needs surveillance operations and intelligence budgets ?
Maj .
Hasan was entirely upfront about who he was .
He put it on his business card : " SOA . "
As in " Soldier of Allah "  which seems a tad ungrateful to the American taxpayers who ponied up half a million bucks or thereabouts in elite medical school education to train him to be a Soldier of Uncle Sam .
In a series of meetings during 2008 , officials from both Walter Reed and the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences considered the question of whether then - Capt .
Hasan was psychotic .
But , according to at least one bigwig at Walter Reed , members of the policy committee wondered " how would it look if we kick out one of the few Muslim residents . "
So he got promoted to major and shipped to Fort Hood , Texas .
And 13 men and women and an unborn baby are dead .
Well , like they say , it 's easy to be wise after the event .
I 'm not so sure .
These days , it 's easier to be even more stupid after the event .
" Apparently , he tried to contact al - Qaida , " mused MSNBC's Chris Matthews .
" That 's not a crime to call up al - Qaida , is it ?
Is it ?
I mean , where do you stop the guy ? "
Interesting question :
Where do you draw the line ?
The truth is , we 're not prepared to draw a line even after he 's gone ahead and committed mass murder .
" What happened at Fort Hood was a tragedy , " said Gen .
Casey , the Army 's chief of staff , " but I believe it would be an even greater tragedy if our diversity becomes a casualty here . "
A " greater tragedy " than 14 dead and dozens of wounded ?
Translating from the original brain - addled multicult - speak , the Army chief of staff is saying that the same fatuous prostration before marshmallow illusions that led to the " tragedy " must remain in place .
If it leads to occasional mass murder , well , hopefully it can be held to what cynical British civil servants used to call , during the Northern Irish " Troubles " , " an acceptable level of violence . "
Fourteen dead is evidently acceptable .
A hundred and forty ?
Fourteen hundred ?
I guess we 'll find out .
" Diversity " is one of those words designed to absolve you of the need to think .
Likewise , a belief in " multiculturalism " does n't require you to know anything at all about other cultures , just to feel generally warm and fluffy about them .
Heading out from my hotel room the other day , I caught a glimpse of that 7 - Eleven video showing Major Hasan wearing " Muslim " garb to buy a coffee on the morning of his murderous rampage .
And it was n't until I was in the taxi cab that something odd struck me :
He is an American of Arab descent .
But he was wearing Pakistani dress  that 's to say , a " Punjabi suit , " as they call it in Britain , or the " shalwar kameez , " to give it its South Asian name .
For all the hundreds of talking heads droning on about " diversity " across the TV networks , it was only Tarek Fatah , writing in The Ottawa Citizen , who pointed out that no Arab males wear this get - up  with one exception :
Those Arab men who got the jihad fever and went to Afghanistan to sign on with the Taliban and al - Qaida .
In other words , Maj .
Hasan 's outfit symbolized the embrace of an explicit political identity entirely unconnected with his ethnic heritage .
Mr. Fatah would seem to be a genuine " multiculturalist " :
That 's to say , he 's attuned to often very subtle " diversities " between cultures .
Whereas the professional multiculturalist sees the 7 - Eleven video and coos , " Aw , look .
He 's wearing … well , something exotic and colorful , let 's not get hung up on details .
Celebrate diversity , right ?
Can we get him in the front row for the group shot ?
We may be eligible for a grant . "
The brain - addled " diversity " of Gen .
Casey will get some of us killed , and keep all of us cowed .
In the days since the killings , the news reports have seemed increasingly like a satirical novel that the author 's not quite deft enough to pull off , with bizarre new Catch - 22s multiplying like the windmills of your mind :
If you 're openly in favor of pouring boiling oil down the throats of infidels , then the Pentagon will put down your e-mails to foreign jihadists as mere confirmation of your long - established " research interests . "
If you 're psychotic , the Army will make you a psychiatrist for fear of provoking you .
If you gun down a bunch of people , within an hour the FBI will state clearly that we can all relax , there 's no terrorism angle , because , in our over - credentialized society , it does n't count unless you 're found to be carrying Permit # 57982BQ3a from the relevant State Board of Jihadist Licensing .
Ezra Levant , my comrade in a long battle to restore freedom of speech to Canada , likes to say that the Danish cartoons crisis may one day be seen as a more critical event than 9/11 .
Not , obviously , in the comparative death tolls but in what each revealed about the state of Western civilization .
After 9/11 , we fought back , hit hard , rolled up the Afghan camps ; after the cartoons , we weaseled and equivocated and appeased and signaled that we were willing to trade core Western values for a quiet life .
Watching the decadence and denial on display this past week , I think in years to come Fort Hood will be seen in a similar light .
What happened is not a " tragedy " but a national scandal , already fading from view .

" America Alone : The End of the World as We Know It "
It 's the end of the world as we know it ...
Someday soon , you might wake up to the call to prayer from a muezzin .
Europeans already are .
And liberals will still tell you that " diversity is our strength " while Talibanic enforcers cruise Greenwich Village burning books and barber shops , the Supreme Court decides sharia law does n't violate the " separation of church and state , " and the Hollywood Left decides to give up on gay rights in favor of the much safer charms of polygamy .
If you think this can't happen , you have n't been paying attention , as the hilarious , provocative , and brilliant Mark Steyn the most popular conservative columnist in the English - speaking world shows to devastating effect in this , his first and eagerly awaited new book on American and global politics .
The future , as Steyn shows , belongs to the fecund and the confident .
And the Islamists are both , while the Westwedded to a multiculturalism that undercuts its own confidence , a welfare state that nudges it toward sloth and self - indulgence , and a childlessness that consigns it to oblivion is looking ever more like the ruins of a civilization .
Europe , laments Steyn , is almost certainly a goner .
The future , if the West has one , belongs to America alone with maybe its cousins in brave Australia .
But America can survive , prosper , and defend its freedom only if it continues to believe in itself , in the sturdier virtues of self - reliance ( not government ) , in the centrality of family , and in the conviction that our country really is the world 's last best hope .
Steyn argues that , contra the liberal cultural relativists , America should proclaim the obvious : we do have a better government , religion , and culture than our enemies , and we should spread America 's influence around the world for our own sake as well as theirs .
Mark Steyn's America
Alone is laugh - out - loud funny  but it will also change the way you look at the world .
It is sure to be the most talked - about book of the year .

At first glance , the piece of metal in Steve Myers 's hands could be taken for a harmonica or a pen .
Only on closer inspection can you make out its true nature .
Myers , director of accelerators at the Cern particle physics laboratory outside Geneva , is clutching a section of copper piping from which a flat electrical cable is protruding .
It looks unremarkable .
Yet a piece of cable like this one was responsible last year for the world 's most expensive short - circuit .
More than £ 30 m - worth of damage was done to the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , the most advanced particle accelerator ever built , a few days after its ceremonial opening .
It has taken Myers – and hundreds of other Cern scientists – more than a year to pinpoint the guilty piece of cable and repair the wreckage .
" It was a very small piece , but it did immense damage , " he said .
It remains to be seen whether Myers can fix Cern 's tattered technological reputation in the process – when his team restart their great machine in a few weeks .
" I am not a nervous person , " said the 63 - year - old Belfast - born engineer .
" And that is probably just as well . "
The LHC had been inaugurated at 9.30 am on 10 September 2008 to a barrage of global media attention .
This was the God Machine that would unravel the secrets of the universe , it was claimed .
Beams of protons , one of the key constituents of the atom 's nucleus , were successfully fired round the machine 's subterranean 18 - mile circular tunnel under the Jura mountains outside Geneva .
Over the following weeks , it was predicted , scientists would recreate conditions that existed a trillionth of a second after the universe 's birth and start making sensational discoveries as they smashed beams of protons into each other .
Discoveries would include the God Particle , a tiny entity also called the Higgs Boson , which is believed to give objects – including people – their mass .
In addition , dark matter , a mysterious , invisible form of matter that permeates the universe , would be uncovered , along with a host of other revolutionary discoveries .
" It was all looking so good , " said Myers .
Then , at 11.45 am on 19 September , things went spectacularly wrong .
Faulty soldering in a small section of cable carrying power to the machine 's huge magnets caused sparks to arc across its wiring and send temperatures soaring inside a sector of the LHC tunnel .
A hole was punched in the protective pipe that surrounds the cable and released helium , cooled to minus 271C , into a section of the collider tunnel .
Pressure valves failed to vent the gas and a shock wave ran though the tunnel .
" The LHC uses as much energy as an aircraft carrier at full speed , " said Myers .
" When you release that energy suddenly , you do a lot of damage . "
Firemen sent into the blackened , stricken collider found that dozens of the massive magnets that control its proton beams had been battered out of position .
Soot and metal powder , vaporised by the explosion , coated much of the delicate machinery .
" It took us a long time to find out just how serious the accident was , " said Myers .
A 400 - metre chunk of the £ 2.5 bn device had been wrecked , it was discovered .
Worse , when scientists traced the cause to a tiny piece of soldering , they realised that they would have to redesign major parts of the collider 's entire safety systems to prevent a repeat event .
That has taken more than a year to achieve .
Now Cern scientists have begun firing protons round one small section of the collider as they prepare for its re-opening .
Over the next few weeks , more and more bunches of protons will be put into the machine until , by Christmas , beams will be in full flight and can be collided .
The LHC will then start producing results – 13 years after work on its construction began .
" There was so much expectation that we were about to make great discoveries last year and then the accident occurred , " said Cern researcher Alison Lister .
" Morale was very low when we found out just how bad it was .
However , we should now be getting results by Christmas , and you could n't get a better present than that . "
When fully operational , the LHC will soak up 10 times more power than any other particle accelerator on Earth , consuming 120 megawatts of electricity – enough for an entire Swiss canton – to accelerate bunches of protons , kept in two beams , each less than a hair 's breadth in diameter , to speeds that will come " within a gnat 's whisker of the speed of light " , according to Myers .
One beam will circulate clockwise , the other anti-clockwise .
Then , at four points along the collider 's tunnel , the beams will cross .
Bunches of protons – each containing 100bn particles – will slam into other oncoming bunches , triggering collisions that will fling barrages of sub-atomic detritus in all directions .
These explosive interactions will form the core of the great collider 's operations and will generate new types of particle , including the Higgs , that will pop fleetingly into existence before disintegrating into a trail of other sub-atomic entities .
New physics will be uncovered with Nobel prizes following in their wake .
And that is not all , say sceptics .
They argue that miniature black holes will be created and one of these could eventually grow to swallow up the Earth .
The LHC would then not only be the world 's biggest experiment – but its last .
This fear has led protesters to make legal attempts to close down the LHC , one even making it to the European Court of Human Rights .
All have failed , though one case – in Germany – has still to be resolved .
Even stranger is the claim by another group of physicists who say the production of Higgs bosons may be so abhorrent to nature that their creation would ripple backwards through time to stop the collider before it could make one , like a time traveller trying to halt his own birth .
" All Higgs machines shall have bad luck , " said Dr Holger Bech Nielsen of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen .
Thus the cable meltdown that afflicted the LHC was an inevitable effect of the laws of time , a notion that leaves most Cern scientists scratching their heads in bafflement .
In fact , the real problem facing the LHC is simple .
It is a vast device the size of London 's Circle Line but is engineered to a billionth of a metre accuracy .
Ensuring that no flaws arise at scales and dimensions like these pushes engineering to its absolute limits .
Cern almost succeeded last year .
Now it is convinced that it has got it right this time .
" All I can say is that the LHC is a much safer , much better understood machine than it was a year ago , " said Myers .
Most physicists believe he is right .
" If it works , we will have built the most complex machine in history , " said one .
" If not , we will have assembled the world 's most expensive piece of modern art . "
As Congress debates the merits of the “ public option ” for health insurance , we might look at Florida for some experience , because Florida has had a public option for years , not for health insurance but for property insurance .
After Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992 some Floridians were having difficulty purchasing homeowners ’ insurance .
( The reason : rates are regulated , and at the regulated rates some properties are too great a risk . )
So , the state government formed Citizens Property Insurance Corporation , which is owned and operated by the State of Florida .
As originally envisioned , Citizens would charge rates above those charged by private insurers , to make Citizens the insurer of last resort .
Nevertheless , Citizens found plenty of customers .
After two bad hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 property insurance rates in Florida rose , and in his campaign for the office , current Governor Charlie Crist promised voters that if elected he would see that their property insurance bills “ dropped like a rock . ”
One tactic he used was to change Citizens ’ rate structure so it was competitive with private insurers .
His idea , like President Obama ’s idea with health insurance , is that with a public option , private insurers would have to keep their rates in line or risk losing customers to the government insurer .
That ’s what ’s happened in Florida .
Today about 30 % of homeowners ’ policies are written by Citizens , which is the largest property insurer in the state .
It ’s about to get bigger too .
The largest private insurer , State Farm , had a rate request rejected last year , and now is pulling out of the state altogether ( for property insurance ; they ’ll still insure your car ) .
As the largest private insurer pulls out over a three - year period ( that period negotiated with the state ) , Citizens will get an even larger share of Florida ’s property insurance .
Everybody in Florida knows Citizens is a fiscal time bomb .
Already , every Florida insurance policy ( on homes , boats , cars , etc. ) pays a surcharge that goes to Citizens , but Citizens still does n’t have sufficient reserves to weather a major hurricane .
When one comes , Florida taxpayers will be on the hook for the bill .
The legislature knows this , and actually passed a bill last year that would have done a great deal to solve the problem by partially deregulating rates private insurers could charge .
State Farm would have stayed in Florida had that bill taken effect , but it was vetoed by the Governor .
The public option is displacing private insurance .
In Florida , the public option has meant a substantial socialization of insurance , subsidization of the public option by those who take a private option , and the creation of a fiscally - unsound public insurance company despite the subsidy .
Now , we have an opportunity to do the same thing at the national level with health insurance .
The results have not been good in Florida , and everyone in Florida knows it .
Why would it be any different at the national level ?
The de facto government of Honduras suspended constitutional guarantees indefinitely late Sunday , outlawing public gatherings and making it easier for the army to make arrests .
The measure , announced on a nationwide simultaneous television and radio broadcast , came on the eve of a potentially enormous march by ousted President Manuel Zelaya ’s supporters .
From his refuge at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa , the Honduran capital , Zelaya called on people to take to the streets today to mark the three - month anniversary of his ouster .
The army took Zelaya from his home June 28 and put him on a flight to Costa Rica , after courts accused him of violating the constitution by trying to make it possible to serve a second term .
He sneaked back into the country last week and holed up at the embassy .
With universal international backing , he is fighting to reclaim his office .
Earlier Sunday , Honduras expelled diplomats from the Organization of American States , which has been attempting to mediate the crisis , and gave Brazil 10 days to turn over Zelaya or face unspecified retaliation .

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said his government would not be cowed by ultimatums from “ coup plotters . ”
Acting Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez said OAS officials had failed to give advance notice of their arrival .
He suggested that if Brazil does n’t recognize the de facto government , the embassy should remove its flag and shield and revert to a private office -- which presumably would eliminate the diplomatic status that protects Zelaya from arrest .
Zelaya and his followers are living in conditions that a visiting doctor described as deteriorating .
Several in the embassy are ill with flu - like symptoms , the doctor told The Times .
Honduras ’ acting rulers have said that if they can , they will arrest Zelaya , a timber magnate who gradually turned to the left and alienated the nation ’s elite .
The rulers have accused him of inciting violence from within the embassy .

Sunday ’s announcement went beyond the curfews that acting President Roberto Micheletti had imposed .
The new measures make it easier for authorities to shut down radio or television stations deemed to be favoring Zelaya .
On Sunday evening , Channel 36 , a pro-Zelaya television station , abruptly disappeared from the air .

Rupert Murdoch says he will remove stories from Google 's search index as a way to encourage people to pay for content online .
In an interview with Sky News Australia , the mogul said that newspapers in his media empire – including the Sun , the Times and the Wall Street Journal – would consider blocking Google entirely once they had enacted plans to charge people for reading their stories on the web .
In recent months , Murdoch his lieutenants have stepped up their war of words with Google , accusing it of " kleptomania " and acting as a " parasite " for including News Corp content in its Google News pages .
But asked why News Corp executives had not chosen to simply remove their websites entirely from Google 's search indexes – a simple technical operation – Murdoch said just such a move was on the cards .
" I think we will , but that 's when we start charging , " he said .
" We have it already with the Wall Street Journal .
We have a wall , but it 's not right to the ceiling .
You can get , usually , the first paragraph from any story - but if you 're not a paying subscriber to WSJ.com all you get is a paragraph and a subscription form . "
The 78 - year - old mogul 's assertion , however , is not actually correct : users who click through to screened WSJ.com articles from Google searches are usually offered the full text of the story without any subscription block .
It is only users who find their way to the story through the Wall Street Journal 's website who are told they must subscribe before they can read further .
Murdoch added that he did not agree with the idea that search engines fell under " fair use " rules - an argument many aggregator websites use as part of their legal justification for reproducing excerpts of news stories online .
" There 's a doctrine called fair use , which we believe to be challenged in the courts and would bar it altogether ... but we 'll take that slowly . "
Murdoch 's attitude towards the internet - which appeared to have thawed when he bought social networking site MySpace for $ 580 m in 2005 - has stiffened more recently .
Over the summer , Murdoch had announced that he planned to introduce website charges by next year - but last week it emerged that his controversial plans had been delayed , saying that " I would n't promise that we 're going to meet that date " .
Additionally , it emerged that MySpace , which has struggled in the face of competition from Facebook in recent years , was due to fall short of its targets in a lucrative search deal with Google – a slip that could cost the site more than $ 100 m in payments from the internet advertising giant .
In the Sky News Australia interview , Murdoch underlined his feelings towards those companies by listing a litany of names of those that he felt were overstepping the boundaries .
" The people who simply just pick up everything and run with it – steal our stories , we say they steal our stories - they just take them , " he said .
" That 's Google , that 's Microsoft , that 's Ask.com , a whole lot of people ... they should n't have had it free all the time , and I think we 've been asleep . "
The ancient Nazca civilisation of Peru , made famous by the giant geoglyphs it left etched in the soil , partly triggered its own downfall by chopping down forests and creating a desert , according to researchers .
The society vanished 1,500 years ago after flourishing for centuries , during which it made sophisticated arts and crafts as well as the famous Nazca lines .
A study published today suggests its collapse was caused by the clearing of huarango trees , which had maintained an ecological balance in that corner of South America .
The Nazca wanted land for corn and other crops and did not realise the forests were crucial to soil fertility and moisture , said the Cambridge University - led report .
" In time , gradual woodland clearance crossed an ecological threshold – sharply defined in such desert environments – exposing the landscape to the region 's extraordinary desert winds and the effects of El Niño floods , " said David Beresford - Jones , from the McDonald institute for archaeological research at Cambridge University .
The findings contrast with the stereotype that Native Americans lived in harmony with nature until the voracious European conquest , and follows reports that other ancient cultures suffered similar fates : the Maya of central America abandoned their cities and pyramids after over - intensive use of water and land , while the tribes who erected giant stone statues on Easter Island all but died out after clearing too many trees .
The Nazca – also spelt Nasca – thrived in arid valleys of what is now the southern coast of Peru between 300BC and AD800 .
In addition to the geoglyphs , which endure to this day and are visible from space , they built the ceremonial city of Cahuachi and underground aqueducts .
Researchers found more than 60 huarango stumps preserved in the Samaca basin .
Pollen samples indicated forests were replaced by fields of cotton and corn .
The short - term agricultural gain came at a high price because the trees anchored the landscape .
" It is the ecological ' keystone ' species in this desert zone , enhancing soil fertility and moisture , ameliorating desert extremes in the microclimate beneath its canopy and underpinning the floodplain with one of the deepest root systems of any tree known , " said Beresford - Jones .
Clearances reached a tipping point at which the arid ecosystem was irreversibly damaged , leaving it vulnerable to a big El Niño - style event around AD600 which unleashed strong winds and catastrophic floods , rendering land unusable for agriculture and , eventually , creating a desert .
Had the forests still stood they would have cushioned the impact , said the study .
Instead , the Nazca endured resource wars and their civilisation eventually suffered a " catastrophic " collapse .
The Nazca study 's authors said their findings had contemporary resonance .
There are now no undisturbed ecosystems in the region the Nazca used to call home .
What remained of the old - growth huarango forests is being destroyed by illegal charcoal - burning operations .
" The mistakes of prehistory offer us important lessons for our management of fragile , arid areas in the present , " said Oliver Whaley , of the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew .
The Nazca
The Nazca people carved out a civilisation in southern Peru 's arid valleys long before the Inca empire .
They are best known for the Nazca lines : vast , intricate drawings etched on the desert floor , possibly sacred pathways .
In addition to sophisticated pottery and textiles , the Nazca amassed one of South America 's biggest collection of human trophy heads .
The skulls had a hole drilled into the forehead .
Academics disagree over whether the heads were of distant enemies killed in battle or sacrificial victims from closer to home .
Gillette was last seen wearing a red hooded coat
A woman convicted of murder has gone on the run during an escorted visit to the shops in south London .
Patricia Gillette , 41 , from Streatham , south London , was detained indefinitely in 2007 for killing Mark Murphy , 38 , at his home in Streatham in August 2006 .
Gillette , who was being held at Bethlem Royal Hospital , was on a visit to shops in West Wickham High Street , Bromley , when she escaped on Friday afternoon .
Police described her as " dangerous " and warned people not to approach her .
Det Supt Gary Gornell said : " This individual is dangerous and we need to apprehend her as soon as possible .
If anyone sees her , please do n't approach her , but call police immediately . "
Gillette is of large build , has moles under both eyes , a scar on the left side of her neck and another scar on her left ear , police said .
She was last seen wearing a red hooded coat , a blue jeans shirt , black jogging bottoms and black shoes .

There has been criticism of the use of social media after the Fort Hood shootings
Old social rules do n't seem to work online , says Bill Thompson Last week I sat around a large table on the top floor of Bush House in London with about 20 other people while we talked about the ways radio is changing and tried to imagine how English - language programming on BBC World Service could take advantage of the online , multimedia world that is emerging around us .
I was invited because I appear on Digital Planet each week to think out loud about the impact of technology on our lives , but this was an internal BBC meeting rather than an open seminar , and the discussion was never intended to be made public .
That did n't stop one of the other attendees , BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan - Jones , from recording a segment of the introductory remarks that Ben Hammersley , the associate editor of Wired UK , made and posting it online via AudioBoo .
And it did n't stop several of us tweeting about our presence , or me posting a photo of Rory at his end of the table on yfrog .
A ' panel - eye view ' of the Nominet event None of us revealed the substance of the debate , and the online activity was in some ways just a good way of making the point that the world has changed , but we could easily have crossed the line with an ill - considered tweet .
It was n't the only time that week that I broke the implicit social rules at an event .
On Tuesday I was one of the fortunate few to have acquired a ticket for Boffoonery , a benefit event for Bletchley Park that featured great comics like Robin Ince and Robert Llewellyn performing for a cause that is dear to my heart .
During the show I was taking photos , updating my Facebook status and twittering away in a manner that would have got me kicked out of the National Theatre but seemed entirely appropriate for an event that began with geek pin-up Simon Singh showing us a real enigma machine .
Audience reach I did it again the very next day when I spoke at a conference organised by Nominet , the company that runs the .uk domain name registry .
During a lively panel session I tweeted about the event , posted a photo of the " panel - eye view " and even used Google to look up the details of the ENUM service that translates a VOIP telephone number into a domain name so I could answer a question .
At the end of our session the chair , broadcaster Sarah Montague , expressed her surprise that we been checking our mobile phones so openly .
Wendy Hall , Michele Neylon and I all loudly protested that we had n't been reading e-mails but engaging in debate with the audience , although I 'm not convinced we persuaded her that we were n't just being impolite .
Behaviours developed for the industrial age simply cannot cope with the new possibilities for information sharing .
Bill Thompson
Thanks to the easy connectivity provided by smartphones and the growing number of people connecting online through social media sites it is now possible to reach out to the audience at an event or people anywhere in the world while talking on a panel , speaking on stage or sitting in an audience .
The shift in the boundaries was in the news this week for much more serious and sombre reasons .
On Friday Major Nidal Malik Hasan , an Army psychiatrist , shot dead 13 people and wounded many others at Fort Hood army base in Texas .
Once the military authorities realised what was happening , the base was locked down and information was provided through a US Army spokesperson .
But one of the soldiers caught inside Fort Hood , Tearah Moore , used her cameraphone to tweet and upload photographs throughout the incident .
Tearah Moore has been widely criticised for doing this .
Much of what she said was incorrect , as although she was present she did not actually see much of what was happening , and she seems to have posted without any consideration for the feelings or privacy of those affected .
' Real - time ethics '
One of the most trenchant criticisms of this " social reporting " came from Paul Carr on the technology blog Techcrunch UK , where he argues that " her behaviour had nothing to do with getting the word out ; it was n't about preventing harm to others , but rather a simple case of " look at me looking at this ' " .
Carr also notes that : " For all the sound and fury , citizen journalism once again did nothing but spread misinformation and breach the privacy of those who had been killed or wounded .
We learned not a single new fact , nor was a single life saved . "
The contrast between me tweeting from a conference panel and the tragic events at Fort Hood is of course enormous , but it shows the range of situations now being affected by the new social media .
The challenge posed by easy access to online tools and services affects everything .
Paul Carr does n't believe we can or should try to stop this or censor what is published , but thinks that " we need to get back to a point as a society where - without thinking - we put our humanity before our ego " .
It 's a point echoed by Kathryn Corrick , one of the shrewder observers of the social media scene .
In a typically eloquent blog post on " the ethics of real - time social reporting " she points out that " gossip and news has always travelled quickly .
What 's different is the reach and speed now possible and the wider and deeper impact " .
Today our social rules seem to have been overloaded by our always on , always connected culture .
Behaviours developed for the industrial age simply cannot cope with the new possibilities for information sharing .
We are clearly going to see a lot more inappropriate use of social media before new rules emerge .

Last month ( Day 9 of Cyber Security Awareness Month ) we discussed a Man in the Middle ( MITM ) attack against RDP ( Microsoft ’s Remote Desktop Protocol ) , along with Man in the Middle protections for RDP services .
The article and video illustrate the just how easy it is to mount a man in the middle attack using ARP cache poisoning .
We 've also recently covered recent research in SSL Man in the Middle vulnerabilities and this month 's issues concerning MITM attacks against TLS renegotiation .
Today 's entry discusses network protections that provide mitigation for all services against such attacks ( not just a specific protocol or vulnerability ) .
We ’ll be discussing mitigations that can be applied in most corporate settings ( Private VLANs are n’t covered ) .
Just a quick recap - Layer 2 MITM attacks are often based on ARP poisoning , and the mitigation against this is what we ’ll be discussing today .
ARP poisoning consists of an attacker sending a gratuitous ARP packet ( an unsolicited ARP reply ) to the target hosts , so that the target client and server both think that the attacker is the host at the other end of the conversation .
After this is accomplished , the attacker will now intercept all traffic between the hosts , which can be simply recorded and forwarded on , or modified before forwarding .
A more complete explanation of the mechanics can be found in last month ’s entry ( check the video for the details )
The configuration commands shown in this article are for Cisco IOS , but equivalent commands are available on Brocade , HP and most other managed switches on the market today .
We ’ll be covering DHCP Snooping , Dynamic ARP inspection , IP Source Guard , and Rate Limiting of ARP packets .
DHCP Snooping
DHCP Snooping intercepts all DHCP traffic , and maintains a table of MAC addresses to IP Addresses called a DHCP Snooping binding database .
This sounds a lot like an ARP table , but is used instead to validate ARP traffic to protect against Man in the Middle Attacks which might poison the ARP table .
DHCP Snooping by default blocks all DHCP offer packets inbound to the switch port , which means that if a DHCP server is on that port , the DHCP requests will reach the server , but the addresses will never reach the DHCP client .
So after enabling DHCP snooping , configure any ports that have DHCP servers attached , or uplink to switches with DHCP servers as “ trusted ” .
It makes good sense to periodically store your DHCP Snooping database to flash memory or a tftp or ( preferably ) an scp server .
Without this , if a switch is rebooted , clients on untrusted ports will not have connectivity until they renegotiate a DHCP lease .
Anyone who has ever had a home router ( with its DHCP server ) appear on their corporate network knows how disruptive this can be , and can attest to just how valuable these DHCP snooping functions can be just to mitigate that one situation .
Configuration :
Switch ( config ) # ip dhcp snooping
Enables DHCP snooping globally .
Switch ( config ) # ip dhcp snooping vlan 1,2,6 Enables DHCP snooping on VLANs 1 , 2 and 6 ( this of course will be unique for each site ) Switch ( config ) # int g0/7
Switch ( config - if ) # ip dhcp snooping trust
On the port with the DHCP server ( gig 0/7 in this example ) , enable dhcp snooping trust Switch ( config ) # ip dhcp snooping database tftp://192.168.10.50/dbfile
On bootup , read the dhcp snooping database from a tftp server
Dynamic ARP inspection ( DAI )
This feature uses the table created by the DHCP Snooping feature to validate all ARP responses that arrive inbound to switch ports .
Gratuitious ARPs are integral to all Man in the Middle attacks that use ARP Cache poisoning .
What DAI does is simply drop all ARP replies that do not have corresponding entries in the DHCP Snooping binding database .
ARP reply packets where the MAC address in the body of the packet do not match the MAC address in the Ethernet header are also dropped .
In non DHCP environments , DAI can operate against a statically defined ARP ACL .
Ports that have multiple MAC addresses , such as uplink to physical or virtual switches , should be configured as “ trusted ” , this bypasses all DAI functions .
Configuration :
Switch ( config ) # ip arp inspection vlan 1 Turn on arp inspection for vlan 1 Switch ( config ) # int g0/8
Switch ( config - if ) # ip arp inspection trust trust int g0/8 to have multiple arp entries - for instance , uplinks to
physical or virtual switches , clusters , load balancers in some cases .
IP Source Guard
This feature uses the DHCP Snooping database as well , but takes things one step further .
When a client host powers on , IP Source Guard will filter all traffic to and from that port except for the DHCP request and reply traffic .
Once the address is assigned and the DHCP Snooping entry is populated for the port , any traffic received from that port from a different ip address is filtered .
Configuration :
Switch ( config ) # Int g0/8
Switch ( config - if ) # ip verify source Enable ip source guard on one interface
or
Switch ( config ) # int g0/8
Switch ( config - if ) # ip verify source vlan dhcp - snooping Enable ip source guard for all vlans defined on this interface
Rate Limiting Incoming ARP Packets
Many tools that perform Man in the Middle attacks based on ARP poisoning will generate large volumes of ARP reply packets ( Gratuitous ARPs ) .
Switches can generally be configured to Rate Limit these packets , and in many cases can be configured to either alert if a threshold is exceeded , or to place any ports that exceed a configured threshold in an error state , either for a configured period of time or until manually reset .
By default , when dynamic ARP inspection is configured , ARP packets are rate limited to some default value ( 15 per second on cisco platforms , but this may vary on other switches )
Configuration
Switch ( config - if ) # ip arp inspection limit rate 20 configure arp inspection for 20 packets
per second .
By default , if this is
exceeded , the port is placed into an
" errdisable " state .
Switch ( config - if ) # errdisable recovery cause arp - inspection interval 240 re-enable the errdisable 'd port after
240 seconds .
Caveats and Comments on Layer 2 Network Protections
Many network components require on changing MAC addresses , so care should be taken when defining protections against ARP poisoning .
These features should be disabled on interfaces that have components that have :
Standby features such as vrrp , vrrp-e , hsrp and similar router or firewall clustering applications
load balancers , or hosts configured with load balancing solutions such as Microsoft NLB
Any clustering application such as microsoft , linux , solaris or other clustering solutions
Ports that connect to Vmware ESX vswitch uplink ports , as a vmotion involves a virtual server mac migrating from one physical switch port to another with a corresponding RARP packet after completion .
Switch ports that connect to ESX uplink ports that support load balanced or failover configurations for the ESX Service Console or vmkernel ports .
Features such as rate limiting of ARP packets , Storm control and port security ( these 2 are n't covered in this post ) can simply disable ports if their function is triggered .
Unless configured for recovery , disabled ports remain in an Error Disabled state until manually re-enabled .
Needless to say , this can cause major service disruptions unless implemented carefully .
While there are certainly some things to watch out for in implementing these features , the benefits of configuring the protections we 've discussed almost always outweigh the risks ( by a country mile ) .
Most enterprises should really consider implementing at the very least DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection .
Seems like President Barack Obama — Nobel Peace Laureate Obama — has taken his predecessor ’s predator drone program and jacked it up with steroids .
The New Yorker ’s Jane Mayer reports this week that the number of Obama - authorized strikes in Pakistan equals the sum launched by the Bush Administration — in the last three years of his tenure .
Wow .
And the Republicans were worried that he would n’t be man enough .
Mayer ’s article goes on to detail two predator drone programs — one publicly acknowledged by the U.S Military , the other directed by the C.I.A :
From Mayer : The U.S. government runs two drone programs .
The militaryâ€™s version , which is publicly acknowledged , operates in the recognized war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq , and targets combatants in support of U.S. troops stationed there .
The C.I. A.â€™s program is aimed at terror suspects around the world , including in places where U.S. troops are not based .
The program is classified as covert , and the C.I.A. declines to provide any information to the public about where it operates , how it selects targets , who is in charge , or how many people have been killed .
Nevertheless , reports of fatal air strikes in Pakistan emerge every few days .
According to a new study by the New America Foundation , the number of drone strikes has gone up dramatically since Obama became President .
General Atomics Aeronautical Systems , the defense contractor that manufactures the Predator and its more heavily armed sibling , the Reaper , can barely keep up with the governmentâ€™s demand .
With public disenchantment mounting over the U.S. troop deployment in Afghanistan , many in Washington support an even greater reliance on Predator strikes .
And because of the programâ€™s secrecy , there is no visible system of accountability in place .
Peter W. Singer , the author of â€ œWired for War , â€ a recent book about the robotics revolution in modern combat , argues that the drone program is worryingly â€œseductive , â€ because it creates the perception that war can be â€œcostless .â€ 
Cut off from the realities of the bombings in Pakistan , Americans have been insulated from the human toll , as well as the political and moral consequences .

It is the time of the Crusades during the Middle Ages - the world shaping 200 - year collision between Europe and the East .
A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith .
The religious wars raging in the far - off Holy Land seem remote to him , yet he is pulled into that immense drama .
Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love , grows into a leader , and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds .
Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight , Godfrey of Ibelin , a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East .
Revealing himself as Balian 's father , Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City .
In Jerusalem at that moment -- between the Second and Third Crusades - - a fragile peace prevails , through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king , Baldwin IV , aided by his advisor Tiberias , and the military ...

I ’ve been working on a total rewrite of Alice which I have renamed to Gigstar .
Just finishing testing this week and then I will release .
There will be no more posts here as the new site is on my blog here :
Switzerland ’s vote to ban minarets on mosques there raises the question of whether anything similar might happen elsewhere in Europe .
Researching this for an analysis of the vote today , I found experts distinguished between actually banning an Islamic symbol such as the minaret and using the minaret example to fan voters ’ fears and boost a ( usually far - right ) party ’s chances at the polls .
It seems Switzerland ’s trademark direct democracy system makes it possibly the only country in Europe where both seem possible right now .
( Photo : Vote “ yes ” posters in Zurich ’s main train station , 26 Oct 2009 / Arnd Wiegmann )
This distinction could become more important in coming months as far - right parties , as they are expected to do , try to exploit the minaret ban to rally support for their anti-immigration policies .
The Swiss far right has already suggested going for a ban of full facial veils ( aka burqas and niqabs ) next .
Marine Le Pen , deputy leader of France ’s National Front , has called for a referendum in France not only on minarets , but also on immigration and a wide array of other issues linked to Muslims .
Filip Dewinter , head of Belgium ’s Vlaams Belang , said he wanted to change zoning laws there to ban “ buildings that damage the cultural identity of the surrounding neighbourhood ” .
It remains to be seen how far they can get with these demands .
At the same time , the consensus reaction from politicians and the press across Europe today was critical of the Swiss vote .
Most of the excited calls for more action come from fringe parties the majority parties keep at a distance ( except the Northern League , which is part of Silvio Berlusconi ’s government in Italy ) .
Referendums are not as easy to stage in other European countries and are even banned in Germany , where the up - and - coming team of Hitler and Goebbels used them before 1933 to rally support for the Nazi Party .
Muslims in Europe were naturally shocked by the vote and worried about what might come next .
The possibility of further pressure on them cannot be ignored because globalisation is forcing European societies to deal with increasing religious , ethnic and cultural diversity .
While not denying that pressure , which naturally does not make life welcoming for Muslims here , let ’s look at a few trends that seem to get drowned out in the headlines .
The first is that mosques are now part of the European landscape .
There were some quite raw confrontations over them in the 1980s and 1990s in the countries with bigger and older Muslim communities such as France , Britain and Germany .
There are still some heated debates , as the uproar over the plan for a large Turkish mosque in Cologne showed .
But for the most part , those mosque projects have gone ahead .
In the Cologne case , despite repeated criticism and far - right protests , the new mosque will have two 55 - meter minarets — tall for an average church , but nothing like the 157 - meter spires above the city ’s famous Catholic cathedral .
( Image : Comparitive heights of Cologne cathedral and planned mosque / DITIB )
Just like a bell tower or spire is normal but not necessary for a church , the minaret and the loud public call to prayer — both regular features in Muslim countries — are optional elements for mosques .
Almost no mosques in Europe use loudspeakers for the adhan , preferring to keep the call to prayer within the mosque , and many of them do without a minarets or agree to shorten their planned heights to make them fit into the local cityscape .
These details can be negotiated constructively , if both sides — repeat , both sides — bring the necessary good will to the table .
Another fact is that there is now roughly enough mosque space for Europe ’s Muslims , according to recent estimates , so the phase of active expansion of mosques and prayer rooms — which created the initial tensions with majority populations — may be waning .
In some areas , a new one has started as Muslim communities take root and want to “ trade up ” from makeshift prayer rooms to better and more visible mosques .
That can create new tensions .
This was the case in Cologne , where Turkish - German Muslims are swapping a mosque set up in a former factory for the elegant new purpose - built mosque that caused so much controversy .
But these controversies take place in cities where many locals now know some Muslim neighbours and take their side in the conflict .
Do difficulties remain ?
Sure .
But do situations develop ?
Certainly .
Many critical commentators do n’t take that dynamism enough into account .
One researcher who does see the changes going on is Stefano Allievi , an Italian sociologist who has made a name as a leading observer of Islam in Europe .
Earlier this month , he published the 102 - page report that I mention in my analysis , Conflicts over Mosques in Europe : Policy Issues and Trends .
He sees the recent rise in populist agitation against Islam in Europe and thinks it could increase .
But beneath the surface , he finds interesting signs of integration of Islam into European societies .
A lot of this is happening at the grass - roots level , below the radar of most headline writers , but it is taking place .
Take a close look at his report ( here in PDF ) for a better idea of how this is playing out .
Probably because reporting on Islam in Europe rather than theorising about it is part of my job , I have never been convinced by the alarmist “ Eurabia ” thesis that Muslim immigration will turn Europe Islamic within a few generations , subjecting the non-Muslim local population to a religious subjugation called “ dhimmitude ” .
Although it is much more sophisticated , I also do n’t agree either with Christopher Caldwell ’s book Reflections on the Revolution in Europe , which sees an army of fervent Muslim believers challenging a sceptical and spineless majority of post - Christian Europeans .
As the prominent British Islam scholar Malise Ruthven put it in the latest New York Review of Books , Caldwell “ takes an essentialist perspective of a primordial religion impervious to change , as if he were oblivious of the way that essentialist views of religion have long been under sustained intellectual attack ” .
He rejects what the British scholar Aziz al - Azmeh calls “ the cliché of a homogenous collectivity innocent of modernity , cantankerously or morosely obsessed with prayer , fasting , veiling ( and ) medieval social and penal arrangements ” .
The integration of Islam in Europe has not been easy and will continue to create tensions and misunderstandings for some time to come , on both sides of the supposed divide .
But this is a dynamic process that changes all actors involved , sometimes in contradictory ways , and it is better reflected in Allievi ’s long report than in many of the short but alarming stories most readers will find about it .

IN 1910 , A COHORT of ultra-conservative American Protestants drew up a list of non-negotiable beliefs they insisted any genuine Christian must subscribe to .
They published these “ fundamentals ” in a series of widely distributed pamphlets over the next five years .
Their catalog featured doctrines such as the virgin birth , the physical resurrection of Christ , and his imminent second coming .
The cornerstone , though , was a belief in the literal inerrancy of every syllable of the Bible , including in matters of geology , paleontology , and secular history .
They called these beliefs fundamentals , and proudly styled themselves “ fundamentalists ” - true believers who feared that liberal movements like the social gospel and openness to other faiths were eroding the foundation of their religion .
Protestant fundamentalism was not an isolated impulse .
The same tendency had already appeared in Catholicism ; beginning with Pius IX , who issued his famous “ Syllabus of Errors ” in 1864 , most popes severely condemned all liberal Catholic efforts .
Muslims hate having the word “ fundamentalist ” applied to them , considering it a foreign term .
Nonetheless , when some 19th - century Koran scholars sought to rethink their faith in the light of science and democracy , an angry opposition resisted these new ideas .
Then , as European colonial powers tightened their grip on the region , other thinkers , like the Egyptian Sayyed Qutb , scorned any such reform efforts as imperialist pollution .
The expansion of religious fundamentalism in recent decades has been notable , as people around the world have sought certainty in the face of dizzying change .
In the second half of the 20th century , old - time religion drew Americans jarred by their country ’s setbacks in Korea and Vietnam , or disoriented by the civil rights movement and youth revolt of the 1960s .
In Europe , American - style fundamentalism failed to make much progress , but highly conservative Catholic parties and groups , sometimes called “ integralist , ” gained strength in some countries .
In the Muslim sphere , as oil funneled immense riches to the elite , it also drove hordes of village people into angry urban poverty .
When secular solutions failed them , many were attracted to the promise of a more equal society based strictly on the Koran .
As the 20th century ended and a new one began , fundamentalism has taken on more formidable shapes , both politically and religiously .
Though most of its adherents work through spiritual and educational channels , the small minority that turn to violence have caught the media ’s attention .
If some seem ready to die for faith , others are ready to kill for it , gunning down abortion doctors in church , hijacking planes , and exploding bombs at weddings .
For plenty of thoughtful people , fundamentalism has come to represent the most dangerous threat to open societies since the fall of communism .
Beloved " Peanuts " creator Charles M. Schulz touched a lot of people over the course of his nearly six decades of professional cartooning , but I gotta say , his letter to a displeased fan shines some serious light on his interaction with readers .
Generally regarded as one of the sweetest guys to ever hold a pen , Shulz 's 1954 correspondence with fan Elizabeth Swaim regarding an annoying female character called Charlotte Braun reaffirms the creator 's reputation while highlighting something of a mischievous streak .
I admit , I had to do a double take to make sure I was n't reading the Onion .
Letters of Note has a full transcript of the letter , which Swaim donated to the United States Library of Congress .
In it , Schulz essentially tells the fan he 's taking her advice to ditch the character ( unless other fans miss her ) , but that her and her friends will have the " death of an innocent child on [ their ] conscience " and asks if they 're prepared for such a responsibility .
He even throws in a drawing of the character with an ax in her head !
Good Grief !
Schulz 's grace and humor seem as admirable as advertised , which is something all of us here in the comic world could stand to emulate .

The FBI has released long - secret security tapes that give new glimpses into the chaos during the minutes after the Oklahoma City bombing .
None show the actual explosion outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building at 9:02 a.m. on April 19 , 1995 .
The soundless recordings do show people rushing from nearby buildings in the minutes after the fertilizer bomb went off .
In some , people flee their buildings through corridors cluttered with fallen debris .
The FBI this summer released more than 20 recordings made from surveillance camera tapes recovered in downtown Oklahoma City .
A Utah attorney , Jesse Trentadue , obtained the recordings through the federal Freedom of Information Act .
He is performing his own inquiry into the bombing .
Trentadue gave them to The Oklahoman because of their historical value .
The Oklahoman agreed to provide copies to the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum .
Many of the released recordings are identified as coming from Southwestern Bell , which had security cameras in buildings both north and south of the Murrah Building .
Others are from the Regency Tower , an apartment building west of the Murrah Building ; the downtown public library , then southeast of it ; and the Journal Record Building , directly north .
Some images from those recordings have become public before .
Prosecutors in 1997 introduced pictures of the bomb truck — seen from a Regency Tower camera — as evidence at bomber Timothy McVeigh ’s trial .
The Regency Tower tape turns to static at the moment of the explosion .
Also , The Oklahoman in 2006 published images from inside the damaged Journal Record Building .
The Oklahoman obtained the Journal Record Building videotapes from a source .
FBI agents did not report finding any security tapes from the Murrah Building itself .
Agents reported a cleaner , a loan company and another business in nearby buildings had surveillance cameras , but the buildings ’ owner said " all ... are ‘ dummy ’ cameras and nothing is videotaped . ”
Agents also reported that security cameras at the federal courthouse directly south of the Murrah Building were connected to monitors only and had no tape backup .
McVeigh was executed in 2001 .
Co-conspirator Terry Nichols is serving life in prison for his role .
The FBI in the past refused to release the security camera recordings .
Their refusal led some — including a U.S. congressman — to contend the government was hiding evidence that others were involved in the attack .
Trentadue began a personal inquiry into the bombing after his brother died at the Oklahoma City Federal Transfer Center in August 1995 .
He contends guards mistook his brother for a bombing suspect and killed his brother during an interrogation .
The official cause of his brother ’s death is listed as suicide .
It has been nice this week to hear some human - scale figures being bandied about by politicians , rather than the unfathomable billions and trillions we have lately become accustomed to .
Cumbria county council pledged £ 50,000 towards the relief effort , after the devastating Lake District floods .
Gordon Brown promised £ 1 m towards clean - up costs .
Hilary Benn , the environment secretary , has taken the opportunity to point out that without the £ 40 m ploughed into flood - risk management in Carlisle after 2005 's 1,000 - year deluge , things could have been a lot worse .
And the Association of British Insurers has suggested that claims for the damage will be between £ 50 m and £ 100m .
Yes , it has been nice , all this talk of mere tens of thousands , mere millions .
But it has been a little bit unrealistic .
So far , 16 bridges have been closed or destroyed in Cumbria , taking other utilities – electricity , phone lines – with them .
A total of 1,600 bridges are now being inspected , to see if they too are less solid that they seemed a week ago .
One entire community has been all but marooned , and a temporary railway station has been erected , to help with sudden demand for the local rail service .
The cost of replacing lost infrastructure will not be a mere bagatelle .
And no one is arguing with the idea that the government will have to find the money , not even those blue - eyed boys who like nothing more than to profess their hatred for the " big state " .
On the contrary , the Confederation of British Industry , at its conference this week , insisted that more transport infrastructure , along with more broadband investment and new nuclear power , should be items at the top of any government shopping list .
I have no argument with that , and I do n't think John Maynard Keynes would either .
It is just the sort of spending he had in mind when he exhorted governments to throw money at recessions , racking up deficits on their way if they had to , in order to get the economy growing again .
Actually , it 's just the sort of thing that many governments spend money on , even when they are not in recession .
The destruction in Cumbria , however , is a horribly timely reminder that successive governments of the late 20th century in Britain have not done this .
Early on in the financial crisis there was a lot of discussion about how high public spending should be allowed to go , as a proportion of gross domestic product .
Plenty of people say there is no need to be anything other than relaxed about current spending , which is inching towards 60 % , since it is historically that high in some other European countries .
Actually , Britain spends more relative to GDP than the European average .
But other European countries do spend more .
In Sweden , government spending was in recent years higher than ours at around 57 % of GDP .
Likewise in France , 55 % is accepted and managed .
Except that these governments have spent money on physical infrastructure , while the outcomes of the money they invest in health and education are widely perceived as better than in the UK .
In Britain , the harsh fact is that public sector productivity has actually fallen since 1997 .
Sadly , our inroads into future clean energy provision , or smarter , faster rail services , have not been impressive either .
( Although there are signs that the long slumber on both might come to an end . )
Anyway , focus has moved from spending to deficit .
Britain's is increasing at a rate of £ 3bn a week .
Government projections put the deficit at £ 175bn in 2009 / 10 , or 12.6 % of GDP , though others suggest it will be more like £ 200bn , or 18 % of GDP .
Compare that with Sweden or France and things are not looking rosy .
Sweden 's projected deficit is already down to 3 % , while France 's is projected at 8.5 % , which before the financial crash would have been considered dangerously high .
Yet even if the fiscal responsibility bill , undertaking to half the deficit in four years , were a magic wand , we 'd still be spending a lot of money , now and in the future , on servicing debt , not building bridges , or railways or power stations .
That 's why both the government and the opposition are only half - right as they wrestle in their phoney fight about public spending .
Of course it would be idiotic to cut public spending in the middle of a recession .
But it would not be idiotic to redirect it .
The great trouble is that the government is pouring money into stuff that is not laying the groundwork for the sustainable economy that everyone wants for the future .
Instead , they are throwing good money after bad , into social services that leave many people feeling they have not been socially served .
Oh , and banks .
Sure , banks are necessary infrastructure , just as bridges are .
But the money that has been spent on shoring up the banks is like money spent on shoring up condemned bridges .
They may still be there .
But they are useless because they cannot bear any weight .
Post - stimulus borrowing levels in the private sector will build neither bridges nor much else .
Anyway , the presupposition that such things as tax rises and public spending cuts can wait until the economy picks up is based on the assumption that somehow economic growth is one day soon going to be as strong as it was before the crash .
How ?
Asset prices may be on their way up again at the moment , but you 'd have to be a rock not to have noticed that it was an asset price bubble that created the boom and the bust in the first place .
Who wants that again ?
It 's a sign that the investment economy remains glibly short - termist .
What if some mad , unsustainable consumer boom was reborn , temporarily ?
Would it offer a breathing space ?
Even before the crash public spending was outstripping revenues .
The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that the present deficit is largely structural rather than cyclical and predicts a structural deficit of £ 140 bn .
Even if this turns out to be exaggerated , it is surely clear that tax rises and spending cuts and infrastructural investment are unavoidable .
Yet hardly a soul seems willing to accept this surely obvious conclusion .
The Hastings Bonfire night , like all the Sussex Bonfire society events , places the big , bad guy of the year on the big , bad fire of the year .
This autumn it was " Bankers , Politicians , and NHS Parking " .
The first two one can understand .
But the third ?
I 'm afraid public anger over paying to place one 's car in a hospital car park , instead of finding a free space 400 yards away and walking , or taking public transport , is indicative of what an unrealistic bunch we have become .
Sure , we can dump Trident , we can dump ID cards , we can withdraw from Afghanistan , we can raise property taxes .
But issues far more fundamental even than these must be grasped .
Far from interpreting " free at the point of access " as meaning " no parking costs for visitors " , we are going to have to accept that even the nasty Tories , with their promises to guard the NHS with their lives , are being overly utopian .
It is time for us to understand that if we want a sustainable and secure future , then everything has to be reassessed , and much will have to change .
Otherwise , our taxes will be spent on servicing debt until all of our bridges are swept away , and there is no way back .
The Swedish hosting provider Portlane is being sued by several Hollywood movie studios for hosting the standalone BitTorrent tracker , OpenBitTorrent .
The movie studios are claiming that OpenBitTorrent is a re-branded copy of The Pirate Bay tracker that shut down yesterday .
After the news broke that The Pirate Bay owners would sell the site to Global Gaming Factory , an independent tracker OpenBitTorrent ( OBT ) was launched .
Due to its public nature , OBT was seen by some as a possible replacement for The Pirate Bay tracker .
Even though the sale never went through , OpenBitTorrent has proved its worth recently , since the Pirate Bay tracker had been struggling to stay online .
That particular battle formally ended yesterday , with the announcement it had shut down for good .
OpenBitTorrent , Hollywood ’s latest target
Unlike most BitTorrent trackers , OpenBitTorrent is not linked to a torrent site where users can download or search for torrents .
Indeed , its involvement in the process is very much limited .
The tracker is merely assisting in connecting peers with each other based on a hash value , without having any control over , or knowledge of what is being tracked .
It also operates a clear DMCA - style takedown policy .
Despite this setup , the Hollywood movie studios have made the decision to try and shut it down by taking the tracker ’s hosting company , Portlane , to court .
“ OpenBitTorrent is used for file sharing , and we suspect that it is the Pirate Bay tracker with a new name .
It is added by default on all of the torrent tracker files on Pirate Bay , ” Hollywood lawyer Monique Wadsted said in a comment .
She further noted that the domain of the tracker was originally registered by Fredrik Neij , one of the Pirate Bay founders .
For Portlane , this is not its first experience of a copyright holder demanding the takedown of a BitTorrent site it hosts .
Earlier this year , the IFPI asked Portlane to close several BitTorrent sites , which they refused to do .
This time around Portlane is not going to comply without a fight either , citing freedom of expression and freedom of information as their defense .
It is indeed questionable if OpenBitTorrent can be held responsible for any copyright infringements that may take place on BitTorrent .
Aside from the alleged connection to The Pirate Bay , the site ’s assistance in the downloading process is not greater than that of BitTorrent outfits Vuze and uTorrent .
Indeed , it could be considered to be less .
The world 's biggest oil company , Exxon Mobil , has softened its hardline position on climate change by throwing its weight behind a tax on carbon emissions .
In a significant shift in stance , Exxon 's chief executive , Rex Tillerson , told an audience in Washington that he considered a tax to be a fairer route to curbing emissions than a cap - and - trade system of pollution allocations .
" As a businessman it is hard to speak favourably about any new tax , " said Tillerson .
" But a carbon tax strikes me as a more direct , a more transparent and a more effective approach . "
Until recently , Exxon was reluctant even to concede that greenhouse gas emissions were responsible for global warming .
The company has faced mounting pressure over its environmental policies , culminating in a shareholder rebellion at its annual meeting last year led by members of the oil - rich Rockefeller family .
In his speech , Tillerson suggested that a combination of greater efficiency , new sources of energy and curbs in demand were needed in a " multidimensional approach " to meeting challenges in policy .
" A carbon tax is also the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions - from investments made by companies to fuel their requirements to the product choices made by consumers , " he said .
The US 's second - largest oil firm , Chevron , warned that its profits would be lower because of a slump in the price of oil .
The cost of a barrel of crude dipped below $ 40 yesterday , down from its peak of $ 147 in July .
At issue are the actions of officers at a Hollywood apartment complex where a security camera documented the 2007 arrest of Guillermo Alarcon Jr .
In February , the U.S. Justice Department opened its own investigation into the officers ' actions .
Three Los Angeles police officers were charged today with perjury and conspiracy for allegedly lying under oath in a drug possession case that was dismissed last year when a videotape sharply contradicted their testimony .
At Alarcon 's trial last year , Officers Richard Amio and Evan Samuel testified that they were on patrol in Los Angeles when they chased Alarcon , 29 , into his Hollywood apartment building .
The officers told jurors that they saw him throw away a black object .
They testified that Samuel quickly picked up the object and found about $ 260 worth of powder and crack cocaine inside .
But footage from a security camera at the apartment building , which is managed by Alarcon 's mother , showed that officers searched for more than 20 minutes before an object allegedly containing cocaine was found .
They were aided by other officers , including Manuel Ortiz , who testified about the case at a preliminary hearing in January .
The quality of the tape , a copy of which was obtained by The Times , is poor and it is difficult to clearly hear what is being said .
But at one point , soon after the drugs were found , an officer seems to make a reference to the arrest report that needed to be filled out .
" Be creative in your writing , " the officer appears to tell another after the discovery .
Alarcon 's attorney argued at trial that his client was innocent and that the officers had planted evidence and then lied about it .
After viewing the videotape , Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Monica Bachner dismissed the charges at the request of prosecutors .
The judge also declared Alarcon factually innocent .

Children from St John 's in the City will raid over 40 homes this weekend to collect food items for Downtown Community Ministry 's Foodbank .
The food will then be used to build a food pyramid inside the church before they gather it up again and bring it down to DCM .
Up to 30 kids aged between 5 and 11 are expected plus a number of adults .
Anna Davis , Coordinator of St J's Kids from St John 's in the City , says " We wanted a local cause to help the kids learn about social justice and the needs of others .
So we encouraged them to think of creative ways to support the Foodbank and offered them the opportunity to deliver what they 'd collected personally " .
" The younger children sold flowers they 'd made up and fudge and bookmarks , while the older ones will raid the cupboards of church members this Saturday . "
Others in the church have been motivated by the children 's enthusiasm .
Anna says , " A lot of people in the congregation have learnt more about the needs of the Foodbank as they 've seen the children talk about it .
Many of them have contributed too which has been fantastic " .
Welcoming the young donors will be DCM Director Stephanie McIntyre .
She says , " It'll be exciting to show the children through the Foodbank .
I 'm sure they 'll have some great questions as to how it all works " .
This week DCM has also benefited from kind donations of oranges and apples from Tawa Rotary and the Suzanne Aubert Soup Kitchen respectfully .

ARTHUR :
Anaheim calling to the hockey world ...
Since Brian Burke 's departure , the hockey media has generally marveled at Bob Murray 's management of the Ducks ' assets .
Like Burke , many of these opportunities came to him : Anaheim was a natural consideration for Koivu after being shut out of Montreal , and who does n't want Chris Pronger ?
But Murray showed he could make some major deals at last year 's trade deadline , calling in some old Blackhawk favors , unloading pending free agents and picking up quality prospects and RFA's .
Still , for whatever reason , Murray has built a team much less stable than that of his predecessor .
And just as the media wondered if Carlyle would be fired because Murray did n't hire him , because Carlyle was n't Murph 's choice , should they now wonder if Henry Samueli will fire Bob Murray for not being the recently reinstated owner 's choice ?
Daniel , I 've recently made the joke that it 's time for Samueli to fire Murray and give him some backdated stock and an autographed 8x10 glossy of Wendel Clark as a severance package .
But assuming that longtime Duck figure ( and one of last year 's most popular GM job interviewees ) David McNab would take his place , should Samueli fire Bob Murray before the general manager moves more of the Ducks assets this season ?
DANIEL :
I think we should consider getting rid of Murray .
As you just said , Koivu was pretty much going to come here no matter what .
All Murray did was recycle Burke 's first Chris Pronger deal .
And the additions of Wisniewski and Whitney , in my opinion , pale greatly to the potential of Nick Bonino .
Looking at today 's roster , Murray 's work has led to the acquisition of Nokelainen , Wiz , Whitney , and Christensen , as well as potential assets Bonino and Pielmeier , while losing Tangradi , O'Dell , the entire 2007 stopper line , and Beauchemin .
Why we can pay Wisniewski's crazy string of penalty killing mistakes 2.75 million and not pay Beauchemin 3.8 is beyond my powers of comprehension .
My main problem when looking at Murray 's body of work is he was so hell - bent on getting something that he seemed to take anything .
Look at the trade with Chicago .
Pahlsson was still a terrific defensive asset .
A little more effort and maybe we get a sturdier Cam Barker or Brent Seabrook .
When you look at the defensive situation this year you see a little bit of the same problem .
Murray took a shotgun approach , and decided that if he brought enough D - men to camp , then Carlyle would just pick the right one .
Eminger has been a pleasant surprise and Boynton is working out ... I guess , but would it have killed him to get some size on the blue line ?
I would have liked a proven stay at home stopper .
Yes , the man was aggressive and did seize a few good players .
The problem is , I 'm not sure they are the right players .
Murray has put Carlyle into a bad situation by just acquiring players instead of acquiring key players who fit the system .
As a result , Carlyle has been scrambling to make this golem of a team function .
I shudder to think what Tampa Bay will get with our 3rd Round pick after we let Artyukhin walk for taking a record 8 million penalties in the offensive zone .
If I felt like there was some plan to what Murray was doing , then I 'd be willing to give him a little more time to work it out , but right now , I say bring on McNab and let 's see if we can get the team going in the right direction .
ARTHUR :
I realize that while Murray was n't Samueli 's choice , McNab was no one 's choice .
He 's just a part of the Pond at this point , grown into it like Bootstrap Bill Turner into the Flying Dutchman .
But I really think he 's earned this job .
He 's respected in the league for what he 's done and for what his father did , and he 's respected amongst the players for having been a part of the Ducks organization since the supplemental draft .
He deserves this shot , and not just because so many organizations seemed willing to give him one last year .
Now if we go to McNab , then we 'll probably have to say goodbye to my dreams of acquiring Duncan Keith , not to mention the advantages of having a GM with at least SOME ties to an NHL organization that is not Anaheim , but we'd be making some effort to turn this ship around .
I 've said before that despite Murray 's years as a pro scout , we 've pretty much gotten Beauchemin , Bertuzzi and Morrison from his experience .
One out of three IS bad .
The players McNab has given us are too numerous to mention ( but let 's say Rucchin , Trnka , Tverdosky , Lecerlc , Salei , Cullen , McDonald , Kunitz , Penner , and Carter for starters ) .
One could argue that this team has always been McNab 's team , helplessly imbued with his vision for the hockey club , and now that we 're getting a taste of Murray 's vision , I think we need to give the ship back to its rightful captain .
Can McNab sign Bobby Ryan on the cheap ?
Can he make a deadline deal ?
I would think that after 16 years holding the proverbial clipboard , he can run a play or two .
One thing is certain : there is a lot of rebuilding on the horizon .
With so much of this team 's future riding on how we manage this year 's assets and acquisitions , I do n't see how Samueli can leave this team in the hands of a man who has managed to miscalculate us into last place in the West in just one year .

Sony Computer Entertainment America is not responsible for this promotion .
Former NARAL Pro-Choice America president Kate Michelman and our own Frances Kissling have an excellent op - ed in today ’s New York Times , arguing that the setback for womens ’ reproductive freedom in the Stupak amendment is a result of the Democratic Party ’s pandering to religion as much as it is a product of religious right lobbying .
In its quest to “ get religion ” and build a larger majority in Congress by recruiting anti-choice candidates to run in conservative districts , the party has cravenly punted on womens ’ freedom and health .
They are absolutely right , and although President Obama came out on Monday against Stupak * , I wonder if he has the gumption to get serious about fixing it in either the Senate or final version of the bill .
Both candidate and president Obama have a history of backpedaling on abortion rights .
The religious right ’s favorite video clip of Obama — proving , religious right activists maintain , that Obama relishes baby - killing — is his 2007 speech to Planned Parenthood in which he promised to deliver , first thing , on getting the Freedom of Choice Act ( FOCA ) passed .
For the religious right , FOCA is the devil ’s bill , one which would codify reproductive freedom and dash their plans to shackle women to maternity wards .
Obama started softening his pro-choice position in early 2008 , when he was feeling the heat from the right ’s virulent Jeremiah Wright smear campaign , and continued to do so throughout the spring as he met with conservative religious leaders and strained to make them more comfortable with his position and record .
We were told , repeatedly , that the Democratic Party ’s outreach to these religious “ centrists ” was about a “ broader agenda ” than the culture wars .
They wanted a new president to address poverty , health care reform , and global warming .
But it was clear , nonetheless , that these leaders and the constituency they supposedly represented still demanded that Democrats stop being so strident on abortion .
By August , then , Democrats agreed to let Rick Warren be the arbiter of the candidates ’ faith cred ; Obama cringed at abortion questions and told Warren that the question about whether life begins at conception was “ above his paygrade . ”
Later in the month , at the Democratic National Convention , the Rev. Charles Blake , the head of the Church of God in Christ , lambasted the party for its abortion stance at an interfaith gathering .
During one of several faith panels , journalist Steven Waldman declared , “ Catholics and evangelicals agree with Barack Obama on 80 percent of issues , but the thing that ’s holding them up is they think he ’s an extremist on abortion . ”
Sojourners president Jim Wallis took to the op -ed page of the Wall Street Journal to ask whether Democrats could count votes , and insisting they had to move to the right on abortion or lose elections .
Warren was rewarded with an invitation to give the invocation at Obama ’s inauguration .
Blake and Wallis were rewarded with seats on the Advisory Council to Obama ’s Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships .
More recently , Waldman left his position as editor - in - chief of Beliefnet to become a senior advisor to the chair of the Federal Communications Commission .
Will we see the proud abortion rights supporter Obama , or the tentative one ?
Will the anti-choice Democrats — the party ’s chickens coming home to roost , so to speak — continue to demand this radical provision crafted by the religious right , or will they be satisfied with the compromise ( the Capps amendment ) that their party ’s leaders already agreed to ?
The Stupak amendment is so radical that it demands a bold and unequivocal response .
* UPDATE : Speaking of bold and unequivocal , while I said in this post that Obama came out against Stupak , upon re-reading his comments , I note that he did n’t use the phrase “ Stupak amendment ” and only made vague references to “ strong feelings on both sides ” and that the final House bill did n’t preserve the “ status quo . ”
What Obama would be satisfied with as preserving the “ status quo ” ( code for no federal funding for abortions ) is unclear — and more to the point , what he would be willing to capitulate to is equally unclear .
This morning , Rep. Stupak postured that there would be “ hell to pay ” for the Democrats if his amendment was removed ; will that inspire fear or fight in the party ?

Tom Tancredo stormed off the set of the Ed Show when he was debating health care with Markos Moulitsas .
Poor baby .
It all started when Tancredo started trash - talking the Veterans Administration , at which point Markos brought up his chickenhawk past .
He got angry and tried the standard conservative whine , realized he was better quitting while he was behind , and then stormed off .
The truth hurts , right Tom ?
As a Republican student activist , Tancredo spoke out in favor of the Vietnam War .
After graduating from the University of Northern Colorado in June 1969 , he became eligible to serve in Vietnam .
Tancredo said he went for his physical , telling doctors he'd been treated for depression , and eventually got a " 1 - Y " deferment .
Too many of these cowards discuss our troops when they themselves refused to serve when they had the chance .
Here 's Jed Lewison :
A few minutes ago on The Ed Show , Tom Tancredo tried to make the case against government health care by claiming that the Veterans Administration is unpopular with U.S. military veterans .
The only problem for him was that he was up against Markos ... who is one of those veterans , unlike Tancredo , a pro-Vietnam War chickenhawk who got a 1 - Y deferment .
When Markos pointed out that Tancredo was ( a ) wrong about the Veterans Administration and ( b ) not qualified to speak for veterans , Tancredo exploded in anger , demanding an apology .
Markos did not oblige , and Tancredo stormed off the set .
Funny , too , how the most thin - skinned of the wingnuts are the same people most prone to making vicious , uncivil , frequently racist and xenophobic remarks .
Tancredo , after all , is a guy who claimed the National Council of La Raza was just like the Ku Klux Klan , and called Sonia Sotomayor a racist , and told the people of Brownsville , Texas , that they should build the border fence on the northern side of their city .
And then goes whimpering and whining off the stage when he gets a clean shot to the gut with hard facts .
There 's a street name for that , but this is a family blog .
NEW YORK —
The label “ War on Terror ” may be out of style as a description of American counterterrorism strategy , but Wednesday in Rome an Italian court served notice that some of its more controversial practices — including the abduction of alleged terrorists known as “ extraordinary rendition ” — would not be forgotten as quickly as some Americans might prefer .
The court convicted two Italian intelligence officials , plus 23 American intelligence agents — all of them in absentia — of aiding the 2003 abduction of an Egyptian - born cleric from the streets of Rome .
Among those convicted was the CIA ’s Milan station chief at the time , Robert Lady , who received an 8 year sentence and , like the other Americans , will now be considered a fugitive from justice and subject to arrest on European extradition requests if they travel abroad .
For President Obama , who may privately welcome the verdict , the case merely sharpens the dilemma facing his administration as he moves on several fronts to reverse what he has described as the overzealous policies of his predecessor .
One of his first moves as president was to outlaw the transfer of detainees to countries where they might be tortured .
But the executive order fell short of banning rendition , and a “ special task force ” created to recommend policy changes has yet to weigh in .
Beyond the rendition issue , the president ’s promise to close the prison holding “ enemy combatants " at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , for instance , looks likely to take a good deal longer than the one year deadline Obama imposed .
Some have complained the moratorium on transfers to Guantanamo has merely shifted the problem to notorious sites like the prison at the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
More broadly , his pledge as a candidate to go after Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan has led to an increased use of airstrikes in both countries , with a commensurate increase in civilian deaths .
The abducted man , Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr , was taken from Italy by U.S. intelligence agents and handed over to Egyptian officials , where court testimony indicates he was repeatedly tortured .
Italy , which among America ’s European allies was more sympathetic than most to the broad “ long war ” strategy of the Bush administration , nonetheless became the first to challenge the rendition strategy when details of Nasr ’s abduction became public .
Nasr , who was living in Rome in 2003 , was suspected of involvement in terrorist plots in Europe .
He was a known member of the Egyptian terrorist organization , Gamaat Islamiya , which had assassinated Anwar Sadat in 1981 and which murdered 58 foreign tourists at the Temple of Luxor in 1997 .
The details of the decision to abduct Nasr remained vague throughout the trial , in part because the Italian Constitutional Court ruled that data on coordination between Italian spy agencies and the CIA was inadmissible .
But enough evidence existed to prove the abduction happened and to broadly implicate a range of American operatives .
Other testimony established that Nasr had transited through Germany ( an embarrassing revelation for a government which had been openly critical of the practice ) , and that he was tortured repeatedly upon his arrival in Egypt .
Within Italy , meanwhile , the ruling will revive controversy over whether the government of President Silvio Berlusconi — a close Bush ally — offered tacit or direct permission for the operations , and in a broader sense , whether it is in Italy ’s national interest to help in such operations .
Privately , some Italian officials have noted that Italy had a large force of troops in Iraq at the time , and , as the home to the Vatican , presents a potentially attractive target for Al Qaeda or other Islamic militant groups .
Rendition had been a tool of intelligence agencies on both sides of the Cold War , most memorably in 1987 , when U.S. warplanes intercepted an Egyptian airliner carrying Palestinians who hijacked the Italian liner Achille Lauro and killed a wheelchair - bound Jewish American .
The airliner was forced to land at a U.S. airbase in Sicily , and the Palestinians were sentenced to prison terms of varying lengths .
Few renditions involved such clear - cut figures , though .
Since the Clinton administration , but especially since the 9/11 attacks , hundreds of people have been taken into custody without legal proceedings and transported to third countries , like Egypt , where legal guarantees are fluid and torture commonplace .
Dana Priest , a Pulitzer Prize - winning Washington
Post reporter who revealed details of the programs in a series of 2005 articles , found evidence implicating a half dozen EU countries as willing ( if covert ) participants in the renditions .
Several others allowed flights carrying abducted prisoners to pass through their airspace .
Besides Egypt , secret prisons where such “ ghost detainees ” were held existed in Jordan , Uzbekistan , Afghanistan , Morocco and Pakistan .
Following Priest ’s articles , President Bush acknowledged those prisons late in his term , after years in which top officials , including Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice , denied their existence .
The drug works directly on the brain 's pleasure zones A drug that failed tests as an antidepressant is being hailed as " Viagra for women " after surprising but not unpleasant side effects .
In three separate trials , the drug flibanserin did wonders for women 's flagging sex drive despite doing nothing to lift mood .
The accidental discovery is akin to Viagra 's - it was originally designed as a heart medicine but failed .
The US work was presented at a sexual medicine meeting in Lyon , France .
Lead researcher Professor John Thorp , of the University of North Carolina , told the European Society for Sexual Medicine : " Flibanserin was a poor antidepressant .
It 's essentially a Viagra - like drug for women in that diminished desire or libido is the most common feminine sexual problem , like erectile dysfunction is in men
Professor John
Thorp who led the research " However , astute observers noted that it increased libido in laboratory animals and human subjects .
" So , we conducted multiple clinical trials . "
The women in the studies who took 100 mg of the drug once a day for their low libido reported significant improvements in their sexual desire and satisfactory sexual experiences , he said .
" It 's essentially a Viagra - like drug for women in that diminished desire or libido is the most common feminine sexual problem , like erectile dysfunction is in men . "
The trials were funded by manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim and involved 2,000 women in the US , Canada and Europe .
Some doctors are sceptical about the need for pills to boost female sex drive .
For some , reduced sexual interest or response may be " normal " , says Professor Irwin Nazareth or University College London .
Others say relying on a pill could stop couples talking through underlying issues .
Paula Hall of Relate said : " Female loss of libido is a big problem and it is not going away .
It can cause problems within a relationship and affect self - esteem .
" This research is really quite exciting for women with loving partners whose loss of libido is a physical thing .
But it is not going to fix a broken relationship or help with looking after the kids or cleaning the house . "

Of all the images synonymous with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , MTV 's distinctive three - letter logo may seem the least likely .
But there it is on the umbrella of the fresh - faced German guard as he stands on top of the wall in its final moments , an unwitting symbol of the sweeping change the city was going through .
In early November 1989 , executives from MTV found themselves in Berlin for a seminar .
Noticing the momentum for change , Bill Roedy ( now MTV's chief executive ) decided to expand access to the channel in east Berlin .
By 7 November , MTV had succeeded in giving hotels and conference centres access to the channel for the first time .
Two days later , the Berlin Wall fell .
In the absence of 24 - hour news channels , many watched events as they unfolded on MTV .
" MTV has always had a very strong connection with the city of Berlin , " says Roedy .
" Not only were we there in east Berlin when the wall came down , but five years later we inaugurated the very first MTV Europe Music Awards at the Brandenburg Gate . "
In the meantime the MTV Europe Music Awards awards have become a fixture , staged everywhere from Liverpool to Lisbon , hosted by everyone from Tom Jones to Xzibit , and have attracted all sorts keen to rub shoulders with music stars .
Even Tory MP John Whittingdale , chair of the culture , media and sport select committee , has attended , donning an MTV hoodie against the Copenhagen chill .
This week , the awards return to Berlin after 15 years to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the wall coming down .
U2 , who recorded their brilliant album Achtung Baby in the city in 1990 , will open proceedings with a free concert at the Brandenburg Gate on Thursday .
But MTV 's presence at one of the most seminal events in modern European history serves to highlight the evolution the music channel has undergone in the past two decades .
Twenty years ago , MTV was a byword for cutting - edge youth culture ; now , having been challenged by the internet , it seems to be a breeding ground for a variety of reality TV shows such as Pimp My Ride and The Hills .
The title of a new Facebook group seems to sum it up : I Remember the Soviet Union , Berlin Wall and MTV ( with good music ) .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- CIT
Group is the first big bailout loss for taxpayers , but it wo n't be the last .
CIT ( CIT , Fortune 500 ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday .
The New York - based small business lender said all its common and preferred shares will be canceled , which will wipe out the $ 2.3 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program investment the Treasury Department made last December .
Though the government is also highly unlikely to recoup all the money it plowed into AIG , Citigroup , Fannie Mae and General Motors , CIT is the first bailout to go to zero -- in just 11 months , no less .
" Preferred stock is a very risky security , " said Linus Wilson , a finance professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette .
" CIT Group is the first large lesson for taxpayers of its risks . "
Unfortunately , it 's not likely to be the only lesson .
Typically in bankruptcies , bondholders and creditors are the first in line to get paid back .
Owners of a company 's stock , even investors in preferred shares that pay special dividends , are usually left holding the bag .
CIT , with $ 71 billion in assets , missed its quarterly dividend payment due in August .
According to a report issued last month by SNL Financial , there were 32 other TARP recipients that did so as well .
CIT was by far the largest , being the only firm on the list with more than $ 1 billion in Treasury loans .
But eight banks that are behind on their dividend payments have at least $ 100 million in Treasury loans , including two that are publicly trying to raise capital -- a tough task at a time when banks are falling by the wayside at a rapid clip .
To take one recent example , the nine banks controlled by FBOP , Oak Park , Ill. , failed Friday , bringing the 2009 failed - bank count to 115 .
The banks , with assets of $ 18 billion , failed two months after FBOP -- which did n't get TARP funds -- signed a written agreement with the Federal Reserve pledging to raise capital .
The two big banks on the TARP deadbeat list that have pledged to raise capital are Sterling Financial ( STSA ) of Spokane , Wash . , and UCBH Holdings ( UCBH ) of San Francisco .
Both have more than $ 12 billion in assets .
Sterling got $ 303 million from Treasury on Dec. 5 .
But it missed its Aug. 17 TARP dividend payment after posting a $ 59 million first - half loss .
Then , last month , it consented to a cease - and - desist order from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
directing it to raise $ 300 million in capital .
The company said in a statement Monday that it was evaluating options for acquiring additional capital and that it has hired investment bank Sandler O'Neill and Partners as a financial adviser .
UCBH , the parent of United Commercial Bank , named a new CEO in September after the company 's previous chief stepped down amid questions about the bank 's accounting .
UCBH received $ 299 million from Treasury last November but said this year it will try to raise money as it investigates the bookkeeping missteps that are expected to lead to an earnings restatement .
Shares of both companies recently fetched less than a dollar each .
UCBH has until mid-November to resume filing timely financial statements or face delisting from Nasdaq .
A spokesman for UCBH said the bank is " aggressively moving forward " on its capital plan and has hired a financial adviser that will help it consider all its options .
Other big banks that have missed TARP dividend payments include :
First Bancorp ( FBP ) , San Juan , Puerto Rico , a $ 20 billion institution that took $ 400 million in TARP funds in January .
It recently shook up its board and named a new CEO , after an investigation by the board 's audit committee .
A spokesman said the bank stopped paying dividends this summer under federal guidelines that say a bank can pay out dividends only if it is making enough profit to do so .
First Banks , Clayton , Mo. , a $ 10 billion privately owned bank that received $ 295 million from Treasury in December .
The bank said it stopped paying dividends " in order to maintain liquidity and capital until such time as economic conditions warrant resuming payments . "
Pacific Capital Bancorp ( PCBC ) , a Santa Barbara , Calif. , institution that posted a $ 363 million loss for the second quarter and recently won shareholder backing for a possible reverse stock split .
It took $ 181 million from Treasury last November .
A spokeswoman said the bank is preparing for its third - quarter earnings report and declined to comment .
Closely held Dickinson Financial , Kansas City , Mo. , got $ 146 million in TARP loans in January .
Its Southern Commerce Bank unit in Florida was recently cited on the Bankaholic web site for offering the highest rates on a 12 - month certificate of deposit -- a strategy strapped banks sometimes use to boost deposit funding .
Central Pacific Financial ( CPF ) , a Honolulu - based bank that lost $ 183 million in the third quarter as its commercial real estate book soured .
The bank took $ 135 million from Treasury in January .
It shares recently traded at $ 1.10 apiece .
Anchor Bancorp ( ABCW ) , a Madison , Wis. - based institution that last month restated its results to show a loss of $ 63 million for the quarter ended June 30 .
The firm , which received $ 110 million in TARP funds in January , cited the deteriorating performance of its loans .
The company said in a statement that it also was deferring dividend payments and that " upon the execution of a successful capital event , AnchorBank expects to be able to pay any and all deferred dividends . "
Deferred dividends are n't the only possible warning sign , of course .
South Financial Group ( TSFG ) , Greenville , S.C. , said last month it expects to lose $ 341 million for the third quarter .
The bank , which took $ 347 million in TARP funds in December , made its third - quarter TARP dividend payment and stressed it remains well capitalized .
But its shares have n't risen above $ 3 apiece since May and recently traded for 75 cents .
South Financial did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .
But with the next round of TARP dividends due later this month , it 's worth considering that the 32 banks other than CIT that failed to pay their August TARP dividends have together taken $ 2.3 billion in TARP money .
They wo n't all fail , of course -- but as taxpayers are all too aware , every dollar counts .
The Supreme Court is considering , for the third time , the case of a California murderer who was sentenced to die in 1982 for the brutal killing of a young woman .
Twenty years ago , the California Supreme Court affirmed a death sentence for Fernando Belmontes , but since then his case has bounced back and forth in the federal courts .
Three times in this decade , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned his death sentence as flawed .
The case is the latest skirmish in the long - running war between California prosecutors and the 9th Circuit over the death penalty -- and it helps explain the oddity of capital punishment in California .
Although death sentences are common , executions are rare .
California has by far the largest death row in the nation , with 685 inmates .
Yet only 13 condemned prisoners have been executed since capital punishment was restored in 1977 , far fewer than the 38 death row inmates who have died of natural causes .
Advertisement
By contrast , Texas has carried out 441 executions during the same period and has 358 inmates on death row .
Virginia has executed 103 people during that time and has 18 inmates on death row .
Among them is John Allen Muhammad , who is scheduled to die Nov. 10 for one of the deadly sniper attacks that terrorized the Washington area in fall 2002 .
The stark differences in execution rates reflect the contrasting approaches of the regional U.S. courts of appeals .
In the South , the 4th Circuit in Richmond , Va. , and the 5th Circuit in New Orleans are dominated by conservative judges who are inclined to reject appeals and to uphold death sentences .
The 9th Circuit , based in San Francisco , has a core of liberal judges who say it is their duty to carefully scrutinize capital cases .

“ There is no greater burden that falls on a member of the judiciary than to sit in judgment on whether an individual shall live or die , and no greater responsibility than to make certain that every capital defendant receives the full protection to which he is entitled to under our Constitution and our laws , ” said Judge Stephen Reinhardt of Los Angeles , defending his decision to again set aside Belmontes ’ death sentence .
In a 2 - 1 decision last year , Reinhardt and Judge Richard Paez , also of Los Angeles , ruled that Belmontes ’ lawyer had provided “ ineffective assistance of counsel ” because he failed to tell the jury of the “ traumas that Belmontes faced as a youth . ”
Given this evidence , the jury might have spared his life , they said .
Eight conservative judges of the 9th Circuit dissented and said the full appeals court should reconsider the ruling .
However , it takes a majority vote of the circuit ’s 27 judges to rehear such a case .
In 1981 , Belmontes broke into the home of Steacy McConnell , 19 , and beat her to death with a barbell .
He stole a stereo and sold it for $ 100 .

In two earlier rulings , Reinhardt and Paez had overturned Belmontes ’ death sentence on the grounds that jurors may have thought they could not consider his conversion to Christianity in prison as a reason for leniency .
Police and prosecutors said Belmontes had shot and killed a man two years earlier , but that was kept from the jury .
After each of the rulings overturning his death sentence , the California attorney general appealed to the Supreme Court .
Twice before , the justices set aside the 9th Circuit ’s decision .
The state ’s lawyers have been waiting for several weeks , anticipating the high court would act soon on their latest appeal .
But they are used to waiting .
“ A great many people are frustrated by the pace at which these cases are resolved , ” said Ronald Matthias , a California assistant attorney general who oversees litigation on the death penalty .
He noted that other Western states “ face the same logjam . ”
Advertisement
The 9th Circuit hears cases from nine states , several of which have large numbers of prisoners on death row .
They include Arizona ( with 122 prisoners ) , Nevada ( 79 ) , Oregon ( 35 ) and Idaho ( 18 ) .
None of these Western states has carried out an execution in the last two years , according to the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington .
In Arizona , “ we ’ve had just one execution since 2000 , ” said Steve Wilson , a spokesman for the state attorney general .
In December 2006 , a federal judge put executions on hold in California while the state revised its protocol for lethal injections .
Critics of the death penalty cite high costs and seemingly endless litigation as a good reason for abolishing capital punishment .
Last year , the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice called the state ’s death penalty system “ broken ” and “ dysfunctional , ” and estimated it costs the state $ 137 million a year .

The justices met Friday to discuss pending appeals , including the Belmontes case , and may act on the case as soon as today .

Now out of power , the Republican party is preaching the virtues of bipartisanship .
A new letter from 18 Republican senators to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski opens with a line of congratulations but moves quickly to the real business at hand : telling Genachowski that he had better not plan on moving forward with his ambitious net neutrality agenda unless he has bipartisan support .
" Such a major policy shift should be contemplated only with all of the FCC Commissioners involved , " says the letter .
" To do it with just one party reduces the confidence the public and the Congress has in the proposal . "
The two Republican Commissioners on the FCC are patently skeptical of the need for net neutrality , however .
When Genachowski unveiled the general principles that would guide his decision making , Commissioners Meredith Baker and Robert McDowell issued a statement of their own in response .
" We do not believe that the Commission should adopt regulations based merely on anecdotes , or in an effort to alleviate the political pressures of the day , if the facts do not clearly demonstrate that a problem needs to be remedied , " they wrote .
" As we analyze this situation further , we remain hopeful that any future Commission action will create an atmosphere that is conducive to promoting freedom , investment and innovation not only at the edge of the Internet but at its core as well . "
This point — do n't send in the hook - and - ladder trucks when there 's no fire — was echoed in yesterday 's Senate letter .
" Your promulgating network neutrality rules seems to emanate from a fear that there may be some problems related to openness in ' the future . '
Of the only two Internet - related disputes to date cited in your speech , one occurred five years ago .
Our view is that it is harmful for the Commission to impose industry - wide rules based upon speculation about what may occur in the future . "
By definition , if it has happened in the past it is n't just " speculation about what may happen in the future , " but the point still stands .
In the US , there have not been many documented instances of neutrality violations — though the Comcast P2P throttling case last year was quite significant .
But throw wireless Internet access into the mix ( which Genachowski wants to do ) and the " neutrality " infractions come thick and fast .
For one example , just read AT&T 's terms of service for wireless data services , which prohibit all sorts of Internet activities , including : " downloading movies using P2P file sharing services , redirecting television signals for viewing on Personal Computers , web broadcasting , and / or for the operation of servers , telemetry devices and / or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition . "
Until last week , using VoIP from an iPhone could be added to that list .
The issue is also complicated by the fact that the worries of the net neutralists did n't arise from fever dreams but from the public pronouncements of people like former AT&T boss Ed Whitacre , people whose stated goal was to charge content providers more money for faster access to customers because Internet companies were somehow " using my pipes for free . "
While this did n't happen , it certainly was n't because carriers did n't want it to happen .
In the absence of the FCC's Internet policy statement , which was drafted under Republican leadership , it 's not clear what might have been tried .
Perhaps the fairest point to be made about the whole situation is that the US has seen very few wireline violations of basic neutrality principles in the last five years while operating under a regulatory framework in which neutrality principles ( rather than rules ) were in effect .
Whether that means no such rules are desirable depends on one 's political point of view , and it 's clear where the 18 senators who signed the letter stand on the matter .
Fortunately , US broadband users are able to debate these matters while " enjoying the best online experience that has ever been available . "
Innovate at the core or the edge ?
While the senators ' letter is concerned only with the position of ISPs , the two Republican FCC Commissioners have a more nuanced view .
The Senate letter says nothing about how net neutrality might well stimulate investment on the edges of the network , providing the sort of platform certainty that encourages the creation of new Googles and Yahoos even as it might lower profit margins from ISPs who increasingly become " dumb pipes " or " bit haulers . "
Baker and McDowell recognize this dynamic .
" As we analyze this situation further , " they wrote after Genachowski 's speech , " we remain hopeful that any future Commission action will create an atmosphere that is conducive to promoting freedom , investment and innovation not only at the edge of the Internet but at its core as well . "
The issue is complicated politically for Republicans by the fact that some conservative groups actually support net neutrality quite strongly .
Take the Christian Coalition , which defends American's " godly heritage " by rallying support against the " government takeover " of healthcare , the nonexistent return of the Fairness Doctrine , and gay marriage ... but which also wants to defend net neutrality .
In fact , in 2007 the group even said that net neutrality was its second most important issue , due to concerns that a non-neutral net could harm small church websites and organizations like the Coalition .
Whatever happens , though , Republicans should probably keep GOP head Michael Steele far away from the issue ; the first line of his first blog post on the newly revamped GOP.com this week consists of : " The Internet has been around a while , now . "
September 1997 / C++ Theory and Practice
C++ Theory and Practice
Dan Saks
Work - arounds for a Mistake
Dan continues his diatribe against overzealous attempts to keep C++ backward compatible with C .
Copyright © 1997 by Dan Saks
Last month , I described what I believe was a fundamental mistake in the design of C++ , namely , that classes and structs are essentially the same construct .
( See " C++ Theory and Practice : Maybe It Was n't Such a Good Idea After All , " CUJ , August 1997 . )
On the surface , this design decision ( which I dubbed the Grand Unification ) appears to simplify the language by requiring only one set of rules to cover both constructs .
Unfortunately , the language rules are n't any simpler than if classes and structs had been kept apart .
Moreover , the Grand Unification is responsible for introducing some serious bugs into C++ programs .
The bugs are a direct consequence of the rules by which C++ generates copy constructors and copy assignment operators .
This month , I will look at various programming styles you can use to prevent compilers from generating unwanted functions .
The Grand Unification is the source of another , albeit lesser , problem in C ++.
I will explain that problem , and suggest a cure for it as well .
Generated Copy Operations ( Again )
Last month , I briefly sketched the rules for copy constructors and copy assignment operators .
This month , I provide more details on those rules so that you will understand how to exploit them more effectively .
A copy constructor for a class T is a constructor that can be called with a single argument of type T .
The typical declaration for a copy constructor has the form
T( T const &t ) ;
This is not the only form .
Any of
T( T &t ) ; T( T volatile &t ) ; T( T const volatile &t ) ;
can also be copy constructors .
A copy constructor can have more than one parameter , as long as all the parameters after the first have default argument values .
For instance ,
T( T const &t , X x = v ) ;
is also a copy constructor for class T .
A class can have more than one copy constructor .
For example , the following class has two :
class T { public : T( T &t ) ; T( T const &t ) ; ... } ;
In this case , if t is a const T object , then declarations such as
T x(t ) ; T x = t ;
use the copy constructor T( T const &t ) to copy t to x .
If t is not const , then the declarations use T ( T &t ) .
A constructor for class T with a single parameter of just plain T is not a copy constructor , nor is it even allowed :
T( T t ) ; // error
If a class T does not declare any copy constructors , a C++ compiler may generate one , but only if the program requires it .
For example , if t is a T object , then declarations such as
T x(t ) ; T x = t ;
require that T have a copy constructor .
Calling a function such as
void f( T x ) ;
requires a copy constructor to pass the argument by value .
That is , if t is a T object , then the call f( t ) uses T's copy constructor to copy t to parameter x .
A function that returns a T object by value also requires a copy constructor .
A function such as
T f( ) { T v ; ... return v ; }
uses a temporary T object to carry the return value back to its caller .
The return statement copies v to that temporary object using T's copy constructor .
Typically , a generated copy constructor for class T has a declaration of the form
T( T const &t ) ;
However , it might have the form
T( T &t ) ;
In particular , the generated copy constructor for class T has the first form ( with a parameter of type T const & ) only if
for each direct or virtual base class B of T , B has a copy constructor whose first parameter has type B const & or B const volatile & , and
for each non-static data member m of T with class type ( or array thereof ) , each such class type M has a copy constructor whose first parameter has type M const & or M const volatile & .
Otherwise , the generated copy constructor has the second form ( with a parameter of type T & ) .
A copy assignment operator for class T is an operator= that can be called with an argument of type T .
The typical declaration for a copy assignment operator has the form
T &operator= ( T const &t ) ;
However , this is not the only form .
Any of
T &operator= ( T &t ) ; T &operator= ( T volatile &t ) ; T &operator= ( T const volatile &t ) ;
can also be copy assignments .
Unlike a copy constructor , a copy assignment must have exactly one parameter .
It cannot have additional parameters even if they have default values .
However , a copy assignment can have a parameter whose type is just plain T , as in
T &operator= ( T t ) ; // OK
Just as a class can have more than one copy constructor , it can have more than one copy assignment operator .
For example ,
class T { public : T &operator= ( T &t ) ; T &operator= ( T const &t ) ; ... } ;
In this case , if t is a const T object , then the assignment
x = t ;
uses the copy assignment operator= ( T
const &t ) to assign t to x .
If t is not const , then the assignment uses operator= ( T &t ) .
If a class T does not declare a copy assignment , C++ compilers may generate one , but again , only if the program requires it .
Typically , the generated copy assignment operator for a class T has a declaration of the form :
T &operator= ( T const &t ) ;
However , it might have the form
T &operator= ( T &t ) ;
In particular , the generated copy assignment for class T has the first form ( with a parameter of type T const & ) only if
for each direct base class B of T , B has a copy assignment whose parameter has type B const & , B const volatile & or ( plain ) B , and
for each non-static data member m of T with class type ( or array thereof ) , each such class type M has a copy assignment whose parameter has type M const & , M const volatile & or ( plain ) M .
Otherwise , the generated copy constructor has the form
T &operator= ( T &t ) ;
When to Say No
As I mentioned last month , the generated copy constructor and copy assignment operator use memberwise copies .
Memberwise copies work just fine for some classes , but not for others .
It 's helpful to have a general rule by which you can tell when memberwise copy is okay , and when it is n't .
The generated copy functions are appropriate for any class in which all the data members have arithmetic or enumeration type ( or array thereof ) , such as :
class complex { ... private : double real , imag ; } ;
For this example , the generated copy constructor is equivalent to :
complex ::complex ( complex const &c ) : real ( c.real ) , imag ( c.imag ) { }
The member initializer real ( c.real ) copies c.real to real as if by assignment .
Ditto for imag ( c.imag ) .
This is the right behavior .
The generated copy assignment has essentially the same behavior , and works equally well .
In contrast , the generated copy constructor and copy assignment are almost certainly wrong for any class that contains at least one pointer to dynamically - allocated memory .
For such classes , a memberwise copy results in a shallow copy , which leaves two or more objects competing over dynamically - allocated memory .
Shallow copies typically leak memory and corrupt the free store .
The only way to copy this kind of object is by a deep copy that duplicates all the dynamically - allocated memory that comprises the object 's value .
If you 're not already familiar with the damage that shallow copies can do , read Item 11 in Meyers [ 1 ] .
The title of Item 11 actually suggests the following rule of thumb :
Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes with dynamically allocated memory .
Item 27 augments this rule with :
Explicitly disallow use of implicitly generated member functions you do n't want .
This is a good start , but I would merge the two rules into one and word it a little differently :
For any class that manages dynamically - allocated resources , either define a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator , or prevent compilers from generating their definitions .
Although memory is probably the most common dynamically - allocated resource , it is by no means the only one .
Classes can manage other dynamically - allocated resources , such as files and devices .
The data members that designate such resources need not be pointers .
For instance , a class that manages a file might refer to the file using a UNIX - style file descriptor , which is simply a signed integer .
In this case , the generated copy constructor and copy assignment would leave two objects fighting over a single file .
Sometimes writing a copy constructor and copy assignment for a class is more trouble than it 's worth , or makes no sense at all .
In such cases , you should do something to prevent a compiler from generating these functions .
Otherwise it will write them for you , and you probably wo n't like what you get .
Preventing Generated Declarations
There are various techniques for suppressing the generated definitions for the copy functions .
By far , the most commonly used technique is to declare the copy constructor and copy assignment private , and omit their definitions .
That is , defining a class T as
class T { ... private : T( T const & ) ; T &operator= ( T const & ) ; } ;
renders
T's copy constructor and copy assignment inaccessible to users of T .
Any attempt to assign one T object to another , pass a T by value , or return a T by value will produce a compile - time access violation .
Well , almost .
This technique still allows members and friends of T to call the copy functions .
However , the copy functions have no definitions , so attempts to copy T objects that make it past the compiler will be caught by the linker .
The diagnostic messages from the linker might not be as clear or timely as you 'd like , but at least they prevent the errors from making their way into the executable program .
I see the need to omit the definitions as a weakness in this technique .
How does someone reading the code know whether the definitions are missing on purpose or by accident ?
The class definition probably needs a comment such as :
class T { ... private : T( T const & ) ; // no definition by design T &operator= ( T const & ) ; // no definition by design } ;
As an alternative , you can clarify intent by bundling the declarations in a macro such as :
# define disallow_copying_for ( C ) \ private : \ C( C const & ) ; \ C &operator= ( C const &)
Since these member functions are supposed to be unusable , the const qualifiers in the parameter lists serve no purpose .
You can omit them and write the macro more compactly as :
# define disallow_copying_for ( C ) \ private : C( C & ) ; C &operator= ( C & ) ;
Using this macro , you can define class T as
class T { ... disallow_copying_for( T ) } ;
which states the intent more clearly .
I prefer a slightly different approach that catches errors at compile time rather than at link time .
This approach relies on knowing when compilers do not generate a copy constructor or copy assignment for a class .
A C++ compiler will not generate a copy constructor for class T if T has :
a non-static data member of class type ( or array thereof ) with an inaccessible or ambiguous copy constructor , or
a base class with an inaccessible or ambiguous copy constructor .
Similarly , a compiler will not generate a copy assignment operator for T if T has :
a non-static data member of class type ( or array thereof ) with an inaccessible copy assignment operator , or
a base class with an inaccessible copy assignment operator .
According to these rules , you can define :
class uncopyable { private : uncopyable ( uncopyable & ) ; void operator= ( uncopyable & ) ; } ;
Then , if you want to suppress the generated copy functions for class T , you can define T as :
class T { ... private : uncopyable u ; } ;
Since T has no copy constructor , the compiler will try to generate one on demand .
As always , T's generated copy constructor will try using memberwise initialization , so that the constructor would be equivalent to :
T:: T( T const &t ) : u( t.u ) ... { }
However , u's copy constructor is private , and so the member - initializer u( t.u ) causes an access violation at compile - time .
The generated copy assignment operator hits the same snag .
Therefore , any attempt to copy a T object , even within a member or friend of T , will produce a compile - time error .
Surprisingly , this particular technique has a slight run-time cost .
Class uncopyable has no members , and therefore appears to have a size of zero .
However , C++ does not allow zero - sized objects , including zero - sized data members .
Therefore , adding a member of type uncopyable to class T actually increases the size of all T objects .
On the other hand , C++ does allow zero - sized base classes .
Defining class T as
class T : uncopyable { ... } ;
inhibits the generated copy functions without increasing the size of T objects .
In the definition for T just above , the base class specifier
: uncopyable
has no access specifier .
By default , the access to base classes of a class defined with the keyword class is private .
Therefore , the definition for T is equivalent to :
class T : private uncopyable { ... } ;
Class uncopyable has no inheritable public members , so I do n't think it really matters whether you use public , private , or protected inheritance .
As defined above , class uncopyable has a problem , as illustrated by the following example .
Suppose class T is :
class T : uncopyable { public : T( int i ) ; private : int t ; } ;
where the constructor is defined by :
T:: T( int i ) : t( i ) { }
Since T has a base class of type uncopyable , this constructor initializes T's base class sub - object by calling uncopyable 's default constructor .
However , uncopyable has no default constructor , and the compiler will not generate one because uncopyable already has at least one explicitly - declared constructor .
( C++ generates a default constructor for a class only if that class has no explicitly - declared constructors . )
With the previous definition for class uncopyable , it 's impossible to write any constructors for a class derived from uncopyable .
Class uncopyable needs an explicitly - defined public default constructor , as in :
class uncopyable { public : uncopyable ( ) { } private : uncopyable ( uncopyable & ) ; void operator= ( uncopyable & ) ; } ;
My current advice for disabling copy functions is :
To prevent memberwise copying for a class T , define class uncopyable and specify it as a base of T .
I caution you that I 've been using this technique in my own work for only a few months , and I have n't seen anyone else recommend it .
I know of no problems with it , but that 's hardly a proof of correctness .
If you try it and run into problems , please let me know and I 'll alert the masses .
More Peculiarities from Unification
The C language rules for naming structs are a little eccentric , but they 're pretty harmless .
However , when extended to classes in C++ , those same rules open little cracks for bugs to crawl through .
In C , the name s appearing in
struct s { ... } ;
is a tag .
A tag name is not a type name .
Given the definition above , declarations such as
s x ; /* error in C */ s * p ; /* error in C */
are errors in C .
You must write them as
struct s x ; /* OK */ struct s * p ; /* OK */
The names of unions and enumerations are also tags rather than types .
In C , tags are distinct from all other names ( for functions , types , variables , and enumeration constants ) .
C compilers maintain tags in a symbol table that 's conceptually if not physically separate from the table that holds all other names .
Thus , it is possible for a C program to have both a tag and an another name with the same spelling in the same scope .
For example ,
struct s s ;
is a valid declaration which declares variable s of type struct s.
It may not be good practice , but C compilers must accept it .
I have never seen a rationale for why C was designed this way .
I have always thought it was a mistake , but there it is .
Many programmers ( including yours truly ) prefer to think of struct names as type names , so they define an alias for the tag using a typedef .
For example , defining
struct s { ... } ; typedef struct s S ;
lets you use S in place of struct s , as in
S x ; S *p ;
A program cannot use S as the name of both a type and a variable ( or function or enumeration constant ) :
S S ; // error
This is good .
The tag name in a struct , union , or enum definition is optional .
Many programmers fold the struct definition into the typedef and dispense with the tag altogether , as in :
typedef struct { ... } S ;
Once again , as a consequence of the Grand Unification , classes and structs are essentially the same in C ++.
Although the draft C++ Standard does n't call them tags , class names act very much like tags .
For example , you can declare an object of class string with a declaration such as
class string s ;
Of course , no one actually does .
C++ was designed so that user - defined types can look as much as possible like built - in types ( whenever appropriate ) .
Using the keyword class in the declaration above serves only to remind readers that string is not a built - in type .
Therefore , C++ lets you use class names as if they were type names .
That is , you can omit the keyword class from the declaration just above , and write it as just :
string s ;
The draft C++ Standard never utters the word tag .
In C++ , the names of classes , structs , unions , and enumerations are just type names .
However , there are several rules that single out these type names for special treatment .
I find it easier to continue to refer to class , struct , union , and enum names as tags .
If you want , you can imagine that C++ generates a typedef for every tag name , such as
typedef class string string ;
Unfortunately , this is not entirely accurate .
I wish it were that simple , but it 's not .
C++ ca n't generate such typedefs for structs , unions , or enums without introducing incompatibilities with C .
For example , suppose a C program declares both a function and a struct named status :
int status ( ) ; struct status ;
Again , this may be bad practice , but it is C .
In this program , status ( by itself ) refers to the function ; struct status refers to the type .
If C++ did automatically generate typedefs for tags , then when you compiled this program as C++ , the compiler would generate :
typedef struct status status ;
Unfortunately , this type name would conflict with the function name , and the program would not compile .
That 's why C++ can't simply generate a typedef for each tag .
In C++ , tags act just like typedef names , except that a program can declare an object , function , or enumerator with the same name and the same scope as a tag .
In that case , the object , function , or enumerator name hides the tag name .
The program can refer to the tag name only by using the keyword class , struct , union , or enum ( as appropriate ) in front of the tag name .
A type name consisting of one of these keywords followed by a tag is an elaborated - type - specifier .
For instance , struct status and enum month are elaborated - type - specifiers .
Thus , a C program that contains both :
int status ( ) ; struct status ;
behaves the same when compiled as C ++.
The name status alone refers to the function .
The program can refer to the type only by using the elaborated - type - specifier struct status .
So how does this allow bugs to creep into programs ?
Consider the program in Listing 1 .
This program defines a class foo with a default constructor , and a conversion operator that converts a foo object to char const *.
The expression
p = foo( ) ;
in main should construct a foo object and apply the conversion operator .
The subsequent output statement
cout << p << '
';
should display class foo , but it does n't .
It displays function foo .
This surprising result occurs because the program includes header lib.h shown in Listing 2 .
This header defines a function also named foo .
The function name foo hides the class name foo , so the reference to foo in main refers to the function , not the class .
main can refer to the class only by using an elaborated - type - specifier , as in
p = class foo ( ) ;
The way to avoid such confusion throughout the program is to add the following typedef for the class name foo :
typedef class foo foo ;
immediately before or after the class definition .
This typedef causes a conflict between the type name foo and the function name foo ( from the library ) that will trigger a compile - time error .
I know of no one who actually writes these typedefs as a matter of course .
It requires a lot of discipline .
Since the incidence of errors such as the one in Listing 1 is probably pretty small , you many never run afoul of this problem .
But if an error in your software might cause bodily injury , then you should write the typedefs no matter how unlikely the error .
I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to hide a class name with a function or object name in the same scope as the class .
The hiding rules in C were a mistake , and they should not have been extended to classes in C ++.
Indeed , you can correct the mistake , but it requires extra programming discipline and effort that should not be necessary .

‘ Not a change ’ in policy ‘ at all , ’ US attorney says
Operators of medical marijuana dispensaries in California are quickly learning that , contrary to recent news headlines , federal raids of medical marijuana clubs are n’t going to stop — an assertion the US attorney for northern California is unequivocally making .
Numerous news sources reported in February that the Obama administration plans to put an end to DEA raids of medical marijuana dispensaries .
But last month ’s memo from Attorney General Eric Holder to prosecutors in 14 medical - marijuana states , instructing them on the new policy , was n’t quite as clear - cut as an outright ban on raids .
ADVERTISEMENT
As the Associated Press noted , the new guidelines mean that the federal government will defer to state law and wo n’t raid medical marijuana dispensaries in the 14 states that allow them “ as long as they conform to state laws . ”
To Joseph Russionello , the US attorney for the northern district of California , that means raids will continue wherever federal authorities believe laws surrounding medical marijuana clinics are being flouted .
“ I think it ’s unfortunate that people have for some reason picked up on this as a change in policy , because it ’s really not a change at all , ” the Mission Local news site in San Francisco quotes Russoniello as saying .
Asked by Mission Local if federal prosecutors would stop investigating and prosecuting dispensaries in California , Russionello said : “ The short answer is no . ”
It ’s not clear from Russionello ’s comments whether Holder ’s instructions were intended to have no effect on policy , or whether Russionello , an appointee of President George W. Bush , is himself applying a restrictive interpretation of the attorney general ’s memo .
But it does contradict what had been reported about Holder ’s memo , which is that it would represent a “ significant departure ” from Bush - era policy .

That the raids will continue is a fact that Emmalyn ’s California Cannabis Clinic , in San Francisco ’s Mission District , experienced first - hand .
Although the dispensary says it follows California ’s regulations on dispensaries — they must be not - for - profit , all customers must be club members and have a valid marijuana prescription , and pot growers must also be club members — the cannabis dispensary was raided by federal authorities “ less than a week after Holder ’s announcement , ” Mission Local states .
The local news service reports :
“ They came in with their guns drawn and pointed them right in our faces like we are criminals , ” said Rose , a quiet Filipino woman with rheumatoid arthritis who manages the spotless clinic .
“ They twisted one of our patient ’s arms and put a gun to his head .
He was crying .
It was so scary . ”
The agents confiscated plants and medical cannabis , which were never returned .
Nobody was arrested and no charges were ever filed .
The clinic , which has 4,500 registered patients , is a nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary that is licensed by the city , Rose said .
It only sells marijuana grown specifically for its patients , all of whom must have a medical marijuana card issued by the state of California and a valid state ID .

The Associated Press reported two weeks ago :
Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said in March that he wanted federal law enforcement officials to pursue those who violated federal and state law , but it has not been clear how that goal would be put into practice .
The government will still prosecute those who use medical marijuana as a cover for other illegal activity , the officials said .
The memo warns that some suspects may hide drug dealing or other crimes behind a medical marijuana business .
In particular , the memo urges prosecutors to pursue marijuana cases that involve violence , illegal use of firearms , selling pot to minors , money laundering or other crimes .
Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett dropped charges against a Nederland woman who faced felony drug charges stemming from her possession of marijuana for medical purposes .
Sherri Versfelt was arrested in July 2008 after police raided her home and found 50 marijuana plants .
She had an expired medical marijuana registry card belonging to another patient and a previous diagnosis of a “ severe debilitating medical condition ” related to surgery as a teenager to remove a massive growth from her abdomen .
Versfelt spent 27 days in jail because she did not have the money to post bond .
She was set to go to trial next week on felony charges of cultivation of marijuana , possession with intent to distribute , possession of 8 ounces or more of marijuana , and possession of oxycodone .
The charges carry a maximum penalty of six years in prison .
Amendment 20 , approved by Colorado voters in 2000 , allows patients and caregivers to have 2 ounces of marijuana or six plants for medical use , but the law also allows an “ affirmative defense ” that a defendant felt a larger amount was necessary to treat his or her medical condition .
That was the defense used successfully by Jason Lauve , a Louisville man who was acquitted of felony drug possession charges this summer .
Robert J. Corry Jr. , the Denver attorney who represented Lauve and Versfelt , wrote a guest commentary that appeared in Thursday ’s Camera asking why Garnett was taking the case to trial when Garnett had said medical marijuana prosecution was his lowest priority .
Prosecutors filed a motion Thursday asking that all charges be dismissed .
Garnett said he was not responding to the publicity around the case but to a judge ’s decision Wednesday that Versfelt could present a medical marijuana defense — even though she obtained her own medical marijuana card after she was arrested , not before .
Garnett said he inherited the case , along with thousands of other felony cases , from his predecessor , Mary Lacy , and that in each case , prosecutors need to assess the particulars before making a decision about whether to proceed .
After reviewing it , Garnett said he felt the courts should rule on whether a medical marijuana card could be obtained after the fact .
“ I had told the deputy ( district attorney ) that if the judge ruled she could present the medical marijuana defense , we should drop the charges , ” he said Thursday evening .
“ So that ’s what we did . ”
Corry said he was happy the charges were dropped .
“ This is a victory for the taxpayers of Boulder County , for the voters of Colorado and for medical marijuana , ” he said .

Police guidelines on how to deal with cannabis users are set to change following the decision to reclassify the substance as a class B drug .
BBC
News explains the rules .
How are drugs classified ?
Since the 1970s , the law has placed drugs in three categories based on scientific evidence of the harm they can cause .
Class
A is the most harmful , including things like heroin and morphine ; class B is the middle group , covering amphetamines and barbiturates ; and class C includes those judged to be the least harmful , such as anabolic steroids .
Where does cannabis sit ?
Cannabis is to be returned to class B status .
It had previously been classified in this way but , in January 2004 , the drug was downgraded to class C by the then Home Secretary David Blunkett based on the advice then available .
In practice this meant there would be a " presumption against arrest " when officers come across someone with cannabis in their possession .
When cannabis was previously classified as class B , police were expected to arrest users - however the reality was often quite different .
Many officers were taking what they would describe as a pragmatic response - confiscating the drug , giving a caution on the street and leaving it at that .
So what did the previous reclassification mean for cannabis users ?
Most people found in possession of cannabis found they were unlikely to be arrested .
Instead , police gave more informal on - the - spot warnings .
Could the police still arrest people over cannabis ?
Yes .
Police still had that power , though they were advised to use their discretion .
Persistent cannabis offenders have always been more at risk of arrest and police also focused on drug use in situations where there is the potential for trouble .
The law regarding dealing the drug remained unchanged - a maximum of 14 years in prison .
Why were the 2004 changes brought in ?
The Home Office and the police hoped the changes would mean officers would spend less time arresting and processing cannabis offenders and more time focusing on more harmful drugs like heroin , cocaine and crack .
Why has the home secretary has decided to change the classification back again ?
Jacqui Smith said she wanted to reverse Tony Blair 's 2004 downgrading of the drug to class C because of the " increased strength " of cannabis .
The home secretary highlighted " uncertainty at the least " on the future impact on young people 's mental health as a result of using the drug .
The decision came despite the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ' review which concluded that the drug should remain a class C substance .
Earlier this year , Gordon Brown indicated that he wanted cannabis back at class B - saying that class C had sent the wrong signal .
At the time of the 2004 classification , ministers pledged a tough public education policy .
Critics of the government 's shift say that rather than criminalising users they should invest in that public health programme to make drug use unacceptable .
What about the mental health debate ?
Opinion is divided on cannabis and mental health .
However the type of cannabis available has itself changed considerable .
Skunk , one type available on the street , is far stronger than previous varieties .
So is there confusion among the public ?
The reality is that there is a generation gap .
The young and many people under 35 would probably have a completely different attitude towards cannabis use than senior politicians or police chiefs because of its ubiquity in higher education and the UK 's clubbing scene .

What are these ?
True story : A small college in the Midwest wanted to put up a wind turbine on their campus .
The school , being on top of a hill in the middle of the prairie , had enough wind to produce upwards of 3 / 4 of their needed electricity , so the project made good sense .
But when it came time to talk to the people living nearby , the school ran into some opposition .
In particular , from a farmer who thought the noise and appearance of the wind turbine would lower property values .
The punchline : He was a pig farmer .*
The point here is not that irony is funny .
( Although , it totally is . )
Instead , this is about the cultural role that farmer represents .
NIMBY–Not
In My Backyard–is traditionally defined as what happens when people are , generally , in favor of something , but do n't want the necessary infrastructure built anywhere they can see it .
Bacon is delicious , but you do n't want to live next door to a pig farm .
Sustainable energy is great , but you do n't want a wind turbine mucking up your views .
It 's really easy to write off any opposition that gets labeled as NIMBY .
After all , infrastructure has to be built somewhere , and everywhere is somebody 's backyard .
Therefore , NIMBYists are selfish twits who can't see beyond their own nose .
But the truth , as per usual , is more complicated .
Thanks to wind power projects , and the supposedly NIMBY reactions against them , political and social scientists are learning what we really talk about when we talk about NIMBY .
Their discoveries could have wide - reaching implications , both for how we understand public opposition to infrastructure projects–and for how we respond to it and get what needs to be built built .
Note for city dwellers and others who do n't get the joke :
Large pig farms are generally smelly , considered unattractive , and tend to lower property values .
Real quick : I 'm not planning on dealing much here with the arguments for and against wind , or with how wind power compares to coal , other renewables , or the magical electricity elves that live in our walls .
That 's a whole other post , to be written in the future .
Whatever you think about that topic , you 'll probably agree that we still have to build energy infrastructure of some sort , which means NIMBY matters .
Wind power is important here mostly because it's the reason researchers are rethinking NIMBY .
See , there 's a weird disparity with wind .
In a traditional NIMBY situation , you 'd expect to see nationwide polls that show high support for wind power , with support dropping off only in communities where a wind turbine might be built .
But that 's not what the researchers are finding .
Instead , the popularity plummet happens when you compare nationwide public opinion polls with nationwide academic surveys .
And , at the local level , opinions are n't much different than the nationwide academic survey results .
What 's going on ?
Partly , it has to do with the difference between the way pollsters ask questions , and the way academics do that same job .
Eric Smith is a professor of political science at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
He told me that polls tend to offer broad questions that result in top - of - the - head responses .
You do n't have to have a fully formed opinion on something to answer a public opinion poll .
In fact , Smith argues , most people do n't .
Academic surveys , on the other hand , get more into the nitty gritty , asking questions about potential downsides of a project that people might not have thought about before .
If you 'd been laboring under the impression that wind power had no downsides , an academic survey might force you to reexamine your position in ways that a poll would n't .
In these kind of surveys , the majority of Americans still favor wind projects , Smith said , but that majority is smaller .
Once you 're looking at the nuanced opinions , he said , there 's not much difference between local and national viewpoints .
In fact , protests often characterized as NIMBY are , instead , really national activism drawn to a specific place because that 's where stuff is going down .
" It seems local , " he said .
" But it 's not really .
Or , at least , it 's not specifically local . "
In other words , what we call NIMBY is less about what people do or do n't want in their backyards , and more about people in and out of the community using the backyard as a flashpoint for national opposition .
If you 're in favor of wind , you 're likely to be in favor of it in your community .
If you oppose wind , you 'll oppose it in your community .
But the specific location of the wind turbines is n't really a huge factor in your decisions .
I think NIMBY is something that 's used to persuade people to ignore opposition as selfish , irrational .
I think it 's a fairly powerful political argument .
But I do n't think it 's true , " Smith said .
Frankly , if Smith is right , NIMBY might not even be that great of a political argument , because it forces you to fight an expensive and time - consuming battle that is n't really necessary .
If you write off the NIMBYists , you have to shout them down .
If you accept that " NIMBY " is something more honest and more nationally applicable , then you can deal with it in other , more productive , ways .
Take Denmark .
I spoke with Jan Hylleberg , CEO of the Danish Wind Industry Association .
In his country , he said , developers do n't go into a community assuming support and writing off any opposition as NIMBY .
We respect the issues much better than years back , " he says .
" Before you can put up turbines you have to do a lot of detailed analysis on environmental issues .
Most important though is that you need enough time to have a local dialogue about the individual projects .
If you do n't have time for dialog and debate , then of course you 'll have more people being against the project because they have n't had the time to get involved and understand what 's going on . "
The other big difference in Denmark is local financial incentives .
This bit was interesting to me , because I 've spoken with researchers here in the states who theorize that smaller wind projects , with local public investment , would get more support because local people would feel ownership of the project .
From Denmark 's example , that seems to be true .
Hylleberg says that if a developer there wants to put up one wind turbine , he or she has to offer the community a 20 % stake .
If they want to build a whole wind farm , they have to offer a least one full turbine to the community .
The solution to anti-wind power " NIMBY " may simply be expecting opposition , respecting the opponents and dealing with it via proactive communication and community involvement .
Or , to be folksy about it , setting out honey for the flies instead of vingar .

Every year at Thanksgiving , parts of the Upper West Side of Manhattan become like a paradise for children .
There ’s the exciting preparation of the balloons and floats for the Thanksgiving Day parade , and then , on Thursday morning , the parade itself .
The weather is n’t always kind .
I ’ve seen the kids out there in snow , in freezing rain , in winds that threaten to send the balloons and their handlers soaring to distant venues .
It does n’t seem to matter .
The children come into the neighborhood in waves , holding the hands of adults or riding atop their shoulders , smiling , laughing , playing hide - and - seek among the police barricades .
Finally , inevitably , they end up staring in absolute open - mouthed , wide - eyed awe as the mammoth , colorful helium - filled creations of their favorite characters begin making their majestic way down Central Park West .
We have an obligation and an opportunity at this special moment in history to do right by these youngsters , and all the rest of America ’s kids .
It ’s a special moment because we ’ve seen so clearly the many things that have gone haywire in the society , and while it may not be easy to articulate , we have a sense of what needs to be done .
The American economy is broken , ruined by the greed and irresponsibility of fabulously wealthy corporate chieftains and their shabby acolytes and enablers in government .
While Wall Street is handing out billions in bonuses , American families are struggling with joblessness , home foreclosures and rampant debt .
The economic woes are exacting a fierce toll on family life , and children are taking a big hit  emotionally , psychologically and otherwise .

Frank : " We Are Trying On Every Front To Increase The Role Of Government "
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) says Democrats are " trying on every front to increase the role of government . "
Chris Comer , whose lawsuit challenging the Texas Education Agency 's policy of requiring neutrality about evolution and creationism was dismissed on March 31 , 2009 , is now appealing the decision .
Formerly the director of science at the TEA , Comer was forced to resign in November 2007 after she forwarded a note announcing a talk by Barbara Forrest in Austin ; according to a memorandum recommending her dismissal , " the TEA requires , as agency policy , neutrality when talking about evolution and creationism . "
In June 2008 , Comer filed suit in federal court in the Western District of Texas , arguing that the policy violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment : " By professing ' neutrality , ' the Agency credits creationism as a valid scientific theory . "
The judge ruled ( PDF , p. 18 ) otherwise , however , writing , " As a matter of law , the Agency 's neutrality policy , if it advances religion at all , only does so incidentally .
Further , a reasonable observer of the neutrality policy would not believe the Agency endorses religion through the policy . "
In her appellate brief , submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , Comer asked ( PDF , p. 39 ) the court to " review the record de novo and reverse and vacate the district court 's decision .
Specifically , it should grant Comer 's motion for summary judgment , and vacate the grant of summary judgment for defendants , as well as the dismissal of plaintiff 's complaint .
At a minimum , this Court should vacate the grant of summary judgment to defendants , plus the order dismissing the complaint , and remand for further proceedings . "
A brief video about the Comer case is available on NCSE 's YouTube channel .

I am sick to death of the economically illiterate environmental nonsense peddled in the media in an endless parade of bad thinking disguised as scientific discourse .
The Green movement is a collectivist enterprise hell - bent on bending every knee in obeisance to a religious orthodoxy that will cripple the advancement of mankind and create third - world nations where first - world countries used to be , exponentially increasing infant mortality rates and reducing standards of living to make all of us look back on envy at the gold - plated living conditions of medieval serfs .
The movement is a nasty brew of National Socialist " blood and soil " ( see Anna Bramwells ’s books ) , Marxist bromides and a child - like vision of how the universe works .
Central planning does not work .
Larger entities that use force and coercion to make others do the right thing lead to national prison camps disguised as nation - states .
Here ’s a short quiz for you : grab the nearest envirus and ask him how would he suggest we improve the care and feeding of Mother Earth absent government intervention ?
He will splutter and get a very blank look in his vapid face as the synapses collapse and fail to function properly .
Use this rule of thumb : cost and benefit analysis will usually determine the economic efficacy of a given course of action .
Prices are , among many attributes , the keenest indicator of scarcity or abundance of commodities or services .
If recycling is such a great idea , why do n’t they pay you to do it ?
If wind and solar energy are such ideal means to deliver power , why do they require massive subsidy and inevitably , the theft from private owners through eminent domain and other tools of economic oppression ?
Speak truth to power because the Greens now have the upper hand .
The government - media complex is now fully captive to the entire Green orthodoxy .
Excepting shows like Bullshit ! on Showtime , none questions the prevailing belief system ; it is like a form of national psychosis although I feel the same way about the worship of the State .
The environmental agenda is nothing less than a total renunciation of Western civilization and the requisite privileges of clean water , electricity , effective farming and a host of other modern conveniences .
The envirus views nature as a snapshot picture of the world frozen in time and unchanging ; a static portraiture of life that possesses no adaptation and dynamism .
Infantile views of nature which are most likely a result from having never tread upon it or lived in it .
Rarely is the hunter or long - time ruralite seduced by the Disney visions of nature that dance in the heads of the Greens .
A perspective further informed by the academic and media professionals whose worldview is shaped by a hive - like collectivist vision of human society in which all individuals are to be subordinated to the whims of what ’s good for the herd as directed by omniscient strangers whose fatal conceit is that they are smarter than us so they know what is best for you .
Nature is cruel and dynamic .
It is a daily massacre for the lame and the newborn .
Vicious spasms of violence red in tooth and claw tempered by turns of weather that can kill and nourish in the same pastoral event .
Most importantly , nature is capricious in the most practical sense : the complexity is so immense as to be almost incomprehensible to human cognition .
Complexity theory has tried to capture the distillate of what appears to be random phenomenon but is actually a spontaneous order much like economic market forces .
Which brings us to the cruelest joke of all on the Greens : they ca n’t possibly know what they are talking about .
Here ’s the rub : there is no question of climate change , the riddle is to what extent man is a culprit .
Once a given problem set has three or more variables , it becomes impossible to establish with any certitude correlative or causative connections between A and B and C .
The global climate is a complex system far too large to isolate variables and know with pinpoint accuracy what makes it tick or respond to human influences .
I do n’t deny that humans have an impact on the climate but no one can prove to me what the extent is .
No evidence emerges that the ice ages in medieval times were anthropogenic , they were simply within the observed cycle of cooling and warming that one would expect of a planetary ecosystem dependent on solar energy as a driver and engine of weather and life .
There is a reason increased sunspot activity is coincident with warming trends .
Man is not apart from nature , he is a part of nature .
We are part of the infrastructure and no one can even address why carbon dioxide , if a pollutant , nourishes all earthly plant life excepting certain anaerobic moss .
The government does not even want to have a discussion since the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) recently muzzled one of its in - house climate skeptics .
Stand up to the Greens and call them on their idiocy .
Question all their assumptions .
Stand athwart their diktats and directives as they attempt to rule you as cattle .
They are shutting down coal - fired plants by the dozen and seeking to bankrupt the nation by pursuing green technologies that the market has proven to be a technological & economic dead - end .
Curiously , they object strenuously to the purest solar energy of all : nuclear energy which harnesses the power of the sun in a relatively clean fission package .
One small ray of hope is the fact that the EPA will strangle and mangle all the emerging green technology .
They will get all bureaucratically befuddled as the contesting envirus schisms like bird enthusiasts and wind generator proponents do battle .
Pollution activists will discover the immense smog component of mass transit buses and the maintenance infrastructure .
Electric car boosters will stand dumb - founded in their garages as the AC outlet fails to deliver power after the coal - fired grid is shut down through rolling brown - outs or blackouts .
All done , of course , at taxpayer expense .
Under Obamunism , we have a wild ride ahead of us as the Green Reds at first have a terrific honeymoon with Middle America but soon discover the combination of economic illiteracy , scientific buffoonery and collectivist tyranny make for a lethal cocktail .
It would be wonderful if we could just sit on the sidelines and observe the circus but the future of America is in the hazard .
Indeed , the collectivists have other plans for us .
" Reality is that which , when you stop believing in it , does n’t go away . "

Mother of teenage girl killed ' after meeting man on Facebook ' calls for ban on false online profiles
The mother of the girl allegedly killed by a stranger she met on Facebook yesterday demanded more protection for users of social networking sites .
Andrea Hall said 17 - year - old Ashleigh had ' made one mistake and has paid for it with her life ' .
She called on websites to clamp down on users who create false identities .
Ashleigh had told her mother she had gone to spend Sunday night with a friend , but a frantic series of calls to her mobile phone the next morning went unanswered .
Loss : Andrea
Hall sitting on the bed of her daughter Ashleigh , whose body was found in a field near Sedgefield in County Durham earlier this week Her body was found that night in a field near Sedgefield , County Durham , after police made a routine stop on a motorist .
Miss Hall , 39 , told yesterday of the agonising moment she finally got through to Ashleigh 's phone , only for it to be answered by a police officer .
Her ' mother 's instinct ' made her realise that the worst had happened .
And she told of the ' scary ' moment she saw pictures of the accused 's ex-fiancee , who closely resembles Ashleigh , saying she feared her daughter had been targeted deliberately .
' I can't blame the internet , but it is about time that somebody looked at ways of introducing controls which stop people putting up false pictures and false information , ' she said .
' The people who run Facebook and other social networking sites do have some responsibility for bringing in these controls . '
Ashleigh Hall was found dead after allegedly meeting a man through Facebook .
Peter Chapman has been charged with kidnap and manslaughter
Miss Hall said Ashleigh knew the risks of sharing information online but stressed : ' We trusted Facebook and she was always told never to add a stranger as a friend .
I brought her up not to talk to strangers and that applied to the internet as well .
' She had about 400 friends on Facebook but she knew every single one of them .
We can't imagine how she got to be friends with someone she did n't know .
She made one mistake and has paid for it with her life .
' It 's not Ashleigh 's fault what happened .
All we can do as parents is try to get across to them that there are two sides to the internet . '
Miss Hall said Ashleigh , a trainee nursery nurse , had made the decision to spend Sunday night with a friend at the last minute .
She gave her daughter the go - ahead only after insisting that she return to their Darlington home early the next day : ' I shouted to her to make sure she was home by 10.30 .
She said " I will " and that was it .
I never saw her again . '
Distraught : Andrea breaks down as she talks of Ashleigh 's death for the first time
Miss
Hall said she felt physically sick when a policeman answered her daughter 's phone on Monday .
' I felt as if my heart had been ripped out .
My whole world fell apart in those two seconds .
' The policewoman [ who later came to her house ] did n't even get the words out .
I would n't let her say it .
Deep down I knew what she was going to say . '
When the woman officer finally told her a body had been found , she collapsed .
Miss Hall , who has three younger daughters - Olivia , six , Ellie , four , and Evie , one - said it took her four days to summon the courage to enter Ashleigh 's bedroom .
' As soon as I walked in I could smell her , ' she said .
' There was a big pile of dirty clothes lying in the middle of the floor where she had dumped them .
' Like any teenager she just took her clothes off and left them on the floor thinking it was my job to pick them up .
' That was the hardest part , picking up those clothes , knowing she would never wear them again .
' But holding them did give me some comfort , it again made me feel that she was still in the house . '
Peter Chapman , 32 , has been remanded in custody accused of the manslaughter and kidnap of Ashleigh as well as failing to identify a new address , as required by the Sex Offences Act .
Earlier this week it emerged that his ex-fiancee , Dyanne Littler , a single mother from Runcorn , Cheshire , closely resembles Ashleigh .
Miss Hall said : ' It was so scary how much they looked alike .
I 'm now wondering if Ashleigh was targeted because she looked so like that other girl . '
Child safety campaigners say the onus is on young people to be aware of potential abusers on social networking sites and chatrooms .
They are warned not to divulge personal information to people they do not know and never to arrange meetings .
They say popular websites could do more to deter paedophiles from attempting to groom vulnerable youngsters .
The Government 's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre wants sites to sign up to its alerts system which enables users who come across something suspicious to warn child protection professionals .
Facebook said it had a range of measures to protect users and expose those attempting to abuse the site , including informing police of dubious behaviour .
A spokesman said : ' We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Ashleigh Hall .
' Everyone should use extreme caution when contacted over the internet by people they do not know .
On Facebook there are a variety of measures people can use to protect themselves from unwanted contact and we strongly encourage their use .
' We encourage Facebook users to report unwanted contact and any behaviour they find threatening or intimidating . '
A 5 percent chance of another Great Depression ?
Brad Delong thinks so , and despite the improving economy , that estimate is up from a few months ago :
For 2 1/ 4 years now I have been saying that there is no chance of a repeat of the Great Depression or anything like it -- that we know what to do and how to do it and will do it if things turn south .
I do n't think I can say that anymore .
In my estimation the chances of another big downward shock to the U.S. economy -- a shock that would carry us from the 1/3 - of - a- Great - Depression we have now to 2/3 or more -- are about 5 % .
And it now looks very much as if if such a shock hits the U.S. government will be unable to do a thing about it .
Importantly , DeLong is n't concerned by changes in the country 's economic condition .
He 's scared by the revealed constraints on the political system 's ability to respond to changes in the country 's economic conditions .
The issue is n't that some storm will unexpectedly slam into the economy and there will be nothing anybody can do , but that the storm will hit and Congress will choose to do nothing .
The biggest danger America faces is not rising health - care costs or global warming or the budget deficit .
It 's the political system 's inability to act on these issues , even though the solutions are generally quite clear .
As any uninsured person will tell you , the fact that medicine exists does n't do you much good if you can't get any of it .
The never - ending lunacy of Betsy McCaughey .
On an ordinary day , Henry Aaron , senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington , comes across as the quintessential policy wonk : knowledgeable , thoughtful , measured , perhaps even a tad boring .
With his rumpled suits , snowy hair , and rosy jowls , the genial septuagenarian brings to mind one 's favorite uncle -- assuming that uncle had spent the past 40 years exploring tax policy , health care financing , and the intricacies of sprawling entitlement programs .
He is , in short , not the kind of guy you 'd expect , in his opening statement in a debate on health care reform held before the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans , to launch an extended , blistering , ad hominem attack on his opponent .
But this mid-September afternoon holds no ordinary encounter , and the object of Aaron 's broadside is no ordinary adversary .
A few feet from his maroon - flocked podium sits Betsy McCaughey , former lieutenant governor of New York , former fellow with the conservative Hudson Institute , and longtime scourge of health care reform .
A constitutional scholar by training , McCaughey ( pronounced " McCoy " ) blazed to fame in 1994 as the person who drove a stake through the heart of Hillarycare , with a detailed ( and , as it turned out , false ) takedown of the plan published in this very magazine .
Fifteen years later , she has reemerged for an encore , penning op - eds and making the TV and radio rounds to issue apocalyptic warnings about the horrors lurking in the fine print of Obamacare .
Pick an inflammatory , misleading rumor that has sprung up in this debate , and chances are McCaughey had a hand in springing it .
She has , for instance , warned that a provision buried in the stimulus bill will soon have computers dictating doctors ' treatment of patients based on government protocols .
More notably , she sounded the ( false ) alarm that the White House aims to ration care based on patients ' value to society -- an idea that swiftly morphed into the " death panel " hysteria and then quickly became entangled in McCaughey 's equally outrageous claim that the proposed reforms would force seniors into regular chats with their doctors about how to end their lives .
That such claims are untrue in no way dims McCaughey 's zeal .
Confronted with conflicting information , she plows ahead with her unique interpretation of reality , leaving critics on both the left and the right nonplussed .
One 's only options , they say , are to ignore her and hope that she fades away -- or to go negative in the hope of discrediting her .
So it is that Aaron finds himself standing in the Crystal Ballroom of the Doubletree Hotel in Arlington , Virginia , running through PowerPoint slides that detail -- quote by excruciating quote -- McCaughey 's reputation as among the most irresponsible , dishonest , and destructive players on the public stage .
He starts with Politifact.com 's categorization of her commentary as " Pants on Fire , " followed by New York Times articles debunking her assertions , followed by complaints from economist Gail Wilensky ( adviser to John McCain 's presidential campaign and head of Medicare financing under the first President Bush ) that " these charges of death panels , euthanasia and withholding care from the disabled give rational , knowledgeable , thoughtful conservatives a bad name . "
Next comes a denunciation of McCaughey 's " fraudulent scare tactics " by John Paris , professor of bioethics at Boston College ; AARP executive vice president John Rother 's protest that her statements are " rife with gross -- even cruel - - distortions " ; a scolding editorial by The Washington Post about McCaughey 's characterization of White House health policy adviser Ezekiel " Zeke " Emanuel as " Dr. Death " ; and , to wrap it all up , Stuart Butler , vice president of domestic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation , expressing dismay that the " personal attacks on good people like Zeke are outrageous .
There are real policy issues that should be debated vigorously , but slandering a good person 's name is beyond the pale . "
At one point , the debate moderator felt moved to reach over and give McCaughey 's hand a comforting pat .
She dipped her chin and stuck out her bottom lip in good - humored appreciation .
What kind of person drives normally staid wonks , including her own ideological teammates , to such stinging public reproof ?
Part of it is obviously the nature of her commentary .
But beyond that , there is something about McCaughey herself that drives her critics wild -- and has throughout much of her career .
Friends posit it's her disconcerting blend of brains , beauty , and confidence .
Detractors chalk it up to her rank dishonesty , narcissism , and lack of shame .
Whatever the cause , the passion McCaughey inflames is familiar .
Looking over the sweep of McCaughey 's life , from her swift political rise ( and fall ) to her humble roots , from her straight - talking persona , fierce will , and blinding confidence to her gift for self - dramatization , head - turning looks , and embrace of the gender card , one sees precursors of a more recent conservative phenom .
Replace the East Coast researcher 's political - outsider , stats - wielding , pointy - head shtick with a political - outsider , gun-toting , populist one , and a striking parallel emerges : Betsy McCaughey is , in essence , the blue - state Sarah Palin .
Blonde , wide - eyed , and smiley , McCaughey does n't look much like a formidable political brawler .
A well - tended 60 , she still has a penchant for short , high - slit skirts , revealing blouses , and spike heels -- all on display at her afternoon debate with Aaron - - which give the impression less of poised - to - kill tiger than on - the - prowl cougar .
Prone to sitting with her mouth slightly open , as though she can't take in quite enough air through her pert nose , and every now and again flashing a grin that seems more involuntary tic than deliberate response to anything occurring around her , McCaughey radiates aggressive optimism mixed with spaciness and just a dash of vulnerability .
