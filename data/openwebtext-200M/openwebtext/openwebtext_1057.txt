Citizens of the United States Welcome to Animal Farm 2009
“ All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others . ” - George Orwell – Animal Farm
The United States has gradually degenerated from a Republic based on individual liberties to a socialized oligarchy run by an exclusive few .
The country was founded upon the platform of individual rights .
We declared our independence from Great Britain because of excessive regulation and taxation .
Americans fought for the right to live their lives free from the subjugation of an overbearing governmental body .
The Founding Fathers declared our independence with these immortal words :
We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Since the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the United States has gone from taking personal responsibility for our own lives to dependence on government to make all decisions in our lives .
There are 306 million Americans and we have defaulted on our responsibility for governing this nation to 535 corrupt politicians , 10 “ too big to fail ” banks , a secretive Central Bank , 17,000 corporate lobbyists , and thousands of government bureaucrats .
Essentially 306 million citizens are managed by a few thousand elitist rulers .
George Orwell ’s classic novel Animal Farm was inspired by the a scene he witnessed :
“ I saw a little boy , perhaps ten years old , driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path , whipping it whenever it tried to turn .
It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them , and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat . ”
Orwell wrote the novel during World War II and published it in 1945 .
It was a contemptuous indictment of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union .
He recognized that propaganda and abuse of language could smoothly control the opinions of enlightened intellectuals in democratic countries .
He saw through the prism of Soviet propaganda to the true evil of Stalin and his KGB Dogs .
Intellectuals in Great Britain ’s Ministry of Information attempted to censor his right to publish the book because it would offend their supposed ally Joseph Stalin .
He knew the truth , while intellectuals were horribly wrong .
Stalin murdered 700,000 Russian citizens during the Great Purge of the 1930s .
The plot of Orwell ’s Animal Farm is quite simple .
It follows the Russian Revolution from 1917 through 1944 .
Three pigs — Snowball ( Leon Trotsky ) , Napoleon ( Joseph Stalin ) , and Squealer ( Vyacheslav Molotov ) formulate Old Major ’s ( Vladimir Lenon ) principles into a philosophy called Animalism .
The animals defeat the farmer Mr. Jones ( Czar Nicholas II ) in a battle , running him off the land .
They rename the property Animal Farm ( Soviet Union ) .
The cart - horse Boxer ( Russian working class ) devotes himself to the cause with particular passion , committing his great strength to the prosperity of the farm and adopting as a personal axiom the affirmation “ I will work harder . ” Napoleon ( Stalin ) and Snowball ( Trotsky ) increasingly argue over the future of the farm , and they begin to struggle with each other for power and influence among the other animals .
After a speech , nine attack dogs ( KGB ) burst into the barn and chase Snowball ( Trotsky ) from the farm .
Napoleon ( Stalin ) assumes leadership of Animal Farm ( Soviet Union ) and declares that there will be no more meetings .
From that point on , he stresses , the pigs alone will make all of the decisions for the good of every animal ( Workers ) .
Napoleon ( Stalin ) begins expanding his powers , rewriting history to make Snowball ( Trotsky ) a villain .
Napoleon ( Stalin ) also begins to act more and more like a human being — sleeping in a bed , drinking whisky , and engaging in trade with neighboring farmers .
The original Animalist principles strictly forbade such activities , but Squealer ( Molotov ) , Napoleon 's propagandist , justifies every action to the other animals , convincing them that Napoleon ( Stalin ) is a great leader and is making things better for everyone despite the fact that the common animals are cold , hungry , and overworked .
Looking in at the party of Pigs and Farmers through the farmhouse window , the common animals can no longer tell which are the Pigs and which are the human beings .
The perversion of founding principles is not limited to communist countries .
On the farm there were the Seven Original Commandments :
Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy .
Whatever goes upon four legs , or has wings , is a friend .
No animal shall wear clothes .
No animal shall sleep in a bed .
No animal shall drink alcohol .
No animal shall kill any other animal .
All animals are created equal .
All of the Seven Commandments are eventually broken by the pigs for their own gain .
Squealer ( Molotov ) constantly changes the Commandments to the pigs ' benefit , taking advantage of the other animals .
Through the manipulation of language , the Pigs accumulate more power and privileges :
No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets ;
No animal shall drink alcohol to excess
No animal shall kill any other animal without cause .
Ultimately , all the commandments are boiled down to one commandment :
All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others .
Could this degeneration of founding principles happen in the United States ?
The distressing answer is that it already has .
It has accelerated at a breakneck pace since 2000 .
Orwell ’s themes are as true today as they were in 1944 .
Corruption
“ All political thinking for years past has been vitiated in the same way .
People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes , and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome .
Political language ... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable , and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind . ” - George Orwell
Our elected officials are supposed to represent the wishes of the citizens that elected them .
They derive their just powers from the governed .
In the early days of our Republic , citizens could freely enter the White House without hesitation .
Federalist Papers 55 and 56 explicitly promised , without qualification , that there would be one Representative for every thirty - thousand inhabitants .
The framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights intended that the total population of Congressional districts never exceed 50,000 to 60,000 .
Currently , the average population size of the districts is nearly 700,000 and , consequently , the principle of proportionally equitable representation has been abandoned .
Our elected officials no longer represent the people .
They represent the 17,000 corporate lobbyists who spend $ 3.3 billion per year to “ persuade ” them what is best for their special interests .
This is why a Congressperson can receive 9 to 1 calls from their constituents against a $ 700 billion banker bailout bill and still vote for the bill .
The ideals of our fledgling Republic have been corrupted by politicians who have sold their souls to corporate and banking interests .
The corruption became more insidious with the creation of the Federal Reserve and the institution of the Federal income tax in 1913 .
The levers of money printing and raising taxes gave the select few ( Pigs ) the wherewithal to control and manipulate the working class population .
Debt and taxes are the friends of a corrupt politician .
The Cabal of bankers who control the Federal Reserve has been printing money for 96 years to such an extent that the U.S. dollar has lost 96 % of its purchasing power versus gold .
But , with Orwellian irony our government leaders proclaim a “ strong dollar policy ” .
This is a lie .
The only way out of the current colossal debt dilemma is by allowing our currency to depreciate even more so that the debt becomes less burdensome in dollar terms .
The National Debt is now $ 11.6 trillion .
The National Debt in 1913 was $ 2.9 billion .
Therefore , the National Debt has gone up by 400,000 % in 96 years .
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PERCENT !
I had to go back and check my calculation three times .
The people we elected to Congress have spent $ 11.6 trillion more than the government has generated in revenues , with $ 10 trillion of it accumulated since 1981 .
Despite this “ investment ” spending by our elected officials , the country ’s infrastructure is crumbling , we import 66 % of our energy supplies versus 28 % in 1982 , our public education system is on par with a Third World country , our healthcare system is bloated , expensive and corrupt , and we have racked up another $ 56 trillion of future liabilities for unfulfillable promises made by our myopic leaders .
The Bills passed by Congress ( written by lobbyists ) exceed 1,000 pages , with payoffs and pork to constituents , corporate contributors and other influential allies .
These Bills are not even read by our leaders before being passed .
Hundreds of pages of amendments are added at 3:00 am .
As the ruling pigs in Animal Farm are slowly corrupted , they take the spoils while the working class proletariat toil for nothing .
Congress and the bankers are the ruling Pigs , we are the overworked common animals .
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive .
Do as I say not as I do because
The shit so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet 's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I 'll hit you again
I 'm a smart ass but I 'm playing dumb
Standards set and broken all the time
Control the chaos behind a gun
Call it as I see it even if
I was born deaf , blind and dumb
Losers winning big on the lottery
Rehab rejects still sniffing glue
Constant refutation with myself
I 'm a victim of a catch 22
Green Day – Walking Contradiction
Class Oppression
If you want a vision of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever .
- George Orwell
The American Revolution was fought for the ideals that “ All men are created equal ” and we had the right to “ life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ” .
The Russian Revolution of 1917 was based upon Karl Marx ’ idealistic Communist Manifesto which pitted the oppressors against the oppressed .
Communism was supposed to be a system in which goods were owned in common and available to all as needed .
The ten conditions for a transition to Communism are :
Abolition of property in land application of all rents of land to public purposes .
A heavy progressive or graduated income tax .
Abolition of all right of inheritance .
Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels .
Centralization of credit in the hands of the State , by means of a National Bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly .
Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State .
Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State ; the bringing into cultivation of waste - lands , and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan .
Equal liability of all to labor .
Establishment of industrial armies , especially for agriculture .
Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries ; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country , by a more equal distribution of the population over the country .
Free education for all children in public schools .
Abolition of children ’s factory labor in its present form .
Combination of education with industrial production .
George Orwell ’s 1984 and Animal Farm were biting condemnations of the Soviet Union , its perversion of the revolution ’s ideals and class tyranny that ultimately widened in its society .
The American Republic was constructed upon the individual and their freedom and liberty .
After reading the above list of conditions , the United States is at least 50 % of the way to a perverted form of communism as our leaders have instituted a progressive income tax , restricted the right of inheritance through taxes , centralized credit in the hands of the State , allowed corporate farms to dominate agriculture along with providing tax breaks and protective tariffs , gotten into bed with the Military Industrial Complex , banking industry , and auto industry , provide free public education to the working classes while they send their privileged children to private schools .
By satiating the poor working classes with bread and circuses like welfare programs , easy credit , no income taxes , cable TV , fast food , cheap liquor , and drugs , the ruling classes are able to reap obscene riches through the systematic raping of the American public through the use of inflation and taxes on the middle class .
There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent person could believe in them .
- George Orwell
The success of any system of government is ultimately dependent upon the integrity , honesty and honor of its leaders .
If they become corrupted by power and money , the system will ultimately collapse .
It may be a natural progression in all societies that intellectuals with superior intelligence will take advantage of those who perform physical labor .
The intelligentsia in Animal Farm is the Pigs , who learn to walk on two legs , wear clothes , sleep in beds , drink alcohol and consider animals that walk on four legs as their inferiors .
They perverted the founding principles of the revolution .
The intelligentsia of the United States has perverted the founding principles that all men are created equal and we are each entitled to our individual liberty .
The ruling elite constitute the 1 % richest Americans and the politicians they have bought .
The top 1 % own 35 % of all the net worth in the country .
They own as much as the bottom 90 % of Americans .
They “ earn ” 22 % of the income and pay 40 % of the taxes in the U.S.
I would contend that the majority of the intelligentsia has utilized their private education , Washington and Wall Street connections and ability to manipulate the financial and political system to further enrich themselves at the expense of the average American .

Gullible Working Class
It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it ; consequently , the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy , and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning .
- George Orwell
The definition of democracy is : government by the people .
Today , the United States is democratic in name only .
The political class , which supposedly represents the citizens , has perverted the original concept of a representative democracy .
Our representatives were supposed to personally sacrifice by taking time off from their everyday professions to do what was best for the country .
After performing this noble duty they would go back to their original vocations .
Instead 40 % of Congress is lawyers , their goal is to make a career in Washington DC and after leaving Congress they seek riches as lobbyists .
Once elected , they utilize the power and money gained from the position to maintain that position permanently .
This is why incumbents win elections 95 % of the time .
In 2004 , incumbents spent $ 700 million to get re-elected , while challengers spent $ 200 million .
These obscene sums of money have perverted the original intention of the Founders .
The combination of a permanent political class with an undereducated , uninterested , gullible , naïve electorate has permitted the few to wield immense power over the majority .
In Animal Farm , the working class is represented by Boxer the workhorse .
He is a hard working non-thinking animal that repeats over and over that “ Napoleon ( Stalin ) is always right ” .
He is representative of those who believe everything that Barack Obama says is gospel .
Ultimately , Boxer is sacrificed so that the Pigs can live more luxuriously .
A highly educated involved electorate would be dangerous to those in power .
An atrocious public education system is actually beneficial to the Pigs .
There are 34 million Americans without a high school degree , constituting 15 % of those over 18 years old .
Another 112 million have graduated high school without progressing any further with their education .
Many of these people are functionally illiterate , ca n’t add , ca n’t spell , do n’t know when World War II happened , or who is the Vice President .
Only 69 % of entering 9th graders in the public school system graduate high school .
The graduation rates and educational achievements of minorities are dramatically worse than these numbers .
Only 26 % of the population has a bachelor ’s degree , with only 6 % possessing a master ’s degree .

The proliferation of drugs among the poor keeps them dazed and sedated .
Various welfare programs and easy credit keep them from rioting as they can “ purchase ” luxury cars and electronic gadgets enjoyed by the upper classes .
The bad debts are picked up by the taxpayers .
As a further control , those in power have put 2.3 million people in prisons , most of whom are poor and 60 % who are minorities .
By distracting the majority of people in the country with cable TV entertainment , the internet , Twitter , cell phones , sports , movies , and shopping malls , the Pigs who run the show are able to oppress and control the masses .
The highly educated use the idiocy and naïveté of the oppressed to their advantage by using the rigged financial system to generate ever more riches for themselves .
The banker gods peddled fraudulent mortgage schemes throughout the world in order to enrich themselves .
When it blew up in their faces , they turned to their government co-conspirators ( Hank Paulson , Ben Bernanke , and most of Congress ) to keep their riches .
Their Congressional benefactors have obliged by stealing trillions from the taxpaying classes and redistributed it to the Pigs running Goldman Sachs , Citicorp , and Bank of America .
Abuse of Language
George Orwell ’s most pointed criticism of political leaders was their misuse of language to further their wicked agendas .
He exposes the outrageous abuse of words in 1984 and Animal Farm .
The ruling elite manipulate the language as an instrument of control over the masses .
“ The great enemy of clear language is insincerity .
When there is a gap between one 's real and one 's declared aims , one turns , as it were , instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms , like a cuttlefish squirting out ink . ” - George Orwell
The intelligentsia understands that the masses can be manipulated with convincing talking points and misleading slogans .
Politicians never tell their constituents they are doing some pork barrel spending .
Every dollar of new spending is spun as “ investment spending ” .
We have evidently made $ 11.6 trillion of “ investments ” in our National Debt .
Somehow we enacted “ campaign finance reform ” and still manage to spend $ 1.3 billion on political campaigns .
Our beloved numbskull Vice President Joe Biden said last week , “ We have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt ” .
President Bush said , “ I ’ve abandoned free - market principles to save the free market system ” .
President Obama insisted that the only way to save our country from catastrophe caused by excessive debt was to borrow $ 700 billion and spend it on infrastructure projects , of which only 3.5 % was allocated to our crumbling infrastructure .
During the Vietnam War a U.S. Major declared , “ It became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it . ”
In 1947 the government changed the name of the Department of War to the Department of Defense , as we today have garrisons of 100,000 troops in 117 foreign countries .
The Department of Homeland Security , Patriot Act , and War on Terror are all deceptive titles and slogans purposely meant to hoodwink Boobus Americanus .
“ In our age there is no such thing as ' keeping out of politics . '
All issues are political issues , and politics itself is a mass of lies , evasions , folly , hatred and schizophrenia .
The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world .
Lies will pass into history . ” - George Orwell
President Obama and his cronies hammer away that 47 million Americans are uninsured .
It is a lie , but that does not deter them from continuing to make the claim .
The latest Census report says that within the borders of the United States as of 2007 there were 45.65 million people without health insurance .
But this number included 9.73 million foreigners , leaving only 35.92 Americans who were uninsured .
Among the uninsured in the United States there were also 9.1 million people making more than $ 75,000 per year who did not choose to purchase health insurance .
Therefore , we are imposing a trillion dollar solution for 28 million people who are poor and uninsured .
That is $ 36,000 per person while imposing a huge invasive bureaucracy on the lives of the other 278 million Americans .
The masses believe the lies .
Green Extremists have convinced children and dullards that global warming is destroying the planet .
They state their position as fact , when their thesis does not meet the scientific method criteria as fact .
Their contentions are based on computer models .
Our financial system was also based on financial models that said that worthless mortgages were really gold .
We know how that worked out .
The facts are that the earth has warmed prior to the industrial revolution and has cooled .
The sun , water vapor , earth 's orbit , volcanoes , interstellar clouds , cosmic rays , tectonic plates , land use , CO2 , sunspots , gravitational pulls , ocean currents and solar flares all impact earth .
It is far too complex to declare that we know what is happening .
Let ’s get tomorrow ’s weather forecast right first .
Men plan and God laughs .
Must have been a lot of cows farting in the 1400s
The Orwellian language of Big Government turns people into pliable subjects .
It lulls us into passively accepting ever - increasing taxes while encouraging our reliance on an embedded and mutating bureaucracy administered by corrupt career politicians and backed by corporate sugar daddies .
Wall Street shysters have mastered the art or twisting and distorting reality to benefit themselves .
Subprime loans , which triggered the worldwide financial crisis , were called “ nonprime ” .
The billions of worthless toxic loans that still sit on the books of our biggest banks at original cost are now referred to as “ legacy loans ” .
How quaint .
The lowest rated bonds of the worst companies are referred to as “ high yield debt ” , not junk bonds .
We describe our economy as “ free market ” .
There is nothing further from the truth .
Bailouts for corporate failures and rewarding the excess risk takers are not hallmarks of free market capitalism .
Government takeovers of banks , insurance companies , and auto companies are not free market capitalism .
It is a warped form of corporate fascism – the intermingling of the State and corporations for the benefit of a few .
Kevin Depew from Minyanville.com described the Orwellian lies of Hank Paulson as he sat before Congress explaining his criminal actions last Fall .
“ Paulson asserted throughout his testimony that he , almost single - handedly , averted an " economic collapse " and , moreover , that we should actually be thanking him for it .
The ugly assemblage of half - truths , obfuscations , smarmy evasiveness and prickly showboating would have embarrassed Bernie Madoff .
But it was n't Bernie Madoff .
It was a former United States Treasury Secretary .
Myopia
“ Enlightened people seldom or never possess a sense of responsibility . ” - George Orwell
Animal Farm represents any human society whether it be capitalist , socialist , fascist , or communist .
Leaders are capable of being corrupted by power within any form of government .
The myopic thinking of the Pigs in Animal Farm will eventually destroy the farm .
Orwell ends the novel with the animals watching the Pigs mingling with farmers through a window .
They could n’t tell the difference between the supposed revolutionaries and those they had fought against .
If he had looked into the future he would have seen that the Soviet Union would decay from the inside as the corrupt few eventually came to believe their own lies and propaganda .
It collapsed 44 years later as a corrupt , bankrupt , shell of a country .
The combination of myopia , greed , wickedness , ignorance and indifference are a brew that are leading the United States down the same path .
As the Pigs in our society have enriched themselves , the average American has seen their real standard of living stagnate over the last 40 years .
The Pigs have manipulated government inflation statistics so the masses think they are getting ahead .
The myopia of our politicians has put the country into a predicament that we ca n’t escape without tremendous pain and suffering .
In order to keep their positions of power they have passed bills for decades that promise trillions more in goodies than we can possibly pay for .
They have paid no thought to the long - term consequences of their actions because they do n’t care .
Future generations are of no concern to gluttonous power hungry Pigs .
During the eight years of the Bush presidency the ruling class used fear tactics and propaganda to ram through laws which allow Government to monitor the movements and communications of every American .
Liberties have been stripped and freedoms have been restricted .
Now President Obama is attempting to take control over the few aspects of our lives that remain relatively free .
The Orwellian phrase “ Cap & Trade ” sounds much more innocuous than an energy tax of $ 1,500 on every household in America that will drive manufacturers out of the country , along with millions of jobs .
“ America ’s Affordable Health Choices Act ” is the Orwellian name for a bill that will create a massive new bureaucracy , cost at least $ 1 trillion , cost small businesses billions more in health costs , give government the final decision on whether you are worth saving , and provide more freebies to poor Americans .
This will keep the poor sedated and less likely to cause trouble for the ruling class .

“ During times of universal deceit , telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act . ” - George Orwell
As we look through the window at the raucous party between the Pigs and the farmers it is impossible to distinguish between the imperial monarchists who taxed the colonies to such an extreme that it caused a revolution and the revolutionaries that have adopted the same characteristics and traits of those they revolted against .
The American people are like sheep being led to slaughter .
Our Founding Fathers declared that the common people were in control .
Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government .
The time has come to abolish the corrupt system and institute a new Government .
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away ;
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air .
You better watch out ,
There may be dogs about
I ’ve looked over Jordan , and I have seen
Things are not what they seem .
What do you get for pretending the dangers not real .
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel .
What a surprise !
A look of terminal shock in your eyes .
Now things are really what they seem .
No , this is no bad dream .
Have you heard the news ?
The dogs are dead !
You better stay home
And do as you ’re told .
Get out of the road if you want to grow old .

If he had looked into the future he would have seen that the Soviet Union would decay from the inside as the corrupt few eventually came to believe their own lies and propaganda .
It collapsed 44 years later as a corrupt , bankrupt , shell of a country .
The combination of myopia , greed , wickedness , ignorance and indifference are a brew that are leading the United States down the same path .
All you wrote is true .
The above is the most hopeful part of the piece .
Once we 're past the collapse , we can start again .
It is the lifecycle of all empires and there seems to be no way to avoid the pain of this birth / death model .

this is very helpful for my essay .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Several hundred Druze demonstrators clashed with police outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office Sunday during a protest against what they said was state discrimination against their community .
Demonstrators hurled eggs , sticks and bottles at riot police .
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said two policemen and several protesters were injured in the violence .
Druze community leaders say that government funding for their villages falls short of allocations for Jewish communities in Israel .
“ Our soldiers serve at the front but there ’s no state support at home ” read one of the placards at the protest .
Druze men are conscripted into Israel ’s military and the native Arabic speakers are a prominent force in the paramilitary border police , often at the front line of confrontations with Palestinians .
The Druze religion is an offshoot of Islam .
Netanyahu later met some of the protest leaders .
A statement issued by his office said he told them he was aware of the financial problems facing Druze municipal authorities and that he would make a “ supreme effort ” to help them .
“ The prime minister told them he was sitting among them thanks to an Israeli hero -- a Druze soldier who saved his life , ” the statement said , without elaborating .
Netanyahu is a former Israeli army commando .
More than 100,000 Druze live in Israel and another 18,000 live in the Israeli - occupied Golan Heights , territory captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war .
An interesting discovery announcement came across the wire on Friday .
In an article to be published in the Astrophysical Journal , Steven Prado and Stuart Shaklan of JPL write up their detection of a ~6 Jupiter mass companion orbiting the nearby ultra - low - mass red dwarf VB 10 .
Their discovery was made astrometrically , using a modern CCD camera attached to the venerable Palomar 200 - inch telescope .
JPL put out a press release to go along with the article .
VB 10 contains about 78 Jupiter masses , just barely lifting it above the minimum mass required to qualify as a bona - fide hydrogen - burning main sequence star .
It ’s got roughly ten times the mass and ten times the density of its companion .
In the center - of - mass frame , the system configuration looks like this , where I ’m taking a guess at the unknown eccentricity :
I would n’t call VB 10 b a planet in the usual sense .
With a mass of order one - tenth that of its parent star , it ’s almost certainly straggling in at the very bottom of the stellar initial mass function .
It ’s a low - mass brown dwarf impinging into the “ planet desert ” from above .
Gravitational instabilities tend to crop up if a protostellar disk exceeds 10 % the mass of its central star , so the VB 10 system probably formed via the fragmentation process that leads to binary stars rather than via the core accretion mechanism that seems to be responsible for the majority of Jovian planets .
Presumably , a similar fragmentation - based process had a hand in the formation of 2M1207 , in which a ~ 4 Jupiter - mass secondary orbits a ~ 25 Jupiter - mass primary :

At a distance of only 19 light years , VB 10 is ( relatively speaking ) just right next door .
In tandem with its wide binary companion Wolf 1055 , it currently ranks as the 68th - nearest known stellar system .
That one need not travel far afield to find VB 10b means that objects like VB 10b are probably common in orbit around the most dimunitive red dwarfs .
As instrumentation improves , it ’ll eventually become possible to survey the satellite systems of objects like VB 10b .
In our solar system , Jupiter , Saturn and Uranus all have roughly 2 ×10 - 4 of their primary mass locked up in satellites .
I ’m guessing that this rule of thumb will continue to hold when exomoons start getting detected , but I bet that it wo n’t hold true for objects that formed via fragmentation .
The VB 10 system is built to last .
The primary will enjoy a main - sequence lifetime of close to ten trillion years , during which time the Milky Way - M31 merger remnant will become increasingly isolated from all the other mass that makes up the currently observable universe .
Tidal evolution will gradually tighten up the orbit of VB 10b , meaning that the binary will quite possibly survive and harden further during quadrillions of years of encounters with passing degenerates .
Barring other catastrophes , gravitational radiation will eventually bring VB 10 and VB 10b together into merger .
That shot of good pure H will revive the dead helium remnant of VB 10 , causing it to shine for a further hundred billion years or so .
By Dave Hitt on Jul 10 , 2009 in Bad Business , Featured , Politics , Yeah - That 'll Work
This morning someone had one of those talking heads infotainment morning “ news ” shows on in another room , and I was half listening to a story about the stimulus bill .
Millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on roadside signs telling us that millions of taxpayer dollars being spent on road work .
Toward the end of the segment the host casually mentioned that we ’re spending eighteen million dollars on a web site that tracks the package ’s spending .
I figured I ’d research that later , but did n’t have to – an article about it showed up in a tweet from the Cato Institute .
Yep , eighteen million .
I run three websites : davehitt.com , which includes The Facts , the Quick Hitts podcast , and this blog , and the separate sites The Podcast Peer Awards and Blood Witness .
It costs me less than $ 200 a year .
Granted , we ’re talking a shared server and maybe 1500 unique visitors on a busy day .
But I ’ve also worked for an e-commerce company and am familiar with the costs involved .
A big , busy e-commerce site costs $ 50 k - $ 100 k to set up , and five or six grand a month in hosting fees .
Even if Uncle Sam was contracting for a site to be built from scratch it should n’t cost more than five or six hundred thousand dollars for design and implementations , and no more than 100 K a year to keep it up and running .
Eighteen million bucks for a single web site .
This is the same government that stupid people believe will bring down the price of health care if we socialize medicine .
Yeah , that ’ll work .
The crew were marched through the Tower of London
A US Navy vessel has become the first non-British ship to take part in a ceremony at the Tower of London that dates back hundreds of years .
The USS Halyburton was involved in the Constable 's Dues ritual , which involved the crew being challenged for entry into the capital .
It mirrors an ancient custom in which a ship had to unload some of its cargo for the sovereign to enter the city .
The ceremony dates back to the 14th Century .
Saturday 's recreation of the ceremony began when the captain of the USS Halyburton , Commander Michael P Huck , led his crew to the Tower 's West Gate .
There they were challenged for entry to the Tower by the Yeoman Gaoler armed with his axe .
The keg of wine represents the vessel 's ' dues '
They were then marched through the Tower of London to Tower Green , accompanied by the Beefeaters in scarlet and gold state dress and a corps of drums .
The commander then delivered a keg of wine , representing the dues , to the Tower 's Constable , Sir Roger Wheeler .
The constable was the sovereign 's representative and would have been among the most powerful men in the city .
The USS Halyburton is currently moored in South Dock at London Docklands where it arrived on Thursday for a three - night stay .
Cambridge , Mass .
No more than five or six minutes elapsed from the time the police were alerted to the possibility of a break - in at a home in a quiet residential neighborhood and the awful clamping of handcuffs on the wrists of the distinguished Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr .
If Professor Gates ranted and raved at the cop who entered his home uninvited with a badge , a gun and an attitude , he did n’t rant and rave for long .
The 911 call came in at about 12:45 on the afternoon of July 16 and , as The Times has reported , Mr. Gates was arrested , cuffed and about to be led off to jail by 12:51 .
The charge : angry while black .
The president of the United States has suggested that we use this flare - up as a “ teachable moment , ” but so far exactly the wrong lessons are being drawn from it  especially for black people .
The message that has gone out to the public is that powerful African - American leaders like Mr. Gates and President Obama will be very publicly slapped down for speaking up and speaking out about police misbehavior , and that the proper response if you think you are being unfairly targeted by the police because of your race is to chill .
I have nothing but contempt for that message .
Mr. Gates is a friend , and I was selected some months ago to receive an award from an institute that he runs at Harvard .
I made no attempt to speak to him while researching this column .
Capping a 10 - day convention in Anaheim , leaders of the Episcopal Church agreed Friday to consider marriage liturgies for same - sex unions and to give bishops greater latitude in meeting the spiritual needs of gay and lesbian couples .
The new policy marked a second victory for liberals after the church gave final approval Tuesday to a measure ending a de facto ban on the ordination of gay bishops .
Debate over liberalizing the rules underlined deep theological differences within the church of 2.1 million Episcopalians , and raised new concerns over tensions with the wider Anglican Communion .
The Episcopal Church is the U.S. branch of the communion .
On Friday , the U.S. church ’s top two officials sought to calm fellow Anglicans , including the communion ’s spiritual leader , Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams

In a letter to Williams , Episcopal Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori and the president of the church ’s House of Deputies , Bonnie Anderson , described the resolution on gay bishops as “ more descriptive than prescriptive in nature . ”
They said it does not repeal the earlier ban on such ordinations , but instead reaffirms commitments made by the church ’s constitution and canons , which prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation .
“ In adopting this resolution , it is not our desire to give offense , ” they wrote .
“ We remain keenly aware of the concerns and sensibilities of our brothers and sisters in other churches across the communion .
We believe also that the honesty reflected in this resolution is essential if indeed we are to live into the deep communion that we all profess and earnestly desire . ”
Copies of the letter were sent to the communion ’s 38 other regional leaders .

During the convention , Jefferts Schori voted for the new polices on ordinations and blessings .
In an interview Friday , the Episcopal leader spoke of the need to balance the aspirations of her church with the broader goal of unity .
“ Change does n’t happen overnight , ” she said , predicting that the church would continue to deepen its relations with the Anglican Communion , despite the conflict that erupted after the Episcopal Church ’s 2003 consecration of an openly gay bishop from New Hampshire .
Some Anglican leaders from Africa and elsewhere have since cut ties with the U.S. church .
Jefferts Schori also said she believes that the tensions between the church and some Anglicans are less the result of theological differences than varying social norms in different regions of the world .

“ I think we are learning more about each other ’s contexts , ” she said of the relationships in the communion .
“ We know more about what it means to be a Christian in Pakistan or North India or Kenya . ”
The issue of same - sex blessings took up part of the convention ’s final day of legislative business .
Clergy and laity in the church ’s House of Deputies voted 152 to 64 to approve the measure , affirming a decision made two days earlier by Episcopal bishops .
The resolution acknowledges “ changing circumstances ” in the United States and other countries resulting from legislation authorizing or forbidding marriage , civil unions or domestic partnerships for gays and lesbians .
Advertisement
It calls for a “ renewed pastoral response from this church , and for an open process for the consideration of theological and liturgical resources for the blessing of same - gender relationships . ”
A church committee will collect and develop such resources for consideration when the General Convention gathers next in 2012 .
The measure gives bishops , particularly those in jurisdictions where gay marriage is legal , discretion to allow same - sex blessings , saying officials may “ provide generous pastoral response to meet the needs of members of this church . ”
Such blessings already are common in some parts of the denomination .
Advocates of change framed the deliberations as matters of compassion and social justice , likening their cause to an uproar over the ordination of women in the 1970s that ultimately led to women being named to the highest ranks of the church .

The blessings measure says the convention honors “ the theological diversity of this church in regard to matters of human sexuality ” and invites input from within the church and the larger communion .
Opponents questioned whether the large majorities of Episcopal bishops and deputies who embraced the liberalized policies had been moved by cultural trends rather than biblical authority , noting that the Bible defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman .
They worried that the new direction would accelerate the departure of congregations .
Several dozen Episcopal parishes and four dioceses left last year to form a rival church .
The differences were on display Friday during a short debate before deputies voted .
One representative described the measure as an “ elegant blend of theological care , ecclesiastical breadth and pastoral generosity , ” while another told the gathering that the church was “ covering itself in shame . ”
Despite the varying interpretations , deputies and bishops alike characterized the legislative debates as prayerful and generous , if messy at times .

“ What has happened at the convention are signs of the health and vigor of the Episcopal Church , ” said Bishop J. Neil Alexander of Atlanta .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. leaders should be open to the possibility of a second stimulus package to jolt the economy out of a recession still causing job losses , House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Tuesday .
House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer speaks at a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington , March 18 , 2009 .

But in the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid was more skeptical of the need for more stimulus spending -- an idea that rattled markets fearful that the economy is far from well and corporate earnings could suffer .
Reid said he saw no evidence another stimulus was needed , saying the “ shoots ” of economic recovery “ are now appearing above the ground . ”
President Barack Obama led the charge for a two - year $ 787 billion stimulus package that his fellow Democrats who control Congress pushed through the House and Senate in February and he has argued it would help create or save up to 4 million jobs .
Despite continued large job losses , both Reid and Hoyer -- who spoke at separate news conferences -- said not enough time had passed since first package was approved for it to have the full impact on the U.S. economy , which has been in a recession since December 2007 .
“ It ’s certainly too early right now ... to say it ’s not working , ” Hoyer said of the initial stimulus package .
“ In fact we believe it is working .
We believe there are a lot of people who otherwise would have been laid off , lost their jobs , who have n’t done that . ”
The rate of job losses was slowing , but “ it ’s not where it ought to be , ” he added .
Some areas of the economy were still in trouble , he said , “ housing being the leading sector . ”
“ I think we need to be open to whether we need additional action , ” Hoyer said .
Last month employers shed some 467,000 jobs , which sent the unemployment rate up to 9.5 percent , the highest in nearly 26 years .
However , the jobs outlook is expected to get worse in coming months , with Obama and many economists predicting it will surge past 10 percent .
In the Senate , Reid said only a little over 10 percent of the initial stimulus money had been spent so far .
The rest , he said , is “ going to move more quickly now .
“ As far as I am concerned there is no showing to me that another stimulus is needed , ” Reid told reporters .
REPUBLICAN SCORN
Suggestions of a second stimulus have been bubbling up amid criticism by Republicans who have argued that the first package was misdirected and wasted money on programs that so far have not sufficiently boosted the economy and created jobs .
To that end , a Government Accountability Office report due out on Wednesday found that while the Department of Transportation has committed $ 15.9 billion of the $ 26.7 billion set for highway and other projects , only $ 233 million has been paid out .
“ States are just beginning to get projects awarded so that contractors can begin work , ” according to a copy of the report obtained on Tuesday by Reuters .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell poured scorn on the very idea of another economic stimulus package .
“ I think a second stimulus is an even worse idea than the first stimulus , which has been demonstrably proven to have failed , ” he told reporters .
“ And we ’re -- we ’re spending $ 100 million a day on interest on the first stimulus , ” he added .
“ Rush and spend is what this administration is about , rush and spend .
This needs to stop . ”
Debt prices dropped on Tuesday in part because of concerns about further federal borrowing and appetite by investors .
The deficit is expected to hit an eye - popping $ 1.8 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year , which ends September 30 .
U.S. stocks also fell sharply to a 10 - week low on Tuesday amid talk of a second stimulus .
Laura D’Andrea Tyson , an economist who advised Obama during the 2008 campaign and a member of his economic advisory panel , said on Tuesday in Singapore that the United States should be planning for a possible second round of fiscal stimulus and focused on infrastructure investment .
The conquering hero left his helicopter yesterday and wandered over to the school cricket field .
There , a bunch of rapturous children greeted him .
" Freddie , Freddie , Freddie , " they cried .
Andrew Flintoff was on a whistle - stop tour of his own cricket academies – he went to Bristol and , via the chopper , to Bolton .
And if they would have been star struck to see him in any event , his deeds at Lord 's earlier this week took the elation up a notch or 10 .
As usual , he was perfectly at home among his audience , for Freddie is truly a man of the people .
They warm to him as to few cricketers .
They love the bravura manner of his performances , born of courage and desire and the clear evidence that , despite the torture his body has been through these past few years , he is happy in his work .
They adore the fact he likes a pint .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But Flintoff had a warning for those who think that the Ashes are coming home this early in the piece .
He said : " If we think we have done anything so far then we will get found out , " he said .
" We have won one Test match and that 's all we 've won .
It 's great and we enjoyed it but it's now about getting ready for next week and we have got to perform as we have or even better .
" The two sides are dramatically different in appearance from the last time we played in 2005 and I think they are close .
That 's what we might see over the next three matches , the series is obviously hotting up nicely . "
Flintoff is in considerable discomfort – and often something worse – from the knee on which he had surgery only weeks ago .
But he is desperate to play in the final three matches of the Ashes series and , after his extraordinary spell of hostile fast bowling , starting on Sunday and culminating on Monday morning at Lord 's , it is clear that the Ashes now are also a Farewell to Freddie .
It is not what he wants particularly , although it is easy to see that he likes the roar of the crowd .
On Monday after his first , crucial wicket of the day to end the worrying partnership between Brad Haddin and Michael Clarke , he stood without fuss in the middle of the pitch .
But by the end , when he completed his 5 for 92 , he stood there , his arms spread wide like the Angel of the North come to life .
In Bolton yesterday , where he entered thoroughly into the spirit of the coaching – and had a 30 mph underarm hit for six by Sam Barnett – it was hard to tell who was the more rapt , the kids or their parents .
That is the measure of true stardom .
Flintoff insists that his attention is solely on the matter in hand , treating the knee as carefully as possible , and that nothing else matters but the next three matches .
" There is no time for sentiment , " he said .
" I will worry about that when I finish at The Oval .
Walking off for the last time at Lord 's the other day was special .
I sat in the dressing room and had a look around and felt pretty pleased with myself .
" It probably has n't hit me yet , in a few weeks , maybe when the lads are playing in South Africa this winter , that 's when it will hit me .
But for now I just want to focus on playing at Edgbaston and performing . "
Freddie is giving up
Test cricket after the Ashes to play one - day internationals and Twenty20 cricket in the Indian Premier League and perhaps elsewhere .
It is his body that has told him to go but it is obvious that Twenty20 , in particular , poses a threat to the longest and purest form of the game .
He was surprisingly pragmatic about this .
" The public will decide the future of Test cricket , " he said .
" If people turn out to watch Twenty20 and not Test cricket then it could happen .
In England we need to maintain the appeal it has .
We have seen in the past few years what it means to people and we have to preserve that for the good of the game and the tradition behind it because it is a great format .
The one thing we need to do to continue to maintain
Test cricket as being special is cutting down the amount and make it a real occasion rather than playing one after another . "
The last point is pertinent but unfortunately it has fallen on deaf ears in the corridors of cricketing administrative power .
Perhaps they may be more prepared to listen now that one of the game 's pukka heroes has gone .
If the endless litany of injuries was the overriding reason , there were other matters to take into account .
" The family is a consideration , one of the kids starts school this year and it is getting more and more a factor .
But ultimately it has been my body . "
There would be a deep irony if Flintoff 's long - term presence in Twenty20 further erodes the appeal of Test cricket , which in 2005 he did so much to revitalise .
" It was interesting coming here today and asking the kids what form of cricket they like best .
They like the glitz and glamour of Twenty20 but maybe Twenty20 could have a knock - on effect so that players start with it and then work out how to play the longer form .
So it could have a positive effect but it 's going to have to be handled very delicately . "
But Flintoff told his audience at a question and answer session – and he reinforced the point later – that nothing gives a cricketer a buzz like the Ashes .
Nothing makes him more determined or proud and it is why he will drag his body to the starting line next Thursday .
When he is done he will have more time to spend on his cricket academy , run by his Lancashire team - mate Luke Sutton , and the Andrew Flintoff Foundation , about both of which he is passionate .
And will he have any regrets ?
Taking on the captaincy in the last Ashes series , perhaps , which ended in a 5 - 0 whitewash for Australia and left Flintoff visibly scarred with pain that had nothing to do with his body .
" When you get offered the captaincy you 've got to have a go , " he said .
" In India , where it went well , I was playing well and anything that needed doing I 'd do it myself .
When I was n't playing well it was tough .
I 'm glad I had a go , maybe it saved [ Andrew ] Straussy .
It might have been different .
The right man has ended up with the job but maybe I took one for the team out in Australia and now Straussy can go about his business . "
And maybe he did .
Flintoff will be in the hearts of the nation in the next six weeks and sometimes those hearts will be in their mouths .
He is playing Australia and nothing will ever be better than that .
But he has not forgotten where he came from as he remembered yesterday when he was asked about his proudest moment .
Flintoff , long before he became Freddie , played his first game for Lancashire Under - 11s when he was nine .
He was awarded a cap with a red rose which he wore for three weeks .
How the audience loved that and the story about his first ever match for Dutton Forshaw Under - 11s in Preston when he was six and out for a duck .
He knows he is a better bowler than ever – " but it 's too late " – but has a fond wish to hit the Aussies for six with the bat .
" I 'm still a batter , I still want to perform , but most of all I want to be there and performing . "

The big balls have attracted lots of attention among shoppers
A valley town centre 's new artworks of seven large chrome spheres have been turned into " great balls of fire " by this summer 's heatwave .
Shoppers have been burning their backsides on the chrome balls put in as part of a £ 10,000 scheme to brighten up Ebbw Vale , Blaenau Gwent .
Weary shoppers were regularly sitting on them until soaring temperatures turned them into round ovens .
The council warned people to take care when sitting on the artwork .
Cafe owner Samantha Dighton , 28 , said : " We have one of the balls right outside our front door and it's a health hazard .
" We 've had a few people coming in for a cup of tea complaining they 've been burnt by the heat from the balls .
Piping hot " I thought they were just making it up .
But when I went out there on a hot afternoon the ball was hot enough to fry an egg on !
Market stall holder Gethin Bennett , 21 , said : " At first the big balls attracted lots of attention .
" It was good to see little kids race up to them seeing their reflections in the silver metal .
" But then they were springing back because the things are piping hot .
" Honestly , you would n't believe how hot they get until you touch them . "
Student Christy Young , 16 , said : " My friend 's toddler leant on one of these balls last week and burnt his hands .
A shopper escapes from one of the overheating balls " He 's frightened to death to come into town now !
" Whoever put these things in ought to be more careful - especially if there are kids involved . "
Pensioner Anne Williams , 62 , said : " They 've only been in a week and everyone hates them already .
" I touched one last week and sprung back because it was so hot .
Someone 's going to get seriously burnt one of these days . "
Allan Stokes and his family liked the look of the balls but he has warned his children not to go near them in case they get burnt .
Talking point " They 'll either have to remove them or put some protective coat on them to stop people getting hurt , " he said .
" Surely somebody should have tested them before they were put in the town centre . "
A spokesman for Blaenau Gwent Council said : " These artworks have become a talking point here in Ebbw Vale .
" During the unusually hot weather we would expect shiny metal surfaces of all kinds to heat up in the sun and people do need to take care .
" However , if people do have concerns we are happy to look into this . "

Before they used canisters , campers often stored food in bags , typically hung from cables slung between trees , which inadvertently made for one - stop shopping for bears .
“ They had learned that when they saw a bag in the air , there had to be a rope someplace and they learned to bite or slice the line , ” said Neil Woodworth , executive director of the Adirondack Mountain Club , a conservation and recreation group .
The number of “ negative human - bear interactions , ” according to the Department of Environmental Conservation  mainly incidents in which bears approached people looking for food  dropped to 61 last year in the eastern High Peaks from 374 in 2005 .
But , of course , there was a problem with the solution .
BearVaults , one of several canister brands , are favored by many backpackers because they are light and can be opened with bare hands ; most others require a coin or screwdriver .
Like other brands , BearVaults must pass the zoo test , in which bears are given a certain amount of time to try to break into a canister filled with food .
Similar to a childproof medicine bottle , the BearVault 350 and 400 models can be opened by pressing a tab that allows the camper to screw off the lid .
But reports began coming in from campers a few years ago that BearVaults were being broken into .
State wildlife officials began suspecting Yellow - Yellow , one of a number of bears they have tagged and tracked as a way of studying the behavior of the more than 5,000 bears roaming the Adirondacks .
In most BearVault break - ins , Yellow - Yellow ’s radio collar indicated she had been in the area .
Eventually , campers began spotting her from afar rifling canisters .
There have been no reports of her threatening anyone .
Image Campers in the Adirondacks are warned to beware of bears .

So last year Mr. Hogan introduced the 450 , a two - pound cylinder costing about $ 60 , and a larger version , the 500 , each with a second tab .
On them , a camper must press in one tab , turn the lid partway , then press the second tab to remove the lid .
“ We thought , ‘ O.K. , well , one bump did n’t work so maybe two bumps will thwart her , ’ ” he said .
You read the title of this article correctly .
You can trade your cigarette habit for gold .
In fact , you can trade just about any of your bad habits for gold if you wish .
If you would give me a few minutes just to read this short article I will show you how .
This method will be free of charge to you .
There are no hidden gimmicks , nothing to sign up for ; I wo n’t even ask for your e-mail address or name .
You need to do nothing to quit that cigarette habit , or whatever habit you wish to end , by merely reading this article and doing 5 minutes of math on your own afterwards .
I stopped smoking cigarettes this way with no urges to ever smoke again .
You can too .
It ’s that simple .
First off , let me get philosophical with you and talk about motivations .
You know , it ’s funny what motivates people .
Some people are motivated by love ; some by health ; some by dreams .
Heck there ’s no end to what motivates people .
I ’m an unusual sort .
I ’m extremely motivated by a want of money .
I just ca n’t seem to get enough of it .
Funny that .
Now I suppose some folks who are well - read in the verses of the bible , namely Exodus 20:3 , where it says something along the lines of , “ Thou shalt have no other gods before me ” might have trouble with those , like me , who are so motivated by money .
It may be unfortunate but I am not ashamed to say that I am terribly enamored by money ; always have been .
It ’s not that I do n’t believe in , or do n’t have those other things — I do .
I believe in God ; I have a happy family , a decent job , I am well loved …
( Though I could be assuming a lot about that last part about “ love . ” — Update : I just asked the little woman to confirm this part for me and she enthusiastically smirked her approval ! )
So , if you are like me then you have love , a family , God , what - have - you .
You just do n’t have enough money .
Oh , and you have a bad habit that you ’d like to kick too .
Okay , well , you ’ve come to the right place .
I ’ve tried to quit smoking many times .
And , like most smokers , I was successful at quitting each and every time .
Sometimes I would go without a cigarette for two months at a time .
One time I even quit for eight months .
But I could never stay quit .
Why ?
My motivations were weak .
You ’ll hear people trying to motivate you to quit by using the “ health angle . ”
They say things like , “ For every cigarette you smoke , your life gets shorter by seven minutes … .
Do n’t you want to see your children ’s wedding ? ”
Then , a few days later , you read the newspaper about some guy in China who is celebrating his 116th birthday and his secret to a long life is to smoke two packs of cigarettes everyday , drink booze nightly and chase wild women .
Oh , and by the way , did I forget to mention that his children all passed away a few decades ago ?
Then , a couple of days later , you read about a girl , who never smoked a day in her life , dying within two months after being diagnosed with lung cancer .
Others try to talk you into quitting because of the daily cost of cigarettes .
This never worked for me as cigarettes in Japan cost about $ 3 a pack …
And that ’s even for imported American cigarettes .
Ask any smoker who is dying for a cigarette if he will give you a fiver for just one cigarette — just one cigarette right now — and see what he says .
If he ’s desperate enough , he ’ll give you the money .
I know I would .
Nope .
These kinds of motivations never worked for me .
Nothing ever worked until one day last month … .
I was having lunch with a business partner .
I , as usual , was talking about myself .
I explained how I think I live a pretty frugal life .
As I was discussing this with a friend , he laughed and said , " You sound like the people in a book entitled , The Millionaire Next Door . "
My friend then recommended that I read the book .
The Millionaire Next Door Thomas J. Stanley , Wil ... Best Price : $ 1.54 Buy New $ 7.97 ( as of 10:46 EST - Details )
It was a very interesting read .
It a book written by two guys who were asked to do research on what millionaires liked to do ; where they shopped ; what they thought ; things like that .
So to find these millionaires to interview , the writers went to millionaire neighborhoods .
Makes sense right ?
The amazing thing about it is that in the millionaire neighborhoods , the writers found that the people living there actually were n’t millionaires ; they were in debt up to their necks .
These people actually had very little accumulated wealth .
Further research showed that most of America ’s millionaires did not look like millionaires , nor did they drive expensive European cars .
They lived frugal lives and lived way under their means .
The real millionaires accumulated huge sums of wealth , yet they did n’t flaunt it .
This kind of thinking really appeals to me .
Why ?
Well , I know a lot of confused people — I ’ll bet you do too — who like to act like they are rich or famous , but actually are n’t .
It ’s all a show .
They feel that they have a standard of living that they have to uphold so they are constantly striving to keep up with the Joneses ; even if they are in debt up to their asses in doing so .
This is also one of the big reasons why the USA is in the mess it ’s in , but I ’ll leave that subject to the many better and more informed writers at LRC than yours truly .
What does this have to do with quitting cigarettes ?
Everything .
In one example of frugal living cited in the book , the writers pointed out how a couple who smoked cigarettes for 46 years , and spent $ 33,190 dollars , could have used that exact same amount of money and made over $ 2 million dollars .
Here is the exact text referring to this from pages 51 — 52 of The Millionaire Next Door :
His parents smoked three packs of cigarettes a day .
How many packs did they consume during their adult lifetimes ?
There are 365 days in a year .
So they consumed approximately 50,370 packs of cigarettes .
How much did the couple pay for those cigarettes ?
Approximately $ 33,190 — more than the purchase price of their home !
They never considered how much it cost to purchase cigarettes .
They viewed such purchases as small expenses .
But small expenses become big expenses over time .
Small amounts invested periodically also become large investments over time .
What if the Friends had invested their cigarette money in the stock market ( index fund ) during their lifetimes ?
How much would it have been worth ?
Nearly $ 100,000 .
And what if they had used their cigarette money to purchase shares in a tobacco company ?
What if they purchased , reinvested dividends , and never sold shares in Philip Morris instead of smoking Philip Morris products for forty - six years ?
At the end of forty - six years , the couple would have had a tobacco portfolio worth over $ 2 million .
( Emphasis his )
They could have had $ 2 million dollars for $ 33,190 out of pocket investment !?
Now this kind of thing motivates me .
Of course , the writers of The Millionaire Next Door only used this as an example of how small expenses could be made into large sums and how a frugal lifestyle pays off in many more ways than just one .
But this was the switch that flipped on the light on in my head .
It is also the rationale that , if you are like me , and want money , then it could be the motivation that you really need to quit your habit .
We probably can no longer invest in the stock market and have any hope of making as much money as the example above in cigarette companies or most stocks .
But how about gold or silver ?
I want all the gold or silver that I can get my hands on .
I took out a piece of paper and calculated my own experience , and you can too .
Here ’s how it worked out for me :
I started smoking in 1998 .
I smoked one pack a day for ten years .
Cigarettes in Japan cost about $ 3.00 a pack .
So at $ 3.00 multiplied by 365 days , I was spending about $ 1095 annually on cigarettes .
Now , take the monthly average gold price since that time .
Refer to here .
In , say , 1999 , when the monthly average price of gold was $ 278.98 per ounce , I could have bought about 3.87 ounces of gold for the $ 1095 - some - dollars I had spent on cigarettes that year .
Now I calculated it this way for every year I smoked until May 2009 .
Schizophrenic in Japan ... Mike Rogers Best Price : $ 3.50 Buy New $ 17.41 ( as of 10:46 EST - Details )
My total expenditures for cigarettes ( not counting lighters , matches , losing packs I had just bought , etc… ) over those ten - plus years was about $ 17,330 .
Had I instead invested in gold , instead of cigarettes , today I could have had 32.39 ounces of gold .
At the spot price of May 22 , 2009 ; that 32.39 ounces of gold would be worth nearly $ 31,000 dollars .
Now that motivates me .
Perhaps turning $ 17,330 into $ 31,000 does n’t motivate you enough .
OK , well , think about this ; if the price of gold hits $ 2,000 or even $ 5,000 an ounce as some people like Peter Schiff have said — and I believe them — then my $ 31,000 turns into $ 161,000 .
Not a bad reward for not setting fire to $ 17,330 .
Makes me cringe when I think of how I burnt up all those ounces of gold I could have had .
If you are like me and owning gold does n’t motivate you to quit a bad habit , then do n’t even bother trying to quit .
But if this does motivate you , figure it out yourself and change those 100’s , Lights , Menthols , and Golds into real gold .
I keep these calculations going over and over in my mind — I no longer have any urge to smoke .
Try it if you wish .
To paraphrase that Mogambo - dude , “ Whee , this kicking the habit stuff is easy ! ”
Here ’s a simple chart showing my calculations :
I smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day @ $ 3.00 per pack X 365 days = $ 1095 per year .
The Best of Mike ( in Tokyo ) Rogers
the main accepted over the rustic are the Yankees , despite if it relies upon the place you reside .
everywhere i bypass , I atleast see a million - 2 human beings wearing a Twins cap , and that i infrequently ever see the different caps around .
individually , I easily have never considered a Royals cap in my life , yet i have n't considered others additionally .
Tuesday , June 9th , marks the start of the MLB Draft ( it ’ll go on for a few days ) .
And while the baseball draft does n’t come with the anticipation , nor the glam and glitz , of the NFL or NBA draft , it ’s still a fun time for fans to get a glimpse of what might be a team ’s future .
Granted , a lot of draft picks do not make much of an impact in the majors .
And signability remains a huge concern , so much so , that the top talent often is not picked first .
That makes the draft a bit unique among professional leagues , where it is n’t always about selecting the best player available .
However , as college baseball continues to gain traction as an option for top athletes and as MLB continues to increase the exposure of the Rule IV amateur draft , there will always be more attention paid to what is hoped to be the next generation of baseball stars .
This year ’s crop is considered a pretty weak one , save for one super - stud at the top , Steve Strasburg .
After that , the pickings start to get slim between a bunch of disappointing hitters and a bevy of pitchers with questions marks .
Although the standard tagline applies that most of these players will not make an impact for years , remember that David Price and Matt Wieters were 2007 draftees and are starting to make their impact felt in the Majors .
Plus Gordon Beckham recently became the first 2008 draftee to debut for the White Sox .
So things can happen fast .
Here are ten players to keep an eye on for Tuesday to see where they land .
These may not be the ten best players , but are some of the most interesting prospects worth monitoring .
And if you ’re really forward looking , check out this story on Bryce Harper , the “ next big thing ” in the world of baseball who may try and become eligible for the 2010 draft .
1. Stephen Strasburg , RHP , San Diego State
Strasburg has been called by some as the best pitching prospect in draft history and many consider him to be Major League ready right now .
That ’s how good he is .
He absolutely dominated the college ranks , although one should note he did so for a non -major team in a secondary conference .
Still , he can reach triple digits with his fastball , has outstanding command , and a pretty good breaking ball .
Barring injury he should be a good one , maybe even one day the best pitcher in baseball .
The downside ?
As BP ’s Kevin Goldstein joked , “ there ’s no definitive proof that he ’s not an android from a faraway planet bent on world destruction . ”
He ’s going to be selected by the Washington Nationals with the # 1 pick , he ’s going to command a record setting signing bonus , and there ’s a pretty good chance he makes at least a cameo appearance in the Majors this season .
And yeah , that ’s him above playing for Team USA in the Beijing Olympics .
2. Dustin Ackley , OF , North Carolina
The Miss Congeniality of this year ’s draft , Ackley has emerged as the best of the rest in the post - Strasburg derby .
He ’s also the only hitter critics can agree belongs in the top ten picks .
The draft class is that weak on positional talent .
Which does n’t mean teams wo n’t reach for positional talent , it ’s just that Ackley ’s the onlysure thing .
His combination of tools includes above - average power and speed , along with amazing hands that should make him an excellent hitter overall .
His ideal home is in center field , but he ’s largely untested there .
The hope is that he develops into a smoothhitting centerfielder and an eventual multiple - time all - star .
The Seattle Mariners will likely pay the price to find out , although there ’s a slight chance he falls to the third pick and the San Diego Padres .
3. Aaron Crow , RHP , Fort Worth Cats
Last year , Crow was battling Brian Matusz for the rights to be the top pitcher off the 2008 draft board .
Matusz won , going fourth overall to the Baltimore Orioles .
Crow ended up going ninth to the Washington Nationals , but chose not to sign .
Now , the top right - handed arm from 2008 is back , again showing a good fastball and above - average slider .
The lost year of development does n’t help , but in a weak draft class a polished college pitcher with good credentials is an attractive option .
The former Missouri Tiger has looked good in the Indy leagues , and is poised for another top ten selection .
He could go anywhere in the top ten starting with the secondpick , but seems most destined for the Baltimore Orioles at fifth overall this year .
4. Grant Green , SS , Southern California
A mere six months ago , Green seemed like the clear # 2 pick behind Strasburg .
But a disappointing season has seen his stock plummet , to the point where he ’s no longer even a guarantee to be picked in the top 10 .
Although a college shortstop , questions remain about his ability to remain at the position defensively .
There are also questions about his power , making a switch to third not the best fit .
What do you do with a light hitting player if he ’s not in the middle infield ?
If you believe he can stay at short , and do n’t put too much stock into a sub - par 2009 , Green is still a solid choice .
But if you see the current struggles and possible lack of range at short , he might not even be a Major League regular .
A top ten selection is still likely given the complete lack of hitting choices , but where exactly he lands is anyone ’s guess .
Cincinnati is one possibility , although a better fit might actually be at # 12 to the Kansas City Royals .
5. Tanner Scheppers , RHP , St. Paul Saints
Like Crow , Scheppers was a big time college pitcher seemingly headed for a big pay day last June .
Then shoulder problems hit , and the Fresno State Bulldog saw his stock plummet .
Teams became scared off by the injury , and he did not get picked until the 48th selection of last year ’s draft .
And to add insult to injury , he was picked by the perennial losers , the Pittsburgh Pirates .
Not satisfied with the money offered , he chose to try his hand again at the draft this spring .
The decision seems to be a good one , as the electric fastball has returned , as has the power curve .
Healthquestion marks remain , and that mystery makes him a very high risk factor .
On pure talent , he might be the second best player in the draft .
But the risk , combined with rumors he might try and leverage a contract with a Japanese pro team into a huge pay day have scared off some teams .
Like Green , his final destination is a bit of a mystery , but the Tigers are never scared off by big price tags .
6. Donavan Tate , OF , Cartersville HS ( GA )
Tate is an old school general manager ’s dream as he ’s the best pure athlete in the draft , and thus the guy with the highest ceiling .
With lackluster options , there ’s some incentive to roll the dice and hope to win big with Tate .
He has the raw power and speed to turn into a good one .
But too often those players go the Corey Patterson route , more raw skills than actual baseball talent .
And in such cases the pick has the highest chance of crapping out .
Tate ’s been strongly linked to San Diego at # 3 , but due to the lack of better options he probably lands in the Top 10 somewhere even if the Padres pass .
The next step is to sign him and hope he chooses baseball over football .
7. Tyler Matzek , LHP , Capistrano Valley HS ( CA )
The long , lean lefty sports a surprisingly deep arsenal for a high school arm .
This includes a pretty good fastball - slider combination , plus a solid curve and decent change .
With generally good command , if he can throw four decent offerings all from the left hand side , it ’s hard to not see him becoming at least a useful piece on a big league roster .
Provided he stays healthy .
That ’s the caveat .
It ’s always a risk with high school pitchers , but even moreso with Matzek who has a “ high effort ” delivery .
The Orioles , Giants , and Reds are all possible landing spots .
8. Zach Wheeler , RHP , East Paulding HS ( GA )
Wheeler is one of many high school power right - handers in this draft class , although he tends to rate near the top due to excellent command and good mechanics .
He ’s does n’t sport much else behind a good fastball right now , but there ’s enough to get many teams interested , including several in the top ten selections , like the San Francisco Giants and the Atlanta Braves .
Projectability is the key here and if the Braves are interested , I would take a second look at the kid , even if he is a Georgia kid and there could be a little home cooking go on .
9. Jacob Turner , RHP , Westminster Academy ( MO )
Turner is
Wheeler with a little more velocity , a little more polish , and a bit less control .
Referred to by some as the top high school pitcher in the draft , he can reach 98 on the radar gun , and also has a good curve .
Signability remains a bit of a concern , but he projects to be a frontline starter .
Due to price tag concerns , he ’s been linked to the Tigers in many mock drafts , and they are one of a few teams that can prevent Turner from joining a very strong Tarheel program in the fall .
10 . Mike Leake , RHP , Arizona State
Leake is not a sexy pick , but posted excellent numbers against top notch college competition .
Scouts grade three of his pitches as plus , and he has good control .
The problem ?
He ’s an undersized right - hander , and those kind of pitchers tend to get overlooked .
Even after the success of guys like Tim Hudson and Roy Oswalt .
That and he probably wo n’t get much better than he is now .
What you see is what you get .
With that kind of pedigree , the Oakland A’s have been linked to him , although the Nationals at # 10 make some sense too .
Christian teacher tells of race slurs by pupils aged 8
Nicholas Kafouris says he was forced out after highlighting the rise in racism among pupils at Bigland Green Primary school in East London
A teacher claims he has been sacked for reprimanding pupils who made racist remarks about his being a Christian .
Nicholas Kafouris said he lost his £ 30,000 - a- year post because he would not tolerate the ' openly racist ' behaviour of pupils as young as eight .
He said the predominantly Muslim youngsters openly praised Islamic extremists in class , and hailed the September 11 terrorists as ' heroes and martyrs ' .
Greek - born Mr Kafouris , 40 , taught for more than ten years at Bigland Green Primary in Tower Hamlets , East London , where according to the most recent Ofsted report ' almost all ' the 465 pupils are from ethnic minorities and a vast proportion do not speak English as a first language .
He is taking the school , its headmistress and assistant head to an employment tribunal where he will claim he was forced out after highlighting the rise in racism among pupils .
In 2006 , said Mr Kafouris , he brushed against a boy while giving him a book .
' He said rather brusquely to me , " Do n't touch me , you 're a Christian " .
I found this very offensive . '
Later that year , he said children aged eight and nine in his class praised the suicide bombers in the 9/11 attacks .
' In late November and December 2006 , many various unacceptable and openly racist , anti-Semitic and anti-Christian remarks were being made by many and various children in Year 4 , ' he said .
' These included , " We want to be Islamic bombers when we grow up " , " the Twin Towers bombers are heroes and martyrs " , " we hate the Jews " and " we hate the Christians " . '
And in January 2007 , he claims some pupils ' expressed delight ' that a child had died when a wall collapsed on him in London .
When asked why , he said one of the children replied : ' Because he 's English . '
The following month , during a religious education lesson about Jonah and the whale , he claims one of the pupils asked if Jonah was a Jew , before shouting : ' I hate the Jews , they 're our enemies . '
Mr Kafouris says he completed ' Racist Incident Reporting Sheets ' and notified headmistress Jill Hankey in writing about each incident .
But he claims his concerns were ignored because she wanted to maintain the school 's ' good '
Ofsted rating .
Mr Kafouris , who is unmarried and has no children , was also reprimanded for handling a discussion about religion with a child ' inappropriately ' , which he denies .
He says assistant head Margaret Coleman accused him of shouting at pupils and telling them Muslims had produced suicide bombers - claims he rejects .
' I believe after I complained to the head about the racist and religious discrimination incidents , I suffered victimisation , ' he says .
' I also suffered less favourable treatment and incurred harassment by the head and assistant head .
' The two people above created an intimidating , hostile , degrading , threatening , humiliating and offensive environment for me at my work . '
Mr Kafouris says the way he was treated brought on stress and depression , and that he was forced to take time off work .
He was finally dismissed because of his absence , on April 30 this year .
A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council , on behalf of the school , said : ' The governing body stands by its decision and we believe all the correct procedures were followed . '

Roll the dice to take your turn .
If you roll some scoring dice then you must take some of those points before you can roll again .
Once you have taken 300 points or more you can bank them or carry on rolling .
If you bank them then the points are safe and your turn is finished .
If you choose to roll again and score no points , that 's a zilch .
You bank zero points and your turn is over .
If you get three zilches in a row then you lose 500 points .
The game ends when one player has banked more than 10000 points .
At that point each player gets one more turn to try and bank more points than the leader .
When everybody has had their last turn the player with the most points wins .

Overview
I ’ve been a fan of Leo Babauta ’s ideas ever since I stumbled across his blog .
His book Power of Less , The : The Fine Art of Limiting Yourself to the Essential …in Business and in Life by Leo Babauta .
is simply fantastic .
I ’m going to give you a summary of his ideas in a series of articles starting with this one .
The other articles are listed below :
The Power of Less – Identify the Essential
Leo ’s ideas are true to themselves – they are elegant examples of less .
The system has two foundational steps from which the rest of the system derives :
Identify the Essential Eliminate the Rest
Modern society is consumption oriented .
Everything seems to be focused towards getting more stuff .
To get more stuff we spend our time getting more money .
Time is finite and so is human ability so there is a limit to what we can do .
If we maximize productivity and time management practice , we can get more tasks done .
But by trying to maximize the number of tasks we do , we end up doing unimportant things .
This dilutes our focus and takes energy away from the more important tasks .
We also end up stressed - out , overworked , and unhealthy .
Setting Limits
Setting limits forces you to choose the essential .
So set limitations for everything you do .
Setting limits is the first of Leo ’s six main principles .
Leo provides a beautiful illustration of it with Japanese Haiku .
This form of poetry requires the poet to express a complete idea in 17 syllables .
In order to accomplish this , the poet must eliminate everything that is not absolutely essential to the meaning .
The result is something very powerful .
Another example .
Imagine two reporters .
Each week , one reporter writes 30 short , quick , and limited articles that get little attention .
The other reporter writes one really good article each week .
Each article has high impact and he receives awards on some of them .
The second reporter did less , focused on the long - term , and gets promotions and widespread recognition as a result .
This is the Power of Less at work .
You can choose to be like the first reporter and “ Get Things Done ” or you can choose to be like the second reporter and do fewer but more high impact tasks .
How do you decide what activities are high impact ?
Use the following criteria :
Long - term view – Will it make you a lot of money or get you a lot of recognition in the long - term ?
Will it make you happy and contribute to your long - term well - being ?
Life changing – Your career or personal life is changed for the better in some important way .
Makes a significant contribution to society or humanity .
Apply these criteria to your tasks , projects , and goals to help determine what is essential for your life .

This is one of the greatest ideas on how to live your life I have ever found .
We lead lives filled with way too much stuff .
It weakens and dilutes our effectiveness .
Go from a limitless life of too much stuff , gadgets , information , etc. that is overwhelming , stressful and ineffective to a life of limits , focus , and incredible power .
This change will bring the following benefits :
Simplifies your life .
Everyday life becomes stress - free and under control .

Firm limits on what you do demonstrates to other people that you treat your time as a precious resource .
You expect everyone else to treat your time the same way .
You are more effective and you achieve more .
You are doing less busy work and more of your important work .
You are n’t spinning your wheels on the trivial .
Set limits on any area of your life that you think is overwhelming .
Examples might include :
Email
Number of tasks or projects
Time spent on phone calls or internet surfing
The number of things on your desk or workspace
The number of subscriptions , paper or online , you regularly read
In reality this is a small fraction of the things you will ultimately want to limit .
However you need to move slowly , changing only one thing at a time until it becomes a habit .
How to Set Limits
Put a strict limit on something you do such as checking email .
Instead of 10 times a day try checking it three times a day .
Test the result .
Can you live with it ?
Can you do your job with it ?
The first week or so of your new habit is an experiment and you will tweak the limit as you learn more about what is reasonable for you .
Continually adjust until you find the right level and make it a habit .
Setting limits is a powerful technique to prevent common tasks from taking over your life .
I suggest you give it a spin .

Overview of Top Website Builder Services
Here is an overview of four of the best and most popular website building companies , with information about what distinguishes each one within this quickly - evolving marketplace .
Wix
The Wix website builder choice of available templates is large and varied , and there are plenty of ways to customize a site with different fonts and colors .
To build your page you can just use a “ drag and drop ” tool , which makes the entire process simple and intuitive .
But one drawback is that after you choose your template you cannot go back and change it for that particular website .
Wix is constantly adding to its platform by building it out with newer and more interesting applications .
While many of those apps are free , others are for sale in the Wix app store .
Wix websites work seamlessly across desktops , tablets , and mobile devices , too .
Wix also has its own freelance marketplace .
If you design a Wix website , for example , you can then offer to create similar sites for others who can view your portfolio and decide whether or not to hire you instead of trying to build their site on their own .
Premium
Wix packages start from about $ 13 a month and the full - featured ones cost about $ 28 a month .
But by signing up and paying for a yearly plan you can save a substantial amount ( between 15 and 45 percent or so , based on which plan you select ) so if you plan to stick with Wix that ’s the way to go .
To see how the pricing works just visit the Wix site for all the details .
Weebly
Weebly appeals to both inexperienced web launchers and more experienced and technically astute uses as well .
Almost everything involved can be intuitively grasped , but helpful tutorials are also available to walk you through the various features available and show you how to incorporate them into your site .
There is no charge to host your website , and you can use a “ drop and drag ” tool to add features from a very large and diverse menu .
Create slideshow , post video clips , integrate a shopping cart feature , calculate tax and shipping charges automatically , or manage and track your inventory .
Building a site is easy , and you can also use Weebly metrics to track the performance of your website – a feature that is especially useful if you are tracking traffic or operating an online retail store through your site .
One feature that many e-commerce users like is that if you have an existing website , Weebly will facilitate importing that product information to the new site that you are building .
You can use a free Weebly web builder , or select a payment plan that fits your needs .
Extras available for a nominal monthly fee include such things as more robust security protocols , connecting your own domain , and greater tech support .
You can view all of the plans and features on the Weebly website .
Yola
Yola offers hundreds of templates , a “ drag and drop ” tool , and the option to launch an expandable website quickly and easily – with hardly any effort .
Just let Yola do the work as you sit back and simply answer questions about your needs and preferences .
You can customize pages , take advantage of Yola ’s search engine optimization technology to generate more traffic to your site , and choose from a robust menu of features to enhance security , navigation , and scalable functionality .
Yola offers online stores within websites , for example , complete with customized layouts , a checkout cart and credit card or PayPal acceptance , order and inventory tracking , and selling over mobile devices .
You can install widgets for Facebook , YouTube , and other platforms , and if you select a design theme for your website and later want to change it you have that flexibility .
Many of the add - on features of Yola do come at an extra cost , though , and you can view the whole pricing structure at Yola to get a clear understanding of how it works .
Squarespace
Squarespace may not offer as many templates as other website builders , but the ones that it does have to choose from are outstanding .
You can also highly customize the look and feel of your website , and Squarespace especially appeals to those who really value visual aesthetics .
But Squarespace is also a website builder that gets lots of positive reviews for its technology .
The company stays on the leading edge in terms of offering all of the newest and most advanced website features , constantly enhancing their product offering .
You can create password protections on specified web pages , for example , build a website that is flawlessly compatible across mobile device platforms , and Squarespace has a whole host of useful and sophisticated e-commerce tools for those who want to open a store on their website .
One limitation that is worth noting , however , is that Squarespace offers one kind of payment acceptance system , called Stripe , which facilitates payments directly to your bank account .
So if you have a preference for other payment processing systems you may find that lack of payment options too restrictive .

( CNN ) --
As college students enter the halls of elite education and higher learning , here is one piece of advice : Learn from the caveman .
Cutting mold off bread and cheese generally is n't a good idea , since the mold could have spread through the food .
" How the caveman worked , he'd check stuff out -- the look and smell of it , " said Jeff Nelken , a food safety expert , about suspicious foods .
" You have a sense of smell and taste , a radar system that tells you that the food is not fresh . "
A survey of more than 4,000 college students published in 2008 in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that " young adults , particularly white men , engage in risky eating behaviors " by consuming undercooked animal products , which carry risks of illness .
College students are n't generally known for healthy eating .
Busy schedules and tight budgets -- and sometimes a lack of knowledge about food -- can result in not - the - greatest choices .
Outside the dining halls , the college student diet may rely heavily on ramen noodles , beer , cereal and leftovers .
Today , a few food experts offer advice on ways to balance health and frugality , since many students are new to the kitchen and crunched for cash .
Can I cut the mold off the bread / cheese and eat the rest ?
It 's tempting to lop off the fuzzy patch , but the mold could have spread already .
" Once you 're able to see mold on bread , it means there 's quite a lot of mold , " said Nelken , a food consultant in Woodland Hills , California .
" It 's indicative that there 's mold on other slices , just not at the level you can see it .
Why jeopardize your health on a slice of bread ? "
Nelken likened mold to jellyfish .
" Even though you scrape off the head of the jellyfish , the tentacles are still in the food product . "
Eating moldy bread could cause an upset stomach .
Although most molds are innocuous , it 's probably not going to taste good , food experts said .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service recommends discarding moldy bread and baked goods , because of their porous texture .
Creamy dairy products like yogurt can easily spread mold and should be discarded .
Soft cheeses with high moisture content -- including those that are shredded , sliced , or crumbled -- can be contaminated with both mold and bacteria .
So throw those away , experts advise .
Hard cheeses can be saved , as long as the mold is cut 1 inch around the spot .
Because of the cheese 's hardness , the mold generally cannot penetrate deep into the product .
Complete chart of USDA 's guide on moldy food .
To save food and money , consider freezing food items to keep them longer , or buy the item in smaller amounts .
Do dry packaged foods like ramen or boxed macaroni and cheese last forever ?
" Forever is a long time , but these products will last for some time , " wrote Linda Harris , a researcher who focuses on microbial food safety at the University of California - Davis .
" The quality will be affected by long - term storage .
The flavors may change over time .
The texture of the noodles might not be as good but they wo n't become unsafe . "
Most dehydrated products have a " Best If Used By " date , recommended for best flavor or quality .
Food experts say it 's not dangerous to eat a product after the " Best If Used By " date , but it could taste different or stale .
Would a hungry college student searching for a cheap , convenient meal notice ?
That would be " highly variable depending upon storage conditions , age , product and taste sensitivity of the student , " Harris said .
The pizza from last night has been sitting out on the counter .
Can I eat it for breakfast ?
The USDA advises no , saying that perishable foods should not be left out for more than two hours .
Anything left at room temperature for longer should be discarded .
" Fridges were invented for a reason , " said Sam Beattie , a food safety extension specialist at Iowa State University .
" They work well to keep food cold .
It slows the growth of these illness - growing microorganisms . "
Leaving a box of pizza out overnight and grazing on it the next morning is something that " I think we 've all done , " Nelken said .
" You do n't hear people getting ill from leftover pizza . "
But he said to steer clear of left - overnight pizza with exotic ingredients such as smoked salmon or grilled eggplant because of bacteria .
Should I drink milk after its use - by date ?
What about eggs ?
Drinking milk a day or two after its use - by date should n't be an issue .
But if you notice changes in flavor , consistency , smell -- do n't take any chances , Nelken said .
For eggs , the USDA recommends using within three to five weeks of the date of purchase .
The " sell - by " date will usually expire by then , but the eggs are safe to use .
Eggs and milk should be stored in the coldest areas of the refrigerator , not on the door , since it 's four to five degrees warmer there .
Raw chicken always smells funny .
How do I know if it 's gone bad ?
It 'll smell a lot more gamy , said Beattie , an assistant professor for food safety in Ames , Iowa .
This means it 'll give off an odor -- stronger than when you first bought it at the grocery store .
Store chicken in the freezer or use refrigerated chicken within three days after purchase .
Beyond that , spoilage organisms will get into the chicken and it will start emitting an unpleasant smell , Beattie said .
Invest in a cooking thermometer to make sure that meat has been cooked thoroughly , rather than relying on visual cues .
Wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap to avoid transmitting E.coli and salmonella .
Should I drink the water after the expiration date has passed on the bottle ?
" What happens with water is absolutely nothing , " Beattie said .
Water is safe to drink even past its expiration date ( as long as there 's no leakage in the bottle ) , but the water may taste different .
According to the Food and Drug Administration , bottled water is considered to have an indefinite safety shelf life if it is produced and stored properly .
While the federal agency does not require an expiration date for bottled water , many manufacturers elect to put expiration dates .
" What happens is that people feel more comfortable with bottled water with a code date , " Beattie said .
" There is no safety factor beyond that .
Manufacturers feel that quality of water may deteriorate or become more neutral . "

This post is excerpted from today ’s NORML weekly media advisory .]
A revised budgetary analysis by the California State Board of Equalization ( BOE ) estimates that taxing and regulating the retail sale of cannabis by adults would raise approximately
The BOE ’s estimate , released late yesterday , assesses a $ 50 per ounce tax on the retail sale of cannabis ( among other state - imposed costs ) , as recommended under Assembly Bill 390 : The Marijuana Control , Regulation and Education Act .
This act seeks to license and tax the commercial production , packaging , and retail sale of marijuana to those 21 years of age or older .
As introduced , AB 390 would not impose taxation or licensing requirements on the non-commercial production of cannabis ( up to ten mature plants ) , or on the not - for - profit distribution of pot .
Further , the bill would not alter existing legislation on the use of medicinal cannabis , nor would it impose new taxes or sanctions on the medical cultivation of cannabis .
According to the BOE ’s revised calculations , the enactment of AB 390 would raise an estimatefrom the proposed $ 50 per ounce levy on retail sales of marijuana in addition to anotherin yearly sales tax revenues .
The BOE assessment did not assess whether the enactment of AB 390 would reduce existing law enforcement and prosecutorial costs , which have been estimated by California NORML to average some $ 200 million per year .
In 2007 , a record 74,000 Californians were charged with marijuana offenses – the largest total since the state ‘ decriminalized ’ the personal possession of small amounts of marijuana in 1976 .
The BOE report acknowledged that legalizing pot for adults According to a May 2009 California Field poll of 901 registered voters , of Californians say that lawmakers should “ legalize marijuana for recreational use and tax its proceeds . ”
Presently , the state is facing a $ 26 billion budget deficit .
Assembly Bill 390 is presently before the Assembly Committees on Public Safety and Health , which are expected to take up the issue early next year .

Mr Bowers lost the benefit 11 weeks ago
A Leicestershire 73 - year - old who wowed audiences by breakdancing on Britain 's Got Talent has had his benefit stopped .
Fred Bowers said the allowance he received for a leg injury has been suspended while the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) investigates .
Mr Bowers , from Loughborough , said : " I 'm going to struggle on .
They 're not going to stop me from dancing . "
A DWP spokesman said : " We do investigate and take seriously all accusations of fraudulent claims . "
Mr Bowers , who injured his leg during a wartime accident , said he was unable to walk more than a few hundred yards but this does not affect his ability to dance .
Comedy act
He said he is hopeful the DWP will eventually reinstate his benefits , believed to be about £ 70 a week , and allow him to make a career out of dancing .
He added : " I 've still got an actual disability and I can't walk very far but I can still dance .
I use my head and back more while I 'm dancing .
" I'm a comedian while I am up on stage , it makes people laugh .
I just want to make people happy . "
Mr Bowers , who made the semi-final of the TV talent show , said he was disappointed not to be picked for the ongoing Britain 's Got Talent theatre tour , which features the winners Diversity and Scottish singer Susan Boyle .
Warning : No IT angle Swedish cops are on the look - out for a quintet of tattooed girls who dragged a 50 - year - old man off his bicycle , pulled down his trousers and smalls and " sexually molested " the poor bloke .
The incident happened on 8 July in Örebro , central Sweden , the Aftonbladet newspaper reports .
One of the gang - described as 5 ' 7 " tall and with " tattoos on her forearms " - grabbed his bike 's rack and brought the victim to the ground .
Having had their evil way , the five assailants made good their escape .
The man was " not otherwise beaten or physically assaulted " .
Police spokeswoman Annika Haaster rightly described the attack as " downright unusual " .
In the hope that members of the public might help identify the tattooed ambush vixens , she concluded : " Perhaps there are others who ’ve had the same thing happen to them . " ®
The Crypt Keeper of Classic Horror Comics
Jonesing for classic Fifties horror comic books ?
You know , the ones where people rise from the dead to torment those who killed them or made their lives hell , where bad people get their just desserts and where all manner of gruesome and supernatural atrocity is splashed across the pages in glorious color ?
Karswell , the creator of the fantastic blog The Horrors Of It All ( and the frontman for “ devil rockers ” Sons of Black Mass ) is the man to give you what you crave .
From his massive collection ( and the occasional contributions of other posters ) he has conjured an online repository of vintage comic fear fare where individual stories from long out - of - print issues are posted in high resolution , page by page .
For a fan of EC , Atlas and other Silver Age - era comic companies , it is pure heaven ( and hell ) , particularly because many of these titles can cost $ 100 or far more on the market .
Attention Deficit Delirium caught up with Karswell to chat with him about his site , love for horror and thoughts on comics that were once considered reading material for delinquents — and inspired censorship and the creation of the Comics Code Authority — but now fetch top dollar on the collectors ’ market .
When did your obsession with vintage horror comics start ?
What attracted you to them originally ?
For as long as I can remember I ’ve been obsessed with horror .
From a very young age in the early Seventies I had the monster model kits , toys , spooky books and records .
I collected Famous Monsters of Filmland and constantly scoured the TV Guide for when classics like King Kong and Creature from the Black Lagoon were airing .
I loved ghost stories , and television in the early Seventies was awesome for it — Night Gallery , Kolchak , etcetera .
I worshiped Alice Cooper as much as Vincent Price — still do , in fact .
I was definitely the creepy kid in class , and every day was Halloween for me .
But it was sometime in the late Seventies when I was with my grandmother at an antique store in rural Missouri that I found some coverless comics in an old box .
I was already fairly obsessed with some of the hero comic books , so to find mags that contained full blown illustrated horror stories and no super powers totally blew my mind .
Did you collect these comics as a kid or when you became an adult ?
Have you inherited a lot of the stash you are reprinting online ?
I actually got into hardcore Pre-Code collecting later as an adult — when I could actually afford these comics — but through my entire life I ’ve always sought out the affordable Atlas and Prize Fifties reprints from the Marvel and DC Silver Age era , as well as the black and white Eerie Pub stuff which re-printed and sometimes “ re-made ” a lot of the other oddball 50 ’s publishers like Superior .
Anything I could get my hands on , reading was my thing .
Still is .
And I ’ve never inherited any comics .
That ’s like the dream though for every fanboy , is n’t it ?
Some crazy old Uncle you never knew leaving you a pile of Harvey horrors or Batmans in his attic .
You ’re never too old to keep wishing for that miracle .
What is your favorite illustrated horror story ever and why ?
Jeez , I get asked this at least twice a week from readers who email me .
I really have no clue .
I have favorite illustrators like [ Alex ] Toth or [ Bill ] Everett , and of course everybody that worked at EC were brilliant .
I guess my readers will probably find this shocking since I do not post EC stories , but if I had to pick an “ all - time fave ” story it would probably come from EC , and probably be one by Jack Davis or Johnny Craig .
Is that a good enough answer ?
How about this —
Who is a cooler EC icon for you : The Vault Keeper , The Crypt Keeper or the Old Witch ?
Crypt Keeper .
What do you think of a lot of the late Sixties and Seventies horror titles from DC and Marvel ?
I love Silver Age horror , that ’s the stuff I mostly grew up on .
It was cool when Marvel would mix issues of say Chamber of Darkness with new stuff and older pre-Code reprints .
I finally just completed an entire run of DC ’s Witching Hour .
That stuff is loads of fun .
How do you feel a lot of these stories have influenced the horror film genre in the last 50 years ?
Well , aside from Creepshow and maybe a handful of others — most notably from England ’s Amicus Studios in the Sixties and Seventies — I ’d say not hardly at all .
Which is surprising , because instead of endless cliche and re-makes , there ’s a treasure trove of tremendous ideas sitting in old pre-Code books just waiting to be exploited .
And it does n’t have to be an omnibus film to harken the days of Pre-Code , just make something inspiring with a good ending for once !
Christ , some of those one page quickies in Ace Comics have better character development within just six panels than an entire franchise of Hollywood hits containing multiple sequels .
This topic comes up [ on my site ] a lot in the comments , and I love when our occasional deep threads or themes connect comics with film , or even music and TV .
I used to concoct contests around it too , with “ match a song to this story ” or “ Casting Call , ” where you actually cast the film version of the days post with famous names .
I should start doing that stuff again .
I suddenly have no idea why I stopped .
What copyright issues have you faced in placing these stories online ?
Not a single one .
I have heard stories of the occasional scan poster getting an angry email from someone though , and it ’s the main reason why I steer clear of EC stories since those great issues in particular seem to have never gone out of print .
But if anyone ever has a rights problem with something I post just email me with proof , and I ’ll take it down immediately .
I sometimes wonder how I ’d react if Stan Lee personally asked me to ixnay on the Atlas stuff .
On one hand it would suck to have to remove Atlas horror from THOIA , but on the other hand — whoa , an email from Stan Lee !
Looking back , I should have seen it was a set - up , but they were smart .
The caller introduced himself as Todd Lewis , a Los Angeles producer .
His company , he explained , was making a film for a German broadcaster about the American south , in particular my home town Birmingham , Alabama .
The patter continued .
Todd 's company was called Amesbury Chase Productions , one of a group of four .
He gave me their internet addresses – they looked legit .
Would it be possible , Todd asked , to film some ballroom dancing ?
I 've always enjoyed dancing .
I learned as a teenager – waltz , swing , tango , Latin – and now help run a large dance club in Birmingham .
It 's been good for me .
At age 75 , the exercise is great and , more importantly , it 's how I met Brenda , my girlfriend of 10 years .
It was agreed that Todd and his cameras would shoot a dance at the Vestavia Hills civic centre in a suburb of Birmingham on Monday 9 February .
The people there are mainly in their 70s .
I was there with Brenda , who 's 64 .
Todd 's operation was impressive .
They turned up in a motorhome with four cameramen and a crew chief .
There were also two front men , and one woman , all aged between 30 and 35 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Our visitors were thoughtful .
They 'd taken along 100 or so 12in red hearts to put on the wood panel walls ( it was a Valentine 's event ) .
Entrance to this dance is $ 5 ( £ 3 ) , but the crew paid that for the 110 people attending .
All we had to do , they told us , was sign sheets of paper at a card table set up by the door .
The generosity continued .
They gave the man running the dances $ 300 and the band leader another $ 100 .
What nice people , we thought .
All the while , though , they were drawing us into their game .
After 30 minutes of dancing , a man who was obviously a performer appeared .
He had short blond hair and two tufts near the front .
He wore a sleeveless white shirt , black leather waistcoat and trousers , and 16in pointed gold boots .
Oh , and a black tie .
I 've seen slim ties in my time , but this was a little hokey .
The man said he was Austrian and did n't speak English ; occasionally he pulled out an English - German phrasebook .
I now know this was Sacha Baron Cohen .
Then the crew asked to put on their own music – probably on an MP3 player – to avoid copyright infringement , they said .
It was lousy , a cross between an Argentine tango and swing .
The " Austrian " started dancing with a second actor who'd walked in from their vehicle and was less flamboyantly dressed .
As they danced , they would throw each other to the side and then pull one another back , leaping up into each other 's arms .
To be honest , they were good , although at most ballroom dances in the US we tend to dance with the opposite sex .
One couple walked out , but no one else was shocked .
At the climax of the dance , the other actor dipped Sacha 's head back and kissed him on the lips for about 15 seconds .
Little shocks me .
I lived all over the States for eight years working as a consulting engineer and was based in San Francisco for two years in the 1960s .
Folks from Alabama are n't easily offended and , contrary to what you might think , are inclined to live and let live .
But one thing really gets to them – knowing they 've been duped .
This is when it hit the fan .
The crowd erupted , five or so people screaming at the top of their lungs : " Get out of here .
Leave the building . "
The second actor started lecturing us , barely making himself heard in the chaos .
" Our love is wonderful .
Ours is true love and you should not feel the way you do . "
All of course , rehearsed to try to push us further .
At that point , I walked over to him and said : " You need to leave . "
The man ignored me and continued to lecture me close to my face .
I was n't mad but I was irritated .
I shoved him hard .
Another dancer turned off the lights to stop the filming and someone called the police .
When a patrolman arrived , he told the crew : " I do n't want to see your faces in Vestavia Hills again . "
At some point , the crew realised that things could get out of hand .
Maybe they were n't sure what this crazy bunch of old folks were going to do .
The last I saw of them was the tail of their long trailer leaving in a hurry .
It was n't until the following weekend that I grasped what had happened .
A Birmingham woman television reporter ( a real one this time ) called and asked : " You do n't think it was Sacha Baron Cohen , do you ? "
I 'd seen the Borat movie so I knew something about Sacha , a lanky 6ft 3in Englishman .
This man did n't have a moustache and black hair , and did n't look that tall from 20 feet away .
" Oh , he was that tall , " said Brenda .
" I saw him standing by the drinks machine . "
It had all been a carefully planned operation – aimed at making us look dumb .
And those sheets of paper we signed were release forms , giving our consent to the footage being used in Sacha 's forthcoming film about Brüno , the gay Austrian television reporter .
We were , it turned out , extras working for a pittance .
Calling friends in other ballroom groups the next morning , I found he'd booked to film more dances – in Huntsville , and also Chattanooga and Nashville in Tennessee .
Sacha 's organised , but we 're very organised , too .
We put out the word on the internet and they were all cancelled .
He was on our territory , so we could do what we liked .
Sorry for messing up your schedule , Brüno .
It turns out we were lucky to get off lightly .
The Alabama National Guard did n't fare so well .
A few days after our dance , Sacha , as Brüno , had fooled them into giving him a uniform , only to strip down to a stars and stripes thong for the cameras .
The way he works is certainly like a military operation .
He 's highly intelligent , but as he gets more and more famous , it 's harder to pull off these sorts of stunts .
I do n't imagine anyone in Britain would fall for it .
Perhaps he thought we 're a bit slower down here and a bit more old - fashioned .
I guess he was hoping we'd be outraged by a gay kiss .
I 'm afraid I 've got news for you , Sacha .
Times have changed .
Some of us have televisions and occasionally even go to see movies , including your Borat film – which , if you 're interested , I thought was good for the first 15 minutes but went downhill after that .
My first reaction was anger .
In the South we are taught to trust people , to show hospitality .
In return we were insulted .
Baron Cohen , I concluded , was little more than an empty shell .
Religion has been reported to be important to him , but his personal religion seems to be based on greed and deriving pleasure from shocking others , often being cruel and uncaring – to get what he is after .
The funny thing , though , is that , as time has passed , I 've come to admire his skill .
It was actually a neat , highly entertaining evening .
He had a job to do and he could n't tell us in advance .
So good luck , Sacha , but just one thing .
We do n't need any more Austrian ballroom tutelage in Alabama , thanks very much .
Luckily my kid is n’t old enough to see this post because I and all other dads in the world have just been shamed , humiliated , and embarrassed by some superdad who built his kid a freakin’ AT - AT Imperial Walker bed .
Yes it ’s as cool as it sounds .
Hey superdad , wanna adopt me ?
Apparently superdad could n’t find an AT - AT bed for his kid ( go figure ) so he went down to his local Home Depot , picked up a few items , and built his own .
Meanwhile , I sat on the couch , drank a beer , and watched baseball .
Here ’s a video of the build :
Yeah that whole top opens up and the kid Jedi can climb into it and back out from underneath via the escape hatch .
Insaaane !

Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly stated that Cap and Trade will be a priority for the 111th Congress .
Embraced some years ago in Europe and a few other countries , cap and trade creates an artificial market for various industries to buy , sell , and trade allowances that permit a certain amount of carbon output .
It has long been on the wish list for American liberals and extremist environmentalists .
And with Democrats now in control of Congress and the White House , you can bet they will soon engage an all effort to enact cap and trade .
In fact , in the 2010 White House budget , President Barack Obama calls for a sweeping cap and trade program that would raise $ 646 billion in new revenues .
Here are FreedomWorks ’
Top 10 reasons why they should n’t …
1 . It will raise energy costs :
While different nuanced approaches continue to surface , any analysis of any cap and trade scheme comes to the same conclusion ; energy costs will go up .
The latest serious attempt to enact cap and trade in the United States , America ’s Climate Security Act of 2007 sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) and John Warner ( R - VA ) , serves as a good example .
An analysis of this legislation cited during a Senate hearing held by the Committee on Environment and Public Works estimated the costs to the average American household would be between $ 800 and $ 1,300 by 2015 , and then increasing to $ 1,500 to $ 2,500 by 2050 .
2 . It does n’t help the environment :
If energy costs are going to go up for Americans , should n’t there be significant environmental benefit and progress towards reversing climate change ?
You would think so .
But even if the most aggressive of cap and trade schemes were properly adhered to , scientists that both advocate and oppose a cap and trade program widely agree that the maximum drop to the earth ’s temperature would be no more than 0.07 degrees Celsius by the year 2050 .
To give some sense of just how negligible this decrease would be , we cannot even estimate the absolute mean surface temperature of the earth within 0.07 .
What ’s worse is that cap and trade actually provides incentives to emit more carbon , not less .
An article by the Christian Science Monitor explains : “ By turning carbon emissions into commodities that can be bought and sold , cap - and - trade policies could remove the stigma from producing such emissions . ”
In other words , if industries understand they are working within a legal framework when they output carbon , the public pressure for them to cut down is weakened .
Evidence of this can be seen in Europe where most countries have seen carbon emissions go up , even though the European Union has had a cap and trade regime in place since 2005 .
3 . It does n’t work where it has been tried : Speaking of Europe , let ’s take a closer look at how cap and trade is fairing .
As mentioned earlier , the EU is watching carbon emission levels rise despite the fact that they have had a cap and trade system since 2005 .
Furthermore , the Heartland Institute reports that 12 of the 15 EU nations taking part in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , a program that sets greenhouse gas reduction targets and serves as a precursor to cap and trade , are failing to meet their reduction targets , with three going over by more than 10 percent and another three going over by more than 20 percent .
In fact , emissions for all EU countries went up on average 2.1 percent between 2000 and 2004 .
Compare this with the United States where currently no such regulatory regime exists and yet emissions went up only 1.3 percent during the same time period .
Nonetheless , President Obama has announced an aggressive set of targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , promising to “ work expeditiously with key stakeholders and the Congress to develop an economy - wide emissions reduction program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions approximately 14 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 , and approximately 83 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 . ”
4 . It will cost Americans jobs :
This calculation is a pretty simple one .
For U.S. industry to comply with a cap and trade scheme , they have to reduce their carbon emissions .
There are two ways to do this : ( 1 ) produce less – this obviously hurts jobs as companies would seek to streamline their workforce to compensate for a drop in production , or ( 2 ) buy carbon allowances in order to keep production up – this , too , would threaten jobs as companies would be forced to devote more internal resources to allowances , negatively effecting their bottom lines and potentially putting workers on the chopping block .
In either case , the rising costs of energy under a cap and trade system , as mentioned earlier , only add to the problem .
An analysis conducted by Charles River Associates in 2007 estimated anywhere from 1.2 million to 2.3 million jobs would be lost under a cap and trade scheme .
5 . It is in effect a hidden regressive tax :
We ’ve talked about how cap and trade causes energy prices to go up .
That does n’t just hit American industry , but American consumers as well .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) correctly notes that as these prices go up in the form of higher gasoline , heating oil , and electricity , the poor are hit hardest with what is in effect a hidden regressive tax .
President Obama promises to return revenues to vulnerable communities , families and businesses , but that leaves taxpayers at the whim of government to redistribute income rather than letting taxpayer keep their hard earned dollars .
6 . It sets a dangerous precedent :
While extremist environmentalists and their liberal allies have been whining about climate change for years , most stop short of declaring cap and trade the silver - bullet solution .
Environmental groups like the Sierra Club and the National Resources Defense Council are generally supportive of the concept of cap and trade .
However , as The Heritage Foundation has pointed out , these groups have found fault with actual proposals such as America ’s Climate Security
Act of 2007 , criticizing them for not going far enough and willing only to endorse them as “ a good first step . ”
As much damage as a cap and trade scheme would cause in its own right , this posture by extreme environmental groups foreshadows even more draconian regulations in our future .
7 . It prevents market forces from working for the environment :
The market distortions imposed by a cap and trade system would be significant .
Recently , major energy companies such as ExxonMobil and Shell have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in technologies that capture and store carbon as well as lower carbon alternative energy sources .
A cap and trade system however , sets up perverse incentives that will distract these and other companies from market - based solutions to curb carbon output .
Resources instead will be funneled to the artificial market for carbon allowances that cap and trade sets up .
8 . It threatens to put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage with other countries :
Though the E.U. and the United States may be buying into cap and trade , industrial giants like China and India are not .
Remember the lost jobs we talked about in point # 4 ?
In addition to China and India , nearby Mexico ( another country where cap and trade is not even a remote possibility ) are more than willing to pick up the U.S. slack and bolster their already robust manufacturing sectors .
9 . It opens the door to massive fraud and corruption :
As energy companies look to game the system , cap and trade would open the door wide for fraud and corruption that could devastate U.S. investors and the economy as a whole .
This has been seen already in the UK , a country currently participating in cap and trade .
In a recent article by the British - based Guardian newspaper they report : “ Britain ’s biggest polluting companies are abusing a European emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) designed to tackle global warming by cashing in their carbon credits in order to bolster ailing balance sheets . ”
In the United States we have seen what happens when companies engage in creative accounting measures to hide losses and the staggering domino effect it can have on Wall Street investors and the larger economy .
If you need more proof of this threat , look no further than this report by The Competitive Enterprise Institute that discusses Enron ’s support for a cap and trade scheme that would allow them to dominate this new , made - up market for carbon .
10 .
It threatens to bust the federal budget at a time when the United States can scarcely afford it : Federal spending continues at a breakneck pace .
The recent passage of the trillion - dollar stimulus bill along with even more taxpayer funded bailouts looming on the horizon add to U.S. budget woes and sink us deeper into recession .
And as if times were n’t tough enough , the CBO reports that cap and trade would heap additional undue pressure on our fragile budget .
According to their report , government would face the same challenges with higher energy costs that consumers do .
Additionally , the fall in production for U.S. industry would lead to a loss of federal government tax revenues .
Further increasing spending while decreasing revenues makes cap and trade a tough sell in the current economic climate .
As the recession grinds on and people run out of unemployment benefits , the last safety net is the government 's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) program .
Though benefits vary by state , TANF provides a maximum of 60 months of coverage throughout a recipient 's lifetime .
To get an idea of which states pay out the most welfare checks , the ( NCSL ) surveyed state governments .
Using the most current information , NCSL then compared the total number of recipients of TANF to the overall state

Perfect spatial hashing
ACM Trans .
Graphics ( SIGGRAPH ) , 25 ( 3 ) , 2006 .
Sparse spatial data packed into a dense table using a simple collision - free map .
Abstract :
We explore using hashing to pack sparse data into a compact table while retaining efficient random access .
Specifically , we design a perfect multidimensional hash function — one that is precomputed on static data to have no hash collisions .
Because our hash function makes a single reference to a small offset table , queries always involve exactly two memory accesses and are thus ideally suited for parallel SIMD evaluation on graphics hardware .
Whereas prior hashing work strives for pseudorandom mappings , we instead design the hash function to preserve spatial coherence and thereby improve runtime locality of reference .
We demonstrate numerous graphics applications including vector images , texture sprites , alpha channel compression , 3D - parameterized textures , 3D painting , simulation , and collision detection .

Using old lists of potentially contaminated structures , federal and Navajo scientists have fanned out to rural reaches of the 27,000 square mile reservation  which includes swaths of Arizona , New Mexico and Utah  to measure levels of radium , a decay product of uranium that can cause lung cancer .
Of 113 structures assessed so far , 27 contained radiation levels that were above normal .
Image  There were a lot of things people werent told about the plight of Navajos and uranium mining ,  Stephen B. Etsitty said .
Credit ... Kevin Moloney for The New York Times
“ In these situations , you have contamination in somebody ’s yard or in their house , ” said Harry Allen , the E.P.A. ’s section chief for emergency response in San Francisco who is helping lead the government ’s efforts .
“ To us , that is somewhat urgent . ”
Many structures that showed high levels of radiation were vacant ; some families had already moved out after hearing stories of contamination in their homes .
But eight homes still had people living in them , and the E.P.A. and Navajo officials have worked to convince residents that it would be unsafe to stay .
“ People had been told they were living in contaminated structures , but nobody ever did anything about it , ” said Will Duncan , an environmental scientist who has been the E.P.A. ’s main representative on the reservation .
“ They would tell us , ‘ We do n’t believe you are going to follow through . ’ ”
But with a budget of nearly $ 8 million , the E.P.A. has demolished all 27 contaminated structures and has begun building ones to replace those that had been occupied .
Typically , the agency pays a Navajo contracting company to construct a log cabin or a traditional hogan in the structure ’s stead , depending on the wishes of the occupants .
Mr. Allen said the cost , including temporarily relocating residents , ran approximately $ 260,000 per dwelling and took about eight months .
The agency also offers $ 50,000 to those who choose not to have an old home rebuilt .
Lillie Lane , a public information officer with the Navajo Nation E.P.A. who has acted as a liaison between the federal government and tribal members , said the program held practical and symbolic importance given the history of uranium mining here .
Ms. Lane described the difficulty of watching families , particularly elders , leaving homes they had lived in for years .
She told of coming upon two old miners who died before their contaminated homes could be rebuilt .
“ In Navajo , a home is considered sacred , ” she said .
“ But if the foundation or the rocks are not safe , we have to do this work . ”
So Texas Governor Rick Perry decided not to nominate the far - right ultra-religious Planter 's sampler Cynthia Dunbar for head of the state Board of Education , but , as predicted , he has instead nominated another creationist : Gail Lowe .
She is yet another in a long series of ill - qualified religious ideologues on the Texas BoE : she wants to insert " strengths and weaknesses " into the curriculum ( the weaknesses to which they refer do n't really exist ; they really mean false creationist attacks on evolution ) , she wants to make classes more political , she wants to remove other solid scientific reasoning from science classes .
I find it interesting indeed that you find none of this when you go to her website .
Instead you find vague claims about her stances which give almost no real information .
Of course , her record is pretty clear .
So the head of the BoE is once again someone with antiscience beliefs .
I wonder if they 'll appoint Jenny McCarthy as head of their Department of Health ?
And so , as usual ...
Think about it ; Dick Cheney is going right after Barack Obama and saying that the President is endangering the safety of American lives .
What does he have to gain by saying something so outrageous ?
Why not stay in hiding and try pissing off as few people as possible , let alone the President of the United States of America ?
Because Dick Cheney wants to be able to make any attempts to investigate him look like political payback .
It 's a simple and stupid strategy .
Dick has forgotten that people hate him for a reason .
Congressional Republicans wo n't denounce Rush Limbaugh , but they 'll happily distance themselves from Dick Cheney ;
Congressional Republicans are telling Dick Cheney to go back to his undisclosed location and leave them alone to rebuild the Republican Party without his input .
/ snip Rep. John Duncan Jr. ( R - Tenn . ) said , " He became so unpopular while he was in the White House that it would probably be better for us politically if he would n’t be so public ...
Mark Kirk ( R - IL ) encourages
Dick to write a memoir , saying that criticism like that is n't in the tradition of the Founding Fathers .
Zach Wamp ( R - TN ) , who wants to be Governor of Tennessee , sums up the general spirit of the Congressional - Republican critics of Dick Cheney ;
" With all due respect to former Vice President Cheney , he represents what ’s behind us , not what ’s ahead of us . "
Dick Cheney is absolutely toxic in polling .
He makes Rush Limbaugh look like Michelle Obama .
He makes George W. Bush look like Malia Obama .
Impressions of the former Vice - President are so solidly against him that he is the most ineffective messenger possible for any conservative talking point .
He may be smart enough , but too proud to admit that .
But the question still remains , why come out and go so hard after the President with the sort of criticism that he used ?
He 's not going to make a run for office .
Why should he care ?
It all comes back to the things he did , and the things we still do n't know about .
Dick Cheney is looking for a good position to defend against any potential trial or commission .
It 's as simple as that .
And on a completely unrelated note , Mike Huckabee really sucks .
On a possibly - related note , however , Condi Rice will be on Leno Tuesday night .
I would keep an eye on that .
These days you can buy jewelery in all shapes and colors , but what about wearing Barbie ’s body parts as earrings , necklace , etc . ?

Lord Mandelson 's plans to cut off the broadband connections of internet users who illegally download copyrighted music and films were attacked by privacy campaigners , internet service providers and Labour MPs yesterday as unworkable , unnecessary and potentially illegal .
The surprise decision to reintroduce the disconnection idea , which was ruled out in the government 's own Digital Britain report in June , also sparked accusations that the business secretary has been swayed by secret meetings with senior figures from the music and film industry .
Tom Watson , the former cabinet minister who until recently was in charge of the government 's internet policy , said the plan " will lead to accusations that the government has been captured by the big lobby operations of powerful rightsholders . "
TalkTalk , Britain 's largest consumer broadband provider , warned that innocent web users could be disconnected after having their connections hijacked by pirates looking to circumvent the new rules .
It added that the move " will likely breach fundamental human rights " .
A spokesman said : " Barely two months after the publication of largely sensible and pragmatic measures to tackle the problem Lord Mandelson has , it seems , caved in under pressure from powerful lobbyists in the content industry . "
Earlier this month it emerged that the business secretary dined with Hollywood mogul David Geffen at a Corfu holiday villa owned by the Rothschild banking dynasty .
Mandelson 's advisers deny that this meeting included talk about how to stem the industry 's losses caused by illegal filesharing .
But Whitehall insiders believe the U - turn is more likely to have been caused by a prior meeting with one of the most powerful figures in the British music business , Lucian Grainge , the chairman of Universal Music , home to Lady Gaga and Rihanna .
Grainge is a fierce opponent of illegal file - sharing and is one of the government 's chief industry advisers and part of the so - called C&binet – a group of executives who advise ministerial departments on fostering the creative industries in the UK .
He was consulted during the compilation of Lord Carter 's Digital Britain report as part of an ad hoc " gang of five ' ' that included BSky B's Jeremy Darroch , Channel 4's Andy Duncan and the Premier League 's Richard Scudamore .
Before the report was published he told an audience at the British Library , which included representatives of Mandelson 's department : " The creators and the investors [ in music ] cannot exist with illegal filesharing , period .
It will decimate the industry . "
But the report stopped short of disconnecting the pirates , instead recommending that illegal filesharers should receive letters warning them their activities could leave them open to prosecution .
Believing that the government should have gone further , Grainge is understood to have had further meetings with Mandelson to push for tougher measures .
A spokesperson for the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills said the business secretary had met many representatives of the creative industries and the government 's change of stance was not the result of any single conversation .
But the music and film industry has been lobbying hard for tougher measures and Stephen Timms , who replaced Lord Carter 's replacement as communications minister said : " It 's become clear there are widespread concerns that the plans as they stand could delay action , impacting unfairly on rights holders . "
As a result , Timms proposed that persistent illegal sharers of copyrighted material should have their broadband connections temporarily disconnected and the power to introduce this measure , if warning letters failed to have an impact on levels of piracy , should rest with the government , not Ofcom .
The government hopes to have its plans for dealing with online piracy included in the autumn 's digital economy bill .
But privacy campaigners say the government 's new proposals could fall foul of the law — as they did in France earlier this year .
Simon Davies , director of Privacy International , warned : " This proposal fundamentally reverses the onus of proof .
It establishes systemic accusation .
It is fraught with technical impossibility , it invites circumvention and creates a major online conflict between rights holders and users .
And these are fundamental rights that are being violated . " " Cutting people off the internet for allegedly infringing copyright is disproportionate , " added Larry Whitty , chairman of Consumer Focus .
" And to do so without giving consumers the right to challenge the evidence against them undermines fundamental rights to a fair trial . "
John Petter , head of BT 's consumer business , meanwhile , expressed his disappointment at the government 's change of direction .
" We were broadly supportive of the original plans but these changes run the risk of penalising customers unfairly . "
A spokesperson for Virgin Media , meanwhile , added " persuasion not coercion is the key to changing consumer behaviour as a heavy - handed , punitive regime will simply alienate mainstream consumers .
The government should be ensuring a balance of action against repeat infringers and the rapid development of new legitimate services that provide a compelling alternative to illegal filesharing . "
Weaker construction activity has hit the economy
The UK economy contracted 2.4 % in the first quarter of 2009 , a decline not exceeded in 51 years , according to the latest official data .
The decline was more severe than the earlier estimate of a 1.9 % fall , and worse than analyst expectations .
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) blamed the sharp revision primarily on weaker output in the construction and manufacturing sectors .
It also said the recession started earlier than first thought last year .
The scale of revision comes as a real shock , and highlights the extreme weakness of the economy in the early months of the year
Andrew Goodwin , Ernst & Young Item Club
See the changes in UK GDP
The ONS now says the recession began during the second quarter of 2008 rather than during July to September , so that the recession has now been running for a whole year .
The ONS said economic output shrank 4.9 % during the first quarter of 2009 compared with the first quarter of 2008 , the biggest year - on - year fall on record .
The figures will make it more difficult for the Treasury to reach its forecast of a 3.5 % decline in the UK economy for the year , made in the April Budget .
But the Chief Secretary to the Treasury , Liam Byrne , said it would not be revising its forecast .
" There have been some tentative signs that the fall in output is moderating and I remain confident but cautious about the prospects for the economy , " he added .
Lower incomes January to March 's quarterly 2.4 % decline has not been exceeded since the second quarter of 1958 , when the economy shrank by 2.6 % .
Analysts had only expected a 2.1 % fall this time .
However , the decline was equalled by figures from the first quarter of 1974 and the third quarter of 1979 , which also saw contractions of 2.4 % .
1958 FACTS Singer Elvis Presley starts military service with US Army Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament founded in London First Cod War between UK and Iceland lasts three months UK 's first stretch of motorway opens near Preston Construction output decreased between January and March by 6.9 % , while the service sector contracted by 1.6 % - led by the banking and financial industries , which saw output slip 2.5 % .
Quarterly manufacturing output fell by 5.5 % .
Meanwhile , real household disposable income fell by 2.4 % , while the savings rate dropped from 4 % to 3 % .
Andrew Goodwin , senior economic adviser to the Ernst & Young Item Club , said the figures were much worse than expected .
" We had expected a downward revision to GDP , given the plunge in construction output since the last quarter , but the scale of revision comes as a real shock , and highlights the extreme weakness of the economy in the early months of the year , " he said .
Fellow analyst , Ross Walker , economist at RBS Financial Markets , said the latest figures were " disappointing " .
" We knew about the construction revisions in advance and the fall was n't quite as big as the ONS had indicated , " said Mr Walker .
" But we 've got a much bigger fall in services output . "
Getting better ?
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said the GDP figures showed that the recession had " been longer and deeper than we had thought " .
" This also means that in the future , unemployment will be higher and Labour 's debt crisis will be even worse , " he said .
If you thought that any recovery was resting on shaky foundations , you will see plenty of support for that view in today 's news
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Read Stephanie 's blog Meanwhile , Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the figures put more pressure on the public finances .
" Rather than making promises on public spending that nobody believes , the Government must start taking tough choices on whether it is going to cut spending or raise taxes to bring the economy out of the red , " he said .
Despite the economy 's big downward revision for the first quarter of 2009 , the expectation is that the official figures for April to June will be nowhere near as bad when the first estimates are published at the end of July .
Earlier this month , the ONS said industrial production rose in April , its first month - on - month climb since February of last year .
A growing number of reports from business organisations such as the CBI have also predicted that the worst of the recession is over .
The CBI said earlier this month that the economy was now stabilising , and would begin a " slow and gradual " recovery from early next year .
Separately , a key service sector survey reported a growth in business in May for the first time since April 2008 .
The PMI service index from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply rose to 51.7 in May , up from 48.7 in April , with a measure above 50 indicating growth .
Martin Weale , director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research , whose organisation estimates GDP on a monthly basis , recently told the BBC that he expected second quarter GDP to be flat .

Advertisement Two Iranian employees of the British and French embassies and a French teacher have gone on trial in Tehran alongside Iranian opposition figures .
Hundreds were arrested during protests that erupted in the wake of the disputed 12 June presidential election .
Those on trial are accused of acting against Iran 's national security by taking part in the protests and spying .
France called for the French teacher and embassy employee to be freed .
The EU expressed its concern at the trial .
Last week more than 100 people appeared in court in Tehran on charges including conspiracy .
Several leading reformers were among the detainees .
Opposition leaders say such proceedings are " show trials " .
There were reports on Saturday that riot police dispersed a large crowd , including relatives of defendants , outside the court .
' Spying for foreigners '
This is the second group trial of those accused of taking part in the post-election unrest .
Reformist lawmakers and journalists were among the group , all wearing grey prison clothes .
Hossein Rassam , the most senior Iranian employee at the British embassy , is accused of " spying for foreigners " , Iranian state media quoted the judge as saying .
Mr Rassam was held after the protests with eight other embassy colleagues and later released on bail .
In pictures : Iranian mass trial Prosecutors accuse him of monitoring the riots on the ground along with two UK diplomats who have since been expelled .
The prosecutors say he was asked to meet representatives of political groups , ethnic and religious minorities and student groups , and inform London about the riots , state media reported .
State media said Mr Rassam had apologised for " the clear violations he had committed " .
In London , a spokeswoman for the Foreign Office called the trial " completely unacceptable " .
" We deplore these trials and the so - called confessions of prisoners who have been denied their basic human rights , " she said .
An Iranian employee of the French embassy , Nazak Ashfar , was also in the dock , state media said , as was French teacher Clotilde Reiss .
The 24 - year - old was stopped on 1 July as she prepared to leave Tehran , having spent five months as a university teaching assistant .
She is accused of " collecting information and provoking rioters " , and has been charged with acting against national security , Irna news agency said .
Hundreds were detained after violent protests that followed June 's election
The agency said she had told the court that she had written a one - page report about the situation in Isfahan and given it to the French embassy 's cultural section .
Ms Reiss told the court she regretted taking part in the protests .
" My motive to take part in the gatherings was a personal one .
But I accept that it was a mistake and I should not have gone to these gatherings , " she told the court , according to AFP .
The French foreign ministry said on Saturday that the allegations against her were " devoid of any foundation " , and that those against Nazak Ashfar were " non-existent " .
The Swedish presidency of the EU expressed concern at the trial , saying it considered it an act against the whole European Union .
' Nothing illegal '
Rights groups say that hundreds of people including reformist politicians , journalists , activists and lawyers have been detained in Iran since the election .
The poll saw President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad returned to power , but opposition leaders insist the election was rigged .
In last week 's trials , some of those in the dock made public confessions , saying they had made up their complaints against the elections to provoke unrest .
However , Iran 's Prosecutor General , Ghorban Ali Dori Najafabadi , has said that confessions will not be the sole basis for the prosecution of suspects .
" The judicial system will base its ruling on the suspects ' files and the evidence presented at courts , " he was quoted as saying on Thursday .
He denied that the confessions were extracted using illegal measures .

Representing Texans Whose Children Were Injured at Birth
Birth injuries can occur due to poor prenatal care or mistakes by the delivering physician or other medical personnel .
Regardless of the cause of birth injuries , in most cases , they are irreversible .
Founded in 1951 , Abraham , Watkins , Nichols , Sorrels , Agosto , Aziz & Stogner has several experienced birth injury attorneys who help families obtain compensation after their children were injured before , during or immediately following delivery .
If your child suffered a birth injury due to the negligence of a doctor or medical provider , he or she deserves compensation .
These financial resources can provide for the long - term care and rehabilitation your child needs .
To learn how our birth injury lawyers can help you , contact our office online or call 713-396-3964 ( toll free 800-594-4884 ) to schedule a free consultation .
Common Birth Injuries
The most common forms of debilitating birth injury include :
Shoulder dystocia
Brachial plexus palsy
Cerebral palsy
Erb 's palsy
Klumpke 's palsy
These are generally caused by doctor error during the birthing process and result in nerve damage and reduced motor function .
Other known birth - related and pregnancy - related injuries include :
Prenatal asphyxia , which can result in brain damage and reduced motor function
Childbirth defects related to SSRI antidepressant use during pregnancy
Excessive newborn jaundice
Hydrocephalus
Autism
Brain damage
Our birth injury attorneys know that in many ways , your child 's future rests in our hands .
In every birth injury case , our goal is to obtain maximum compensation for the child .
By obtaining these financial resources , we can help them live lives that are as comfortable , productive and meaningful as possible .
Erb's Palsy and Shoulder Dystocia Birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia can often result in serious complications for infants , including the development of Erb 's palsy .
This condition occurs when excessive pressure is put on the baby 's head or neck during delivery , often when the baby 's shoulder is lodged behind the mother 's pelvic bone .
It is the responsibility of the delivery room doctor and team to recognize this situation and to safely release the impacted shoulder .
If your child suffers from Erb 's palsy and you believe that medical malpractice likely contributed to the condition , it is important to speak with an experienced attorney about your rights .
Doctors in delivery rooms should go through a series of maneuvers to safely release an impacted shoulder before it leads to a more serious condition .
Unfortunately , medical professionals sometimes fail to follow this standard and can actually exert more pressure on the baby 's head , which can damage the brachial plexus and cause Erb 's palsy .
The nerves can be stretched to varying degrees and , in the worst cases , can tear away from the spinal cord .
Erb 's palsy results in paralysis of the shoulder or upper arm , while the related condition of Klumpke 's palsy is paralysis of the hand or wrist .
Erb's Palsy and Shoulder Dystocia Birth - Related Brain Injuries
The common thread uniting child birth injuries and brain injuries , whether caused by poor prenatal care or mistakes by medical professionals , is that they are irreversible in most cases .
If your child is suffering from a birth injury , a brain injury or both , it is important to be fully aware of what your child needs to live as normal a life as possible .
All birth injuries and child brain injuries are difficult to deal with , for children and their parents .
The most common child brain and birth injuries include : Brachial plexus palsy Erb's palsy Klumpke 's palsy A variety of other birth and brain injuries can be caused by a lack of oxygen or other mistakes by medical professionals during delivery .
With injuries to children , it is important to consider the full cost of treatment in the short and long term .
We can work with you and necessary medical experts to put together a life care plan and determine how much compensation your family and child will need .
Has your child suffered a birth or brain injury ?
He or she may need expensive medical procedures throughout childhood and long - term care throughout adulthood .
To learn more about filing a claim to secure the monetary compensation you need , talk to one of our lawyers in a free consultation .
Birth - Related Brain Injuries Childbirth Defects From Antidepressant ( SSRI ) Drugs Recent studies have found that certain birth defects , including heart defects , lung defects and other congenital birth defects , may be linked to the mother 's use of antidepressant drugs during pregnancy .
These antidepressant drugs are called select serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or SSRI .
Our practice is dedicated to protecting the rights of injured individuals and their families .
When your child has an SSRI drug birth defect , we understand the importance of getting the compensation needed to cover medical bills , out - of - pocket costs , noninsured expenses and other unforeseen circumstances , as well as to make sure your child can live as comfortably and productively as possible .
Because of the strong link between SSRI drugs and birth defects , many medical experts believe that it is negligent for doctors to prescribe certain antidepressant medications to pregnant women .
These antidepressants include : Zoloft Prozac Paxil Lexapro Celexa Fluoxetine Effexor Luvox Wellbutrin Serzone Remeron
One study revealed that if a mother took an SSRI antidepressant during the first trimester of her pregnancy , the newborn had a 60 percent higher probability of developing congenital heart defects .
In addition to these serious cardiac birth defects , SSRI drugs have been found to cause numerous other serious medical conditions in newborns and infants , including : Persistent pulmonary hypertension of a newborn ( PPHN ) Lung defects such as pulmonary stenosis Abdominal wall malformations such as omphalocele and gastroschisis Clubfoot and other limb malformations Cleft palate Heart murmurs Seizures Apnea Hyponatremia , or low sodium levels and electrolyte imbalances
Water on the brain
Other injuries to the brain , spinal cord and limbs
We employ a team of medical professionals , including experienced lawyers , doctors , doctor / lawyers , nurses , nurse / lawyers , paralegals and investigators to work on these cases .
Our SSRI birth defect attorneys have the pharmaceutical litigation experience necessary to hold doctors and large drug manufacturers responsible for creating and prescribing defective and dangerous drugs .
If your child was born with a congenital heart or lung defect or signs of any SSRI - related birth defects , you may be entitled to compensation from the drug manufacturer or the doctor if he or she prescribed the medication without disclosing the risks .
Childbirth Defects From Antidepressant ( SSRI ) Drugs Pregnancy Complications
When delivery room doctors , nurses and other medical professionals associated with the birth of a child make errors due to negligence , it can have devastating results for families and their children .
Complications that cannot be avoided often happen during pregnancy .
Doctors , however , should take the proper steps to recognize and treat these complications when possible .
The failure to provide standard medical care can be considered medical malpractice .
If your child has suffered any of these types of injuries from pregnancy complications , it is important to talk with an attorney as soon as possible : Cerebral palsy Erb 's palsy Shoulder dystocia Brachial plexus injuries Facial paralysis
Any type of brain damage or traumatic brain injury Forceps injuries Hematoma Cleft palate Some of these birth defects have been linked to a mother 's use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressants during pregnancy .
Regardless of how it happened , we know that the consequences of a birth injury can be devastating .
Families are often forced to deal with a lifetime of medical treatment .
Through medical malpractice litigation , our firm is committed to holding health care professionals to high standards of treatment and care .

Ok , you ’re scaring me now :

From the Ishikawa Komuro Laboratory , University of Tokyo .
I heard this podcast from Paul Saffo last night in which he said we ’ve been through these various “ ages ” which are caused by technological innovations – so in the
– 80s we had computers , courtesy of cheap microprocessors
– cheap lasers allowed us to create the communications boom
– and now we ’ve got a revolution in cheap sensors going on , and that ’s going to cause a robotics revolution .
The computers of the 80s that learned to talk to each other in the 90s are in the process of learning to negotiate physical environments .
They ’re breaking free .
It ’s like Lawnmower Man all over again , but with real lawnmowers .
Which brings me back to the iPhone – being used as a sensor - bank , rather than a cellphone .
It ’s cephalic .
It ’s a detachable , pocket - head .

There are about a million versions of that song on Youtube :
Thy drugs are quick .
One of the biggest pieces of sci - fi news hitting yesterday did not come from Comic - Con International .
Tom Baker , The Fourth ( and , to many fans , the best ) Doctor , will return to the role after almost 30 years in a series of Doctor Who audio productions .
The U.K.'s Doctor Who Magazine reports that Baker has decided to step in from the Who-less wilderness in five stories recorded specially for BBC Audio .
While David Tennant is the most popular Doctor for the show 's new generation of fans , Baker was the man when the show was in its original prime in the mid and late - 1970s .
He 's also the actor featured in the first imported episodes seen by most American fans on PBS in the 1980s .
He became so closely associated in the role and so entrenched in being The Doctor , moving on from the part proved tough for Baker .
But , in recent years , while participating in BBC DVD commentaries of his old episodes , Baker revealed that he looks back on those years as the best of his life .
At the age of 75 , the time was right for Baker to revisit the part that made him an icon .

Advertisement Four - year - old Samar Abed Rabbu lost her two sisters during Israel 's offensive in Gaza last December and January .
The BBC's Christian Fraser has been following the plight of Samar and her family - now divided across two continents , as Samar receives treatment in Belgium with her mother .
Throughout these months of gruelling therapy Belgian doctors say Samar Abed Rabbu has demonstrated remarkable courage .
Samar has lost the use of her legs but has shown remarkable spirit
She is desperate to walk again - she even simulates it on the bed with her fingers - but there is nothing the Belgian doctors can do to repair Samar 's broken back .
" She has had two operations so far , " said physiotherapist Pierre Van Lierde .
" One in Gaza and one here in Brussels .
But the bullets are lodged too deeply .
It 's too dangerous to remove them and at least one of them is embedded in her spinal cord . "
I first met Samar in January in a hospital in Egypt .
She had been evacuated from Gaza for emergency surgery , just one of scores of children who were injured as the Israelis searched out their Hamas targets .
Shocking
But there was something particularly shocking about this story .
The family alleged that Israeli soldiers had opened fire at close range - as they lined up outside the house and while Samar 's grandmother waved a white flag .
When the war ended we travelled to Jabaliya , northern Gaza , to find Samar 's father .
He told us that Samar 's two sisters - Soad , 7 , and Amel , 2 - had been killed in the assault .
We brought him news that his only surviving daughter was now paralysed .
Today , after months of treatment - paid for by the Belgian government - Samar is at least upright and learning to balance .
She must wear a plastic brace to correct the position of her spine .
Every day she undergoes intensive physiotherapy to move her legs and to build the strength in her upper body .
On the day we visited her custom - built wheelchair had just been delivered .
Home in ruins
But these are all things that will all need to be replaced as she grows - and the question is how this family will cope when Samar is eventually sent back to Gaza .
I am desperate to see her again .
But I do n't want her to come back here - not to this
Khaled , Samar 's father
Jabaliya , Gaza
The neighbourhood of Jabaliya looks exactly as it did when I was last there just over six months ago .
With the Israeli blockade still in place there is no concrete or steel to rebuild it .
At the moment there is precious little to come back to .
In Gaza there is still no sign of the aid that was promised by the outside world .
In Jabaliya people are so desperate to salvage some respectability that they spend their days scavenging for broken bricks and metal , which they drag away on donkey - drawn carts .
In place of his home , Samar 's father Khaled has been given a prefabricated hut - which feels like a sauna in Gaza 's summer heat .
It is without any running water or electricity .
" I miss my daughter terribly , " he said .
" I am desperate to see her again .
But I do n't want her to come back here - not to this .
What can I offer her ?
She is much better where she is . "
Khaled spends what little money he has on phone calls to Brussels .
Samar 's family now live in a hut next to the ruins of their former home Samar sings to him down the line .
So imagine the emotion as he had the chance to see her face in the pictures we had brought from Brussels .
The entire family gathered around as we showed Khaled the film - including Samar 's young brother .
" It 's been tough for all of us , " said Khaled .
" The family has been split for almost seven months - and we are still coping with the trauma and the grief .
This little boy needs his mum . "
Israeli denial
The Israeli Defence Force has told the BBC that their inquiry into the family 's allegations had found no evidence of such an incident .
They stressed they have never targeted innocent civilians .
The Israeli blockade has meant little rebuilding in Gaza
But the morals and behaviour of the army have been called into question by a number of serving soldiers who took part in the Gaza offensive - although the military has dismissed their testimonies as based on hearsay .
Back in Belgium , Samar 's mother Kawtar says she wants to stay in Europe , even though the family has been split .
" I want Samar to get better , " she says .
" I am just hoping that she wo n't stay like this .
" The doctors say she is very smart and she performs well .
I do n't want to take her to Gaza because I do n't want her to lose her mind like she lost her legs . "
In the orderly surroundings of a Belgian hospital Samar has all the attention she needs .
But it is tough enough dealing with a disability like this , never mind coping with it , amid the chaos and destruction of Gaza .

Women in same - sex relationships can now register both their names on the birth certificate of a child conceived as a result of fertility treatment .
Female couples not in a civil partnership but receiving fertility treatment may also both be registered .
The law change applies to female couples in England and Wales who were having fertility treatment on or after 6 April 2009 .
However critics say the change would be detrimental to family values .
Previously , the mother 's female partner could not be registered as a parent .
But the change in the law confers legal parenthood on the mother 's female partner .
According to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority , there were 728 lesbians who underwent in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) between 1999 and 2006 .
And in the same period , there were 5,211 lesbian females who received donor insemination ( DI ) treatment .
Now lesbian couples in the UK who make a considered decision to start a loving family will finally be afforded equal access to services they help fund as taxpayers
Ruth Hunt , Stonewall
' Brilliant ' news for lesbian couples
The changes to the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987 were approved by Registrar General James Hall earlier this year , following Royal Assent for new parenthood provisions contained in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 .
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said that there will be provision for a birth certificate to be used that will have two " parent " sections , rather than mother and father .
Also , sperm donors will continue to be able to opt in or out of having their name on the birth certificate , but if both mothers wish to have their name on the document , the donor cannot be registered in that way .
' Fair treatment ' Home Office Minister Lord Brett said : " This positive change means that , for the first time , female couples who have a child using fertility treatment have the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts to be shown as parents in the birth registration .
" It is vital that we afford equality wherever we can in society , especially as family circumstances continue to change .
This is an important step forward in that process . "
Conservative MP
Nadine Dorries told the BBC that the move undermined the traditional family model .
She said : " If we want to build a stable society , a mother and father and children works as the best model .
" We should be striving towards repairing and reinforcing marriage .
I think this move sends out the exact opposite message . "
' Legal fiction ' Dr Peter Saunders , of the Christian Medical Fellowship , criticised the move , telling the Daily Mail that the change would " create a legal fiction around the parentage of the children " which would then result in a " legal minefield " when it came to issues of maintenance and inheritance .
He was supported by Labour MP Geraldine Smith , who said : ' To have a birth certificate with two mothers and no father is just madness . "
Stonewall 's Head of Policy and Research Ruth Hunt said that as a result of the law change , life for lesbian families " is n't only fairer , it 's also much easier " .
She added : " As the law improves to provide further equality , knowing your new rights will help people make full use of the services they 're entitled to .
And , if discrimination occurs , the same knowledge can help them demand fair treatment .
" Now lesbian couples in the UK who make a considered decision to start a loving family will finally be afforded equal access to services they help fund as taxpayers . "

Do you consider yourself to be " working " when you check your e-mail after dinner and find yourself still addressing work issues two hours later ?
What about when you let yourself answer that emergency call from a coworker or a client on an off day ?
The line between work and play is growing increasingly muddy thanks to technology , and new lawsuits are popping up to push back on employers to shell out for the free labor .
The Wall Street Journal today noted a lawsuit that was filed last month in the Eastern District of New York against T - Mobile , alleging that the wireless carrier required employees to be on call and respond to customer issues outside of work hours , but without paying overtime .
The employees in question — former and current retail associates and supervisors — were required to carry company - issued smartphones and " were required to review and respond to numerous T - Mobile - related e-mails and text messages at all hours of the day and night , whether or not they were logged into T - Mobile 's computer - based timekeeping system , " according to the law firm representing the plaintiffs .
Additionally , these employees were expected to participate in T - Mobile conference calls after work and during lunch , times when they were officially off the clock .
When pressed , managers allegedly told the employees that they should expect to put in the extra hours as part of " standard business practices . "
According to the complaint , these employees were all " non-exempt , " meaning that not paying them overtime for their outside - of - work labors could fall afoul of numerous wage and labor laws .
A similar lawsuit was filed in the Eastern District of Wisconsin on behalf of a real estate maintenance worker who was n't paid overtime for the time he spent responding to issues via his cell phone after hours .
In both cases , the companies insist that they are compliant with all wage and hour laws — bringing into question whether taking calls and e-mails outside of work technically counts as " work . "
A study conducted in 2007 showed that Americans were split on whether devices like the BlackBerry chain you to work .
Regardless of how they felt , however , those who owned a BlackBerry were in fact working longer hours than those who did n't , lending support to the notion that being hyperconnected in today 's working world translates to more hours .
The pay situation is significantly less clear - cut for exempt employees ( those who are on a fixed salary rather than an hourly wage ) .
Taking the occasional call or e-mail is no big deal for most , but some exempt employees feel that they should n't have to work another 40 hours outside the office without some extra incentive .
Ars Project Manager Clint Ecker used to work for T - Mobile as an RF Engineer — an exempt position — and was required to be on call practically 24 hours a day , every day , including weekends .
However , he's of the view that unless someone is misled into believing that this sort of thing would n't happen when being hired , it just comes with the territory .
There is also a group of people simply addicted to work .
Those of us who work in the news industry ( that includes most of the staff here at Ars , as well as many other publications ) are constantly feeling a little jittery about things that might be happening at any and all moments we are not in front of the computer , leading us to become compulsive e-mail and RSS checkers even during otherwise taboo times — during dinner , in bed , at a play .
Smartphones and constant Internet access mean that work and play are no longer separate — it 's work and work , with some play mixed in ( and occasionally sleep — but if you 're me , you 're still checking your e-mail in the dark via iPhone at 3:00 am every day ) .
Some argue that the Fair Labor Standards
Act requires employees to be paid for the extra time they put in , even if it 's completely voluntary .
However , employment attorney Dan McCoy told the WSJ that employers simply need to define more clear - cut policies on out - of - office communications .
" There is a practical approach to this , " he said .

How do I mix ZENERGY ?
ZENERGY Water Concentrate is mixed with Distilled Water .
Mixing Instructions are sent with each order .
Why do I have to use distilled water to mix with the ZENERGY Water Concentrate ?
Distilled water has been stripped of all impurities and is the preferred choice to accept and mix the purity and structure of ZENERGY .
When you add the ZENERGY to the gallon of distilled water memory transfer takes place ; this means that the entire gallon of distilled water becomes pure hexagonally structured water .
If you mix the ZENERGY with any other water you may not get the same hydration results or health benefits .
Does drinking distilled water leach minerals from the body ?
No , quite the opposite .
If inorganic minerals ( and other substances like chlorine , heavy metals , bacteria , etc. ) are removed from water , by converting it into pure distilled water , the result is improved absorption of all nutrients , including minerals , and improved elimination of wastes at the cellular level .
There are numerous studies indicating that through proper hydration , our bodies retain essential minerals which are part of a proper diet .
Who can drink ZENERGY ?
ZENERGY water is for infants to the elderly , and everyone in between .
It ’s a premium water product for any health conscious person who wants only the very best water for their body .
The truth is ZENERGY is for everyone !
Even your Pets will Love It !
How much ZENERGY water should I drink daily ?
As general rule of thumb , you should try to drink at least half your body weight in ounces a day .
For example , if you weigh 180 pounds , you should try to drink 90 oz . of water .
We recommend drink at least 2 gallons of ZENERGY a week .
You should increase consumption during periods of increased physical activity or other physical stress .
Remember to drink before you get thirsty .
If you wait until you 're thirsty , you 're already dehydrated .
How should I store my ZENERGY and what is the Shelf Life ?
You may store ZENERGY water at room temperature , however we recommend refrigeration after the bottle is opened for basic sanitary purposes .
ZENERGY is not affected by heat or direct sunlight like many of the alkaline waters on the market .
ZENERGY has a shelf life of 3 years as required by the FDA labeling guidelines .
But as a June 2002 issue of Consumer Reports states , as long as bottled water is stored properly , it should be good indefinitely .
How can ZENERGY be any different ?
I thought water was just water .
That ’s what many people say , until they try it .
Ideally , drink it for a week and see what you think .
After you ’ve experienced ZENERGY ’s super - clean , crisp , smooth taste for a while , you ’ll likely find it difficult to return to drink any other water .
Without getting too technical with the science behind it , here are some basic facts : • ZENERGY has been structured to consist of small clusters of water as opposed to normal , larger clusters of regular water molecules .
ZENERGY is infused with life enhancing frequencies and has a perfect hexagonal shape , enabling rapid absorption and hydration of every cell in the body .
• ZENERGY displays characteristics unique from other water , including a higher boiling point , lower NMR , and a lower viscosity – all tests indicative of pure hexagonal water .
•
Our extensive purification and structuring process is why ZENERGY measures only 0 - 4 parts per million ( ppm ) of total dissolved solids ( TDS ) and 0.0 contaminants .
The test results show the perfect score we receive for our ZENERGY Water .
This is the best score you can receive and the only one we accept for ZENERGY .
These tests prove that we do everything possible to create the best water .
Every detail of our proprietary process is scrutinized and a sample is sent to the independent lab for the final purity test .
•
The cleaner the water , the healthier the water .
Clean water allows your body to function more efficiently .
An independent , third - party lab has verified that ZENERGY is extremely pure - averaging 0 - 4 parts per million ( ppm ) of total dissolved solids ( TDS ) . •
You wo n’t get this quality of product anywhere else .
Do n’t be fooled by copycat manufacturers - they do not use the same technology to produce their water , nor do they have the technology to produce a product like ours !
I am skeptical about ZENERGY Water , is there any research ?
Even though many people have never heard of hexagonally structured water , it has a long history of scientific research and findings , including work by world renowned doctors and scientists .
For example : In 1986 Dr. Mu Shik Jhon , Author of “ The Water Puzzle & The Hexagonal Key ” presented the Molecular Water Environment Theory at a symposium on cancer .
That theory , which is now being substantiated , states : “ Replenishing the Hexagonal Water in our bodies can increase vitality , slow the aging process and prevent disease . ”
He states further , “ Aging is a loss of Hexagonal Water from organs , tissues and cells , and an overall decrease in total body water . ”
“ The Water Puzzle and the Hexagonal Key ” is scientific documentation , collected over a period of 40 years , and presented in simple terms .
It verifies the existence of a specific water structure known as Hexagonal Water , which is found naturally in various parts of the world - specifically in areas where the inhabitants are known to live exceptionally long lives .
It also explains why this specific water structure is so energetically powerful - why it has a greater capacity to hold and transfer energy and why it can move more efficiently within the body .
Dr. Mu Shik Jhon , has over 250 scientific publications to his credit .
His research started in the 1960's when he began his study of the structure of water .
His first book , Significant Liquid Structures ( John Wiley & Sons - 1969 ) was co-authored by the world famous scientist Dr. Henry Eyring and his original work was encouraged by Eyring and Nobel laureate , Dr. Albert Szent - Györgyi .
Dr. Yang
Oh , who holds a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Harvard Medical School and is a retired professor from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , says the kind of water you drink may relate to bodily dysfunction and disease .
His conclusion :
The hexagonal structure of water is the one that promotes health and increases longevity .
You can also find many articles and publications in scientific journals , books , and even on the National Institute of Health ’s publications ( PubMed ) .
You can share this type of information , but the # 1 thing you can do is try ZENERGY and how you feel .
Can I use ZENERGY water in other ways besides just to drink by itself ?
Yes , we encourage you to drink or mix the ZENERGY with any food , herbal shakes , protein powders , herbs or vitamin supplements etc. to boost the body 's ability to absorb the nutrients and maximize the health benefits from proper hydration .
ZENERGY water makes excellent coffees , teas and juices .
However , we recommend that you do not microwave the water , as this can change the frequency and structure of the water .
Is n’t it important to have minerals in water ?
No .
Pure water provides your body the most effective hydration .
Many mistakenly believe drinking spring or mineral water provides a good source for minerals .
According to the American Medical Journal , “ The minerals which the human body needs that are in the water are insignificant to those in food … and anyone simply eating a varied diet , not even a balanced diet , could hardly suffer a mineral deficiency . ”
The main reason minerals in water are insignificant is because they are in an inorganic state , whereas minerals in food are in an organic ( or bio- available ) state .
“ The only minerals that the body can utilize are the organic minerals , ” said Dr. Charles Mayo of the world - renowned Mayo Clinic .
“ All other types of minerals are foreign substances to the body and must be eliminated . ”
That ’s why we say the only thing that belongs in your water is water .
Not surprisingly , we ’re hearing about more and more spring bottled water drinkers switching to ZENERGY ’s ultra - premium purified water , once they discover the cleaner taste and higher purity .
Is n’t it good to have carbohydrates or vitamins in my water ?
No .
Carbs in a drink can be beneficial during a high - endurance event , but otherwise having carbohydrates or vitamins in water only slow down the hydration process , as a Gatorade study indicated .
Your body can benefit more by receiving carbohydrates and nutrition from food , as well as from high - quality vitamin supplements .
Will ZENERGY
Water help with weight loss ?
Pure water is a crucial component to any weight loss plan .
It has zero carbs , zero fat , and zero calories , and it certainly is n’t going to make you put on any unwanted weight .
Plus , drinking water can help appease hunger pangs that are actually being caused by thirst .
* Each Bottle of Zenergy Water equals approximately a month supply for one person .
I am told the deal is done .
The Canucks have signed 23 - year - old Sergei Shirokov to a two - year deal .
The contract is an entry - level deal and a two - way contract , meaning he can be called up to the Canucks or sent to their farm team ( Manitoba Moose ) without going through waivers .
He will be paid $ 875,000 with bonuses each year .
Note : Under CBA rules , players at the age of 22 - 23 can only sign two - year entry - level contracts .
* Update * I have been told that an official announcement has not been made yet because there is a problem in Russia to send him over .
But do n't get me wrong , this deal is 100 percent done .
* 8:00 Update * I have been on the phone with several people , and as I said before , the deal is 100 percent done , but the problem has something to do with a team in Russia that apparently signed Shirokov .
I do n't have much , but at least it 's something .
I am not sure how this affects the situation as of yet .
I 'm hoping this is n't another Evgeni Malkin situation .
I will try to find out more , so stay tuned .
* 11:00 Update * I am now told the problems were not as big as we thought , look for an official announcment soon ...

The Crown Prosecution Service is telling police officers to use Wikipedia to prepare for court cases .
Mike Finn , an expert witness on martial arts and weapons , told the Police Review he was involved in a case in the Midlands and asked to prepare a report on a weapon .
According to the Telegraph , Finn said : " The material they gave me had been printed out from Wikipedia .
" The officer in charge told me he was advised by the CPS to use the website to find out about the weapon and he was about to present it in court .
" I looked at the information and some of it had substance and some of it was completely made up . "
Finn said he had heard of at least three other cases were police were told by the CPS to get onto Wikipedia .
He added : " When an organisation like the CPS tells you to look at Wikipedia , you might believe it is some kind of authority .
It is unsettling that potentially unsafe and inaccurate evidence could be presented in court . " ®
Those of us who follow health care may be overlooking the big picture .
Most of the profound ( and sometimes disruptive ) changes of the last half century -- computers , the Internet , social networks -- were n't initiated by the political process .
They arose at the intersection of technology , economics , and mass social change .
So here 's something to think about :
Could the medical profession go the way of the record industry ?
Consider the path that led to the current crisis in the music business :
1 . An industry with a near - total monopoly experiences a minor disruption ( in music 's case , with the invention of cassette tape recording ) .
2. It ' relaxes ' and assumes the crisis has past .
3 . An even better technology comes along ( the Internet ) that includes lateral as well as vertical connections .
( Individuals could only make tapes for themselves ; sharing was possible but cumbersome , until the Net and mp3s made it instantaneous and worldwide . )
4 . The industry fails to recognize the long - term significance and risks of this new tech .
5 . Enterprising individuals use this new technology to distribute " information " of mutual interest - songs - through " P2P " ( peer - to - peer ) file sharing .
The result ?
A massive and ongoing implosion of the music biz .
( David Byrne provided an excellent overview in Wired , with some corrections on his blog . )
Could the same thing happen to the medical profession ?
Many people 's immediate reaction will be to say ' no . '
They 'll list the many barriers to what we might call a ' P2 PMed ' disruption of our medical economy ( with ' P2P ' here meaning either ' peer - to - peer ' or ' patient to patient ' . )
Doctors are too respected .
Regulations wo n't permit it .
Doctors control access to medications .
Medical information is walled off behind expensive , subscription - only medical journals .
It 's unthinkable .
That 's pretty much how the record industry reacted in the 1990s .
Let 's look at those objections :
160 million people looked up medical information on the Internet circa 2007 , according to Harris polling data .
Yet they still go to doctors .
That 's true -- just as millions of people made tape copies of music for decades without seriously undermining musical economics .
Each of these searches was a solitary activity .
The difference will come when a new technology allows lateral information - sharing in a way that people trust .
It has n't happened yet , but smart people are banking on the idea that it will soon .
I agree with that assessment , although none of the many projects I 've looked at so far struck me as a breakthrough .
But a lot of folks are working on it .
Doctors monopolize access to medications through the power of the prescription pad .
That monopoly 's already eroding as online pharmacies provide low - cost ' doctor consults , ' a legal work - around that allows -- to an sometimes disturbing extent -- easy access to meds .
Where there is demand , there will be suppliers .
People wo n't spend money based on self - referral .
The multi-billion dollar complementary medicine industry demonstrates this is untrue .
Most " CAM " ( complementary and alternative medicine ) transactions are based on self - referral out of the traditional MD / patient relationship .
Medical information is walled off .
True , but a backlash against the sequestering of research data is already underway .
Case in point : A new publication called The Journal of Participatory Medicine hopes to provide peer - reviewed articles on self care for patients , as board member Kevin Kelly writes .
The Journal 's Advisory Board reads like a Who 's Who of Internet and medical business pioneers ( and it's an open - source publication , meaning its content will be free to all ) .
The Journal goal of helping patients take " responsibility for their own health and healing " ( in Kevin Kelly 's words ) aligns with decades of movement toward a more patient - centric model championed by both the Left ( as " patient 's rights " ) and the Right ( as with high - deductible " consumer - directed health plans " ) .
Once again , the left / right paradigm is ill - suited for new developments ... and do n't blame initiatives like the Journal if medicine goes the way of record labels .
They 're symptoms of broader socio- informational change , not its cause .
Not all doctors would go out of business after such a transition , of course .
They 're still selling some CDs , too .
So who would be most likely to thrive after the transformation ?
High - touch practitioners : Empathetic , comforting , and warm doctors .
" Mechanics " :
The most gifted and accomplished surgeons sometimes use this word to describe themselves .
We will need talented neurosurgeons , cardiac surgeons , and other " fixers " for the foreseeable future ( at least until the self - programmable nanobots take over ) .
Innovators : Doctors who are always exploring , changing , and trying new things , staying one step ahead of the curve .
Integrators : Doctors who can bring together seemingly unrelated ideas and solutions , whether in diagnosis or in treatment .
Integration is the foundation of creativity , and creative doctors will always be valued .
Who 'll fail ?
Doctors who function by rote , who make routine diagnoses , and who connect patients to other resources based on past relationships and not need .
Anyone whose expertise and connections are easily replicated on the Internet ( think " travel agents " ) will struggle to survive .
Watching the AMA defend its turf on issues like doctor reimbursement is like watching the RIAA file copyright lawsuits against teenagers , even as its business model collapses around it .
You can't fight your own market and win , and you can't fight yesterday 's battles .
Doctor groups should look more like think tanks and less like a lobbying groups .
( Come to think of it , so should the RIAA . )
Predicting this kind of change is not the same thing as endorsing it .
But , like it or not , we should be talking about it now .
Because -- like it or not -- it 's coming .

Apple dropped to fifth in U.S. laptop sales , down from fourth last year , Electronista reports , citing early estimates from IDC .
Toshiba , which was No.5 last winter , is expected to take Apple 's spot , but Apple will maintain its market share the IDC says .
Mac shipments will fall 12.4 % to 1.21 million units .
The top three in laptop sales are Dell , HP and Acer .
Dell is the only other company in the top five that 's expected to lose market share .
Acer is predicted to have grown the fastest at a 51 % increase in shipments .
IDC expects the U.S. computer business to have shrunk 3 % since last year .
Electronista argues the numbers show that a company offering more affordable laptops will sell more units during a recession :
Electronista : IDC would n't speculate on each brand , but it 's commonly believed that the relatively high prices of Macs hurt Apple for most of the quarter , steering those still sensitive to the economy towards lower cost brands or else keeping them from buying altogether .
Sweeping MacBook
Pro updates that included lower prices only came in mid-June and were unlikely to have had a significant impact .
Single molecule , one million times smaller than a grain of sand , pictured for first time
It may look like a piece of honeycomb , but this lattice - shaped image is the first ever close - up view of a single molecule .
Scientists from IBM used an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) to reveal the chemical bonds within a molecule .
' This is the first time that all the atoms in a molecule have been imaged , ' lead researcher Leo Gross said .
The delicate inner structure of a pentacene molecule has been imaged with an atomic force microscope
The researchers focused on a single molecule of pentacene , which is commonly used in solar cells .
The rectangular - shaped organic molecule is made up of 22 carbon atoms and 14 hydrogen atoms .
In the image above the hexagonal shapes of the five carbon rings are clear and even the positions of the hydrogen atoms around the carbon rings can be seen .
To give some perspective , the space between the carbon rings is only 0.14 nanometers across , which is roughly one million times smaller than the diameter of a grain of sand .
Textbook model : A computer - generated image of how we 're used to seeing a molecule represented with balls and sticks
' If you think about how a doctor uses an X - ray to image bones and organs inside the human body , we are using the atomic force microscope to image the atomic structures that are the backbones of individual molecules , ' said IBM researcher Gerhard Meyer .
A 3D view showing how a single carbon monoxide molecule was used to create the image using a ' tuning fork ' effect
The team from IBM Research Zurich said the results could have a huge impact of the field of nanotechnology , which seeks to understand and control some of the smallest objects known to mankind .
The AFM uses a sharp metal tip that acts like a tuning fork to measure the tiny forces between the tip and the molecule .
This requires great precision as the tip moves within a nanometer of the sample .
' Above the skeleton of the molecular backbone ( of the pentacene ) you get a different detuning than above the surface the molecule is lying on , ' Mr Gross said .
This detuning is then measured and converted into an image .
To stop the tip from absorbing the pentacene molecule , the researchers replaced the metal with a single molecule of carbon monoxide .
This was found to be more stable and created weaker electrostatic attractions with the pentacene , creating a higher resolution image .

The experiment was also performed inside a high vacuum at the extremely cold temperature of - 268C to avoid stray gas molecules or atomic vibrations from affecting the measurements .
' Eventually we want to investigate using molecules for molecular electronics , ' Mr Gross said .
' We want to use molecules as wires or logic switches or elements . '
CHICAGO | Retirement is no longer the debt - free zone it used to be .
Rising health care and energy costs and the phasing out of traditional pensions have been making that widely sought goal tougher to reach for some time .
Now the recession and market slide have compounded the challenge , taking giant chunks out of home values , stock portfolios and job opportunities for older workers .
Zero debt is hardly a must .
Some retirees are content paying off mortgages they have well under control .
Others like using credit to buy investment real estate for a second home , or a houseboat , or charge a special trip .
But all the additional cost burdens provide an emphatic reminder that , generally , the less debt the better for seniors living on limited fixed incomes .
A sobering example of what can happen when crushing debt overwhelms can be found in a poignant scene that plays out all too often at counseling offices in such places as Rapid City , S.D .
Women in their 70s and 80s , sometimes on walkers , show up for their required counseling sessions regularly at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of the Black Hills as they prepare to file for bankruptcy .
Debt adviser Terry Mills says hundreds of retirees have gone that route since 2005 , making them by far the biggest demographic group .
Most had limited assets to deal with their medical bills .
“ It ’s very sad , ” said Mr. Mills , the agency ’s education and community outreach manager .
“ They worked their whole lives , and here they come and they have to file bankruptcy — this is how you end your life .
It just tears your heart out when people come in here on walkers . ”
Americans 55 and older have been the largest age group to file for bankruptcy recently , accounting for 23 percent of the more than 1 million filings in 2007 , according to the AARP .
Older seniors are even more vulnerable , with bankruptcy more than quadrupling for those ages 75 to 84 .
Even aside from the last resort of bankruptcy , the level of mortgage and credit card debt among retirees is worrisome .
Forty - three percent of people ages 65 to 74 had a mortgage in 2007 , carrying median housing debt of $ 69,000 , according to government data compiled by the Employee Benefit Research Institute .
That was up sharply from 32 percent in 2004 and 18 percent in 1992 .
Credit card debt is an increasing problem for seniors with limited or modest resources .
A study of low - and middle - income households by the New York think tank Demos last year found that credit card debt had risen 26 percent among those 65 and older since 2005 .
The respondents in that age group reported an average of $ 4,000 of credit card debt for medical expenses alone .
Those who thought they had built up a comfortable level of assets for retirement are feeling the squeeze , too .
Ginnie Curran , 65 , a retired teacher from San Diego , always expected to be debt - free in retirement .
As she prepared to retire in 2003 , she envisioned annual trips to New York for Broadway shows and to Hawaii , even sometimes paying for her son and daughter to accompany her .
But unforeseen circumstances have chipped away at her money and added to her debt .
Her investment holdings plunged 30 percent in the dot - com implosion not long before her retirement .
The condo she bought for $ 580,000 in 2005 after selling her house has fallen 10 percent in value .
She carries a $ 215,000 mortgage that translates into more than $ 1,800 in monthly housing costs .
And despite a seemingly adequate monthly income of $ 4,200 ( after taxes ) from her teacher ’s pension , unanticipated costs on everything from home repairs to doctors visits cause her to keep running up her credit card , which she periodically dips into her stocks to pay .
Now Ms. Curran , who is divorced , is on a tight budget so she wo n’t exhaust her savings over a long retirement .
Those yearly pleasure trips ?
She ’s been once each to New York and Hawaii in six years .
She lives comfortably enough , but it ’s not what she expected .
“ I still feel very blessed and grateful for what I have , ” she said .
“ But I ’m surprised and disappointed that I am not debt - free . ”
Her cautionary words to future retirees :
You do n’t know how your retirement is going to work out , from market drops and other setbacks to unanticipated medical costs that might not be covered .
So do n’t make any optimistic assumptions about debt .
Ms. Curran ’s financial adviser , Rick Brooks of Family Wealth Advisers in Solana Beach , Calif. , says an unfortunate number of investors such as Ms. Curran began this decade with retirement plans built on asset - return assumptions that proved far too rosy .
“ She ’s not an emergency case , but she ’s one of those people who it would n’t take much to push over the edge , ” said the certified financial planner , who has worked with his client to rein in her spending .
How much debt , then , is acceptable for retirees living on modest fixed income ?
The advice will vary widely depending on Social Security and pension income and many other factors .
A general guideline is to stay far under the spending limits widely recommended for homeowners :
No more than 30 percent of your monthly income should go to housing and no more than another 20 percent to pay other debts .
Paying off a mortgage before retirement , and avoiding rent , too , is highly advisable when possible .
But the most important thing is to keep nondiscretionary expenses to a minimum when you retire .
You want to have as much flexibility as possible with cash flow .
Failing to plan wisely can leave you with more debt , or perhaps a reverse mortgage , as your only alternative .

The Graveyard Book : A Review
From the title on down , this novel is " The Jungle Book , " but dead .
Whereas " The Jungle Book " is vibrant , terrifying , meaty , pulsing , and passionate , Neil Gaiman 's " The Graveyard Book " is subdued , light , insubstantial , diffident , and chilly .
The difference between the two books is the difference between the tiger and the ghost of the tiger .
But which one is more magical , you may ask ?
Which one is more terrifying ?
The tiger or her spirit ?
Comparisons here add little to our understanding , even though Gaiman practically demands that we make them as a result of his brazen gambit , staging Kipling in a graveyard and casting ghosts , vampires , and ghouls instead of wolves , tigers , and monkeys .
More interesting than comparisons are the questions that his narrative decision provokes .
Are we not more obsessed these days by ghosts than by primal hunters ?
Do n't we occupy a more quiet world , a world of deadened senses and soft mosses , where we are haunted and yet nurtured by all that has come before us ?
Is there any place left in the world that is not more like a graveyard than a jungle ?
What have n't we killed ?
What have we left alive ?
And what can we learn from the dead ?***" The Graveyard Book " is the story of a young orphan who is rechristened Nobody Owens ( " Bod " ) after his family is murdered by a man called Jack and he is adopted by a ghostly couple in his local graveyard .
Jack is a typical Gaimannered villain .
You know the sort : immortal anthropomorphic concepts saddled with ancient pathology , magic , and workaday , tea - drinking evil .
A man named Silas offers to be Nobody 's caretaker and protect him from Jack 's malice .
Silas is a physical being unlike the rest of the graveyard 's inhabitants , although he is one of those who are technically neither living nor dead .
However , he can leave to procure books and food for Nobody , instructing him on the ways of the world while simultaneously protecting him from harm and rescuing him from deadly perils .
Like " The Jungle Book , " each chapter tells its own story .
There is a space of two years between each vignette .
Unlike " The Jungle Book , " each chapter follows the central character closely instead of drifting off into ancillary fables .
Therefore , some of the most famous parts of " The Jungle Book " do n't have a direct analog in this novel , such as Kipling 's story of Riki - Tiki - Tavi or the bit about the elephant seals .
Perhaps these untold stories will appear soon in a companion piece , and then the whole work can be synthesized , complete with epitaph poems , advice for dealing with extreme bereavement , and instructions for settling the spirits of the restless departed .
" The Jungle Book " is well - known for serving as the impetus for the modern scouting movement .
Is anybody up for Ghost Scouts ?
Motto : be prepared ... to die .*** To promote his book , Gaiman traveled the country and read a different chapter in nine different locations .
You can watch him read the whole book aloud here : Chapter 1 : " How Nobody Came to the Graveyard " Chapter 2 : " The New Friend " Chapter 3 : " The Hounds of God " Chapter 4 : " The Witch 's Headstone " Chapter 5 : " Danse Macabre " INTERLUDE : " The Convocation " Chapter 6 : " Nobody Owens ' School Days " Chapter 7 ( Part 1 ) : " Every Man Jack , Part 1 " Chapter 7 ( Part 2 ) : " Every Man Jack , Part 2 " Chapter 8 : " Leavings and Partings " *** Nobody is like Gaiman 's other heroes , a minor - key cipher with untapped powers that keep him balanced yet befuddled , struggling to come to terms with the bigger questions of love and belonging , gifted with existential certainty .
He occupies a privileged side - world of truth deeper than the metaphysics to which the rest of us are allowed access .
Like Dream from " The Sandman , " and Shadow from " American Gods , " he is a creature torn between the power of the past and the promise of the present , navigating the deep architecture of fable in order to overcome modern obstacles .
The ghosts of Nobody 's graveyard have taught him to fade into invisibility and possess the dreams of the living .
He knows for certain there is life after death , and knows for certain what shape it takes .
But when will he learn self - possession ?
When Nobody becomes somebody , he stops being safe .
A body can be killed , but more importantly , a body must have a reason to live .*** One must keep in mind at all times that this is a novel meant for children , otherwise one 's expectations will be too high and one will be sadly disappointed by what Gaiman provides .
Gaiman 's finest terrors , fancies , and myth - making are not on display here .
The book is clever and clean , without getting too deep or dragging on for too long .
Because this is a children 's story , " The Graveyard Book " often feels like Gaiman is writing while sitting on one hand .
Gaiman does his best work on a canvas of bone , dipping his brush into buckets of blood and painting pictures of eternal suffering , made beautiful by eternal story .
This is not such a work .
But it may be Gaiman 's most accessible story to those who are unfamiliar with him .
Soon enough , Gaiman might produce a lengthy work of moody British genius to rival Barker 's " Imagica " or Peake 's " Gormenghast . "
He 's certainly got the talent .
One hopes the success of this book does n't convince Gaiman that his real talent lies in creating minor fairy tales .
When exceptionally imaginative dark fantasists write for children , it always feels like court - ordered penance , like seeing your favorite drug - addicted rock musicians do public service announcements about how you should get your car inspected or spend more quality time with your elderly relatives .
The best parts of this book are the departures from Kipling , the parts where Gaiman tells his own story and his world begins to take on its own life beyond the equipment of the concept .
It is interesting to imagine the post - modern mash - up that occurs inside a graveyard .
Death is the world 's great equalizer , where the high and the low are forced to share common ground , and where historical periods must mingle to teach us about the frailty of every epoch .
In my favorite chapter , and perhaps the best stand - alone episode , Gaiman 's eternal muse , Death herself , makes her cameo appearance .
In this section -- " Danse Macabre " -- the villagers of " Old Town " and the inhabitants of the graveyard come together for a joined evening of revelry , the living partnering with the dead in a ritual dance as old as marriage .
Children no longer fear wild animals .
Indeed , they identify with them , being also creatures of natural vitality thrust into a world of decay and " human " ways .
We have mastered the jungle and erected tombstones of knowledge where we have deleted the inhabitants .
But children have other paralyzing fears these days .
Death is alien to our culture and yet surrounds us like animated mist .
To make children comfortable with death , to encourage them to commune with the spirits of the departed and to comfort them with the knowledge that the separation between the here and the gone is temporary -- this is no small feat .
Gaiman 's novel is a soothing towel on the forehead of an ashen , fevered rugrat who wants to know what it all means .
We are all going to die .
Might as well dance .
Or better yet , read a book .
US soldier who opposes Afghan war sentenced
By Jack Cody
8 August 2009
A US Army Specialist and veteran of the war in Iraq will face jail time for refusing to deploy to Afghanistan .
The non-commissioned officer objects to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on principle , claiming the US military occupies both countries in violation of international law .
Spc. Victor Agosto , 24 , from Miami , served a 13 - month tour in Iraq with the Army ’s 57th Battalion .
Although his four - year enlistment should have ended August 4 , Agosto received orders in May to report to an Army office to begin the paperwork for overseas deployment to Afghanistan .
He was informed that his military service was to be involuntarily extended under the “ stop - loss ” program .
When he received his reporting orders , Agosto wrote a letter refusing deployment .
“ There is no way I will deploy to Afghanistan , ” wrote Agosto .
“ The occupation is immoral and unjust .
It does not make the American people any safer .
It has the opposite effect . ”
Agosto has now been court - martialed .
After a one - hour hearing August 5 , a military court in Ft. Hood , Texas , demoted Agosto to the rank of private and sentenced him to 30 days in jail .
When he heard the sentence , Agosto ripped from his uniform the patch displaying his specialist rank , symbolically embracing his demotion .
After completing his jail sentence , Agosto will likely receive a less - than - honorable discharge .
The stop - loss program originated in the aftermath of the Vietnam War , coinciding with the elimination of the draft in the US .
Conscription fueled mass opposition to US militarism among civilians and soldiers alike , which in turn contributed to the American government ’s inability to continue prosecuting the Vietnam War .
Ultimately , the US was forced to withdraw from Vietnam in 1975 .
Conscious of the effect popular discontent could have on its ability to carry out future imperialist adventures , the US ruling class eliminated the draft in 1972 .
Congress passed the stop - loss legislation in an effort to maintain a semblance of voluntarism without incurring chronic , debilitating troop shortages in the process .
Since the beginning of the current war in Iraq , over 140,000 soldiers have had their terms involuntarily extended under the stop - loss policy .
The extent to which soldiers oppose the war in Iraq and Afghanistan is difficult to gauge , in part because most resisters either simply go AWOL ( absent without leave ) , or purposely defy army regulations in order to be discharged .
According to the Courage to Resist web site , “ Since 2002 , the Army has court - martialed twice as many soldiers for desertion and other unauthorized absences per year than for each year between 1997 and 2001 .
AWOL rates in the Army are at their highest since 1980 , with the desertion rate having jumped 80 percent since the start of the Iraq War , according to the Associated Press . ”
Agosto , conscious of the consequences he faced , made his objections public in an effort to mobilize resistance to the wars among the military rank - and - file .
“ I learned of the effect of the GI resistance movement during the Vietnam War , ” Agosto explained in an interview given to the “ Democracy Now ! ” radio program on the day of his trial .
“ I felt that if I were to go AWOL my commanders could tell other soldiers that I left because I was scared , because I had other reasons .
Whereas by staying on base I can set an example for other soldiers to see that I think this war is wrong , and I am just not going to do it , and I think they should do the same . ”
Agosto is unapologetic about his refusal to deploy .
In a statement issued to the press after he was sentenced , Agosto said , “ I have learned that there is nothing more frightening to power than a direct and principled challenge to its authority .
The truth is on our side , and those who have incarcerated me know it ....
My only apologies are to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan .
I hope that someday they can forgive me for my contributions to their distress . ”
Asked by Amy Goodman of “ Democracy Now ! ” if he would apply for conscientious objector status , Agosto replied that he would not .
“ As far as the army is concerned , ” said Agosto , “ a conscientious objector is someone who is opposed to all wars , and that is not me .
I believe that sometimes war is necessary in cases of legitimate self - defense and legitimate resistance ....
We ’re just killing people and spreading suffering with no real justification . ”
Agosto argues that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan violate international law .
In the case of Afghanistan , to which Agosto refused to be deployed , the US ruling elite justified the occupation on the grounds that the country was harboring Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders , who were allegedly responsible for the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Nearing the end of the eighth year of the war and occupation , any pretense of hunting for Bin Laden has been dropped .
The Afghan war has been escalated by Obama , who was elected in large part because of popular hopes that he would bring the disastrous conflicts in the region to an end .
Asked by Goodman whether it surprised him that Obama had escalated the war in Afghanistan , Agosto replied , “ No .
No , it does n’t , because he said he would do so during his campaign .
Part of why I ’m doing what I ’m doing is because I do n’t believe that any politician can end this war .
I think that it has to be ended at the grassroots level .
Soldiers , by refusing to fight , can bring about the end of the war . ”
Agosto is quite correct to argue that both the US - led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan violate international law .
His advice to other soldiers ?
“ I would say that you would never — you ’ll never regret following your conscience and that adherence to an oath is not a valid excuse for betraying your conscience . ”
Agosto told Courage to Resist that he has received support from fellow soldiers at Ft. Hood .
“ Some of the people in my unit will flash me peace signs when they walk by me , ” he explains .
“ The other day when I was coming back from the shop , this soldier stopped me and said he wanted to shake my hand .
He told me he looked up to me for not going to fight a war I do n’t believe in . ”
Paulette & Paul , a figher for Wisconsin families & a fighter for K Street lobbyists
It was Ryan who attended the April 15 , 2009 ' Tea Party ' in Madison , decrying government spending to a modest Capitol steps crowd after voting for the record stimulus spending package last fall .
It was Ryan who voted for the George W. Bush plan that deprived the federal government of using its bulk purchasing power in negotiating the price of prescription medications with the giant pharmaceutical companies .
That decision increased the cost of health care to the federal government and taxpayers as well as health care recipients by tens of billions of dollars .
Now , Ryan , through the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel portal , enters the debate over heath care reform : Government puts itself , not patients , in control of care .
While the statement is incorrect , what is more interesting is Ryan 's observation that :
" Right now , the nucleus of power lies with third parties -- insurers , employers and bureaucratic administrators . "
It is curious that for all these years Ryan never chose to take up the health care banner on behalf of patients in their struggle with the ' third parties . '
Ryan had a dozen years to fight for patients and consumers .
So long as the battle was against the private sector lobbyists who supported his campaigns he was silent .
Now that reform is in the air , he muddies the waters by claiming to be the champion of the people .
Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan has been the face of the Republican House caucus ' ugly and shallow financial and health care " policies , " which really amount to nothing more than obstructionism and egregiously distorting President Obama 's ideas for cleaning up the mess the GOP left the country in .
Ryan has happy to alternate with another unctuous piece of work , his tag team partner Mike Pence , distorting the issues on Hate Talk radio tweeting away the days and scooping up huge corporate bribes from the Medical - Industrial Complex and Big Insurance -- but he has steadfastly refused to meet with his constituents for a real talk about the health care debate .
A couple of days ago Paul Soglin at Waxing America pointed to the hypocrisy of a career - long shill for Big Business and a darling of the K Street lobbyists -- who has taken more money from the Finance Sector than any other politician in Wisconsin ( $ 1,651,445 ) and another $ 685,714 from the Medical - Industrial Complex -- suddenly declaring himself a tribune of the people .
Recently Blue America started a StopPaulRyan fund - raising page and we 've been praying for a good , solid opponent to weigh in against Ryan .
It looks like our hopes are being answered -- in spades .
Paulette Garin , a member of the National Single Payer Alliance and the Wisconsin state Coordinator for both Progressive Democrats of America and the Leadership Conference for Guaranteed Health Care , has taken the plunge and filed her candidate papers with the FEC , making her Ryan 's official opponent .
She 's been spending all of her time campaigning for health care reform rather than for Congress but yesterday she faced off against Ryan in the only contest he 's agreed to participate in -- a goat - milking event at the Racine County Fair .
Paulette beat him .
We 'll be hearing lots more from this strong and determined progressive woman real soon and we 'll be adding her ActBlue page as soon as it's up .
Meanwhile , though , please consider a donation to StopPaulRyan while you watch Paulette speaking about health care at a rally in Madison last week :

Advertisement A dog rescue centre in Norfolk is trying to find a new home for a blind sheepdog and its " guide dog " .
The two border collies , called Bonnie and Clyde , were found roaming on a country road .
It was not immediately clear why one followed the other .
Cherie Cootes , from Meadowgreen Dog Rescue Centre , in Hales , near Loddon , said they could not be separated .
She discovered that Bonnie led Clyde , who had lost his sight because of a degenerative disease .
" If Clyde 's unsure where he is , he will suddenly go behind Bonnie and put his face on the back of her so she can guide him , he totally relies on her , " said Ms Cootes .
There 's no option of homing them separately .
They 've got to go as a pair
Cherie Cootes , Meadowgreen Dog Rescue Centre " And when she walks she tends to stop and make sure he 's there - she does look out for him .
" When she 's about you would n't notice he is blind , but when she 's not about he refuses to move .
" There 's no option of homing them separately .
They 've got to go as a pair . "
The dogs were found running through Blundeston , near Lowestoft in Suffolk , during a storm three weeks ago .
Neither Clyde , who is thought by the rescue centre workers to be about five years old , nor Bonnie , whose estimated age is two or three , had identifying collars or chips .

The iPhone Dev-Team has confirmed that updating to iTunes 8.2 will make the current versions of QuickPwn and Pwnage Tool inoperable .
They are warning users who wish to jailbreak iPhones to wait until the new versions of their tools are available before upgrading iTunes to the new version .
The Dev-Team plans to release updated jailbreaking software after Apple makes a public release of iPhone OS 3.0 .
An update to the unlocking software yellowsn0w will also have to wait .
According to the Dev-Team , any possible release of a yellowsn0w version for basebands newer than 02.28.00 would only come after iPhone OS 3.0 is out of beta .
Jailbreaking the iPhone provides added functionality to the user by making it possible to run software not approved by Apple .
The yellowsn0w tool is available on Cydia and allows jailbroken iPhones to be used with any GSM carrier .
The iPhone Dev-Team has determined that iTunes 8.2 has updated a low - level USB protocol and this inadvertently breaks the jailbreak tools .
From the Dev-Team Blog , the reasons jailbreakers and yellowsn0w - users should NOT update iTunes to version 8.2 :
It breaks your ability to use QuickPwn , PwnageTool , and iPhone Tunneling Suite ( ssh over usb ) .
We do n’t think this is a deliberate breakage of these tools .
It ’s just that Apple has updated a low - level USB protocol that normally only Apple cares about ( but jailbreakers care about ) .
So far , the only appreciable change to iTunes 8.2 is the Genius function working on videos .
On an added note , the Dev-Team also thinks the iTunes 8.2 update may break the Palm Pre 's ability to communicate with iTunes .
There is always one more thing to learn ...
Andreae says aerosols are a " brake " on warming
The Earth could heat up more quickly as the cooling effect of this pollution is reduced , Professor Meinrat Andreae told a London conference on Monday .
He said aerosols - tiny particles of , typically , sulphur or carbon held in the air - helped to cool the planet .
But since these were expected to diminish in the coming decades , global warming would accelerate , he claimed .
The aerosols come from natural sources , such as volcanoes - but a substantial load also comes from human sources , such as the soot from oil and wood burning .
Aerosols are an important but uncertain agent of climate change .
By absorbing or scattering radiation , they can either warm or cool the troposphere .
They can also modify clouds and affect precipitation .
Professor Andreae , of the Max Planck Institute in Mainz , Germany , told the 13th World Clean Air and Environmental Protection Congress that the overall cooling effect was , in his view , currently dominant and offsetting the warming brought about by greenhouse gases .
" We 've been in an accelerating car with one foot on the brake and one foot on the gas , " he told the BBC .
The scientist said the " climate protection " provided by aerosols was likely to diminish in the future .
" The aerosol particles do n't stay in the atmosphere for very long , so we do n't expect their concentration - their effect - to grow over the next century .
" The greenhouse gases , on the other hand - carbon dioxide and methane - they keep accumulating in the atmosphere because they have long lifetimes .
" Whether we want it or not , the warming forces are going to overpower the cooling forces and the big question now is just how strong that effect is going to be . "
Predictions of the rise in global temperatures may therefore have to be revised upwards , Professor Andreae argued .
The US space agency 's Aura satellite was recently sent into orbit with a specific task to unravel aerosols ' precise impact on the global climate .
I saw a great post this afternoon by Rob Walling of Software By Rob , where he talks about Competing With Open Source .
His main point was the fact that while there are some great open source projects , most open source software suffers from usability , support and documentation issues ( amongst other things ) and this is where commercial software can have the upper edge .
While I could see the point he was trying make , I found that over the last few years I have developed pretty much the opposite view .
Of course , it all depends on the segment of the software market that you ’re looking at ( enterprise , mass market etc. ) , but lets start with the big ones .
Enterprise Software Development
If you ’ve done enterprise software development for any length of time you would have heard of or used some of the biggies ( note I have predominantly been doing Java development ) :
Websphere
Weblogic
Oracle ( Database )
etc .
All commercial , all owned by big companies , all established players in the market place with years of development effort put into them .
So , let us examine these against some of the more pertinent points :
Easy of installation – I do n’t know about you , but I would say all three that I mentioned above get a massive fail for this one ( if you disagree please , I ’d love to hear you explain how all those are easy to install )
– I do n’t know about you , but I would say all three that I mentioned above get a massive fail for this one ( if you disagree please , I ’d love to hear you explain how all those are easy to install ) Great documentation – Sure there is a LOT of documentation for all of them , the value of it however is marginal .
Most of the information is probably there , finding what you need is a whole other story .
Another big fail .
– Sure there is a LOT of documentation for all of them , the value of it however is marginal .
Most of the information is probably there , finding what you need is a whole other story .
Another big fail .
Usability – yeah all right , they are usable ( sort of ) , but they have nothing over their open source counterparts in this department .
Maybe not a fail , but certainly far from brilliant .
– yeah all right , they are usable ( sort of ) , but they have nothing over their open source counterparts in this department .
Maybe not a fail , but certainly far from brilliant .
Support – well , it is certainly there somewhere .
You know it exists , getting your hands on some of this support is a whole other matter .
Even if you do manage to get through the layers of bureaucracy and get a hold of someone who knows what they are talking about , it gets you precisely nowhere if you found a bug with the software .
It ’s not as if IBM will be rushing out a new Websphere release just to fix your little issue any time soon and even if they did , let ’s see you easily upgrade .
Notice that I only named 3 big commercial products , that ’s not by accident .
Undoubtedly there are hundreds of others used in enterprise software development , but the number pales in comparison to the sheer amount of open source libraries and products that are in general circulation .
Lets see how many I can list off the top of my head in 5 seconds :
Pretty impressive , and that was the very tip of the iceberg .
And the interesting thing about most of those that I listed is the fact that they have decent documentation ( for the most part ) , are reasonably easy to use , are reasonably easy to install ( if you know what you ’re doing , at least a little ) and have great support not only from the developers but from the community .
Which is the truly awesome thing about open source products , even the smallest ones will often have a community form around them , a community that is usually vociferous , helpful and that includes developers who actually wrote the product .
This is something that even the biggest commercial products usually lack – a helpful community .
And consider that with open source software if you do find a bug , you sometimes actually have a chance of getting the products fixed and a new version released pretty much just for you .
Granted , this will never happen with the bigger open source products but at least you have a chance and at the end of the day , you can always just patch it yourself and build your own copy ( and submit your fix to the developers ) because the source code is right there ( difficult yes , but at least possible ) .
And to get back to documentation , if you really think about it , open source software is the best documented software of all because you always have the god ’s own truth to have a look at – the code .
If you do n’t understand the doco for an open source product , you can read the code as a last resort ; for a commercial product – good luck !
Software For The Masses
Of course we have so far been happily ensconced in developer land , but what about the average Joe Bloggs out there , what ’s the landscape like for him / her ( Joanne Bloggs : ) ) when it comes to open source vs. commercial .
The field is a little more even here , Joe is not going to read the code , he pretty much wants his software to just work and you know what more and more often these days open source software just does .
Sure , commercial products probably have the majority of the market at the moment when it comes to mass - market software , but I would guess that their market share is shrinking .
Open source developers have learned that they need to build for the consumer and not for other developers and they ’re slowly starting to do so .
And the abundance of open source tools and frameworks is making this easier and easier for them .
The only commercial software I have on my machine is … well the operating system ( I am a gamer so Windows is a must ) , and even there my machine is dual boot :) .
Aside from that , everything else I need to do with my machine is done by free or open source software :
All of these were easy to install ( they just worked ) , intuitive to use and have decent documentation as far as I know ( never had to look at any ) .
And as far as support goes , well once again we have the community which is more passionate and helpful around all of the apps that I listed than around most commercial products .
But , I am a developer , I hear you say , I know how to use and tweak all this stuff , surely Joe Bloggs would find things much tougher .
Well , to that I have this to say , the only commercial software my parents have on their machine is … once again the operating system , and only because I did n’t want to confuse them too much ( they are not developers : ) ) .
They ’ve been using it fine and I have n’t heard any complaints about lack of documentation , support or usability , the machine does everything they want it to do , what else do you need ?
This day and age commercial software is going to find it harder and harder to compete as the world is getting more connected and more savvy .
Sure they can make the documentation great ( which historically has not been the case ) , but so can open source software , and the 80 ⁄ 20 rule applies where it all becomes moot after a certain point .
Commercial can be more useable , but once again 80 ⁄ 20 rule and you really need to innovate hard to stand out .
Easy of installation is getting tougher and tougher to compete on as open source tools get more savvy about this one .
Finally support is left , and honestly , no commercial software company has the same type of flexibility to offer support as a great open source product with a strong community .
The only thing that you end up competing on is price and ‘ nothing ’ , is going to beat ‘ something ’ every time .

“ It was thought to be this green pasture of stability , a more comfortable life , ” said Mr. Fanciullo , who had heard that 90 percent of N.Y.U. law graduates land jobs at firms , and counted on that to repay his loans .
“ It was almost written in stone that you ’ll end up in a law firm , almost like a birthright . ”
With the cost of law school skyrocketing over the years , the implicit arrangement between students and the most expensive and prestigious schools has only strengthened : the student takes on hefty debt to pay tuition , and the school issues the golden ticket to a job at a high - paying firm  if that ’s what the student wants .
“ Students came in with a certain sense of what the compact was going to be , ” said Irene Dorzback , the assistant dean for career services at the New York University School of Law .
But with the system crumbling in recent months , Ms. Dorzback said , “ people are now accepting this notion of a lost year . ”
The timing is worst for the class of 2011 , the second - years now looking to get into firms , because of a unique logjam created last year .
After the September financial crisis , firms chose to defer their new hires at the price of steeply cutting recruiting this year .
But students who miss the brief window of opportunity to land an offer this fall may struggle to break into firms once next year ’s class rises .
When Julia Figurelli , a second - year student at the University of Pennsylvania , decided to enter law school a year ago , she expected to find a lucrative law firm job in three years  if not collecting the $ 160,000 - a- year associate salaries at one of the uppermost partnerships .
By the time she obtains her J.D. , she says , she will have around $ 200,000 in debt .
“ Had I seen where the market was going , I would ’ve gone to a lower - ranked but less expensive public school , ” she said .
“ I ’m questioning whether law school was the right choice at all . ”
Once aiming to work in Philadelphia , Ms. Figurelli is now hunting for jobs in lower - paying markets , like Pittsburgh and Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
“ I ’m looking anywhere my competition is n’t looking , ” she added .
Ever since it occurred to me a few years ago , I ’ve been deeply disturbed the two meanings that the word “ fuck ” has in U.S. culture .
We use the word when we want to hurt someone really , really bad ; and we use it to describe what may be the most physically intimate thing two people can do together .
The fact that the word has that double meaning , I think , speaks volumes about our fucked up relationship with sex .
Illustrating this , Caroline H. pointed me to a June 2009 Playboy slideshow of politically conservative women that readers want to “ hate fuck . ”
After protests , Playboy took the slideshow down , but RedState captured screen shots .
You can see them all here .
I post a selection below .

INCREDIBLE CREATURES III
$ 22.95
The Incredible Creatures That Defy Evolution Series enters the fascinating world of animals to reveal sophisticated and complex designs that shake the traditional foundations of evolutionary theory .
This series features Dr. Jobe Martin , who for the past 20 years , has been exploring evolution vs. creation .
His findings have been fascinating students around the world as he lectures on these remarkable animal designs that cannot be explained by traditional evolution .
Dr. Martin himself was a traditional evolutionist , but his medical and scientific training would go through an evolution , rather a revolution when he began to study animals that challenged the scientific assumptions of his education .
This was the beginning of the evolution of a creationist .

WASHINGTON  The American - led mission in Afghanistan is all but abandoning efforts to destroy the poppy crops that provide the largest source of income to the insurgency , and instead will take significant steps to wean local farmers off the drug trade  including one proposal to pay them to grow nothing .
The strategy will shift from wiping out opium poppy crops , which senior officials acknowledged had served only to turn poor farmers into enemies of the central government in Kabul .
New operations are already being mounted to attack not the crops , but the drug runners and the drug lords aligned with the insurgency .
Ultimately , farmers must be persuaded to plant other crops , including wheat for domestic consumption and pomegranates and flowers for export , officials said .
Michael G. Vickers , the Pentagon ’s top civilian official for counter - insurgency strategy , said Thursday that the specifics of the new antidrug effort still needed to be worked out , but that a decision had been reached on the new focus .
Hey , guess what !!
Monday brings the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing !!
Oh , you heard ?
Well , get ready to hear more -- this weekend and Monday will no doubt be a " One small step for man " marathon .
Which is fine -- the moon mission was a crazy , awe - inspiring thing that could have gone wrong a million ways but did n't .
Even though the Apollo program cost about a trillion dollars in today 's money , it did give us Tang .
And it also gave us our five favorite myths about Apollo 11 .
1 ) It never happened at all .
The internet was designed for crazy conspiracy schemes , and the moon landing is the subject of one of the weirdest .
It was all staged in a studio , according to earnest idiots and the producers of the terrible film Capricorn One .
( The movie involved a faked Mars landing , but everyone got the point . )
Evidence that it was a hoax ranges from allegedly odd shadows ( NASA apparently could n't hire competent lighting directors for their fake setting ) , the fact that no stars are seen in the moon photos , and even that the the footprints should have faded , as if they were on a sandy beach .
Mythbusters , among many others , have exploded -- nay , busted -- these myths .
2) " Houston " was not the first word said on the moon .
This one hits home , obviously , because for some reason Houstonians keep telling outsiders this , we guess in the expectation that those outsiders will drop their jaws and say " Good Lord , you 're right !!
My entire image of Houston is now completely changed !
It 's not a pollution - riddled swamp , it 's a world - class city ! ! "
This myth comes from a dispute on just when the Eagle can be described as being " on the moon . "
Was it when it had comfortably settled ?
Was it when a bit of wire made contact with the surface , warning the astronauts they were close ?
Depending on which of several interpretations you choose , the first words on the moon can be such inspiring prose as " Engine arm is off " or " Descent Engine Command Override , Off . "
Ready - made for Bartlett 's Book of Quotations .
3 . The astronauts might bring back all kinds of space diseases with them .
After living in incredibly cramped conditions for a week or so , the Apollo 11 astronauts splashed down , got on board the USS Hornet .... and immediately were packed away in a cramped quarantine chamber .
It was a converted Airstream trailer and they stayed there until the ship reached port ; they were then kept in somewhat looser quarantine until 21 days had passed from splashdown .
" No one knows what diseases might be on the moon ; leprosy may be one of those diseases , " CBS 's Walter Cronkite solemnly reported , according to Squint : My Journey With Leprosy , an autobiography by a leper .
( All the patients in his ward were shocked and disappointed at hearing the words . )
Leprosy on the moon ?
Apparently not .
4. Richard Nixon , president at the time , cared deeply about the moon landing .
Well , he probably did -- it was great publicity for him , after all -- but it was n't all he was thinking about that day .
" You know , this is quite a day on another front , too , " he said when his speechwriter William Safire called to congratulate him on his public comments .
What else could have been occupying Nixon 's mind ?
Vietnam ?
Opening up relations with China ?
No .
That day Teddy Kennedy had made sure " Chappaquiddick " would be a name long remembered .
" It ''s be hard to hush this one up , " Nixon told Safire .
" Too many reporters want to win a Pulitzer Prize . "
Oh , and man walked on the friggin ' moon today .
5 . Our favorite : Neil Armstrong made a blow - job related comment on the moon .
" This one 's for you , Mr. Jablonski , " he supposedly said , before NASA erased it off the tapes .
( The name involved changes according to the storyteller . )
Allegedly young Neil was walking past a neighbor 's open bedroom window when he heard Mrs. Jablonski ( or whomever ) say " Oral sex !!
you want oral sex ?
Yeah , when man walks on the moon . "
( Sometimes " Yeah , when the kid next door walks on the moon . " )
Alas , it never happened .
Armstrong 's words , that is .
We 're not sure how Mr. Jablonski fared .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
An American missile hit the Mehsud tribal region of South Waziristan on Tuesday , killing at least 10 people in the same area where the leader of the Pakistani Taliban was apparently killed in a drone attack last week , Pakistani security officials said .
The missile struck near the town of Kani Gurram , one of the largest in the area , which is home to the Pakistani Taliban movement .
American and Pakistani security officials say they believe the leader of the movement , Baitullah Mehsud , was killed in a drone strike by the C.I.A. last Wednesday .
The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters .
Details of the strike on Tuesday were unclear .
Reuters reported that the missile had apparently hit a house that was being used by the Taliban , but it was not clear if the attack killed any Taliban commanders .
Many of them have reportedly gathered in the area in order to choose Mr. Mehsud ’s successor .

In this first part of the “ Up the Moo Herd : MooTools Tips and Tricks “ series , we ’re going to talk about the fetcher functions and methods .
These are the most used functions and methods in MooTools , and mastering them is essential for controlling the DOM .
Again , let me remind you that this is not an introductory tutorial .
I wo n’t go over the basics for this series , so make sure you know the basics so you wo n’t get lost .
There ’s a list of resources available for beginners from the earlier blog post , so be sure to check them out .
And with that , we start going up the herd .
The Dollar Function
Most people think that doing this in native Javascript :
var myElement = document .
getElementById ( ' myElement ' ) ; var link = myElement .
get ( ' href ' ) ;
is just the same as doing this in MooTools :
var myElement = $ ( ' myElement ' ) ; var link = myElement .
get ( ' href ' ) ;
Zing !
Try the first and you ’ll probably get an error ( something like myElement .
get is not a function ) .
That ’s because aside from fetching the particular element from the DOM tree , the dollar function also extends the element , which means it adds additional useful methods to the Element–all of which are documented in here .
The dollar function also allows you to pass a native HTMLElement object instead of the id string .
If you do this , MooTools will no longer search for the element in the DOM , but it will still extend your object so you can use all the nifty methods .
// this will return an Option object ( a native HTMLElement object ) .
var myOption = new Option ( ) ; // returns undefined because native HTMLElements do n't have a get method .
console .
log ( typeof ( myOption . get ) ) ; //
Pass the original myOption object to $ ( ) to extend it .
myOption = $ ( myOption ) ; // outputs ' function ' -- hooray extension !
console .
log ( typeof ( myOption . get ) ) ;
If the dollar function is passed an element that ’s already extended , it simply returns the element .
This is very useful when it comes to creating custom classes where you allow users to pass either a string id or an actual element object .
var Item = new Class ( { initialize : function ( element ) { this .
element = $ ( element ) ; } } ) ; //
Now you can do : var myItem = new Item ( ' myItemElement ' ) ; // or .. var myItemElement = $ ( ' myItemElement ' ) ; var myItem = new Item ( myItemElement ) ;
Another thing to remember is that the dollar function is a do or die function : if it finds an element , it will return the element ; if it does n’t , it returns null .
This is the most common culprit for the element .
XXX is not a function error because you ’re trying to call a method to something that ’s actually null .
So be sure you ’re passing the correct id or the correct object to the dollar function before calling any Element method .
Safe - Dollar Since version 1.2.3 , a “ safe - dollar ” mode was implemented that allowed interoperability between MooTools and other non-prototype extending libraries .
The full details of this new feature is documented here , but the gist is this : the old dollar function , $ ( ) , has been renamed to document .id ( ) .
During loading , MooTools checks if there ’s already a $ ( ) function available : if it does n’t find one , it declares that the $ ( ) function be used as an alternative syntax to document.id ( ) .
But if it does find a separate $ ( ) function , it does n’t overwrite it .
What does this mean to you ?
Well , it just means that there might be some cases where your scripts might not work because you ’re using the dollar function of another library .
Ouch !
But to make life easier , here are some simple guidelines :
If you ’re sure that you wo n’t be using any other library aside from MooTools , then it ’s safe to use $ ( ) .
If you ’re not sure whether there will be other libraries loaded and you want to be safe , use document.id ( ) ( or use a closure ; details for that are found in the link above ) .
If you ’re writing a script that you ’ll be releasing publicly and you do n’t know whether the users will use other libraries aside from MooTools , use document.id ( )
( This should be a standard for all MooTools plugins , by the way ) .
If you want to force the $ ( ) function to be equivalent to document .id ( ) no matter what libraries may be loaded , put $ = document .id ; at the start of all your scripts .
The Double Dollar
If the dollar function returns a single element , the double - dollar function , or $ $ ( ) , returns as many elements as it can .
Colloquially , we say that the double - dollar function returns an “ array of elements ” , but the proper term is that it returns an Element Collection .
What ’s the difference between an array of elements and an Element Collection ?
var arrayOfElements = [ $ ( 'elA ' ) , $ ( 'elB ' ) , $ ( 'elC ' ) ] ; // array of elements var elementCollection = $ $ ( ' #elA , #elB , #elC ' ) ; // element collection console .
log ( typeof ( arrayOfElements . add Event ) ) ; // undefined console .
log ( typeof ( elementCollection . add Event ) ) ; // function
The difference is that an Element Collection , aside from having the normal array methods , also has all the Element methods .
So anything you can do to an element fetched via $ ( ) , you can do to all the elements inside an Element Collection fetched by $ $ ( ) .
This little feature is overlooked by many , so they tend to write code like this :
$ $ ( '.button ' ) . each ( function ( button ) { button .
addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( ) { console .
log ( ' Hey there ! ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
when they could just have done it like so :
$ $ ( '.button ' ) . addEvent ( ' click ' , function ( ) { console .
log ( ' Hey there ! ' ) ; } ) ;
Because an Element Collection returned by $ $ ( ) already has all the Element methods , there ’s no need to iterate over all items in the collection and apply an Element method , because that ’s already available for the collection as a whole .
With Element Collections , methods that return something will return an array of somethings :
$ ( ' myInput ' ) . get ( ' name ' ) ; // returns ' firstname ' , but .. $ $ ( ' input ' ) . get ( ' name ' ) ; // returns [ ' firstname ' , ' email ' , ' comment ' ] ;
The double - dollar method always returns an Element Collection–even if there were no elements found .
This is a common error for many , which makes them scratch their heads when something like this happens :
var myItems = $ $ ( ' xx x ' ) ; // returns [ ] if ( myItems ) { // will always be true because an empty // Element Collection , like an empty array , is a truthy value .
}
What you want to do is check the length member of a collection to check whether it really has elements :
var myItems = $ $ ( ' xx x ' ) ; // returns [ ] if ( myItems .
length > 0 ) { // Problem solved . }
Another source of confusion is what actually do you pass as an argument to the double - dollar function ?
The short answer is a CSS Selector .
While this is clear enough for most people , some fail to see that CSS Selectors are n’t limited to ids , classes and tags .
For example , take a look at this code :
$ $ ( '.items ' ) . each ( function ( item ) { if ( item .
get ( ' name ' ) == ' orange ' ) { if ( item .
get ( ' checked ' ) == ' checked ' ) { item .
highlight ( ) ; } else { item . destroy ( ) ; } } } ) ;
Sure , that will work , but it does n’t use the full power of selectors .
Taking that code and simplifying it , you may end up with something like this :
$ $ ( '.items [name= " orange " ] [ checked =" checked " ] ' ) . highlight ( ) ; $ $ ( '.items [ name = " orange " ] [ checked ! =" checked " ] ' ) . destroy ( ) ;
The double - dollar function makes it easier to fetch items from the DOM by allowing you to use complex selectors .
Which is why it pays to know your CSS selectors !
There are many good resources for learning about CSS Selectors ( let me google that for you ) , and the MooTools - Core documentation for Selectors also lists some other pointers regarding them .
By the way , the code above could further be optimized for performance :
var items = $ $ ( '.items ' ) ; items .
filter ( ' [ name = " orange " ] [ checked =" checked " ] ' ) . highlight ( ) ; items .
filter ( ' [ name = " orange " ] [ checked ! =" checked " ] ' ) . destroy ( ) ;
Safe Double - Dollar ?
With regards to the new safe - dollar mode , you do n’t have to worry about $ ( ) getting overwritten , because MooTools still retains this function , even if safe - dollar mode is turned on .
Segue : querySelector and querySelectorAll
Sidenote : now that the querySelector and querySelectorAll methods are available in the latest versions of all the major browsers ( albeit implemented differently in some of them ) , you might be wondering how to deal with them .
With the old getElementById , you could simply do something like this to extend an element :
var myElement = document .
getElementById ( ' myElement ' ) ; var myExtendedElement = $ ( my Element ) ;
But how about these new methods ?
The good news is that you can do something similar with them :
var myElement = document .
querySelector ( ' # myElement ' ) ; var myExtendedElement = $ ( myElement ) ; var myCollection = document .
querySelectorAll ( ' a.withClass ' ) ; var myExtendedCollection = $ $ ( myCollection ) ;
So if you ever find yourself in a situation where you want to use the Element methods for items fetched via these new methods , remember that you could simply extend them using the good - ole dollar and double - dollar functions .
Other Fetchers
Finally we have to talk about the other fetcher methods available : getElement and getElements .
These methods are available to any Element object and are useful for fetching elements within those elements using CSS selectors .
Sounds confusing ?
Do n’t fret .
They ’re really simple methods to filter out the contents of your elements :
// fetches a div with the id main .
var myElement = $ ( ' main ' ) ; // fetches the first anchor inside #main with a .yes class var linkWithinMain = $ ( ' main ' ) .
getElement ( ' a.yes ' ) ; // fetches all anchors inside #main .
var allLinksWithinMain = $ ( ' main ' ) . getElements ( 'a ' ) ;
Why Would I Want to Do That ?
People might suggest that instead of doing that , just use a complex selector with the double - dollar function .
Yes , you could always do this instead of the code above : var firstLink = $ ( ' # main a.yes ' ) [ 0 ] ; var all Links = $ ( ' # main a ' ) ;
But for performance reasons , it is advised that you fetch the parent element first via $ ( ) and then fetch the child elements via getElement or getElements .
For simple things , this might go unnoticed , but if speed is a concern , do use the $ (… ).getElements (… ) style .
And lastly , there ’s a filter method available to an Element Collection , which was used in an example above .
It also accepts a CSS selector for its argument and it returns a new collection containing all items from the original collection that matches that selector .
// Fetch all links on the page .. var all Links = $ $ ( ' a ' ) ; //
Filter the collection : return only links with an .outgoing class .. var linksClassedOutgoing = all Links . filter ( '.outgoing ' ) ;
Go Fetch

Poachers in Africa and Asia are killing rhinos at an alarming rate to meet the demand for rhino horns .
From Ecoworldly , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Poachers in Africa and Asia are killing rhinos at an alarming rate to meet the demand for rhino horns , which are believed to have medicinal value in some countries .
According to new research , the level of rhino poaching is about to hit a 15 year high , and is " the worst rhino poaching we have seen in many years . "
An estimated two to three rhinos are illegally killed each week in some areas , with the Democratic Repuclic of Congo , South Africa , and Zimbabwe seeing the worst of it .
From 2000 to 2005 , only about three rhinos were killed each month in Africa , so the increase is a serious threat to the population ( estimated at only 18,000 in all of Africa ) .
Rhino poaching in Asia is also on the rise .
At least 10 rhinos have been killed in India since January , and seven in Tibet , out of a total population of about 2400 combined .
The new report , Status , Conservation , and Trade in African and Asian Rhinoceroses ( PDF ) , published by TRAFFIC , WWF , and IUCN , calls the situation " bleak " .
The report was presented by the WWF , IUCN , and TRAFFIC to the 58th meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Standing Committee this week in Geneva , and suggested that local governments needed " an accurate and up - to - date picture of the status , conservation and trade in African and Asian rhinoceroses … so that firm international action can be taken to arrest this immediate threat to rhinoceros populations worldwide . "
Here 's what the report 's authors said :
Dr. Susan Lieberman , WWF Director of the Species Program :
Rhinos are in a desperate situation
Steven Broad , Executive Director of TRAFFIC :
Increased demand for rhino horn , alongside a lack of law enforcement , a low level of prosecutions for poachers who are actually arrested and increasingly daring attempts by poachers and thieves to obtain the horn is proving to be too much for rhinos and some populations are seriously declining
WWF :
Illegal rhino horn trade to destinations in Asia is driving the killing , with growing evidence of involvement of Vietnamese , Chinese and Thai nationals in the illegal procurement and transport of rhino horn out of Africa

Police in north - western Pakistan say several hundred students are missing in a tribal area near the Afghan border .
Unconfirmed reports from the Taliban stronghold of North Waziristan say the students , teachers and relatives may have been kidnapped by militants .
Further north , troops are tightening their hold on Mingora , the main town in the Swat valley , after retaking it from the Taliban at the weekend .
In the town of Kohat , a blast at a bus terminal killed at least two people .
Attack fears Reports say a convoy of about 30 minibuses carrying the students left Razmak Cadet College in North Waziristan bound for the town of Bannu .
Only two minibuses turned up , police say .
" Two vehicles carrying some 25 students reached Bannu , we are investigating about other students , " local police chief Iqbal Marwat told the AFP news agency .
According to witnesses who escaped the convoy was stopped by a group of heavily armed men .
Police officials quote these witnesses as saying a large number of people have been kidnapped , although there are conflicting reports about how many .
There has been a rise in violent incidents in recent days in the tribal areas next to the Afghan border .
The BBC's Chris Morris in Islamabad says officials believe militants are trying to divert attention away from a major military offensive in the Swat valley .
Fears of attacks by militants have increased after a military offensive against the Taliban in parts of the north - west .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The militants said they had carried out a massive bombing in the city of Lahore last week and have threatened more attacks .
Pakistani troops are still fighting against Taliban militants in the Swat valley , pushing northwards from Mingora , which is now under full government control .
The authorities say more than 1,200 militants and about 90 soldiers have been killed since their offensive began in a neighbouring district nearly six weeks ago .
There has been no official word about civilian casualties , and no independent confirmation of the military 's claims .
An estimated 2.5 million people have fled from the fighting , but tens of thousands who were trapped in their homes are in even greater need of assistance .
' Retaliation '
The blast which killed two in Kohat , an important garrison town in North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) , injured at least eight others , officials say .
Police say a bomb went off in a crowded bus terminal on Monday afternoon .
Kohat police chief Mohammad Idrees said the attack could be retaliation for police operations against the militants , the Associated Press reported .
Taliban militants were driven out of Mingora , Swat 's main town , on Saturday by Pakistani government troops .
Officials said operations in the whole Swat valley region should end in the next few days , although military chiefs are more cautious

This summer , among all the anonymous blockbusters , remakes and sequels filling the multiplexes , only one American movie will open on the strength of its director – Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds .
Yet even as Tarantino continues to be feted – first at Cannes and soon in cinemas across the world – there 's a creeping , worrisome sense that a dearth of young American directors have the necessary clout to open a movie .
At this year 's Tribeca film festival in New York , it was the endlessly prolific Woody Allen , Steven Soderbergh and Spike Lee who made the headlines as they each unveiled yet another film .
Not one director was being pushed as their natural successor .
It 's now been well over a decade since Tarantino became the last American director to be celebrated as an auteur , a director whose films had to be watched no matter what they were about or who was in them .
Since the release of Pulp Fiction in 1994 , several American directors have threatened to become box - office stars after the manner of Martin Scorsese , Woody Allen or Steven Spielberg , but while Paul Thomas Anderson ( There Will be Blood ) , Sofia Coppola ( Lost in Translation ) and Wes Anderson ( The Royal Tenenbaums ) have received plaudits ( and occasional brickbats ) , none are household names , and none command guaranteed box - office .
At a time when talking robots and student wizards dominate the screens , it 's apparent that directors , or more specifically auteurs , are becoming increasingly irrelevant when choices are made about which film audiences want to see .
Studios have become more adept at marketing franchises ( think of all the endless superheroes and High School Musicals ) , or rebooting old television shows and movies in a way that has ensured that the director of the films goes pretty much unnoticed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
That Sam Raimi directed the Spider - Man films was no doubt news to most of the audience who went to see the trilogy .
The Harry Potter films are further proof of the irrelevance of the director : the vast success of the franchise meant the producers were happy ditching the " names " – Chris Columbus for the first two , followed by Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell – who directed the first four films in favour of a British TV director , David Yates , whose biggest hit so far has been the BBC drama series State of Play .
And how many fans went to see the blockbusting Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen last month because Michael Bay was at the helm ?
Furthermore , super - producers such as Jerry Bruckheimer and Harvey Weinstein are now more famous than most of the directors who make the films they back .
Now that Will Smith is the only actor that can guarantee box - office , special effects and comic - book characters have become the real attraction .
The power of a director to pull in audiences has become almost non-existent .
The auteur is a dying breed .
François Truffaut coined the term " auteur " in his 1954 essay , " A Certain Tendency in Cinema " .
Up until that moment , the director had been seen largely as a hired hand needed only to chivvy along the actors when they appeared on set .
Truffaut and the American critic Andrew Sarris were the first to point out that directors such as Alfred Hitchcock , Nicholas Ray , Douglas Sirk and John Ford had their own inimitable style , which in turn gave their movies a unique signature .
Suddenly , it was the director rather than the producer , the studio or the lead actor who became the star .
Cinema movements such as the French New Wave in the Sixties , the New Hollywood movement of the Seventies and the Danish Dogme95 manifesto in the Nineties were all focused on the primacy of the directors making the movies – despite the latter 's no-credit rule – rather than the actors who starred in them .
Films directed by Truffaut himself , Jean - Luc Godard , Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola became must - see events .
At its height , the draw of the auteur was such that films by the Italian modernist Michelangelo Antonioni would regularly appear in the top 25 box - office hits of the year .
The right director 's name on a poster was enough to sell tickets and what the directors would do next was something to be genuinely excited about .
Now barely any film is sold on the director 's name alone .
American directors , in particular , became the biggest names in cinema .
A new Stanley Kubrick was a must - see event .
New Hollywood cinema made stars out of Robert Altman and Hal Ashby , while Terrence Malick became world famous on the back of just two movies , Badlands and Days of Heaven .
Every genre was creating directing superstars : horror had John Carpenter and George A Romero ; Sam Peckinpah 's riffs on the Western and ultra-violence gained him a sizeable fan club ; John Waters was adored for his ability to run roughshod over taboos ; Spielberg became the king of the blockbuster ; David Lynch created fantastical dramas in his own unique style ; and David Mamet transferred his theatrical wisdom to the silver screen .
Elsewhere , John Cassavetes and Woody Allen 's brand of low - budget , quick - turnover film - making predated the American independent movement of the Eighties .
The B - movie king was Roger Corman , who directed and produced films with a signature style that ensured that even when he was producing it would be his name , rather than that of the director , which would define and sell the movie .
Coppola , Scorsese , Peter Bogdanovich , Jonathan Demme , John Sayles and James Cameron all worked for the producer in one capacity or another as they kick - started their careers .
He was proof that in exceptional circumstances , writers or producers could earn the auteur accolade .
As Hollywood films became more event - orientated , auteurs found their voices making inexpensive films with an edgy sensibility .
American indie cinema launched the careers of Jim Jarmusch , Spike Lee , Richard Linklater , Steven Soderbergh , Todd Haynes , Todd Solondz , the Coen brothers and Kevin Smith .
Throw in the fantastical work of Tim Burton , the visual panache of Michael Mann , the masculine madness of Oliver Stone and the comedy horror of Sam Raimi , and it seemed that there was an American auteur coming out of every nook and cranny .
In the Nineties , following the success of Miramax , many studios opened up specialist divisions to cultivate and nurture American independent films and film - makers .
In the past three years , every major studio has announced job losses or the closure of these speciality divisions .
In the same period Woody Allen and Spike Lee have had to go to Europe to secure funding .
Tarantino is the last of these directors – and possibly the only American director working today – who can open a movie on name alone .
Even his cachet has dropped a little with the failure of Grindhouse ; no wonder Brad Pitt has been drafted in to get Inglourious Basterds off the ground .
It 's a back - up strategy that Scorsese has been using ever since he helped to establish Robert De Niro as box - office dynamite .
More recently , Scorsese has called on Daniel Day - Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio to get bums on seats .
In the same way , Michael Mann cast Tom Cruise in Collateral and now Johnny Depp in Public Enemies , and when he adapted Miami Vice for the big screen , the Oscar - winning Jamie Foxx was called up to support Colin Farrell .
It 's a clear sign that across the industry , no studio believes that a director alone can open a movie .
Producers are increasingly hedging their bets to minimise their exposure to risk and unsustainable financial losses .
And even using a star is no longer a guarantee of success .
Last Friday , three days before shooting was supposed to commence , the head of Sony , Amy Pascal announced that she was pulling the plug on Moneyball , a Steven Soderbergh baseball movie starring Brad Pitt .
Pascal felt that the final script was far too artistic to take a $ 57 million risk on in the current economic climate .
The New York Times reports that $ 10 million had already been spent on pre-production .
Only David Fincher , following Se7en and the post - cinema DVD success of Fight Club , has come close to matching Tarantino .
Yet when Zodiac was released in 2007 and marketed around the director 's reputation , the thriller was a commercial failure .
He has also shied away from the fast - cut MTV - style editing that was once his signature especially in his last film , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button .
Of the newer talents , Paul Thomas Anderson , seen by many as heir to Altman , and Wes Anderson , the quirky director of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited , have both been put forward as modern - day auteurs .
Although both of these film - makers can happily lay claim to a signature style , neither director has shown the requisite personality to become a star in their own right .
Sofia Coppola has the benefit of the family name ( though her father , Francis , is on a woeful run of form ) but while her first efforts , The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation , were breathlessly received , Marie Antoinette was a flop .
Spike Jonze , her ex-husband , was once a bright young hope but he has not managed to translate his success in commercial and music videos into a fully realised film career .
Expectation around his next film ,
Where the Wild Things Are , an adaptation of Maurice Sendak 's children 's classic , has been lowered by rumours of production problems and re-cuts .
The studio , Warner Brothers , flexed their muscles and Jonze , it seems , has backed down .
Gone are the days when Michael Cimino could hold a studio to ransom .
Charlie Kaufman , who is unusual in that he is a screenwriter who has attained auteur status , wrote Spike Jonze 's previous films , including Being John Malkovich , as well as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for Michel Gondry .
But the following and acclaim he had built up as a screenwriter counted for nothing as his debut in the director 's chair , Synecdoche , New York , flopped at the box office .
Audiences are less willing to indulge directors when they fall below par .
Among all the almosts and not -quites , the one person who can claim to have truly bucked this recent trend is Judd Apatow , who has carefully and quietly built up a loyal audience for his signature comedies .
The director of The 40 - Year - Old Virgin and Knocked Up has done so by producing comedies with a masculine slant and by developing his own stars , who include Seth Rogen and Steve Carell .
This summer sees the release of his new film , Funny People , starring Adam Sandler .
Set in the world of stand - up comics , it promises to offer something different from his usual formula .
It 's unusual for a comedy director to gain auteur status but it's a sign of the times that Apatow has done so .
These days , the most important figures for Hollywood studios are the opening - weekend box - office returns .
Cinemas have grown incredibly ruthless at culling movies that do n't perform well ; the time when a film could slowly but surely find its audience is long gone .
Word - of - mouth and critical acclaim has little chance against the relentless might of the biggest studios ' huge marketing budgets .
As a result , American independent films have been largely relegated to the film festival circuit .
Yet even on the festival circuit American auteurs seem to be struggling .
At Cannes , much was made of the fact that the competition this year was dominated by the world 's biggest auteurs , figures such as Michael Haneke , Lars von Trier and Jacques Audiard .
The only American - born film - maker in competition was previous Palme d'Or winner Tarantino .
James Gray , the director of Two Lovers and We Own the Night , was on the jury this year : he is a typical case of an American film - maker lauded in France – his work always screens at Cannes – and yet ignored and unknown in his home country .
There is simply less interest now in what a director has to say about his work .
When it comes to talk shows in the States , it 's the stars in front of the camera that the hosts want to talk to .
The personality has become king .
It 's the triumph of beauty over brain .
The change in attitude to directors in America has also come about at the same time as the YouTube explosion .
The public are now looking to their computer screens to find alternative voices and unique stories .
Film - makers have as yet not found a way to exploit the medium in the same way as musicians and writers .
There has been no directing equivalent of The Arctic Monkeys .
Finding a way of making money online is the Holy Grail of independent film distribution .
Making money full - stop is a problem for auteurs .
Once upon a time , the Sundance festival would be the occasion of several multi-million dollar deals every January .
No longer .
The market for American independent films has collapsed , and gathering funds to get movies off the ground has become increasingly difficult for directors with unique voices to share .
Financiers have lost faith that they 'll get a return on their investment : with the prospect of making money all but diminished , they 're unwilling to take a punt on nurturing break - out talents .
A success on the festival circui is no longer an indicator of commercial success .
This year , Lynn Shelton 's Humpday , about two straight men who decide to make a porno with each other as a dare , and the brothers Ben and Joshua Safdie 's Go Get Some Rosemary , an amusing , New York broken - family tale , were the break - out , word - of - mouth successes , lauded by critics , tipped by hacks and industry insiders .
Humpday was made as part of the burgeoning " mumblecore " movement , in which directors make their work on digital cameras for super - low budgets as a reaction against genre movies or blockbusters .
Yet despite these directors being young and attractive , and having new stories to tell , they seem destined to remain in a niche .
Respect for their voices has diminished , and the auteur as an all - powerful figure in American cinema is on the way to becoming the stuff of legend .
Now , once again , it 's the studios rather than directors who are calling the shots .
Pictures of promise : 10 young American moviemakers to watch
Lynn Shelton
The Seattle - based director is a leading exponent from the mumblecore , movement , a group of film - makers who make tiny - budget movies that focus on personal relationships .
Her third film , Humpday , about two male friends who decide to make a porn film after a dare on a drunken night out , won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance .
The 37 - year - old also writes , edits and acts .
Ben and Joshua Safdie
Go Get Some Rosemary is the first film that the Safdie brothers , Ben ( 27 ) and Joshua ( 25 ) , do not appear in themselves , though it is an autobiographical tale about two young boys trying to cope with their parents ' divorce .
Joshua , also a successful stand - up comedian , features in several of their films , including the award - winning The Pleasure of Being Robbed , which is about a quirky young kleptomaniac called Eléonore making her way around New York , stealing grapes , cars and kittens along the way .
Ryan Fleck
Raised in California , Fleck moved to Brooklyn following his graduation from NYU .
His critically acclaimed debut feature , Half Nelson , about a crack - addicted teacher going off the rails , earned its star , Ryan Gosling , an Oscar nomination .
Fleck , who works with his long - term partner , producer - director Anna Boden , followed its success with the baseball drama Sugar , about a rookie player from the Dominican Republic trying to make it in the big league .
Emily Abt
Abt came to prominence with her documentary Take it from Me in 2001 .
Her work , including 2008 's
All of Us , about the high number of black women in the South Bronx with HIV / Aids , examines social issues .
Her fictional feature debut , Toe to Toe , focuses on a young black high - school student embarrassed by her poor background after she wins a scholarship to a prep school .
Miranda July
The 35 - year - old artist Miranda July ( main picture , above ) picked up awards from Cannes to Sundance for her critically - acclaimed debut , Me and You and Everyone We Know .
A writer , director , musician and actress , she 's appeared in videos for bands , written books and curated exhibitions .
Her visually - playful style gave Me and You a unique look .
She 's working on her second feature , Satisfaction , in which she stars .
Ramin Bahrani
The eminent critic Roger Ebert declared Ramin Bahrani " the new great American film director " on the strength of the 34 - year - old 's films about the downside of the American dream : Man Push Cart , about a Pakistani rock star who is frustrated in his work as a New York coffee vendor ; Chop Shop , set in Queens ' Latino community ; and Goodbye Solo , which focuses on a Senegalese cab driver 's relationship with a white Southerner in North Carolina .
David Gordon Green
Martin Scorsese often says that he needs to make one for the studio and one for himself .
Still , it was something of a surprise when David Gordon Green , the cerebral 34 - year - old director of George Washington and Undertow , agreed to helm Pineapple Express , Judd Apatow 's 2008 stoner comedy starring Seth Rogen .
In doing so , though , he defied pigeonholing and proved that he 's every bit as comfortable grappling with big - budget genre comedies as he is making movies set in depressed small - town America .
Barry Jenkins
His compelling 2008 debut , Medicine for Melancholy , a love story set in the 24 hours after a one - night - stand , had hints of Richard Linklater 's Before Sunrise and Spike Lee 's She 's Gotta Have
It about it .
The San Francisco - based film - maker , originally from Miami , is now hotly tipped as a director to watch out for .
Alex Holdridge
Born in the South 's film - making mecca of Austin , Texas , the 34 - year - old Alex Holdridge had to wait until his third offering , In Search of a Midnight Kiss , a quirky black - and - white romance set in LA , before he was embraced outside of the festival circuit .
Holdridge spent four years working on his debut film , Wrong Numbers , released in 2001 , and followed it with another low - budget feature , Sexless , after he struggling to finance a big - budget remake of Wrong Numbers .
He now lives in LA .
Matt Bissonnette
Almost American : born in Toronto , Bissonnette now lives and makes movies out of his adopted home in Los Angeles .
His latest offering , Passenger Side ( which stars his brother Joel ) , a black comedy featuring two siblings on a road trip in LA , confirms the promise of his two previous efforts , Looking for Leonard and Who Loves the Sun .
While his first works were compared to early Hal Hartley , his most recent effort was likened to a highbrow Judd Apatow movie following its generally well - received premiere at the LA Film Festival last month .
In 2001 , Dr. Jason Sorens began trying to collect enough pro-liberty voters and activists in one low - population state that their sheer critical mass would ultimately tip the scales back toward a limited , constitutional government .
Or one charged solely with the protection of life , liberty , and property .
Like many others in the movement , Dr. Sorens believes that most pro-liberty types share the same desires for limited government , free markets , and public choice , but are often so geographically diverse that they remain wholly unrepresented in national elections .
If physically concentrated , the theory goes , those individuals ' common passion for freedom and their mutual distrust of government control could become a driving force in local and state politics .
A geographic coalition of liberty - focused leaders could then form the thin edge of a powerful political wedge with which to ultimately pry the hands of the federal government from the economic and personal freedom of its citizens .
Now based in New Hampshire , the Free State Project ( FSP ) recruits pro-liberty individuals ( regardless of political party affiliation or label ) from across the country to help restore the balance of power between citizens and their government .
However , despite the project 's relatively simple premise , its implementation to date has proven rather challenging .
After quickly topping 5,000 participants in the first two years , New Hampshire was selected as the project 's destination via online ballot in 2003 , and the FSP hoped to crest its target of 20,000 members by the end of 2006 .
The project currently stands at just over 9,000 signers and collects an average of about twenty additional members per month .
On its face , that math is not particularly encouraging , leading some in the liberty movement to proclaim Dr. Sorens ' experiment failed .
But for thousands of “ Free Staters ” ( or “ Porcupines ” ) the “ Second American Revolution ” is just beginning .
Since its physical destination was chosen six years ago , the Free State Project has evolved from a glorified web forum into a bona fide political movement .
Though initially the project called for relocation only after the target of 20,000 participants had been reached , over 700 members have now migrated to or were already living in New Hampshire .
Every month , more of these “ early movers , ” impatient for action and greater freedom , are journeying to the “ Live Free or Die ” state in pursuit of what they believe is the last best hope for “ liberty in our lifetime . ”
The Gold Standard
Once the early movers arrive , the official FSP has virtually no involvement in members ' day - to - day political activities .
“ I tell people to think of the project like a bus , ” said Board president , Varrin Swearingen .
“ We 'll bring you to the border and drop you off .
After that , you 're on your own . ”
Or , more accurately , after that you are plugged in by other movers to an extensive network of savvy , enthusiastic , like - minded peers .
From help with housing and employment to grassroots activist training , significant social and political infrastructure has already been built and is constantly being improved upon by successive waves of arriving Free Staters .
One major part of that system is a state - registered lobbying organization , the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance ( NHLA ) .
Formed in 2003 , NHLA representative , Denis Goddard , said that the Alliance has trained numerous pro-liberty activists in the basics of coalition building and campaigning to raise public awareness of issues and candidates .
Such tactics have long proven effective for pro-government organizers , but are too often ignored by the less - cohesive liberty movement .
Especially valuable are mock town hall meetings , hosted by the NHLA , which offer public speaking practice and critique for citizens who wish to appear in session before the state legislature .
“ It 's mind - blowing when people find out that they can do this , ” Goddard said .
“ Folks who have a gift for public speaking can do more to pare back government in this state than those who are actually elected in other places . ”
Every day during the legislative session , volunteers from the NHLA 's “ liberty lobby ” greet lawmakers at the door to the Statehouse with fresh copies of their signature publication , The Gold Standard .
Its printed sheets of yellow paper offer a liberty grade on every bill up for a vote that day .
Often , said Goddard , representatives pause to discuss and debate various points right on the spot .
Those interactions provide liberty lobbyists with a unique opportunity to challenge and refine legislators ' assumptions regarding their own jobs and the role of government in a free society .
To make sure they are actually learning , once a year the NHLA rates each rep individually based on his or her votes , using a scale of “ A ” through “ F . ”
The very worst earn a designation of “ CT ” or “ Constitutional Threat . ”
Of course , it usually takes more than handing out grades to get an elected official 's attention .
So to make sure they got the message , last year the NHLA distributed 30,000 copies of its legislative report cards in major newspapers across the state .
“ There 's nothing quite like a rep 's constituents calling [ them ] and saying ' Did you know the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance considers you a threat to the Constitution ? ' ” said Goddard .
“ Eventually , if they get enough harassing phone calls , they just quit , ” he laughed .
“ I love it when that happens . ”
Radical Incrementalism
Encouraged by the broad impact of the NHLA , other Free Staters have started their own lobbying organizations to focus on specific issues .
One of these is the New Hampshire Coalition for Common Sense Marijuana Policy , which was formed two years ago by a former English professor named Matt Simon .
In its first year , the Coalition successfully shepherded a marijuana decriminalization bill through the New Hampshire House , only to watch it die in the Senate following a rare veto threat from Democratic governor , John Lynch .
Drawing on the lessons from that bittersweet defeat , Simon shifted to medical marijuana advocacy , and this year the resulting bill has enjoyed wide support from activists and lawmakers in both houses .
In April , HB 648 quickly passed the House and Senate , giving desperately ill patients hope that Gov. Lynch will sign some version of it into law during 2009 .
Rejecting the temptation to be antagonistic , Simon proactively engages lobbyists , lawmakers , and local and state news outlets to offer information on the progress and particulars of marijuana policy legislation .
Juxtaposed against the confrontational tactics ( and limited success ) of some other Free Staters pushing for outright legalization , Simon offers a more moderate alternative .
Thirteen states already have resolutions legalizing the medical use of marijuana , and the difference , Simon said recently , is compassion .
For many people , the drug is their only source of relief from debilitating pain or the agonizing side effects of other treatments .
As Simon often tells reps , “ If we 're going to have a war over marijuana for another 5 , 10 , 20 , even 30 years , we need to take [ desperately ill patients ] off the battlefield . ”
By working diligently within the system , Simon has established credibility as a reliable media source and an issue expert , enabling him to effectively disseminate and control his message .
Such a strategy requires patience and dedication because it hinges on tactical persistence and gradual gains rather than the immediate pursuit of dramatic social or political change .
For decades , left wing , big government activists have employed such “ radical incrementalism ” to consolidate political power within their own constituencies , but Simon is effectively adapting the technique to advance the very different objectives of the liberty movement .
Still , using the political process to shrink government from the inside is arduous and imperfect .
According to Simon , there remains “ a whole swath [ of Free Staters ] who do n't believe in participation … at all . ”
But , he said , “ I hope that our kind of activism will demonstrate that it is effective and it is worth doing . ”
Allies in the Statehouse
The incremental gains are already adding up to some significant victories .
In 2006 , inspired by his fellow Porcupines ' pivotal role in a legislative defeat of the federal Real ID program , Joel Winters ran for state representative as a “ fiscally conservative ” Democrat and became the first Free Stater to win elected office .
Last November , in a demonstration of their growing political prowess , FSP activists helped reelect Winters and sent fellow ( Republican ) project members Jennifer Coffey , Carol McGuire , and Calvin Pratt to join him at the Statehouse in Concord .
Rep .
Winters has noted that despite a recent wave of anti-Republican sentiment in New Hampshire , there remains significant voter enthusiasm for the philosophy of minimal government .
In addition to the demonstrated success of the Free Staters ' “ small 'l ' libertarian ” platform , he said , “ Being against a [ statewide ] sales or income tax , is [ still ] very popular ” for any candidate .
However , Winters cautioned , “ Without the other Free Staters , I would n't have gotten elected . ”
And , like everything else in politics , loyalty has its price .
The vigorous effort put forth by Porcupines to elect their own means that candidates who do reach office have two constituencies , he said , “ Free State Project members and [ their ] actual district . ”
Winters did admit that just a few weeks into his second term he has already taken heat from some project members for occasionally voting along standard Democratic Party lines , in favor of a minimum wage increase and in support of some “ environmental protections . ”
But for the most part , he said , “ [ The Free Staters ] are very happy with the way I vote . ”
If it does n't stay that way , Winters and his colleagues will likely find themselves fighting for their seats against the very same people that helped elect them in the first place .
Blood Sport
The high proportion of representatives to residents means that the cost of challenging a seat in the New Hampshire Statehouse is relatively low , averaging just a few thousand dollars per candidate .
That plays to the advantage of the well - organized and highly motivated liberty activists .
As with any dedicated special interest group , it 's usually cheaper for lawmakers just to heed the concerns of project members than it is to fight off a well - funded primary challenge every cycle .
And the cost of disregarding Free Staters continues to rise .
During the 2008 election season , Chris Lawless , a Porcupine and Hopkinton town selectman , formed a political action committee with his friend and colleague , Jim Forsythe ; himself a passionate advocate of small government , though not officially a member of the FSP .
Lawless and Forsythe 's PAC raised $ 100,000 to support the state - level campaigns of project members and others willing to use their office to further the cause of individual liberty .
Speaking at the 2009 FSP - hosted Liberty Forum in Nashua , Forsythe drew enthusiastic applause when he told a group of home schooling parents about his intention to hang one meddlesome lawmaker 's “ pelt on the wall ” in an upcoming election .
Targeting specific officials for political retribution sends a clear warning to other legislators that those who try to limit freedoms risk negative electoral consequences .
“ The state [ Republican ]
Party knows what we 're doing , ” Lawless said with a grin .
“ We have a hit list …
If you screw us , we 're gonna take you out . ”
Considering what their movement is up against , both in New Hampshire and at the national level , it is hard to blame the Free Staters for treating politics like a blood sport ( albeit one that liberty has been losing for decades ) .
But through the Free State Project this passion has been organized and focused , suggesting a turn in the tide .
Already , Porcupine pioneers have made impressive and undeniable progress , but the gains are reversible and building on their momentum requires reinforcements .
Still , when asked about the likelihood of achieving their vision , Lawless was optimistic .
“ Give me [ just ] three hundred more Ron Paul Republicans , ” he said , “ and we will do amazing things in this state . ”
It sounds like Cash in the Attic meets the The Da Vinci Code .

Antiques dealer Martin Roberts suspected that the item being sold by a friend was worth a punt , and so he offered to swap it for a pine chest of drawers and six Victorian glass handles which he had bought for £ 13 and to hand back 10 per cent of the final sale price achieved .
The gamble now looks like it may pay off handsomely after the piece was identified as a possible tabernacle door belonging to the Knights Templar and dating back to the time of the Middle Ages .
Mr Roberts is hopeful that his latest find could match that of his most famous discovery – a 3,500 - year - old Egyptian artefact he found in a box full of silverware during a house clearance near Harrogate .
Having paid £ 50 for that lot he eventually sold the four - inch royal shabti torso of Amenophis III , the grandfather of King Tutankhamun , at auction for £ 30,000 when a British - based private bidder paid 12 times the reserve price .
The former professional golf player astonished experts who insisted on wearing gloves to examine his latest find when he told them that he had driven around for two weeks with the tabernacle on the dashboard of his van .
" When I touched it , it sent shivers through me , " he said yesterday .
It was initially checked out by a dealer in Doncaster who suggested the polychrome cartoon images could be of St George and the Dragon .
But he now believes it is more likely to be a Roman stabbing a Turk – a reference to the Crusades as well as a priest carrying a cross .
A second expert suggested that its origins could be traced back to the Orthodox Church between 700 and 1200 .
The door was found at Masham , North Yorkshire , close to Middleham Castle , the former home of Richard III which dates back to the time of the Norman Conquest .
One theory is that it may have fallen into the possession of one of the influential residents that inhabited the castle , known as the Windsor of the North .
" At the end of the day I go around and find things .
I buy from car boots and junk shops but I have never seen such a wonderful response as when people see this panel , " said Mr Roberts , who would not be drawn on how much it was worth .
" We are trying to find any historians that might know about it .
If it is significant I might want to put it on display in a museum .
If it is part of our heritage it must not sit in some collector ’s private display where no one can see it simply because he has got more carrots than anyone else , " he said .

Mr Roberts , who took up antiques dealing on eBay six years ago following the death of his wife from cancer , said he developed
an interest in the business through his father .
" My dad sat me down and said to me , ‘ Your brother is a roofer and your other brother is a steel erector – you are going to be an antiques dealer , ’ and he gave me a set of books , " he recalled .
" I do n’t always buy plums .
Sometimes I buy lemons and I have certainly bought plenty of them .
It is a real buzz .
The money is great but if you relied on the plums you would be starving , " he admitted .
Mr Roberts , who has also discovered a bronze Egyptian figure dating back to 600BC , admitted that his knowledge of the history of Templar period was sketchy .
" When it comes to the history I am on a Monty Python level .
The best description of the Knights Templar is in Spamalot – I ’ve seen that , " he said .
" You can drop on stuff but you have to know what you are looking for .
I have a wish list from customers who want me to find things for them . "
Mr Roberts added : " Maybe now we could sell the movie rights to this . "
We 've been pretty into Carnegie Mellon 's modular snake robots for a while now , and seeing as it's a relatively sleepy Sunday we thought we'd share this latest video of snakebots just basically crawling all over the place and getting crazy .
Bots like these have been getting some serious military attention lately , so watching these guys wriggle into any damn spot they please is at once awesome and terrifying .
Or maybe it 's just the music .
Video after the break .

Using The DMCA To Stop Patients From Rating Their Doctors

Last month , Carlo wrote about how a number of doctors were pushing their patients to sign waivers , promising that they would n't review the doctors online -- and that one company would go around trying to enforce these waivers and get critical comments pulled down from ratings sites like RateMyMD.com .
The whole thing seemed quite odd -- but in another article about the service ( found via Michael Scott ) , the details make it clear that this is even more questionable than we previously thought .
That 's because the way the " waivers " from the company " Medical Justice " work is by having the patient " assign all intellectual property rights for anything the patient may write ( and publish ) about the physician to the physician . "
Then , the physician can claim copyright infringement on any review , and force it offline .
So unlike what was implied in the original article , it would n't be a specific contractual issue , but a copyright issue .
This is not what copyright law was intended to do .
Of course , it does bring up a few interesting points of discussion .
First , is that the main purpose of using copyright here is so that the doctors can make use of the DMCA 's notice - and - takedown safe harbor provisions , rather than be stymied by the similar ( but not quite the same ) CDA section 230 safe harbors for things like defamation .
One of the key differences between the two is that Section 230 does n't have a notice - and - takedown provision ( though some have been trying to add one ) .
So , really , all this is designed to do is figure out a way to shift the critical rules in question from the CDA to the DMCA .
Sneaky !
Second , is that I wonder if this would be seen as actual copyright infringement anyway , or if reviewers could make a credible fair use defense .
In some cases , the review itself might not even be covered by copyright ( i.e. , if there 's no creative expression in it -- such as simple " he 's awful ! " reviews ) .
In other cases where copyright might exist , the four factor fair use test might allow its use .
While it could hurt the doctor 's ability to make money as a doctor , it would n't be harming the market for the copyrighted content .
Also , the use would be for purposes of " criticism . "
So , it 's difficult to see how such content posted on a review site would actually violate anyone 's copyright , even if the rights really were signed over .
But ... ( and this is where that sneaky first part comes into play ) , this might not matter .
Even though you can get in trouble for filing a false DMCA notification ( and even for failing to take fair use into account ) , most online services will quickly pull down content when receiving a DMCA takedown to preserve their safe harbor protections .
So in almost all cases , the content will get pulled down , even if the content is n't really infringing .
And , then it seems quite unlikely that any reviewer / patient will find it worth the trouble of filing a counternotice .
So , really , this is a fascinating misuse of the DMCA that will live on ( unless someone like the EFF decides to make an example of it ) .
What it really highlights is one of the many problems with the DMCA 's notice - and - takedown provision , which heavily incentivizes service providers to pull down content as quickly as possible .
As a result of that , companies like Medical Justice have tremendous incentives to come up with a plan like this to shift what they do to a copyright issue , solely to make use of the notice - and - takedown provision , even in cases where there 's no actual infringement of the copyright .

Aso salutes to journalists upon arrival at his official residence in Tokyo Monday , July 13 , 2009 .
The embattled prime minister has dissolved parliament and called a general election for next month .
(( The Associated Press ) )
The speaker of the lower house announced the move Tuesday , setting the stage for a vote that could trigger a rare change in Japan 's political leadership .
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has had a majority in the lower house for most of the past 50 years .
But the main opposition , the Democratic Party of Japan , has won a series of local elections and drawn broad support in recent polls .
Earlier this month , Aso 's party and its coalition lost its majority in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly , prompting some to call for his resignation .
The municipal contest does not directly affect the national government , but it is widely viewed as a bellwether for a national vote .
The Democratic Party of Japan favours a more independent stance from the U.S. , smaller government and more international peacekeeping missions for Japan 's military .
The Liberal Democrats currently have 303 seats in the powerful 480 - seat lower house , and their coalition partner Komeito has 31 .
The Democratic Party has just 112 .
The party that wins a majority in the lower house picks the prime minister and government ministers from among its ranks .
Thirty years ago the world awoke to a great volcanic eruption in Iran that transformed the country 's face and sent tremors across the globe .
A mass movement of popular protest had succeeded in doing what few had thought possible .
The Shah 's heavily fortified regime was no more - a mere chapter in the country 's long past .
For all the religious euphoria that has marked the revolution , its root causes are in reality more sociopolitical than theological .
After all , theology cannot create revolution if its conditions are not seething in society 's gut and within its political forces .
The vast wells of popular anger that erupted at the end of the 1970s were fed by grievances that had been building for years .
At the forefront of these was the corruption and despotism of the Shah and his regime ; the widening circle of sociocultural marginalisation , fuelled by pseudo - modernisation ; and the regime 's acquiescence to foreign interventions , particularly from the US .
There is much about this pre-revolutionary Iranian scene that would appear familiar to the observer of the wider Middle East today .
While the region 's modern history has been mired in a string of crises associated with a fragile post - colonial state , its ills have been further aggravated by the erosion of legitimacy that has accompanied the last few decades .
Its first source - national liberation - faded with the departure of the independence generation , and the rise to power of a new breed of colourless technocrats and generals .
And as the promises of development and progress vanished into the smoke of the shanty towns , the Arab state lost its last refuge from its citizens .
Stripped of all cover , it degenerated into a terrifying oppression machine .
The more depleted its legitimacy , the greater it relied on the police , internal intelligence apparatuses , and on the support of foreign patrons - much like the Shah .
Most Arab regimes would not survive without the perpetual use of violence against their citizens and opponents - aided and abetted by their " friends " and allies .
Egypt may represent the clearest manifestation of this state of affairs .
For the last decade , its 80 - year - old president has been preoccupied with ensuring the accession of his son , Gamal , to the throne of the republic .
In the meantime , his country , the most populous in the Arab world , sinks deeper into degeneracy , with receding regional influence , rampant corruption , and millions teetering on the verge of starvation .
What we have before us is a deadly recipe for explosion .
By the 1990s , with the collapse of communism and Bush Sr's attack on Iraq , most Arab regimes had reached their sell - by date .
Thanks to their " business as usual " Euro - American allies , their expired lives were extended .
But one cannot see how they can escape mortality much longer , amid a sea of crises and surging popular anger .
Of course , this is not to say that the Iranian scenario will be replicated in Egypt - or other Arab countries - or that another Khomeini will soon emerge .
History does not repeat itself .
What is doubtless though is that many components of the Iranian dynamite are today raging beneath the surface of imposed " stability " , especially as new sociopolitical forces are entering the stage on the ruins of the discredited official elite .
Four months before the Shah was forced to flee , the CIA issued a report describing his regime as stable .
The shah , it predicted , " is expected to remain actively in power over the next ten years " .
Things have n't changed much since .
The same state of wilful oblivion is still in play .
Blinded by short - term interests , western governments insist on seeing things in the region as they want , not as they are .
In truth , they are the real makers of revolution in the Middle East .

Understanding The Use Of Thermite On 9 - 11
There is no answer to this conclusive evidence that the WTC towers were deliberately demolished with pre-planted devices while two thousand people were still inside and trying to get out .
There is no excuse for any American not to be up in arms and thankful that we have proof and full justification to bring down the Money Power which at this minute has its bloody hands around our economic throats .
Let no one doubt that the WTC buildings were brought down by thermite devices planted in the building with full knowledge and cooperation of Larry Silversteen , close friend of Ariel " We - the - Jewish - People - Control - America - and - The - Americans - Know - it " Sharon .
Begining with Larry Silversteen , it is time to arrest each accomplice within the Perle - Wolfowitz - Kissinger network of Neo-Cons , profiteering Zionist Money Merchants and mercenary killers domestic and foreign we know were involved .
The Pentagon evidence was sufficient to convict them all , but the discovery of Dr. Steven Jones , carefully explained here , does for Silverstein what the Pentagon evidence does for Donald Rumsfeld and the entire Pentagon leadership .
Whoever impedes the necessary arrests at this point must be counted as complicit in this capital offense of treason , conspiracy , high - crimes and New Federal " hate crimes " according to our laws -- but more than that , they must be considered enemies of the United States under direct attack by a foreign enemy who has infiltrated our command structure .
Losing this war will carry a cost we cannot bear .
To save anything , everyone must be staked on fighting and winning against this consiracy .

Chistopher Bollyn Dr. Steven Jones Understanding The Use Of Thermite On 9 - 11
The spectacular explosions that accompanied the impact of the planes provide evidence of having been created by Thermate containing barium nitrate which produced the light orange flame and white smoke .
Understanding how Thermite works sheds new light on the photographic evidence of 9 - 11 .
The discovery of Thermite in the dust of the World Trade Center is solid scientific proof that this steel - melting and steel - vaporizing explosive was used to demolish the twin towers on 9 - 11 .
The peer - reviewed scientific paper ( 2009 , Niels Harrit , Steven E. Jones , et al ) that presents the evidence of Super - Thermite ( nano - sized Thermite compounds ) in the dust of the twin towers is the result of years of investigation .
The white smoke and molten iron seen in this photo are evidence of Thermite ausing the collapse of the tower .
Understanding the importance of this discovery and the evidence of the use of Thermite in the spectacles that unfolded on 9 - 11 is central to understanding how the towers were demolished , a heinous crime in which some three thousand people lost their lives .
This is why , I believe , Dr. Steven E. Jones and I were both attacked in August - September 2006 .
During the spring and summer of 2006 , Jones and I had worked closely on interpreting the evidence that pointed to the use of Thermite .
I was attacked in the middle of August at my home by a team of unidentified thugs , which had been prowling around my house and who turned out to be an undercover police tactical unit connected to the Dept. of Homeland Security .
Dr. Jones , on the other hand , was trapped by a wily NPR radio host who , with a team of Zionist Jews , ganged up on Jones and pressured BYU to suspend him for comments they maliciously misinterpreted and then deemed to be anti-Semitic .
It was no coincidence that two 9 - 11 researchers who were investigating the use of Thermite were both attacked within three weeks .
Because Jones ' research was focused primarily on the use of Thermite at the World Trade Center and because I had worked closely with him , it certainly appears that a decision had been made during the summer of 2006 by the culprits of 9 - 11 to attack , vilify , and discredit both of us .
The fact that the three people who led the attack on Jones were all Zionist Jews clearly reveals the nature of the group that was being protected .
Bollyn and Dr. Steven E. Jones discuss the evidence of
Thermite in the spring of 2006 .
After visiting Jones at the campus of Brigham Young University in Provo , Utah in the early spring of 2006 , I went to the University of California at Davis where I met with Dr. Thomas Cahill , who had studied the particles in the smoke that rose from the pile of rubble at Ground Zero .
The Davis DRUM , which measured the quantities and sizes of the particles from the smoke , found an extraordinarily large amount of extremely small particles and nano - size particles of many metals in the bluish smoke that rose from the pile .
This hazy smoke rose from the pile until the fires burned themselves out in late December 2001 .
Such particles , Cahill said , could only be produced in fires hotter than the boiling point of the metals .
This was scientific proof that beneath the rubble of the twin towers were extreme hot spots in which iron boiled for more than 15 weeks .
That is a most unusual fire .
Given the fact that these super - intense fires were raging in oxygen - starved conditions , it became clear that an aluminothermic reaction like Thermite was creating these hot spots .
The bluish smoke that rose from the pile contained large amounts of nanosized particles of metals created only in fires hotter than the boiling point of the metal .
Neither the lack of air nor the continuous dousing with water affected these incredibly intense hot spots .
This is evidence of thermite , which can be used underwater , cooking under the pile .
I returned to Provo with photocopies of the key chapters of USGS chemical survey of the dust .
This survey contained several photos of tiny balls of iron found in the dust .
These spheres were solid evidence that large amounts of molten iron accompanied the destruction of the World Trade Center .
These spheroids of iron are one of the products of a Thermite reaction .
When Thermite , a compound of aluminum and iron oxide , reacts , the products are aluminum oxide , a white smoke , and molten iron .
The exothermic reaction releases a great deal of heat as well .
The addition of a small amount of sulfur ( 2 percent ) increases the effectiveness of the steel melting or steel vaporizing process ( eutectic ) while barium nitrate creates a light orange flame .
The thermite compound with sulfur or barium nitrate is known as Thermate , an incendiary pyrotechnic composition that generates short bursts of exceedingly high temperatures .
It should be noted that steel beams and columns were found to have been melted and vaporized in the remains of the three collapsed towers .
The FEMA report about the collapsed twin towers noted the vaporized steel beams ( Barnett ) and said that the areas where this had occurred showed signs of sulfidation .
None of this could be explained and the FEMA report presented evidence of steel that had been affected by Thermate without using the word .
The FEMA - sponsored Building Performance Study of 2002 contains evidence of Thermate - melted steel .
This is found in the " Limited Metallurgical Examination " written by Professor Jonathan Barnett .
Barnett examined two pieces of melted steel : one from the WTC 7 , the other from the TwinTowers .
About the first piece , Barnett wrote : " The thinning of the steel occurred by a high - temperature corrosion due to the combination of oxidation and sulfidation . "
This was done by " a eutectic mixture of iron , oxygen , and sulfur that liquefied the steel , " he concluded .
Barnett found the same sulfidation in the piece of melted steel from the TwinTowers .
" The severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of Samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event , " Barnett wrote .
" No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified . "
Professor Jones points to Thermate , with 2 percent sulfur , as being the most likely culprit .
The oxidation and sulfidation of the steel requires the oxygen and sulfur being " intimately in contact with the metal at high temperature , " Jones said .
Super - Thermite is a form of Thermite composed of nano - size particles which makes the reaction explosive .
The evidence is now clear .
Large amounts of Thermite / Thermate were placed in the towers ( WTC 1 , 2 & 7 ) and were responsible for cutting the core columns , slicing the trusses and beams , and pulverizing the concrete in the floors .
The photo shows a core column that has been cut with Thermite .
The steel walls of the core columns were 4 inches thick at the base of the towers .
Thermate with barium nitrate was used as an " incendiary pyrotechnic " during the first explosions that accompanied the planes hitting the buildings , while nano - sized Super - Thermite was exploded during the demolition to pulverize the concrete in the 220 floor pans of the twin towers .
Thermite cutting charges were also used to cut the core columns to initiate the collapses .
The people who engineered the demolition of the World Trade Center clearly did not like the fact that their Thermite secret was being revealed in 2006 and decided to stifle the voices of those who were discussing the evidence .
The people who reacted are connected to the people who placed the Thermite in the towers .
When one understands how Thermite and Thermate work , and that these violent reactions produce intense heat , white smoke , and molten iron , the visible evidence of thermitic reactions in the photographs and videos of 9 - 11 becomes quite obvious .
The evidence of flowing molten metal preceded by pressure pulses of white smoke are clearly indicative of thermitic reactions , and can be seen in many videos and photos of the towers .
A large flow of molten iron could be seen falling from the 81st floor of WTC 2 five minutes before it collapsed .
The light yellow color of the metal indicates that is is well over 1,000 degrees C.
If this were aluminum , as some would argue , it would have melted at about 660 degrees C. and would appear silver - grey in daylight conditions .
Molten aluminum appears silverish in daylight .
( Aluminum processing , Micron Infrared Inc. )
The chips of Super - Thermite and balls of previously molten iron in the dust and rubble are solid evidence of the use of Thermite .
When the use of Thermite / Thermate in the destruction of the World Trade Center is understood , the entire scam is revealed .
The three towers did not fall due to airplane crashes caused by Islamic terrorists ; they were demolished by Zionists working with the owners and lease - holders of the towers : Larry Silverstein and Frank Lowy .
The following series of photographs of the explosions in the South Tower were take by Todd Rengel .
Rengel is standing N.E. of the towers and is catching the view of the corner of WTC 2 from which the plane and its fuel are emerging after having crashed into the South side of the tower .
In the first photo a great deal of white smoke and cascading molten metal can be seen in front of the exploding fuel fire .
The falling molten metal is clearly producing white smoke .
The area through which the molten metal fell is now full of white smoke , which disperses in the following photos .

A simple rebuttal to the lunacy of http://www.rense.com/general86/therm.htm
This BS ' Bogus Science ' has been addressed previously by me with a tremendous amount of factual evidence so I will not spend much time on this scam BS other than to post the previous referenced facts .
I will address one statement that is so rediculous as to be laughable in its ignorance and stupidity if it were n't for the fact it being used to hide / scam the real facts of the destruction which by definition are those obstructing justice and accessories to murder :

" This was scientific proof that beneath the rubble of the twin towers were extreme hot spots in which iron boiled for more than 15 weeks .
... it became clear that an aluminothermic reaction like Thermite was creating these hot spots . "
Similar burn-rates around 350 m/s are measured for these " super - thermites " http://www.mrs.org/s_mrs/sec_subscribe.asp?CID=2642&DID=115853&action=detail
A proven quote from my article dealing with the " The BS ' Bogus Science ' of ' Explosive SuperThermite ' Versus the Facts of a ' Deflagration Material ' .
http://www.rense.com/general77/geddno.htm
There are approximately 2,628,000 seconds in a month .
http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080904102842AAuCDvw 2,628,000 seconds X 3.75 months = 9,855,000 seconds .
350 meters X 9,855,000 seconds = 3,449,250,000 meters ( approximately 3.45 Billion meters or 2,14 Million miles ) of thermite length would be needed to burn for 15 weeks .
Wow , that 's kinda long but maybe the super duper double top secret thermate was also super thin and they were able to hide 2.14 million miles of super thin thermate , so how much would it have to weigh ?
It takes about 1 gm of enhanced thermate to bring 1 gm of steel to melting point - a one to one ratio .
So how much would it take to bring 5 acres of land 15 feet deep to the 1600 degrees ?
" at the US NIST , the average density of dirt is 120 lbs per cubic foot . "
http://ts.nist.gov/ts/htdocs/230/235/weightcart/historyof105-8.pdf
There are 27 cubic feet in a yard .
http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.04/carol3.html
So 120 lbs/cubic ft X 27 cubic ft = 3240 lbs/cubic yard
One acre is equal to 4840 square yards and your pond is 15 feet or 5 yards deep therefore the number of cubic yards is 4840x15 or 72600 cubic yards .
< http://www.blurtit.com/q6688887.html>http://www.blurtit.com/q6688887.html
We have no official numbers on the depth of the 1600 degree temperature of the 5 to 7 acres of land , but unofficial estimates seem to indicate about 15 feet , so lets use that .
3240 lbs/cubic yd X 72600 / per acre = 235,224,000 lbs /acre .
At a minimum 5 acres of land was brought to seering temperatures so 235,224,000 X 5 = 1,176,120,000 lbs .
So based on these basic approximate calculations the ' super thin invisible super top secret super thermate ' would have to have been 2.14 Million miles long and would to have weighed approximately 1.176 Billion pounds .

( CNN ) -- Sen. John Ensign of Nevada admitted Tuesday to an extramarital affair with a woman who had worked for him .
Sen . John Ensign of Nevada is considered a rising star in the Republican Party .
Ensign , 51 , would not identify the woman but said she and her husband had been " close friends . "
Her husband , he said , also worked for him .
" Last year , I had an affair , " the Republican senator said outside his office in Las Vegas .
" I violated the vows of marriage .
It 's absolutely the worst thing I 've done in my life .
" I take full responsibility for my actions .
I know I have deeply hurt and disappointed my wife , Darlene , my children , my family , friends , my staff and those who believed in me .
And to all of them , especially my wife , I 'm truly sorry , " he said .
The senator 's office also released a statement from Ensign 's wife , saying , " Since we found out last year , we have worked through the situation and we have come to a reconciliation .
This has been difficult on both families .
With the help of our family and close friends , our marriage has become stronger .
I love my husband . "
Ensign 's spokesman , Tory Mazzola , said Ensign and a campaign staff member carried on the affair from December 2007 through August 2008 .
Her husband was an official Senate staff member for the senator .
Neither remained in Ensign 's employ as of May 2008 .
Ensign , a veterinarian , is considered a rising star within the Republican Party .
A member of the party 's Senate leadership , Ensign last year took over as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee .
He was elected to the Senate in 2000 and comfortably won re-election in the midterm elections of 2006 , when Democrats won back Congress .
He is up for re-election in 2012 .
This month , Ensign spoke to a conservative group in Iowa , stoking speculation that he might have interest in running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 .
CNN 's Ted Barrett contributed to this report .
All About John Ensign
At the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit last week I demoed my new work - in - progress Netbook - focused interface to Banshee called Cubano .
Cubano is designed with the Netbook in mind , but is certainly not limited to such a device .
I prefer this clean and simple interface to the more traditional Banshee interface already , even on my desktop .
Cubano is more about experiencing your music than managing it .
I am aiming to introduce visual metadata ( photos , colors ) and simple whitespace as UI elements to separate and emphasize content instead of the hard lines from traditional toolkit widgets .
However , even with a minimal interface you do n’t lose any of the power to which you may be accustomed from the traditional Banshee interface .
I must stress that not all of the UI concepts here are solidified or indeed implemented .
A few quick things to note about what will change in the very near future :
The painful source combo box will go away , do n’t worry !
It was just a widget that already existed in Banshee that I was able to easily reuse to connect the dots .
We ’re working on a grid view for artists and albums .
I do n’t care for the header either — it will receive much attention in due time .
Feel free to checkout Cubano ’s source code , but you ’ll also need clutter , clutter - gtk , and clutter - sharp from Clutter git master , and Banshee from GNOME git master .
Bleeding edge !
Lastly , let me further stress that Cubano does not replace Banshee as we know it today .
It only augments it .
Cubano simply provides a different user experience on top of the existing Banshee platform .
Platform you say ?
Trendy , I know .
Banshee is in its third generation now .
It ’s been designed to be completely extensible , and major components are abstracted and organized in reusable ways .
As such we ’ve fostered the development of many Mono / .NET libraries , most of which are not specific to Banshee and can easily be reused in other projects .
We essentially glue everything together with Mono .
Addins , and build user interfaces on top of it all .
What this means is the traditional user interface we ’re used to in Banshee is an astonishingly small 875 lines of C# code .
Therefore , it ’s conceivable , and even quite easy to think of Banshee as not just an application , but a platform for building new applications and user experiences .
Ergo , Cubano .
For those interested in some of the wider details of the design and utility behind Banshee as platform , I recently had lovely a discussion on the topic with Scott Hanselman — Senior Program Manager in the Developer Division at Microsoft — for his podcast , Hanselminutes .
F - Spot
A major take - away from this platform discussion at GCDS last week is talk of re-basing the core of F - Spot — the wonderful photo management application — on top of Banshee itself .
The goal is simply to allow F - Spot to benefit from Banshee ’s mature and maintained core , which provides many of the underpinning necessities in F - Spot , and allow the F - Spot developers to focus on the more interesting task of organizing and manipulating Photos .
While nothing is set in stone , I have a simple proposal :
Re-base F - Spot ’s non -UI core on Banshee ’s non-UI core .
Implement basic photo importing , tagging , and viewing as a Banshee extension ( an optional feature ) .
This would mean showing photos in Banshee like we do for videos .
With Banshee / Cubano supporting basic photo management , grow the F - Spot user interface and experience to be more like that of professional tools such as Adobe Lightroom — an experience missing today on the Linux desktop .
GCDS Slides
The talk I gave at GCDS covered the above and a bit more .
The slides are available here , but may be a bit terse if you were n’t in the audience .
I ’m not sure if my talk was recorded or not .
Nevertheless , for your perusal :
For a while I 've had this idea stuck in my head that it would be nice to have an “ re ” attribute on strings to tie them together .
I mean , all the re methods take a string , but then you have to keep a reMatch object around to get access to the group ( ) method …
My idea is you could have something like this :
if line.re.search( r' Date : (.* ) ' ) : print line.re.group(1 )
To experiment with this , I have created a module that implements a “ restr ( ) ” class , including an “ open ( ) ” wrapper , “ readlines ( ) ” short - cut , and a bunch of itertools - inspired methods for processing files as an iterator over the lines of the file , as restr ( ) objects .
Read on for more information .
I wrote up a description to the python - dev mailing list , because the right place for it , if it is the right solution , would be in the string objects .
See the above link for the python - dev discussion .
The module itself includes a lot of documentation in the doc-strings .
Things that make this interesting to system admins are iterator tools like “ grep ( ) ” and “ grepv ( ) ” ( grep - v ) , and “ cat( file_or_iterator [ , … ] ) ” .
Thanks to a little help from Paul Hummer , I 've created a Launchpad Project for filtertools .
I plan to use this for the BZR hosting and bug - tracking .

University of Florida researchers were able to program bone marrow stem cells to repair damaged retinas in mice , suggesting a potential treatment for one of the most common causes of vision loss in older people .
The success in repairing a damaged layer of retinal cells in mice implies that blood stem cells taken from bone marrow can be programmed to restore a variety of cells and tissues , including ones involved in cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease .
" To our knowledge , this is the first report using targeted gene manipulation to specifically program an adult stem cell to become a new cell type , " said Maria B. Grant , M.D. , a professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at UF 's College of Medicine .
" Although we used genes , we also suggest you can do the same thing with drugs — but ultimately you would not give the drugs to the patient , you would give the drugs to their cells .
Take the cells out , activate certain chemical pathways , and put the cells back into the patient . "
In a paper slated to appear in the September issue of the journal Molecular Therapy , scientists describe how they used a virus carrying a gene that gently pushed cultured adult stem cells from mice toward a fate as retinal cells .
Only after the stem cells were reintroduced into the mice did they completely transform into the desired type of vision cells , apparently taking environmental cues from the damaged retinas .
After studying the cell - transformation process , scientists were able to bypass the gene manipulation step entirely and instead use chemical compounds that mirrored environmental conditions in the body , thus pointing the stem cells toward their ultimate identities as vision cells .
" First we were able to show you can overexpress a protein unique to a retinal cell type and trick the stem cell into thinking it is that kind of cell , " said Grant , who collaborated with Edward Scott , Ph.D. , the director of the Program in Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at UF 's McKnight Brain Institute .
" As we proceeded , we found we could activate the stem cells by mimicking the body 's natural signaling channels with chemicals .
This implies a whole new field of stem cell research that uses drug manipulation rather than genetic manipulation to send these immature cells along new pathways . "
Scientists chose to build retinal pigment epithelial cells , which form the outer barrier of the retina .
In addition to being very specialized and easy to identify , RPE cells are faulty in many retinal diseases , including age - related macular degeneration , which affects nearly 2 million people in the United States , and some forms of blindness related to diabetes .
" This work applies to 85 percent of patients who have age - related macular degeneration , " Grant said .
" There are no therapies for this devastating disease . "
The work was supported by the National Eye Institute .
Researchers removed blood stem cells from the bone marrow of mice , modified the cells in cultures , and injected them back into the animals ' circulatory systems .
From there , the stem cells were able to home in on the eye injury and become retinal cells .
At 28 days after receiving the modified stem cells , mice that had previously demonstrated no retinal function were no different than normal mice in electrical measures of their response to light .
Grant and UF have patented some technology involved in the research .

NEW YORK — Despite disappointing sales of hard - core Wii titles like MadWorld and The Conduit , Sega remains committed to creating mature videogames for the casual console .
" You 'll see more games in that genre coming from us , " said Sega President and COO Mike Hayes ( pictured ) at a Tuesday press event here .
Aside from reaffirming the company 's plan to crank out bloody Wii games , Sega demonstrated its lineup of upcoming titles and showed that it was aiming for both hard - core and casual gamers .
Sega showed spy - themed RPG Alpha Protocol , sci - fi shooter Alien vs. Predator and recently delayed actioner Bayonetta , which will let gamers play a shape - shifting witch .
On the casual side , there was the sequel to best - selling Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games ; Step & Roll , a new Balance Board - focused Super Monkey Ball title ; and exercise game Daisy Fuentes Pilates .
Wired.com spoke with Hayes and Sega Vice President of Marketing Sean Ratcliffe about Bayonetta 's delay , the importance of " mommy bloggers , " surviving the economic downturn and creating titles that will appeal to Western gamers .
The full Q&A is below .
Wired.com : MadWorld was a widely praised title , but sales were disappointing .
Why do you think that is ?
Do you think that " core " games just do n't sell on the Wii ?
Mike Hayes :
It 's difficult because it was a critically acclaimed title ; it was extreme but good .
The thing that we 're saying is , Sega would be extremely arrogant to have a title that did n't do as well as we thought on a platform and then say , " Those kind of games do n't sell on that platform . "
I think if you take our slew of more mature games —
House of the Dead Overkill did really well in Europe , and for some reason even though it 's a big ( intellectual property ) it did less well in North America .
So that 's kind of like a win and a miss that 's kind of come out neutral .
* MadWorld * sales were very disappointing , but was that to do with the platform ?
Was it that people did n't like the art style ?
Or that people did n't like the way the game played through ?
It could be many things , which we 're obviously researching .
__Wired.com : __What about The Conduit ?
__Hayes :
__We actually regard * The Conduit *as a success .
We shipped 300,000 units , sold through half of those and now it's at the point where it 's selling consistently at a time when Wii sales are generally depressed in the marketplace .
So what does that tell you ?
We still kind of do n't know .
What we can say is that we 'll still do mature games for the Wii market because with an install base of some 34 million in Europe and America ( maybe half of whom do n't own Xbox 360s and PS3s ) ....
So even if you took half of those where they 're not into those ( core ) games , you 've still got 8 million consumers to go for .
So I think the sheer scale of the Wii allows a shooter , or a mature game , to be a niche but a successful niche .
And because the development costs can be less on Wii , that means you can sell less to be successful ....
We can take more risks on the Wii .
__Wired.com : __So Sega will continue to have a commitment to making hard - core games on the Wii , despite the sales of MadWorld .
__Hayes : __Absolutely .
You 'll see more games in that genre coming from us .
Wired.com : Bayonetta has been moved to early 2010 .
There seems to be more and more games delayed to that time period .
How do you feel about that for Bayonetta ?
__Sean Ratcliffe : __ I think there 's quality titles coming down the pipeline anywhere ....
There 's always going to be good products around you .
It 's just a matter of setting your release date , working with your customers , the retailers and making sure you 've got everything in place .
And we feel confident that Bayonetta 's set in the right point in time .
We know it 's a great quality title , no doubt about that , so now we just have to communicate to the consumers about when it 's going to be available on the shelf , and we 'll work with our retail partners to do that .
We 're confident we 'll do a good job there .
__Hayes : __What we do n't want to do is move , then say we 're launching on Jan. 29th — that would be crazy .
We want to make sure that we stagger that period after Christmas .
Hopefully , as publishers , we 'll be smart in the points that we release and do n't create another November in February .
But I acknowledge your point 's a very good one .
Ratcliffe :
We have to take a leap out of the movie industry .
They manage their portfolio quite well .
The movie companies sort of get together — I do n't know how they do it , I do n't know if they physically sit around the table and divide it up — but somehow they sort of know and communicate with each other when the big titles are coming out .
I think they have a feeling .
What 's happening in the games industry — right as soon as someone names a date , then people go , " Then we 're going to move around it . "
Action game
Wired.com :
Is there anything you 've learned as the former head of Sega Europe that you 're taking with you over to North America ?
Are there any strategies that worked over there that you 'll try to apply over here ?
__Hayes :
__There are detailed process points , but that 's very operational .
The road map was always being driven by a collaboration between North America and Europe in so far as , unless it 's a very specific product , like Football Manager Live in Europe , which sells a million units on PC every year , most titles have to be successful in both .
So there 's been a consensus approach in any case .
I do n't think there 's much done in Europe that we would want to do in North America .
In fact , interestingly , now being here , I 'm finding things that we do in North America are cool that we should be doing in Europe .
How odd is that ?
I think that 's the whole point :
It 's about how as an operation can we be as efficient and collaborative as possible .
__Wired.com : __Can you give an example of one thing you 'd like to try in Europe that you 've liked over here ?
__Hayes : __Well , it 's what 's going on here at the moment , the mommy bloggers .
What a brilliant idea .
I 'm sure there are mommy bloggers in Europe .
But I 'm not aware that we 've done a press event specifically for them .
And with the mass - market nature of videogaming now , and how important moms are — not just in the purchase , but as consumers themselves — what a great idea .
So I think that 's something I 'd love to see more of in European territories .
Just as one example .
I think it 's having that view of both that we can share the benefits .
__Wired.com : __Especially since you 've said a lot of territories in Europe are more family - oriented .
Hayes :
Yes , I think that 's a great point .
In fact , it 's probably more relevant in countries like Spain and actually in Germany .
Germany 's probably a territory where this whole mass - market acceptance of videogames has yet to happen because parents are still very concerned about what their children are playing so that would be very good case in point where that would work .
See , there 's another idea that came just from thinking out loud .
( laughs )
Because I was just thinking in the U.K. but actually it 's probably more appropriate for Germany .
I think one of the things pertaining to that though , in the reorganization — we have excellent studios in Japan , and it 's very important that they 're making titles that are very relevant for Western territories .
There 's Sonic , there 's ( Mario and Sonic at The Olympic Games ) — that 's done extremely well — and Super Monkey Ball .
I think the plan for us to get more of that extremely successful , Western - relevant content from our Japanese studios as well .
And that 's something that this reorganization will allow us to do quite successfully .
The upcoming Mario & Sonic at the Winter Olympic Games
Wired.com :
How do you think Sega can do that though , specifically ?
Hayes :
On the one hand , you 've got brilliant Japanese development studios , like our partnership with Platinum Games .
* Bayonetta * is just a very Western - relevant but very Japanese - inspired title , and we 're quite excited about that doing very well .
That 's a good case where Japanese excellence is in place .
And that will actually do well in Japan as well .
And then you look at Sonic and the Sonic teams , and how they created titles which fundamentally only sold in the West and how can we look at what 's been doing well in that genre and try and add to the success that Sonic 's already had .
So I guess it 's the teams probably taking more of a detailed look at what works in the West — what makes a good shooter , what makes a good Western RPG , what makes a great children 's platform action - adventure game .
And I think it's by having that focus more on the big market of Europe plus America where I think there will be some more development focus on providing appropriate titles for the market , if that makes sense .
__Wired.com : __How is Sega is dealing with the economic downturn and what 's your strategy moving forward ?
Hayes :
Our general view is that we acknowledge the recession , particularly in its wider field .
I do n't think we 're as convinced that the recession is affecting the videogames market as perhaps some of our competitors are stating .
I think we 're in a period of videogame life cycles where things are expected , whether they 're price drops , whether we 're waiting for triple - A titles to come out .
So to answer your question , we 're only adapting to what the platforms are doing rather than what the economy is doing .
We think that by the end of this year , the market will be at least as big as it was last year , so $ 22 billion marketplace in America , a $ 22 billion marketplace and change in Europe .
It 's interesting — the PlayStation 3 is rumored to be having a price drop .
Well , the consumers are so smart , they kind of know that one 's going to be coming so they 're not going to rush out and buy a PlayStation 3 until they know .
So that 's going to depress the market slightly .
The Wii last year had Wii Fit , Super Smash Bros .
Brawl and * Mario Kart* , and they were just exceptional titles .
And then of course , there was Grand Theft Auto .
So we 're not comparing apples with apples .
We 're acknowledging that the packages market is down .
And then you layer on top of that all the digital business that 's going on that 's not being measured in our whole environment , I just do n't see how we can be too down about the market .
I think the economic part of that is only altering the shape , not the actual size .
I think with holiday sales , ( the industry ) will bounce back and get us to that point where we 'll see the market was as big as it was last year .
No one has a crystal ball , but to answer your question , we 're not taking any actions specifically based on the general state of the economy because we think the issues in videogaming are specific and relevant to videogaming .
For example , when we moved Bayonetta , that was n't due to the economic situation .
It was because it looked like we 'd launch in November and in the West , you do n't launch new IP at that busy time of year .
So we moved it to what we think will be a quieter period in the new year .
And I think that other companies are saying they 're moving titles just because of the economy , and I think their development directors are quite delighted that 's being used as a reason .

Sources : State labeling laws in box charts above obtained from ACE STATUS Report ( 2006 - Onward ) and U.S. Dept of Energy Data Center , in addition to review of current public information , including state and county laws , fuel and petroleum supplier / distribution reports , etc .
American Coalition for Ethanol ( ACE ) has published a yearly update on state - by - state ethanol laws from 2006 to Present .
During 2006 - 07 STATUS
Report available online for widespread public viewing , then in 2008 ACE only supplied the report by special request .
Fuel - Testers Company did receive a 2008 copy from Lacey Dixon , Director of Member and Industry Relations in 2008 - But , in 2009 our request to ACE for STATUS Report Update was denied .
View ACE Staff Contact .
As per Lacey Dixon , ACE now ONLY distributes STATUS Report to their ' Voting " and " Associate " paid members ( $ 1,000 / $ 750 annual dues ) .
State fuel laws and guidelines change very frequently , especially with ethanol distribution -
So always check your state 's laws directly for updates .
Renewable fuel and E10 details / changes in laws can also be found online at your states ' governement website - Look under Department of Energy or Department of Agriculture and / or Division of Weights & Measures .
Search for " renewable fuel standards " .
Caution - Warning :
The legal limit for ethanol alcohol in E10 fuel is 10 % .
Engine manufacturers still only recommend and warranty use of gas with 10 % or less ethanol ; Not E15 , E20 or any other gas blend that contains above 10 % .
It is shocking that the EPA recently ( 10/2010 ) approved E15 for 2001 and newer autos despite knowing manufacturers will invalidate engine warranties when fuel types above E10 are used .
* E15 is not legal for sale yet ( 12/2011 ) but MANY gas stations continue to illegally over - blend ethanol due to profit motives .
Exception : Flex - fuel vehicles are designed to accept up to 85 % alcohol in gas ( E85 ) .
* Nov. 7th , 2011 the EPA published a public notice stating " Update : As of November 7 , 2011 , E15 is not registered with EPA and is therefore not legal for distribution or sale as a transportation fuel ... "

We have viewed this page several times since then , but on 12/16/2011 this page at EPA website is no longer visible ...
We 'll keep you posted .
Gas pumps may not reveal ethanol alcohol was added to gasoline .
The percent of ethanol may be incorrectly added by the local fuel distributor or gas retailer .
Overblending and " double - blending " is common .
Adding 15 , 20 % or higher amounts of ethanol - ( Legal limit=10 % ) .
Few gas stations monitor or check ethanol content ( % added ) of fuel delivered and contained in the gas pump .
Several states that are now labeling , are attempting to change laws to " no label " .
There are still many gas - powered engines that prohibit use of gasoline containing alcohol .
Check your owner 's manual fuel recommendations .
View Manufacturer Ethanol Fuel Recommendations . and Warnings .
Contact your local , state and federal legislators and demand the right to be informed when fuel mixture at gas station pumps contains alcohol .
Protect your right to NON - ethanol fuel availability : SIGN Fuel Choice Petition .
The debate to " label or not label " has been a hot topic in Iowa and several other states .
Example : Iowa Senate President Jack Kibbie introduced a bill in 2008 to remove labeling requirement , saying that he thought more motorists would buy E - 10 without the label .
Kibbies proposal would have allowed gasoline station owners to decide whether or not to keep the E - 10 label at the pump .
The Iowa Corn Growers Association ( ICGA ) opposed the label - removal proposal , wanting to keep the E - 10 labels on pumps .
Details on this news report can be found at NACS online and magazine , The Association for Convenience and Petroleum Retailing .
Several legislators in Nebraska have repeatedly tried to rescind labeling requirement - We 'll see what happens in 2012 ...
In less than 5 years , most consumers have lost their right to buy E0 pure gasoline ( without alcohol ) , due to unwise decisions made by the EPA and our government leaders , and of course the greed of ethanol lobbyists / producers ... IMO .

The reigning political cliché of the day is that Britain has to cut its public spending fast – and it should start today .
This sentiment is intoned by David Cameron with his best lip- biting impersonation of Diana Spencer , and is parroted by political commentators who wave frightening national debt figures in our faces .
There 's just one problem – it defies everything we have learned about economics since the 1930s recession was unnecessarily turned into a Great Depression .
Oh , and as an ugly little coda , we are already starting to see in subtle ways what " cuts " look like – and who pays the price for them .
The cut - cut - cut chorus appears not to have heard of what John Maynard Keynes called " the paradox of thrift " .
In a recession , it is rational for you and I to cut back on our spending .
You holiday at home , put any spending plans on ice and save what you can .
So it seems instinctively right to expect governments to do the same .
But Keynes showed that if governments cut back at the same time as its citizens cut back , the recession gets even worse .
Nobody is buying anything ; demand collapses .
More people are laid off , and the state has to spend even more in the end .
The people complaining about growing spending and the growing national debt have missed the point .
Indeed , Gordon Brown 's failing has been in the opposite direction .
His recession - time spending – although far better than Cameron 's voodoo economics – is n't nearly big enough : he should be boosting the economy far more , paid for with ( yes ) temporarily higher debt .

Keynes said a stimulus could be spent on anything .
At one point , he mooted burying £ 5 notes and paying people to dig them up .
Governments today have a far more appealing option .
We need to spend a fortune to decarbonise our economy anyway , to prevent it irreparably trashing the ecosystem .
A green stimulus would save us twice over .
But the people demanding cuts are speaking louder than the quiet , rational eco-Keynesians – and they are already having a toxic effect .
Brown is embarked on some boosted spending , but is sawing off other areas of state expenditure , claiming real victims .
This process is worth looking at closely because it shows how the Government cuts now so glibly demanded almost always fall unequally .
The people who caused this crisis – the bankers at Barclays , say – are partying like it 's 1999 , splashing around grotesque bonuses with our tax money .
Meanwhile , the blameless are seeing the services they depend on snatched away .
I live in the poorest part of Britain , the East End of London , in the shadow of the reinvigorated towers of the City of London .
I 've noticed three examples of shrivelling spending that are already hitting the most vulnerable people here .
Help for elderly people to stay in their own homes is being sawed off .
Imagine you are assessed as having " basic " or " intermediate " needs : it means you are " unable to carry out several personal care or domestic routines " , such as washing yourself throughly , or cooking an egg .
Now , in more than 75 per cent of the country , you get no paid visitors or supervision any more .
You have to wait until you hurt yourself .
Even then , you will now find only overstretched services with little to offer .
Prices for meals on wheels have soared under the recession , so the number of elderly people who can afford this one hot meal a day has haemorrhaged away .
Three councils – Northumberland , West Berkshire and Wokingham – have cancelled them altogether , except for those elderly people assessed as having their " life in danger " .
It means a lot of frightened old people who can barely leave their homes – the generation who saved us all from Nazism – are being left a little more lonely and a little more hungry and a little more abandoned .
Another unnoticed target of cuts is Britain 's rape victims .
This country has one of the lowest rates of rape conviction in the democratic world : barely 5 per cent of rapists end up behind bars .
One of the reasons why we manage to convict even that puny dribble is that we have an excellent network of rape crisis centres , where victims can find a safe place to describe what has happened to them , receive counselling and treatment and gather the courage to approach the police .
A friend of mine only managed to take her rapist to court after their careful , caring support .
But more than 100 local authority services do n't have a rape treatment centre at all , and more than half of the existing centres face the prospect of closure owing to funding shortfalls .
The guillotine also fallen on the programmes to help recent immigrants who desperately want to learn English and integrate into British life .
In 1998 , the Government introduced free English language classes for refugees and poor immigrants .
It was an excellent way to give real meaning to the lectures by politicians telling immigrants to learn our language Or Else .
It showed that while we ( rightly ) expect integration , we will help willing immigrants to get there in a spirit of generosity .
A typical class member here in Tower Hamlets is Muni Monir , a young Bangladeshi woman sent here to marry at the age of 18 , who was bewildered and largely confined to her house .
Then she started coming to these classes , slowly learned English and now makes a real contribution to her community , helping her elderly ( white ) neighbours and co-organising the residents ' association .
But today these lessons are being severely curtailed .
At Tower Hamlets College , courses have been slashed by half , a pattern repeated across the country .
Many of the people who used to come , from Somalian cleaners to Chinese migrant workers , can't any more because fees have been imposed .
As a result , they are more likely to be ripped off for less than the minimum wage , less able to report crime and less able to enrich our society with their thoughts and dreams and labour .
These cuts are happening under the local authority control of all three parties , but they are most severe in Tory areas .
There will be many more hard - won public programmes choked off by the stale language of belt - tightening .
But even if you believed we should have spending cuts in the middle of a recession , would these groups be the first in your firing line ?
We are spending £ 5 bn expanding the M25 motorway , even though mountains of research evidence show carbon - belching traffic simply expands to fill the extra space .
We are subsidising the airline industry by £ 10bn a year , even though it is the single most environmentally destructive way to travel , by far .
We are spending £ 20bn on our own stash of weapons of mass destruction , Trident missiles , even though the renewal makes a mockery of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty we have signed .
Would n't they be better places for savings – to transfer the money into a green stimulus package that will get us back to work ?
It 's easy to pose as a political hard man by saying we have to face the music and slash .
It 's hard to make the counter - intuitive Keynesian case for more spending to get us through , but somebody has to .
Our pensioners , rape victims and recent immigrants – and the other vulnerable groups waiting in the firing line – can't afford any more of this callous cost - cutting .

I like the use of the bass in this song , I love the way it seems to stand out .
This is what folk music is all about .

Senior military and intelligence officers have condemned Gordon Brown 's decision to hold the Iraq war inquiry in secret , warning that it looks like a cover-up .
Military leaders , who have lost 179 personnel in Iraq , want their actions judged by the public , and intelligence officials say that politicians ' manipulation of intelligence should be thoroughly examined .
The pressure on No 10 mounted yesterday as the shadow Foreign Secretary , William Hague , tabled a Commons debate for next week demanding that inquiry evidence be heard in public .
The Conservatives will be supported by rebelling Labour backbenchers and by Liberal Democrats , who could force another embarrassing parliamentary defeat on Mr Brown .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
General Sir Mike Jackson , head of the Army during the Iraq invasion , said : " I would have no problem at all in giving my evidence in public . "
He said Mr Brown 's decision that the proceedings be held in private fed " the climate of suspicion and scepticism about government " , adding that the Prime Minister ought to consider requiring witnesses to give evidence on oath .
" I do not see why it could not have gone for a halfway house with sessions in public and then having private hearings when it comes to intelligence , " said General Jackson .
" And they do have to look at the intelligence that Blair used in the run-up to the war ... which at the end turned out to be fool 's gold .
" They say they are modelling this on the Franks inquiry into the Falklands War .
Well that was 30 years ago in a very different world .
The main problem with a secret inquiry in the current climate of suspicion and scepticism about government is that people would think there is something to hide .
And public perception at the moment is terribly important . "
He added : " We are told that having a private inquiry will make people more candid .
But none of the evidence will be given under oath and also the inquiry has no power of subpoena .
These are things that should be looked at . "
Air Marshal Sir John
Walker , the former head of Defence Intelligence , said : " There is only one reason that the inquiry is being heard in private and that is to protect past and present members of this Government .
There are 179 reasons why the military want the truth to be out on what happened over Iraq . "
As a former deputy chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee , Sir John was asked for advice by members of the Defence Intelligence Service unhappy at the way the " dodgy dossier " on weapons of mass destruction was being put together .
" We have worrying questions about how intelligence was ramped up to suit Tony Blair and his cronies and their reasoning for invasion , " he said .
" There is no reason why intelligence officials alone should have to carry the can for this .
If there is anything particularly secret – and God knows there is precious little left secret over Iraq – then that can be heard in camera . "
Major General Julian Thompson , who was highly decorated for his command of the Royal Marines in the Falklands , said : " I do not see why this has been based on the Franks inquiry into the Falklands .
At that time the Cold War was on and protecting Western secrets in things like communication was used as the reason to hold the inquiry in secret .
That is certainly not the case now .
Also , the Falklands was essentially a failure of intelligence .

" Here we are looking at something much more serious : the allegation that a British government manipulated intelligence to take part in an illegal war .
" There is no reason why the public should not be able to hear the witnesses and judge what they say for themselves .
We should not have to depend on a group of people handpicked by the current Government .
A report from a secret inquiry will look like a whitewash . "
One serving senior officer who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan said : " It was a political decision to go to war and we followed orders , although a lot of us had private reservations .
" One thing I do remember is how urgent procurement orders were delayed and delayed because the Government wanted to pretend it was still following diplomatic channels .
This was one of the main reason for the shortages we faced and this resulted in lives being lost .
We wo n't mind details of that coming out to the public . "
The Tories hope to defeat the Government next Wednesday by holding an opposition day debate demanding that " the proceedings of the Committee of Inquiry should whenever possible be held in public " .
Labour rebels are drumming up support among colleagues to back the motion , with one saying he would do " everything in my power " to force Mr Brown into a U - turn .
Defeat six weeks ago in a Liberal Democrat opposition day debate about Gurkhas ' rights to live in the UK made the Prime Minister change government policy .
Mr Hague said there was " clearly a widespread dissatisfaction across all parties and throughout the country " over the format .
" There is still time for them to put this right .
To have real credibility , the inquiry needs to be open to the public whenever possible and to have a wider and more diverse membership . "
Even senior Labour loyalists have been angered by the inquiry 's parameters .
The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee , Mike Gapes , openly criticised the Prime Minister last night .
It was " a missed opportunity " , he said .
" A major reason for holding this inquiry was to reassure the public that nothing was being held back because it has been such a controversial topic .
This will not help , " he added .
Cameron would not stop Blair 's EU bid
David Cameron has said he would allow Tony Blair a free run at becoming the EU 's first president .
According to reports , the Tory leader has informed senior colleagues not to oppose a Blair candidacy if the Lisbon Treaty , which creates the role , is ratified later this year .
The issue is a thorny one for Mr Cameron , who has refused to answer questions about a Blair candidacy on the grounds that his party opposes the treaty .
Putting Palin as the head would lead to utter defeat of any coup .
Here 's the real story behind the Palin resignation :
Sarah Palin Resigns : Is She Fleeing Scandal ?
By Tana Ganeva , AlterNet
Posted on July 4 , 2009 , Printed on July 4 , 2009
http://www.alternet.org/bloggers/www.alternet.org/...
At a news conference on the lawn of her Wasilla home yesterday morning , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin announced that she 'll give up her post in the next few weeks .
A day later , Palin ’s abrupt and confounding move has left political analysts and the media scrambling for an explanation .
Many observers expected Palin to say that she was not seeking re-election – a prediction driven by speculation that the Governor is preparing for a Presidential bid in 2012 .
But Palin 's shocking announcement seems to belie plans for a Presidential run .
As Josh Marshall points out at TPM , " Generally , when you run for election to a high office it 's understood that you 'll stick around to do the job . "
Some observers have nevertheless toyed with the idea that Palin is quitting to free up time to campaign .
Conservartive columnist Bill Kristol wrote in the Weekly Standard blog :
If Palin wants to run in 2012 , why not do exactly what she announced today ?
It 's an enormous gamble - but it could be a shrewd one .
After all , she 's freeing herself from the duties of the governorship .
Now she can do her book , give speeches , travel the country and the world , campaign for others , meet people , get more educated on the issues - and without being criticized for neglecting her duties in Alaska .
But many Presidential hopefuls finish up their time in office .
And Palin 's rambling statement did little to lay the groundwork for a future campaign : the Alaska Governor vaguely stated that she would do more good " outside government " and issued some Nixonian grumblings about the press , according to a reporter at the scene to whom Palin allegedly said : " You are naive if you do n't see a full - court press on the national level , picking apart a good point guard . "
( Palin did , however , also offer some suspiciously campaigny - sounding rhetoric : " I 'm not wired to operate under the same old politics as usual . " )
Many analysts also point out that Palin ’s resignation highlights her main weakness in a potential Presidential run — that many conservative elites see her as unprepared to serve for National Office .
John Weaver , a former strategist for the McCain campaign said “ If this is her launching pad for 2012 , it 's a curious move .
Policy is politics , and she has no real accomplishments as governor " according to the AP .
With little information coming from the Palin camp following the announcement , observers speculate that Palin ’s bizarre decision and rushed press conference point to a brewing scandal .
( If it turns out Palin is fleeing office in the face of some bombshell revelation scandalous enough to kill any chances she might have in 2012 , we would be averaging the loss of one GOP Presidential hopeful per week over the past month . )
Even in the absence of a Mark Sanford - style drama , Palin may be resigning to escape ongoing ethics inquires .
The state of Alaska has spent nearly $ 300,000 investigating ethics complaints against the Governor .
Palin has said that contesting the complaints has cost her family $ 500,000 .
The widely publicized inquiry into Palin ’s firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan after he refused to can the state trooper involved in a divorce with Palin ’s sister is the most prominent of over a dozen investigations .
Others include allegations that Palin used the governor 's office for personal gain by receiving improper gifts , and that she used state time and resources for partisan political purposes .
( The AP has the full list here )
Max Blumenthal , writing for the Daily Beast , points to Todd and Sarah Palin ’s suspicious ties to Spenard Building Supplies ( SBS ) , an Alaskan contractor .
Blumenthal writes that the Feds may be launching an investigation into whether Palin and her husband helped bring lucrative contracts to the company in exchange for gifts :
Though Todd Palin told Fox News he built his Lake Lucille home with the help of a few " buddies , " according to Barrett ’s report , public records revealed that SBS supplied the materials for the house .
While serving as mayor of Wasilla , Sarah Palin blocked an initiative that would have required the public filing of building permits — thus momentarily preventing the revelation of such suspicious information .
Just months before Palin left city hall to campaign for governor , she awarded a contract to SBS to help build the $ 13 million Wasilla Sports Complex .
The most expensive building project in Wasilla history , the complex cost the city an addition $ 1.3 million in legal fees and threw it into severe long - term debt .
For SBS , however , the bloated and bungled project was a cash cow .
Whatever facts may emerge , Palin ’s latest bewildering move ha

When the PHP internals team announced that it would be using the backslash as a namespace separator my stomach turned a bit .
I was n't alone .
But why the backslash ?
The whole debacle last October left an awful taste in my mind .
It killed the anticipation of transitioning the Recess Framework to native namespaces .
Was PHP dying the slow death it seemed ?
The dread of it enabled me to put off using namespaces until forcing myself to this week .
Putting off moving forward with namespaces until now was a big , regrettable mistake .
Prior to native namespace support frameworks and libraries could optimize for either :
Simple class names , at cost of higher collision potential .
Few class name collisions , at cost of convoluted class names .
Since 2003
I 've been using a Library class that simulates namespace - style naming and importing , allows for sensible source code organization , and optimizes for simple class names .
<? php // Recess Namespace Work - around Pre 5.3 // In Folder : recess / db/orm / Library : :import ('recess.lang.Object ' ) ; class Model extends Object {} $ model = new Model ( ) ; ?>
In the PHP community at large this was n't the recommended style because of the higher likelihood of class name clashing .
The recommended style , that PEAR and Zend standardized around , brings the namespace information into the classname itself and would look like this :
<? php // Community Standard Namespace Work - around Pre 5.3 // In Folder : recess / db/orm / class Recess_DB_ORM_Model extends Recess_Lang_Object {} $ model = new Recess_DB_ORM_Model( ) ; ?>
The upside of the PHP community - at - large solution is a simple autoloader can replace underscores with slashes and you 'll find the file .
You 're also unlikely to find someone else who wants to name a class Recess_DB_ORM_Model .
( I 'm not sure you 'll find anyone who wants to name a class that . )
The bottom line is without namespace support PHP developers had to make really dumb trade - offs .
Either use ridiculous class names like ' Zend_Gdata_Calendar_Extension_Timezone ' or accept that clashing could happen if you 're trying to mix and match lots of 3rd party libraries .
Finally namespaces in PHP 5.3 remove the need for any of these trade - offs , and even with backslashes , are a joy to use :
<? php //
Namespacing with 5.3 namespace recess\\db\\orm ; use recess\\lang \ \Object ; class Model extends Object {} $ model = new Model ( ) ; ?>
The good news for Recess is that this means updating the codebase involves adding a namespace directive to the top of each class file and changing all occurances of " Library : : import ( ' foo.bar.
Class ' ) ; " to " use foo\ \bar\ \Class ; " and we 're pretty much set .
After using namespaces in 5.3 I 'm more than sold , I 'm in lust .
Contrary to my initial , reactionary beliefs PHP's new namespaces are incredibly well thought out and incredibly well implemented .
Sure , they 'd look a lot better if they were in the language from the start , but so goes the life of a language whose design is driven by demand and not theory .
Namespaces are not going to be the straw to break PHP 's back , in fact , they 're likely the brace that saves PHP 's back .
Of all of 5.3's new features including lambdas / closures , late static binding , etc. , namespaces are the feature that will impact the community - at - large the most by enabling consistency between 3rd - party libraries with no naming ugliness or compromising .
So Why all the Bikeshed Discussion on HN and Proggit ?
I remember that sinking moment in October when I saw the thread on HN revealing the new namespacing scheme .
I read the PHP internals team discussion on it .
I ran into Joel 's office and lamented over PHP .
" Idiots !
They considered using the smiley face as a namespace seperator !
Are they trying to kill PHP ? "
My gut reaction was along the lines of most of the responses on HN .
It looked like a bad idea , it read like a bad idea , it felt like a bad idea .
In retrospect the circus of negativity around the new namespaces boiled down to three things :
As programmers and language lovers it 's really easy to get drawn into a heated bikeshed debate on something as trivial as the character a language chooses for delimiting a new token in their programming language .
It 's easy to dismiss PHP 's every move as a programming language .
What 's hard to appreciate is that PHP is the most widely used dynamic language that exists .
The internals team carries the weight of knowing when they change the PHP language it has wider - ranging impact than every other dynamic language .
The internals team dropped the ball when communicating the change with the outside world .
After using namespaces it is clear that the IRC conversation and wiki- justification did not capture or express the amount of forethought that went into PHP 's new namespace design .
Reading the IRC log it 's easy to conclude " these people are idiots ! " , but after using what they were deciding upon it 's easy to conclude " these people are brilliant ! "
Still do n't believe me ?
Before reacting try building something with it .
The future of PHP is looking bright again , folks , much thanks to the internals team .
The bad news is for language lovers : your prettier , princelier languages wo n't be killing the homely , pragmatic monster anytime soon .
PHP is now much stronger as language and a platform repositioned for growth .
ISTANBUL —
First came " Big Brother , " about which many here had their doubts .
Then came " The Big Donor Show , " a highly questionable Dutch brainchild in which candidates — not contestants — competed to donate their kidney to a terminally ill patient .
But just when you thought television shows could not get any more outrageous , those wacky Turks launch " Penitents Compete . "
The premise of this TV reality show sounds like an old joke : “ What do you get when you put a rabbi , a Buddist monk , a Greek Orthodox priest and a Muslim imam in the room with 10 atheists ? ”
It brings together local leaders of four religions who then try to convert a group of 10 atheists to their respective faiths on live television .
" Penitents Compete " ( " Tovbekarlar Yarıs ıyor " in Turkish ) will air on Turkish television channel Kanal T this September .
And the prize for those who find a new relationship with the almighty ?
An all - expenses paid pilgrimage to a holy site of their newly chosen religion — Mecca for Muslims , the Vatican for Christians , Jerusalem for Jews and Tibet for Buddhists .
Only true non-believers need apply .
A commission of eight theologians will assess the atheist credentials of would - be contestants before deciding whom to accept on the show .
Let ’s begin with the objections to this merger of faith and entertainment , from those who accuse it of syndicating salvation .
Turkey ’s state - run Religious Affairs Directorate has so far refused to provide an imam for the show , arguing that the show ’s format trivializes what is meant to be a deeply personal decision .
“ Doing something like this for the sake of ratings is disrespectful to all religions .
Religion should not be a subject for entertainment programs , ” the chairman of the High Board of Religious Affairs , Hamza Aktan , told state news agency Anatolian after news of the planned program emerged .
Besides which , religion is a sensitive subject in predominantly Muslim Turkey because of the country ’s strictly secular constitution , which outlaws most displays of faith in public life .
Still others see the show as fueling a widespread intolerance of atheism .
“ The point of the show is to convert atheists , as if there is something wrong with them that needs to be fixed , ” argued Selma Ergec , a dancer , sitting in a cafe off of Istanbul ’s crowded Istiklal Street .
“ Yes , I am a Muslim .
But no one should be manipulated into changing their beliefs by a game show . ”
The makers of the show insist that " Penitents Compete " is meant to spread awareness of other religious faiths , not mock them .
“ The project aims to turn disbelievers on to God , ” the station ’s deputy director , Ahmet Ozdemir , told the Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review .
The program ’s slogans are testament to these goals .
Advertisements range somewhere between fortune cookie - like messages ( “ You will find serenity in this competition ” ) and the motto for a religious retreat ( “ We give you the biggest prize ever : we represent the belief in God ” ) .
“ We do n’t approve of anyone being an atheist .
God is great and it does n’t matter which religion you believe in .
The important thing is to believe , ” said Seyhan Soylu , Kanal T’s chief executive .
Then there is the problem of those contestants who , tempted by the thought of a free holiday , may just claim to have seen the light .
The show promises that the converted will face rigorous scrutiny to guarantee the legitimacy of their salvation .
“ They ca n’t see this trip as a getaway , but as a religious experience , ” Ozdemir said .
How this determination will actually be made , however , remains vague .
Sociologist Nilufer Narl from Istanbul Bahcesehir University argues that the project focuses attention on the issue of religious identity in Turkey , where rights groups have raised concerns over freedom of religion for non-Muslims .
" It is the reflection of rising curiosity toward religion , " said Narl , adding that for the past 10 years there has been an increase in people ’s interest in topics such as religion .
It appears that there are already a number of atheists looking for either salvation or vacation .
Already there are more than 200 atheist applicants eager to ponder whether to believe or not to believe , 10 of whom will be selected for the show ’s premiere .
Which leaves us with only one more question : “ What do the atheists win if they get one of the clerics to abandon his faith ? ” asked Ergec with a smile .

Police baffled as dozens of ' suicidal ' cows throw themselves off cliff in the Alps
In the picturesque Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen , the locals are worried .
Dozens of alpine cows appear to be committing suicide by throwing themselves off a cliff near the small village in the Alps .
In the space of just three days , 28 cows and bulls have mysteriously died after they plunged hundreds of metres to rocks below where they were killed instantly .
Swiss mystery : Dozens of cows ' bodies litter the valley floor after they mysteriously fell from the alpine cliff many feet above
In each case , local mountain rescue services using a helicopter had to be called in to remove the bodies because of the danger to the local groundwater of pollution .
A police spokesman said : ' There are no large carnivores living in the Alps anymore who would once have disposed of the bodies so they have to be moved .
' We are investigating because cows growing up in the mountains normally can estimate dangers and do not plunge down cliffs . '
According to local reports , there had been violent thunderstorms in the area which may well have spooked the animals .
Cows wandering at high altitude are a common sight across much of the Alps , where farmers let them loose to graze on the green plateaus above the villages .
Cows graze in the picturesque mountains and valleys of Lauterbrunnen , right
Often carrying large bells around their necks , most are dairy cows as the mix of vegetation and grasses at that high altitude are particularly good for milk and for making cheese .
Cows do occasionally fall to their deaths in these Alpine regions although it is rare for so many to fall in one particular place .
There has been speculation in the past that when this does happen it is because a tightly - grouped number have followed each other as they search for more grass .
Most scientists generally believe that animals are incapable of committing suicide .
Even lemmings , which by popular myth throw themselves off cliffs during mating season , do not take their own lives intentionally .
Instead , evolutionary pressures cause them to feel the urge to change habitat at which point they migrate in huge droves .
Sometimes , particularly in Scandinavia , they reach clifftops overlooking an ocean and , driven by the urge to cross a body of water , throw themselves off in order to swim to the other side .
They often die of exhaustion or drown as a result .
The myth came to the public 's attention when a Disney wildlife film in the 1950s mocked up the lemming migration to make it look like the animals had committed suicide .
The cause was pulmonary fibrosis , a lung disease , said Garry Ridge , president and chief executive of the WD - 40 Company .
The company says surveys show that WD - 40 , the slippery stuff in the blue and yellow aerosol can , can be found in as many as 80 percent of American homes and that it has at least 2,000 uses , most discovered by users themselves .
These include silencing squeaky hinges , removing road tar from automobiles and protecting tools from rust .
Mr. Barry was not part of the Rocket Chemical Company in 1953 , when its staff of three set out to develop a line of rust - prevention solvents and degreasers for the aerospace industry in a small lab in San Diego .
It took them 40 attempts to work out the water displacement formula .
The name WD - 40 stands for “ water displacement , formulation successful in 40th attempt . ”
Convair , a unit of General Dynamics , first used WD - 40 to protect the outer skin of the Atlas missile from rust and corrosion .
The product worked so well that employees sneaked WD - 40 cans out of the plant to use at home .
Norm Larsen , the Rocket Chemical technician who invented WD - 40 , soon came up with the idea of selling it to the general public .
WD - 40 hit store shelves in San Diego in 1958 .
In 1961 , employees came in on a Saturday to produce the first truckload shipment to meet disaster needs of victims of Hurricane Carla on the Gulf Coast .
WD - 40 was used to recondition flood - damaged vehicles .
Sales continued to increase , but it was the arrival of Mr. Barry as president and chief executive in 1969 that jolted the company to dominance in its unusual niche market .
He immediately changed the name of Rocket Chemical to the WD - 40 Company , on the indisputable theory that it did not make rockets .
Mr. Barry was fiercely dedicated to protecting the secret formula of WD - 40 , not to mention its trademarks and distinctive container .
The company never patented WD - 40 , in order to avoid having to disclose the ingredients publicly .
Its name became synonymous with the product , like Kleenex .
Mr. Barry acknowledged in interviews with Forbes magazine in 1980 and 1988 that other companies , including giants like 3 M and DuPont , made products that closely resembled WD - 40 .
“ What they do n’t have , ” he said , “ is the name . ”
Mr. Barry brought marketing coherence and discipline to the company .
He spruced up the packaging and increased the advertising budget , but most of all he pushed for distribution .
He emphasized free samples , including the 10,000 the company sent every month to soldiers in the Vietnam War to keep their weapons dry .
Within a little more than a decade , Mr. Barry was selling to 14,000 wholesalers , up from 1,200 when he started .
He kept tight control of the product .
When Sears wanted to package WD - 40 under its own label , Mr. Barry said no .
When another big chain wanted the sort of price concessions to which it was accustomed , he refused .
He pushed to get WD - 40 into supermarkets , where people buy on impulse .
He also began an aggressive effort to sell WD - 40 in foreign countries .
“ We may appear to be a manufacturing company , ” Mr. Barry said to Forbes , “ but in fact we are a marketing company . ”
Under Mr. Barry ’s leadership , annual sales increased from $ 2 million in 1970 to $ 91 million in 1990 .
WD - 40 reported sales of $ 317 million in 160 countries in its most recent fiscal year .
John Steven Barry was born in Minneapolis on Aug. 31 , 1924 .
He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Minnesota , then enlisted the United States Navy in a program for officer candidates , under which he studied at Harvard and Columbia .
He then earned a master ’s degree in business from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and went to work for 3M .
He was soon recalled by the Navy to serve in the Korean War .
He returned to 3 M and worked for it and other companies until he succeeded his father - in - law , Cy Irving , as president of what would soon become the WD - 40 Company .
After resigning the company presidency , Mr. Barry stayed on as chairman until 2000 .
Mr. Barry is survived by his wife of 56 years , the former Marian Irving ; his sons , Randy and Steve ; his daughter , Deborah Faneros ; and four grandchildren .
People ’s enthusiasm for sending in ideas for using WD - 40 mushroomed under Mr. Barry .
The uses included preventing squirrels from climbing into a birdhouse ; lubricating tuba valves ; cleaning ostrich eggs for craft purposes ; and freeing a tongue stuck to cold metal .
A bus driver in Asia used WD - 40 to remove a python that had coiled itself around the undercarriage of his bus .
The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Housing and Urban Development advise ( but do not require ) remediation if lead levels in soil exceed 400 parts per million in children ’s play areas and 1,200 p.p.m. elsewhere .
But some states and cities have set much lower limits .
For example , 100 p.p.m. is considered hazardous in Minneapolis .
In the Netherlands , 40 p.p.m. is unacceptable .
Unpolluted soil averages 10 p.p.m. Mr. Meuschke ’s soil had lead levels of 939 p.p.m .
Since 2003 , hazardous amounts of lead have been documented in backyard and community gardens in New York as well as in Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Detroit , Indianapolis , Los Angeles , Minneapolis , New Orleans , Philadelphia and Washington .
Lead - laden soil has been found not only in inner city neighborhoods but also suburban areas .
“ It does n’t matter if you ’re rich or poor , ” said David Johnson , a professor of environmental chemistry at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse , where he has found lead concentrations as high as 65,000 p.p.m. in the yards of upscale homes .
“ Lead knows no socioeconomic boundaries . ”
Excessive lead in soil is the legacy not only of lead paint but also of leaded gasoline , lead plumbing and lead arsenate pesticides .
Although these products were outlawed decades ago , their remnants linger in the environment .
Lead batteries and automotive parts , particularly wheel balancing weights , are still widely used and are sources of soil contamination .
Soil is likely to contain high levels of lead if it is near any structure built before 1978 , when lead - based paint was taken off the market , or if a building of that vintage was ever demolished on the site .
Pesticides containing lead were often used on fruit trees , so land close to old orchards is also of concern .
And beware of soil around heavily trafficked roadways ; it , too , is probably laced with lead .
But environmental engineers and soil experts said any place is potentially tainted .
“ It ’s kind of a dirty secret nobody really knows about because we ’re all distracted worrying about lead in toys from China , ” said Gabriel Filippelli , a professor of earth science at Indiana University - Purdue University in Indianapolis who has published several papers on lead accumulation in soil .
His and other research indicates lead levels in people ’s blood correspond directly to the amount of lead in the soil where they live .
Palestinian youth activists Yousef Nijim and Faris Arouri , in collaboration with the Dutch NGO “ Send a Message Foundation , ” are engaged in a nonviolent campaign to combat the oppressive infrastructure of Israeli occupation .
Setting their sites on the separation barrier which destructively meanders through Palestinian life and land , they assert their international solidarity and national identity through graffiti art .
Stenciling words , images and ideals loftier than the heights of their concrete canvas , they hope to draw international attention to the plight of the Palestinian people .
In an article on the Palestine News Network , Nijim notes that “ The messages bond people to this place . ”
He believes that engaging with the Wall is the best way to resist it .
“ If you do n’t deal with it , it wo n’t be gone , ” he adds .
For around $ 40 , anyone in the world can have a message or slogan painted on the wall , as long as it is not an incitement to hatred , violence or otherwise contrary to the peaceable objectives of the project .
The money is used by Arouri and his volunteers for spray paint , gas for their car , and for community - development projects in Palestinian neighborhoods designed to increase youth participation in volunteer activities .
According to TIME magazine , nearly 850 messages , ranging in content from the juvenile romantic to the politically poetic , have already been painted .
( Check out www.sendamessage.nl to see some works in progress and to find out how you can send your own message . )
This artistic and creative approach to resisting the occupation and denouncing the wall has led to confrontation with Israeli Occupation Forces , yet Nijim notes that the army is generally reluctant to interfere with their projects .
“ I would say [ there have been ] a few face to face encounters , ” he says .
“ But the whole project is about media , so they stay away from us . ”
Criticism of their work is not exclusive to Israeli forces , but also comes from Palestinians who believe they are trying to capitalize on the Wall .
On the whole , however , local sentiment continues to be encouraging and supportive of the work that Send a Message is doing .
I recall the moments of my work organizing protests and demonstrations against the wall in Qalqilya and Jayyous with the International Solidarity Movement .
I remember the bouts of frustration that led many youth to attempt to dismantle portions of the wall , only to be met with harsh reprisals and collective punishment by the Israeli Occupation Forces .
As in Jayyous and other rural areas of the West Bank , not all portions of the barrier are concrete but rather chain link fences reinforced with steel and barbed wire .
Graffiti is not an option there .
Soldiers would often close the barrier ’s entry / exit points and deny farmers access to their lands if they found evidence that locals were attempting to tamper with or destroy any portion of the barrier .
But Palestinians must continue to imbue their own lives with meaning in the ways that they see fit given their circumstances .
And those struggling in the path of nonviolence must be even more creative , patient and enduring .
The fact remains that the Wall must fall .
Whether concrete or fence , none of it is morally sustainable nor can it resist the tides of justice .
The writing on the wall reminds us all .
Linux distributions come and go by the dozens almost every day , and most of them live and die an unknown , irrelevant life , mostly because no , changing three icons and adding the suffix ‘ - nix ’ to any random word does n’t make it different from Ubuntu .
Anyway , sometimes , a new distribution is started that brings something new to the table .
One such “ distribution ” is Glendix , which aims to combine the Linux kernel with the userpsace tools from Plan 9 .
Distribution is probably not the right term for this project .
We all know what Linux is , but what exactly is Plan 9 ?
Plan 9 , developed at Bell Labs , was supposed to become the successor to UNIX , also developed at Bell Labs .
Plan 9 was written from scratch , and made many radical departures from standard UNIX conventions .
For instance , in Plan 9 , everything really is a file ; even the window a program is running in is represented as a file in a hierarchical file system .
Every program in Plan 9 sees every possible resource as a file .
Plan 9 is also fully distributed , so that parts of the operating system can run on different machines .
Plan 9 never made its way out of the research departments , and the reason is fairly simple : UNIX is good enough .
It might not be exactly elegant , but it gets the job done .
The Glendix developers aim to combine the Plan 9 userspace tools with the Linux kernel .
According to them , the Plan 9 kernel is limited when it comes to hardware support , and this is where Linux comes into play .
In this project , we decouple Linux from GNU utilities , and port Plan 9 user - space applications to run on the Linux kernel .
In summary , we are combining the Plan 9 user - space with the Linux kernel - space – resulting in a hybrid operating system .
We think this would oer the best of both worlds – great hardware support with a cutting - edge application development environment .
The primary goal of the project is to create a Linux based operating system that includes the most important user - space applications from Plan 9 .
For brevity , we restrict our work to only the Intel x86 architecture .
The project is obviously not done or ready for mass consumption , but you can already dive into the source code .
There are also two papers you can read for more information .

The problem , again , is NOT the propaganda – it is those who chose to believe it !
The success of religion may be the fault of non-believers ( or , if you look at it the other way around , thank god for the atheists ! )
At least that is one interpretation of a recent individual - based simulation study of social evolution conducted by James Dow at Oakland University in Rochester , Michigan , and published in a recent issue of the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation ( vol. 11 , no. 2 2 ) .
Dow built a simulation program ( appropriately called evogod ) that explored the question of how religion — i.e. , a system based on passing along false or unverifiable information about the world — can spread in a society .
There are , of course , several theories out there about the evolution of religion , falling into two broad categories : either religion is somehow advantageous and is therefore the result of natural selection , or it is a byproduct of other characteristics of the human brain and social organization .
The first possibility comes in two main flavors : the advantage could accrue to religious individuals ( standard individual - level natural selection ) or groups ( invoking the more controversial mechanism of group selection ) .
Dow ’s study explores the possibility that religious belief spread because of an individual advantage of some sort .
The first interesting result from the simulations is that under most tested scenarios religion actually does not survive !
This is presumably because there is an obvious cost ( in terms of sheer Darwinian fitness ) to buying into fanciful notions about how the world works .
How is it possible , then , that practically every human society has gotten the religious virus ?
The most surprising result of Dow ’s study is that religion spreads only if non-religious people help it by supporting the religious !
How is this possible ?
The simulation ’s structure was not designed to address the question of what mechanism could induce non-religious people to help religious ones , but some possibilities have been suggested nonetheless .
According to Dow , “ if a person is willing to sacrifice for an abstract god then people feel like they are willing to sacrifice for the community ” ( the so - called “ greenbeard ” effect ) .
This is a social version of a well - established evolutionary idea known as the “ handicap principle , ” where males who can parade useless and costly attributes ( be they peacock 's feathers or Ferrari sports cars ) are more likely to attract females because they are sending the indirect signal that their genes are so good that they can waste energy and resources just to please the female .
It attempts to induce the female to imagine what sort of offspring they might be able to produce if only the female would consent to ...
As bizarre and irrational as this sort of scenario may seem , there is independent empirical evidence , for instance from studies of Israeli kibbutzim , that religious people do tend to receive more assistance than less religious ones from the rest of the community , again perhaps because they inspire trust .
Ironically , of course , this trust originates not because the religious provide more truthful information about the world , but precisely because they display a high degree of commitment to delivering non-verifiable information !
Humans , you ’ve got to love them .
I just read a fantastic article on Forbes about a topic that I have been wondering a lot about : continued gentrification of Chicago as the recession drags on .
I have been pessimistic about the chances that neighborhoods like Uptown would continue to renew and rebuild …be a magnet for the middle class .
However , after reading this interview with Pat Lashinsky of Zipreality.com , Michael Feder of Radar Logic , Spencer Rascoff of Zillow.com , and Peter Slatin of Real Capital Analytics , I ’m beginning to think my pessimism may have been misplaced .
At least I hope it was and their optimism is correct .
People Want to Live Close to Work
The first point for optimism is , as Mr. Lashinsky pointed out , that people want to live as close to work as is possible .
It seems to me that two facts are going to keep this trend going : First , is the cost of energy : with gas going up to over $ 3.00 a gallon in the past couple of weeks , and very little long - term chance that the 30 mile commutes will ever be as economically feasible as they were when gas was $ 1.00 a gallon , this trend is likely to not reverse any time soon .
The second fact is that Chicago is a gorgeous place to live now .
The gentrification that has happened in Chicago has made it not only possible , but down right attractive to live in the city for nearly everyone .
Of course , the Loop is not the only area in Chicagoland with jobs .
The suburbs lay claim to some of the area ’s largest employers ; some of my friends actually reverse commute from the central part of the city to the far flung suburbs .
However , when young people move to Chicago looking for work , they are n’t dreaming of living in a generic box behind another generic box off a cul - de-sac in a faceless suburban sprawl .
They are dreaming of brownstones , high rises , and walking down bustling sidewalks to meet friends at sidewalk cafes .
This is going to mean that much of the young talent is going to be located in the city .
Hopefully this means that new upstart companies , as well as the Fortune 500 , will continue to want to call Chicago home and the upward spiral will continue .
But , if the job losses continue and young people continue to give up on their dreams of big -city life ( as the rental data is hinting at ) in order to return to live with their parents outside of the city , this force for renewal and growth will be gone .
Price Is Relative
As someone who grew up in Montana and South Dakota and then having spent ten years living in Tokyo , I have experienced both ends of the price - per - square - foot continuum .
While living in Tokyo I did n’t think twice about spending $ 2,500 a month for our tiny one - bedroom apartment ?
a price that could have allowed me a five bed , five bath , four - car garage with a pool in my hometown .
But I wanted to live in Tokyo and my income allowed us to live very comfortably even with that rent .
Actually , I ’ve never had more disposable income than when I was paying the most for a home I ever have .
People understand this .
They know that relatively speaking , right now is an amazing time to buy .
Mortgage rates are at historic lows and prices are bottoming out at RELATIVELY amazing prices .
As Mr. Slatin put it in the article , “ The concept of a ‘ great ’ deal remains relative , and is n’t that what pricing is all about ? ”
The bottom line is for many people , the cost - to - performance of living in central Chicago is still very low .
This is going to mean that the demand for homes is going to remain and gentrification of neighborhoods is likely going to continue , but undoubtedly at a slower pace .
Slow Gentrification is Still Progress … Gains Will Hold
Mr. Slatin had a wonderful quote in this article in response to discussion about Bucktown and The Westloop ,
While there will surely be regression in some newly gentrified neighborhoods , for the most part , gains will hold .
Residents , investors , retailers , etc. will fight to keep areas moving up or at least flat .
Where holes do develop–and they will –investors will buy up REO .
There ’s still plenty of life and enticement in most of these neighborhoods , and emptied out tracts are far less alluring .
The other panelists agreed with him , but made sure to say that the progress we have seen in the past years will slow .
The coffee shops , restaurants , and boutiques going into the new areas of town may not survive , but eventually they will find the dollars they need to help transform the neighborhoods .
Chicago City Gov’t Has to Continue to Support the Growth of the Middle Class
Again , Mr. Slatin pointed out a large potential danger to the whole upward , albeit slow , spiral , “ One danger to these neighborhoods remains the inability of local governments to support their growth through schools , green space , transit , etc . ”
As I talk to my circle of friends , this is completely true .
One of the main reasons we are all still in the city is that there are fantastic public elementary schools for our children to attend .
But ask these people who have eschewed the suburbs for the convenience and vibrancy of the city what they are worried about and they all reply that there are not enough good high schools to accept all the fantastic kids coming out of the elementary schools .
Their parents stayed and took a chance on CPS , and under Arnie Duncan they by - and - large have delivered .
However , can we count on a Dailey insider who has never run a school let along a school system to continue this and deliver high schools that will prepare our children for college ?
I hope my concern is unfounded .
But of course it ’s not only about schools : potholes that gobble up trucks , the crumbling supports for the Metra and I - 90 we all pass by every day hoping the whole thing doe n’t come down on us like it did in Minneapolis , and reductions in police to protect the city area all trends that have to somehow be reversed .
As Always , It ’s All About Supply and Demand
The Forbes interviewer for the story was the prolific Chicagoan Stephane Fitch , who is apparently my not - so - far - away neighbor .
He talked about his neighborhood of Uptown .
… I live in Chicago ’s Uptown neighborhood .
Still , lots of gentrification needed in Uptown , I think it ’s fair to say .
It ’s the classic gentrification play .
But none of my neighbors thinks the gentrification will continue where I live .
Not with the nicer neighborhood just to my south , called Lakeview , looking more nearly affordable for modestly well - off professionals .
That sums it up … if the jobs stay , people will want to live in this beautiful , livable city and that will mean more jobs and continued renewal of amazing swaths of this amazing city we call home .
If the spiral does n’t continue up or at least stay flat , Lakeview will prevent Uptown from improving , and eventually Lincoln Park will begin to nibble away at Lakeview , and on down we will go .
I ’m optimistic and think ( hope ) we will continue to improve upon what is already here .

This entry was posted on Tuesday , August 25th , 2009 at 12:00 am and is filed under Chapter 1 , Comic Pages .
Hopped over to courtroom 14 - B at 500 Pearl Street yesterday afternoon where I saw Judge Jed Rakoff hammer SEC and Bank of America lawyers over the proposed settlement regarding Merrill Lynch bonuses .
The news is that Rakoff refused to approve the settlement .
He ordered the lawyers to get to the bottom of the “ who / what / where ” of the case , saying the settlement “ seems to be lacking in transparency . ”
He ’s asked them to file briefs answering those questions on the 24th , and then responses on September 9th .
The hearing itself was very interesting .
Rakoff was clearly very skeptical of the arguments presented by both legal teams , which seemed rather unimpressive .
The judge wondered immediately why , given the “ serious questions ” raised in its complaint , the SEC was n’t going after more facts .
If BofA and Merrill conspired to lie to shareholders about bonuses that had been agreed to when the merger was signed , then why is n’t the SEC trying to figure out who is responsible ?
“ Was it some sort of ghost ?
Who made the decision not to disclose [ the bonuses ] ? ” said Rakoff .
David Rosenfeld , lead lawyer for the SEC , meekly replied that they have n’t made any allegations against specific individuals .
This clearly did n’t satisfy Rakoff who argued that to make the complaint , they “ must have determined who physically committed these acts . ”
[ By the way , Rosenfeld struck a few of us in the gallery as badly prepared .
He seemed to stumble a lot , and the judge and court reporter repeatedly told him to speak up .
He was n’t familiar with specifics so frequently had to defer to another SEC lawyer .
Even though the hearing revolved around BofA ’s proxy filing , Rosenfeld and his team did n’t have a copy of the document with them . ]
So who led the merger negotiations when the discussion of bonuses came up ?
The SEC offered two names : Greg Curl for BofA and Greg Fleming for Merrill .
Of which the SEC says it has only spoken to one : Fleming .
Were details of those negotiations circulated to top management ?
Yes , Merill CEO John Thain and BofA CEO Ken Lewis were aware of them according to the SEC ’s lawyers .
But according to BofA ’s lawyer , Cleary Gottlieb ’s Lewis Liman , they apparently were n’t aware of what was in “ the disclosure schedule , ” the document where bonus details were laid out .
That schedule was supposed to be attached to the SEC filing detailing the merger .
Conveniently , it was n’t .
And of course that ’s nobody ’s fault .
Oddly , given Liman ’s insistence that the proxy was very thorough , Rakoff did n’t ask him why the disclosure schedule was n’t attached .
Rakoff also asked the SEC lawyers why the settlement is so puny .
A $ 33 m fine for $ 3.6 billion worth of misconduct ?
“ Why is n’t this a grossly unfair amount ? ” he asked .
SEC lawyer David Rosenfeld seemed badly prepared for this question .
He cited the Wachovia / First Union case , saying that $ 37 million settlement was the right precedent .
Again the judge was skeptical , noting it revolved around $ 500 million worth of misconduct .
Here you have $ 3.6 billion .
More to the point , perhaps , Rakoff asked why the settlement is being collected from the corporation and “ not from individuals responsible for orchestrating the misleading [ SEC filing ] ? ”
Rosenfeld mumbled something about the degree of misconduct , the need for deterrence and finding the closest precedent to justify the structure of the settlement .
As for going after specific individuals , Rosenfeld says he can ’t .
The executives are all hiding behind attorney - client privilege .
The judge was not impressed with this excuse , noting that if BofA execs are asserting they relied on advice of counsel , which they seem to be , then they have to waive privilege .
Liman offered some pretty pathetic arguments of his own …
People should n’t have been surprised by the Merrill bonuses because the company had already accrued $ 12 billion for that purpose through Q3 .
What do you do with this ?
Merrill may have had an accounting entry saying they owed their people bonus money , but Merrill would n’t have lasted long enough to PAY the bonuses had it not been for bailouts .
He argued that $ 3.6 billion was n’t a lot of money .
After all it worked out to an average of $ 91 k per recipient .
“ I ’m glad you think $ 91 k is n’t a lot of money , ” retorted the judge .
And in any case , as NY Atty General Cuomo reported two weeks ago , nearly 700 Merrill employees got bonuses north of $ 1 million .
149 got more than $ 3 million .
Liman also trotted out the cliché about bonuses being necessary for “ retention . ”
To this Rakoff responded with the obvious : “ how many banks were hiring people when the bonuses were paid ? ”
My least favorite defense argument was about the structure of TARP .
Since it came in the form of preferred stock , which has a fixed dividend , Liman argued its value was n’t impacted by expenses like bonuses .
Liman forgets that besides preferred , TARP investments included warrants , essentially options to buy common stock .
Of course the common is impacted by expenses .
And how is the value of preferred stock not impacted when $ 3.6 billion is subtracted from the balance sheet ?
That ’s a lot less cushion protecting preferred stockholders in bankruptcy .
Not exactly a far - fetched scenario only a few months back .
Last Liman argued that no one could have been misled by the bonuses because they were n’t a surprise .
He waved his hands in the air suggesting it would be impossible to find anyone , anywhere in the press who did n’t expect Merrill employees to get incentive comp .
This is Wall Street ( ! ) he protested .
Indeed it is .
EVIDENCE of a mass execution of young men thousands of years ago has been unearthed in a ‘ remarkable ’ archaeological find during the construction of the Weymouth Relief Road .
Experts are staggered by the discovery of the dismembered skeletons which are thought to date between late Iron Age to early Roman times .
Oxford Archaeology – contracted by Dorset County Council to undertake all the archaeological work throughout the relief road scheme – expected to uncover some artefacts because preliminary survey work had been undertaken before the earthworks began .
This included the finds at the Bronze Age burial grounds near Bincombe Bumps before Christmas .
But the latest discovery on Ridgeway Hill is seen as significant .
Council chiefs say the burial pit is strictly out of bounds to the public and the site is under 24 - hour security .
They stressed the development would not hold up work on the relief road as the pit is to the side of the main earthworks .
Oxford Archaeology project manager David Score and his team made the find when hedgerows were pulled up as the bulldozers moved in .
Mr Score said : “ The watching brief system means that we do n’t miss anything of importance and in this case we have found a remarkable burial pit .
“ We have counted 45 skulls so far , these are in one section of the pit , and several torsos and leg bones in separate sections of the pit .
“ It is rare to find a burial site like this .
There are lots of different types of burial where skeletons may be aligned along a compass axis or in a crouched position , but to find something like this is just incredible . ”
Mr Score said it was likely the remains were deposited in the pit due to a ‘ catastrophic event ’ such as war , disease or execution .
The skulls appear to be predominately those of young men , he said .
The remains will be taken to Oxford for detailed analysis where experts will try to piece together the story .
Archaeological finds from the Weymouth Relief Road will be offered to a Dorset museum after analysis work has been completed .
Dorset County Council Head of Highways Andy Ackerman said : “ It ’s standard practice for major schemes to ensure that archaeological investigations are undertaken .
We take this responsibility very seriously and have been working closely with Oxford Archaeology to ensure that appropriate time is programmed into the construction timetable .
“ Knowing that the care taken has helped lead to this exciting discovery makes the effort very worthwhile .
“ I ’d ask members of the public to continue to stay away from the archaeological works .
“ The burial pit is within the construction site which can be a dangerous environment . ”
UCSF scientists have discovered that a tiny filament extending from cells , until recently regarded as a remnant of evolution , may play a role in the most common malignant brain tumor in children .
The study , conducted in mice and in human brain tissue of medulloblastomas , coincides with a study by another team of UCSF scientists showing that the structure , known as primary cilium , also may play a role in basal cell carcinoma , the most common form of skin cancer .
( See related UCSF news release . )
The findings , both reported online on August 23 , 2009 in " Nature Medicine , " are the first direct evidence of a role of primary cilia in cancer , which the researchers say could lead to a new strategy for diagnosing subtypes of cancers and to potential targets for therapy .
" These findings are very exciting , " says the senior of the medulloblastoma study , Arturo Alvarez - Buylla , PhD , UCSF Heather and Melanie Muss Professor of Neurological Surgery and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF .
" In the last few years , primary cilia have been shown to be essential for the cell - signaling that drives both human development , including the differentiation of stem cells into neurons , and some diseases , including polycystic kidney disease .
The fact that the two UCSF studies implicate primary cilia in two totally different tissues suggests the finding is likely to be very general . "
Significantly , in both UCSF studies , the findings in mice revealed that primary cilia had opposing roles in cancers depending on which mutated genes initiated the aberrant cell - signaling events to begin with .
When one particular mutated protein was activated , removal of the cilium prevented the onset of disease ; when another particular gene was activated , absence of the cilium allowed cancers to develop .

Remarkably , an analysis of human tissue in the medulloblastoma study revealed that primary cilia were present in a subset of human tumors , but absent in others .
The presence and absence correlated with the cell - signaling pathways that were activated in the tumors .
This suggests , the researchers say , that , as in mice , some tumors in humans need to remove the primary cilia to grow , while other require its presence to grow .
The explanation , says the lead investigator of the medulloblastoma study , Young - Goo Han , PhD , a postdoctoral fellow in the Alvarez - Buylla lab , has to do , in part , with the way in which the primary cilium is structured and functions .
Unlike their beating cousins , known as motile cilia , or flagella -- which swish protozoa through pond water and undulate in the airways -- primary cilia are generally immobile , and function as cellular antennae .
They receive signals from other cells , allowing for their transmission , in a process known as signal transduction , down a pathway of signaling proteins -- some of which are located precisely in the cilia -- into the cytoplasm , ending at the cell 's nucleus , where the signals ' commands are issued .
One of the key signaling molecules in development is a secreted lipoprotein known as Hedgehog , which regulates tissue patterning , cell proliferation , and many other biological processes .
Recently , scientists have discovered that Hedgehog signaling functions through the primary cilium .
As Hedgehog approaches a target cell , it binds to its receptor , Patched1 ( Ptch1 ) , on the cilia , opening the gate for another protein , known as Smoothened ( Smo ) to enter into the cilium .
There , Smo , an essential activator of the Hedgehog pathway , initiates the biochemical cascade that leads to the activation of a " downstream " protein known as Gli2 , which in part communicates the Hedgehog signal to the cell 's nucleus .
Aberrant Hedgehog signaling is well known to lead to human cancers , including basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma .
However , it was not known if the cilium , itself , played a role in the development of cancers .
advertisement
Han engineered mice to continuously express a mutant form of Smo , known to cause cancers in humans .
In these mice , the mutant form of Smo moved to the cilium , independent of Ptch1 , driving the development of medulloblastoma .
When Han genetically removed the cilium , no tumors developed .
Predicting that continuously activating a protein in the signaling pathway downstream of Smo and primary cilia would induce tumors whether or not the cilium were present , Han activated Gli2 – and removed the cilium .
To the team 's astonishment , all of the mice developed medulloblastoma only when primary cilia were removed .
The explanation may be , the researchers say , that removing the primary cilium prevented it from carrying out one of its other jobs – activating proteins in its pathway whose jobs are to suppress Hedgehog signals .
Next , the team examined 38 samples of autopsied brain tissue donated to the UCSF Medical Center Neurological Surgery Tissue Bank and to the Neuropathology Laboratory at St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital .
Primary cilia were present in most cases of one form of the disease , known as desmoplastic medulloblastoma , and mostly absent in another , known as anaplastic medulloblastoma .
Of 24 tissue samples analyzed for their gene - expression profiles , primary cilia were identified almost exclusively in tumors driven by Hedgehog or Wnt signaling .
The findings have prompted the team to begin investigating primary cilia 's role not only in other subsets of medulloblastomas but also in glioblastomas , the most common brain tumor in adults , with an eye toward identifying a diagnostic strategy and therapeutic targets .
More broadly , they are considering other questions .
Most cells have a primary cilium , notes Alvarez - Buylla .
" I think people have paid little attention to this thin , cellular extension or have thought of it just as a remnant of a ciliated organism .
It 's become clear that it 's much more fascinating than that :
It may play critical binary roles in many decisions cells make , and may be particularly important in cancer .
In some cancers , the activating role of primary cilia is hijacked in order to keep the growth signal on ; in other cancers , it is removed to eliminate the off switch . "

Google has begun a new ad campaign for its enterprise services , but it is n't your typical Google venture — it 's going oldschool .
Starting today and running for the next four weeks in August , Google will be running a series of billboards — yes , real ones — in Boston , Chicago , New York , and San Francisco in order to showcase the benefits of " going Google " for business .
The hope is that more business owners will ditch managing their own e-mail , calendaring , and doc sharing solutions in favor of Google Apps — especially now that they 're out of beta .
For those who want to see the billboards for themselves , they will be placed along Highway 101 in San Francisco , the West Side Highway in New York , the Eisenhower Expressway in Chicago ( and that 's why we have n't rushed out to go see it yet ) , and the Mass Pike in Boston .
Google says that the billboards will be changed every single weekday for the next month , but you environmentalists in the crowd should worry not — all vinyl used on the billboards will be recycled and turned into either computer bags or shopping bags .
The story being told on the billboards will be about " an anonymous IT manager who gets so fed up with the typical IT status quo that his company eventually — you guessed it — goes Google . "
The billboards direct people to a new page on Google 's site , which emphasizes the benefits of Google Apps .
The company notes that workers who have " gone Google " do n't have to worry about full mailboxes or backing up their data , and that IT managers do n't waste time buying , installing , and managing their own e-mail servers .
In announcing the new ad campaign , the Internet giant also touted the roster of companies that have already made the switch to Google 's services , including Motorola , Genentech , Valeo , and the Washington , DC City Government .
It 's a message Google wants to drive home to the millions of people stuck in traffic every morning and evening .
The billboard campaign is just the latest move in Google 's long - running push into the enterprise .
The company finally ditched the " beta " status on many of its
Web apps last month , saying that businesses were hesitant to dive into Google Apps that may not be finished .
" We 've come to appreciate that the beta tag just does n't fit for large enterprises that are n't keen to run their business on software that sounds like it 's still in the trial phase , " Google product management director for enterprise products Matt Glotzbach said at the time .
Many businesses are still hooked on their own solutions , many of which are a cocktail of Office , Outlook , and various other Microsoft offerings .
In an attempt to wean admins from Exchange , Google introduced a tool earlier this year allowing IT Managers to migrate from an Exchange server to Google Apps with virtually no change from the end users ' perspective .
Billboards may not directly win converts to Google 's enterprise solutions , but they certainly will raise the company 's visibility as a serious alternative to Microsoft in the office .
I ’ve seen the original black - and - white version of The Fly and I ’ve seen the version of The Fly that grabs you by the genitals and tells you the true story of a teleportation accident that causes Jeff Goldblum to slowly transform into a horrible fly - monster goddamn .
Quick : name all of the skinny starting power forwards in the league .
OK , I ’ll give you another minute .
Maybe LaMarcus Aldridge ?
And even he has 20 pounds on Taj Gibson .
So it begs the question : will Taj Gibson ever be a starter in the NBA ?
Or will he merely be an energy guy ?
You need those too , to be sure .
Maybe the Bulls are n’t concerned about his label , or whether he starts or comes off the bench .
What they are concerned about is finding good defenders who can run opponents off the floor with Derrick Rose .
Tyrus can do it .
Even Joakim can do it now .
Gibson is another shot - blocking big that can run all day .
I ’m starting to come around on this pick .
And as much as every Bulls fan wants someone that can score down low and with their back to the basket , you did n’t see those available in the draft .
Gibson can be an important rotation piece for years to come .
And if the Bulls ever do trade Tyrus , they have something similar right behind him .
Same goes for James Johnson and Deng .
The Bulls did get better in the draft .
And they added to their options .
It ’s a kind of calligraphy , these ringlets and waves , hair combed , twisted and pinned .

Notice there are no flips .
In the beginning , we see a newborn empire in those Josephine curls .
The mid-20th century is marcelled .
And in recent decades , increasingly liberated first ladies sport more leonine locks .
Interestingly , there are no bangs .
Perhaps this has less to do with hair and more to do with campaign promises of marital harmony and world peace .

The Houston Rockets have answered the defection of Ron Artest to the Los Angeles Lakers by quickly reaching an agreement to sign Trevor Ariza away from L.A .
NBA front - office sources told ESPN.com that Ariza made a verbal commitment Tuesday night to sign a five - year deal with the Rockets on Wednesday -- the first day free agents are permitted to sign new contracts -- not long after the Lakers and Artest reached terms on a three - year deal worth an estimated $ 18 million .
ESPN.com 's Chris Sheridan reports that Ariza , according to sources , will receive the Rockets ' full mid-level exception , which is being projected to come in at $ 5.8 million for next season .
If the exception for the 2009 - 10 season is indeed set at $ 5.8 million Wednesday when the league announces next season 's salary cap and luxury tax , Ariza 's deal would be worth $ 33.5 million .
The Rockets shifted their focus away from Orlando Magic restricted free agent Marcin Gortat on Thursday when it became clear that Gortat was on the verge of reaching terms with the Dallas Mavericks and when it became known leaguewide that Ariza was determined to leave his hometown Lakers -- in spite of his vital contributions to L.A. 's championship run -- because they were unwilling to start his new contract higher than the mid-level exception .
Rockets general manager Daryl Morey immediately flew to Las Vegas to recruit Ariza in person and convinced him to join the Rockets over the Cleveland Cavaliers , who had strong interest in both Ariza and Artest and must now keep searching for a small forward on the open market such as Linas Kleiza or Anthony Parker .
The Lakers effectively declared that they preferred to have Artest -- older , physical , more versatile but also famously unpredictable -- at a lower price than the 6 - foot - 8 Ariza , who reached new levels of reliability as a defender , shooter and glue guy in the postseason .
Ariza shot 49.7 percent from the field and 47.6 percent on 3 - pointers in the postseason in 31.4 minutes per game , after averaging just 24.4 minutes per game during the regular season .

The Transporter TW ( Twin Wheel ) is based around an electric engine which produces a magnetic field to drive the large wheels .
The wheel rims are suspended over a superconducting fluid where the changing magnetic field produces the motion needed to propel the vehicle .
The power generator and motion is thus smooth , nearly noiseless and green .

Public health versus private health : understanding the differences can be literally life and death for a society or civilization .
The US has been slowly bankrupting itself providing exotic healthcare for all sorts of personal things including annoying sexual performance problems in the gnome community ( viagra ! ) .
The US under serves public healthcare while overspending on private healthcare and this is putting us at a severe disadvantage in trade as well as driving our government off the cliff ( of course , our many wars are also at fault here ) .
.
As per usual , the US public writhes with fear , agony and partisan anger as we try , for the umpteenth time , to develop a national health program that is as useful and frugal as 80 % of the top manufacturing nations on earth .
The health statistics for the US public are miserable .
We rank below nearly all of Europe and many Asian countries in longevity , child health and maternal deaths .
Yet we have the most expensive medical complex system on earth .
.
It is a mirror of our military / industrial complex .
Expensive , totally out of touch with pressing matters , focused mostly on cosmetic appearances and impossible to change .
And is bankrupting us .
The twin forces of our extravagant military and our deluxe but nonfunctional health systems are tearing our nation apart and both will ultimately destroy our entire civilization if not reined in , somehow .

One very bad problem we have , concerning healthcare , is differentiating between what is for the public good and what is private .
We are a collective .
Anyone who thinks he is an island , should move to one and not leave it .
The rest of us live in the middle of an ocean of humanity , all of us are interconnected in a wide variety of ways .
.
One way we are connected is , we share the same breathing spaces .
That is , people breathe in and out all over the place ( unless they are holding their breath ! ) and viruses love this aspiration methodology to aspire to multiply via coughing or sneezing .
When did the first virus evolve to spread via breathing ?
We do n’t know but I bet , it was around the same time the first amphibians began to walk on dry land .
.
When the first Labyrinthodontia came toddling ashore , it probably cast a glance over to another Labyrinthodontia and said , ‘ My nose itches .
* Achoo * ’ .
The other one said , ‘ Gesundheit , ’ and then went back into the water only it felt awfully sick the next day .
Long before the ruling elites tried to get rich , running the G7 nations , the real pests were the Virus Empire and the Bacterial Kingdom .
These two conglomeration of single celled party poopers have a long and stellar history of out - evolving all other life forms .
More about that later .
.
One of the main functions of any civilization that wishes to exist for very long is to deal with the Virus Empire and the Bacterial Kingdom and to keep them either at bay or under control .
Anytime a government loses control of these two dire bio armies , chaos and death ensue .
Out of curiosity , since I dislike simply assuming anything , here is a useful timeline about US public healthcare :
.
Health Care Law : U.S. Health Care Timelines
1796 : Congress refused to give the federal government authority to quarantine people with contagious diseases 1879 : First federal quarantine program established ( allowed to expire in 1884 ) 1887 : Public Health Service opened one - room lab in Staten Island marine hospital to do research on bacteria , vaccines , and quarantine techniques — forerunner of National Institutes of Health 50 years later 1902 : Biologics Control
Act enacted to regulate quality of vaccines and sera 1906 : Food and Drug Act enacted to prevent manufacture , sale , or transportation of ( harmful ) food , drugs , medicine , or liquor 1912 : Children ’s Bureau established 1917 : Public Health Service facilities authorized to provide medical care to WWI veterans with service - connected disabilities ; extended in 1933 to include medical and domiciliary care to all veterans of any war since 1897 , regardless of whether disabilities were service - connected 1918 : Chamberlain - Kahn
Act authorized first federal grants to states for public health services ( for control of venereal disease ) 1933 : Federal Emergency Relief Administration provided limited medical , dental , and nursing services for the medically indigent 1935 : Social Security
Act enacted to provide retirement and death benefits , a federal / state unemployment compensation system , federal grants to states in developing public health programs , and cash benefits to dependent children , the blind , and , in 1952 , the disabled .
Employer and employee contributions implemented in 1937 with each contributing 1 % of first $ 3,000 of wages .
No general health benefits were included .
1945 : Harry Truman was first president to present an official administration proposal for national health insurance to Congress
.
First off , Congress wanted everything to be state ’s rights issues .
So , if a state did n’t give a hoot or holler if vast plagues swept their own population ( i.e. : the slave states ) then , people would die left and right .
It is amazing to see how people ca n’t think very well : slaves were ‘ subhuman ’ ( see : Hitler ’s Master race ideology ) so it did n’t matter all that much if the slaves got sick .
The idea that illnesses sweeping through the wretched quarters of the field hand slaves could migrate to the Big House and kill the master ’s children , baffled slave owners .
After all , they thought , slaves were NOT humans at all so how could they give the ‘ real ’ humans ( Massa and his cuddly kids ) any diseases ?
.
We take for granted the idea that we know that germs cause diseases .
Unfortunately , this is false .
It was n’t even an American that found out about germs , it was a Frenchman .
And this revelation occurred at about the same time my godmother , who died at 105 years in 1964 , was born !

Louis Pasteur Quick Facts – Quick Facts – MSN Encarta
December 27 , 1822 .
Death September 28 , 1895 .
Place of Birth Dole , France .
Known for Founding microbiology .
Proposing the germ theory of disease , in which diseases arise from naturally existing microorganisms , not from spontaneous generation , the supposed formation of disease - causing organisms from nonliving matter .
Inventing the process of pasteurization .
Developing a vaccine for rabies
.
Pasteur proved that diseases were NOT caused by living in sin or reading racy French novels or going to ballets or engaging in politics .
He proved that many things people did to foil death were either futile or downright dangerous .
For example , he campaigned hard to get doctors to WASH THEIR HANDS between patients .
The medical profession thought that was very stupid .
The death rate of mothers , due to doctors refusing to wash their hands , was very ferocious .
.
The US public health system has to pay close attention to collective health problems : things that spread via breathing , touching , sexual intercourse , sweat , urine , feces and farming methods .
These MUST be attended to and regulated .
People have to cooperate with various energetic programs to prevent epidemics , pandemics and the evolution of germs .
That is , if people do n’t do the right things with existing therapies and medicines , diseases evolve rapidly to overturn these cures .
Thus , the need for public input on dealing with say , TUBERCULOSIS .
.
That dread disease is now spreading and it is resistant to modern medicines .
Draconian measures must be taken but are n’t being taken , to stop this menace .
Another public health menace is malaria .
This , too , has evolved to the point , it no longer is stopped by modern medicines .
Usually , these diseases occur when private poverty prevents patients from following the entire course of a cure .
So they stop halfway and the disease surges back , often , mutating while doing this .
.
To keep up with these diseases , we need public funding of research labs .
The major drug companies do n’t like this sort of research , it is not all that profitable .
They far rather research sexual enhancement drugs , or stuff that can be used for cosmetic surgery .
Vanity drives a huge sector of healthcare research and profits .
So universities are often the place where our new research comes from :
.
U.S. researchers find ‘ signature ’ of common virus | Deals | Regulatory News | Reuters
Common viruses that cause colds and flu leave a distinctive signature in the blood , and U.S. researchers said on Thursday they had found a way to pin it down . .
The researchers hope to develop a test that will tell a doctor quickly whether a patient has a common cold , influenza or some other infection , and help guide treatment options . .
“ This work is still in a relatively early phase of discovery , but we are optimistic that these findings may lead to a whole new way of diagnosing infectious disease , ” Dr. Geoffrey Ginsburg of Duke University in North Carolina , who led the study , said in a statement . .
Most respiratory infections look similar — cough , sneezing , fever , headache and fatigue .
There are no good quick tests and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study , also on Thursday , showing on - the - spot flu tests miss up to half of all flu infections .
[ ID :nN06348322 ] …. ..
… The biggest value , they said , may be in helping doctors tell who has viral pneumonia and who has bacterial pneumonia .
It is useless to treat viral infections with antibiotics . .
“ It could mean more appropriate use of antibiotics .
Overuse of antibiotics can lead to the emergence of drug - resistant pathogens , and no one wants to see more of that , ” Dr. Christopher Woods of Duke said in a statement
.
Way back in my youth , I was 100 % against feeding antibiotics to farm animals .
Yes , they gain weight faster and live longer when we do this but the germs mutate over time and destroy the value of antibiotics to the MAJOR PUBLIC .
Again : private farm producers are endangering the greater public because they want bigger profits from bigger animals .
.
A government should stop them from doing this but of course , the big aggie guys pay Congress lots of money to not stop them so they merrily destroyed the value of antibiotics during the last 50 years .

Massive beef recall linked to antibiotic - resistant salmonella outbreak
California firm Beef Packers
Inc has recalled over 800,000 pounds of ground beef linked to an outbreak of antibiotic - resistant salmonella that has sickened people across nine states . .
The US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) issued the alert yesterday for a range of the company ’s ground beef products processed between June 5 - 23 that were sent to retail distribution centres in Arizona , California , Colorado and Utah .
The 825,769 pounds ( 375,349 kg ) of meat had been repackaged into consumer - size amounts and sold under different retail brand names .
Consumers were warned to check with local retailer to find out if they were at risk .
.
Thank you , Big Factory Farming Aggie Guys !
This salmonella is ANTIBIOTIC - RESISTANT !!!
Good gods .
And this was so easy to predict .
The way we abuse antibiotics and other drugs used to stop dangerous diseases is part of the public / private healthcare matrix .
We cannot pretend that ‘ to each his own ’ is OK .
Medical anarchy =death .

BBC NEWS | Health |
Are we losing the war on bugs ?
We now know that the bacteria behind the current outbreak of pneumonic plague in China – Yersinia pestis – started out life as a fairly harmless inhabitant of the intestine before acquiring a gene which allowed it to infect insects , and then return to humans with devastating effects . .
The strain of E.coli meanwhile which has just left two people seriously ill is a mutant form of the bacterium which lives without causing any trouble in cattle , but can be a killer in humans when it is picked up after touching an animal or eating undercooked , infected food . .
Campylobacter jejuni , another cause of bacterial food poisoning , have developed cells with different surfaces : this means that even if most of them are recognised and killed by the host ’s immune system , some of them will escape and proliferate .
Which is what those which have developed resistance to antibiotics are also able to do .
Campaigns have been launched aimed at reducing unnecessary use of treatments amid a rising number of resistant strains . .
While MRSA rates have fallen dramatically , others – notably antibiotic resistant E. coli strains which cause infections of the urinary tract and the blood – are on the increase . .
“ Sensible prescribing is part of the answer but we also need new antibiotics – it ’s not one of the most attractive areas for pharmaceutical companies as people do n’t take them for very long , unlike treatments for heart disease or cancer , ” says Dr David Livermore , an infections expert at the Health Protection Agency .
.
Grrr ….if anyone thinks eating right and living a ‘ virtuous ’ life will protect them from tuberculosis or the plague … that is just nutty !
Of course , it is good to eat healthy , be sanitary and to exercise but none of these activities will protect one from the major deadly diseases that are resurgent .
On top of this , businesses making drugs do n’t like dealing with these things , they want to find drugs we have to take all our lives .
Bingo : big profits , little work .
.
Below is a PEW study about antibiotics being abused by farmers :

Every day , doctors use antibiotics to treat thousands of sick children and adults .
Humans depend on these life - saving medicines for their personal health .
But did you know that as much as 70 percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. are being fed to cattle , swine , and poultry on industrial animal farms , for purposes other than treating disease ? .

.
What puzzles me is how some people get on various strange bandwagons .
For example , getting hysterical about fluoride .
While at the same time , being la-de - dah about very serious potential plagues .
This refusal to look at big things while getting anxious about small things is very human .
We feel unease when we confront the greater forces .
So we focus on trivialities .
.
Water pollution from all sorts of things such as hormone drugs , antidepressants , industrial wastes , street runoffs , etc , are much more deadly and much more serious and are PUBLIC HEALTH issues , not private issues .
The right wing refuses to figure this out .
I cannot fathom why but then , they also trend towards wanting ‘ faith ’ rather than ‘ reason ’ when dealing with the world .
So things can be overlooked .
But overlooking our public health has a very steep price .
That is , masses of humans can die .
.
For example , stopping the nuclear bomb tests was critical for stopping the rising cancer rates that have now killed MILLIONS of people .
Millions have died in this ‘ silent nuclear war ’ and are still dying !
Yet , during the entire episode in world history , the major nuclear powers all denied that nuclear bombs caused cancer .
While all of these same nations were trying to help us with public health care initiatives !
.
Humans are very paradoxical creatures !
One last thing :

BBC NEWS | Science & Environment | Extinction hits ‘ whole families ’
Whole “ chunks of life ” are lost in extinction events , as related species vanish together , say scientists . .
A study in the journal Science shows that extinctions tend to “ cluster ” on evolutionary lineages – wiping out species with a common ancestor …. .
… Many species have become extinct during the relatively stable periods between those global calamities .
But even during such quiet periods , the team found that extinctions tended to cluster into evolutionary families – with closely - related species of clams vanishing together more often than would be predicted by chance …. .
… According to this pattern , the study ’s authors point out , extinctions are likely to eliminate entire branches of the evolutionary tree .
.
We saw with Dutch Elm Disease , how species can be wiped out by mere germs .
The roster of living things killed by the Viral Empire and the Bacterial Kingdom is long and dread .
They both have rung down the curtain on many , many life forms and we must take them seriously .
Which is also why we have to shut down military germ labs !
Gah !!!
These are extremely noxious .
Man Bets On His Life and Wins
When Jon Matthews , a 59 - year - old man from Buckinghamshire , England , was diagnosed with a type of cancer called mesothelioma , his doctors told him he had mere months to live .
But instead of saying his goodbyes , Matthews decided to make a bet on his own slim chances of survival — and now his decision is paying off .
When Jon Matthews , a 59 - year - old man from Buckinghamshire , England , was diagnosed with a type of cancer called mesothelioma , his doctors told him he had mere months to live .
But instead of saying his goodbyes , Matthews decided to make a bet on his own slim chances of survival — and now his decision is paying off .
In 2006 , he placed two £ 100 bets , for which he was given odds of 50 - to - 1 .
He would win the first bet if he was still alive to collect his winnings in June 2008 ; the second , in June 2009 .
Despite all medical predictions to the contrary , Matthews is still doing well , and has managed to collect £ 10,000 in payouts .
If he is still around another year from now , Matthews stands to make an additional £ 10,000 .
For Matthews , the betting is n’t about the money — he is planning to give most of his winnings to charities , including the UK cancer charity McMillan .
“ When I was diagnosed I was told mesothelioma was a death sentence , ” he told BBC News .
“ I was n’t that fussed because everyone has to die some time .
But the interesting thing for me was how long it would take - would it take weeks or years ? ”
Although Matthews ’ bet seemed a little bit morbid to the betting agency he used , William Hill , which usually deals in sporting events , the business was convinced to make the deal with Matthews because of his overwhelming determination .
Matthews “ was adamant that it would give him an additional incentive to battle his illness , ” said a William Hill spokesperson , Graham Sharpe .
And while the agency generally does n’t like to be on the losing side of a bet , the agents at William Hill are crossing their fingers that Matthews will receive his payout next year , too .
“ Never in 30 years in the business have I been so pleased to pay a winning client £ 10,000 , with , I trust , a further £ 10,000 to come next year , ” said Sharpe .
DALLAS -
Three children were kept in a hotel bathroom for about a year and were “ horribly emaciated ’’ when police found them earlier this month , authorities said .
One said she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted .
The children were so emaciated that they threw up when child protective workers first tried to feed them .
The children ’s lips were dry , swollen , and cracked , their ribs were protruding .
The children ’s mother , 30 - year - old Abneris Santiago , is charged with injury to a child .
Her 37 - year - old live - in boyfriend , Alfred Santiago , is charged with aggravated sexual assault and continuous sexual abuse .
According to an arrest affidavit , Abneris Santiago called police on July 2 and asked for help getting her children and belongings from the hotel .
Officers found a healthy 1 - year - old girl - the child of the Santiagos , Jamison said - in a crib .
Inside the bathroom , they found an 11 - year - old girl , a 10 - year - old boy , and a 5 - year - old boy - Abneris Santiago ’s children from other relationships , Jamison said .
It was apparent they suffered from “ serious physical , emotional , and mental neglect , ’’ according to the affidavit .

Heart and circulatory disease is the UKs biggest killer Having a lower than average IQ is in itself a risk factor for heart disease , say UK researchers .
Given the findings , public health messages on things like exercise and diet could be simplified , the authors say in the European Heart Journal .
In the study of over 4,000 people , IQ alone explained more than 20 % of the difference in mortality between high and low socioeconomic groups .
This applied even when known heart disease risk factors were considered .
Dr David Batty , who led the research for the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council , said : " We already know that socio- economically disadvantaged people have worse health and tend to die earlier from conditions such as heart disease , cancer and accidents .
I think the public health messages on things like diet , exercise and smoking could be simplified
Lead researcher Dr David Batty " Environmental exposures and health - related behaviours , such as smoking , diet and physical activity , can explain some of this difference , but not all of it . "
He said this raises the possibility that as yet unmeasured psychological factors need to be considered and that one of these is intelligence or cognitive function , commonly referred to as IQ .
His team at the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh studied a group of 4,289 former US soldiers from all walks of life .
As expected from past trends , those on low incomes and with less education had a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease .
Health promotion
But when the researchers took into account IQ and controlled for nine other known heart disease risk factors , IQ alone explained 23 % of the differences in mortality between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups in the study .
They offer several possible explanations for this - low IQ scores might simply be a marker of underlying poor health or intelligence might lead to greater knowledge about how to keep healthy .
Dr Batty said , whatever the explanation , the findings imply the IQ of the public should be considered more carefully when preparing health promotion campaigns .
" I think the public health messages on things like diet , exercise and smoking could be simplified .
" For instance , we often read about how some types of alcohol are good for you while others , or even the same ones , are not .
The messages can be difficult to interpret , even by knowledgeable people . "
Professor Peter Weissberg , medical director at the British Heart Foundation , said : " If we are to make real progress on tackling health inequalities we need health campaigns designed to reach everyone in the community and an environment that makes healthy choices easy choices for the whole population .
" One way to achieve this would be through clear and consistent front of pack food labelling to replace the confusing hotchpotch of schemes we currently have . "
He urged the government to implement a single traffic light food labelling scheme as soon as possible .
Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , president of the UK Faculty of Public Health , said : " People with lower IQ also tend to miss out on preventive healthcare .
" They are less likely to have check - ups , follow lifestyle advice , take preventive medication and be referred for preventive hospital treatment .
We must find ways to break down these barriers . "

The Israel Supreme Court is the creation of one elite family : the Rothschilds .
In their negotiations with Israel , they ’ve agreed to donate the building under three conditions : the Rothschilds were to choose the plot of land , they would use their own architect and no one would ever know the price of its construction .
The reasons for those conditions are quite evident : the Supreme Court building is a Temple of Masonic Mystery Religion and is built by the elite , for the elite .
Built in 1992 , the Israel Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem , in front of the Knesset ( Israeli legislature ) .
Its peculiar architecture has earned critical praise due to the architects ’ opposition of old versus new , light versus shadow and straight lines versus curves .
Almost all critics and journalists have however omitted to mention the blatant occult symbols present all over the building .
Masonic and Illuminati principles are physically embodied in numerous instances , proving without a doubt who runs the show in there .
House of the Rothschilds
The Rothschild family is an international dynasty of Germans of Jewish descent who established a worldwide banking and finance operation .
The offspring of Mayer Amschel Rothschild ( 1744-1812 ) have spread all over Europe and became major actors in the social , political and economic life of the continent .
By knitting close ties with the elite of England , Austria , France , and Italy , the Rothschilds became a hidden force in most political events of the last centuries .
Alternative historians say they are part of the infamous 13 bloodlines of the Illuminati , along with the Rockefellers and the Duponts .
The Rothschilds are one of the originators of the Zionist movement and the most active actors in the creation of the state of Israel .
James A. de Rothschild financed the Knesset , Israel ’s main political building .
Right in front of it sits the Israeli Supreme Court , donated by another member of the dynasty : Dorothy de Rothschild .
In the same general area of Jerusalem we can , therefore , find the Knesset and the Supreme Court , built by the Rothschilds and , following a perpendicular leyline , several blocks away , sits the Rockefeller Museum ( another elite family ) .
You might start to understand who owns this area now .
Jerry Golden wrote several years ago on the Israeli Supreme Court , appropriately pointing out its occult concepts .
When you study those types of buildings , you quickly realize that the same themes inevitably reappear : illumination , pyramid , ascent , the number 13 or 33 , phallic / yonic symbols , etc .
This building has it all and more .
Path to Illumination
A journey through the Supreme Court is , in fact , a symbolic course towards Illumination .
The ultimate “ goal ” of the journey is to reach the top of the pyramid which is located on the roof of Supreme Court , atop of an area where the “ holy of holies ” would be in a Jewish Temple .
On each side of the pyramid ’s apex is a hole representing the “ All - Seeing Eye ” of the Masonic Great Architect ( see the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States ) .
Let ’s go through the path of the “ profane ” to reach illumination .
Darkness to Light Stairway
One who enters the Supreme Court finds himself in a dark area , in front of a stairway leading to a source of light .
By climbing those stairs , the visitor gradually leaves the depths of darkness to finally reach glorious sunlight .
There are exactly three times 10 steps , totaling 30 .
They represent the 30 first degrees of Freemasonry , where the profane is gradually taken from the depths of material life ( darkness ) to wisdom and illumination ( light ) .
We know that Freemasonry comprises a total of 33 degrees and we ’ll later see where we can find those last three degrees in the structure .
On the right side of the stairs are old rocks reminiscent of walls of ancient Jerusalem while on the left is a smooth and modern wall .
This represents the timeless nature of occult teachings , who have been transmitted since ancient times to this day .
Once having climbed the stairs the visitor can admire a great view of Jerusalem .
In a symbolic way , the enlightened person gained “ spiritual sight ” .
Embedded on the floor is a leyline , guiding the traveler to the entrance of the library , which is conveniently placed right under the pyramid .
The Library
The library is divided into three levels , symbolically representing the last three degrees of Freemasonry ( 31st , 32nd , and honorary 33rd ) .
The first level is reserved for lawyers , the second is reserved for judges and the books on the third level can only be read by retired judges .
The library ’s way of functioning – where some information is the exclusive privilege of a selected few – directly correlates with the functioning of occult orders , where teachings of a certain degree can only be given if the initiates have successfully cleared the previous degrees .
The library contains legal , judicial , philosophical and spiritual works .
There is no doubt that the “ reserved ” books contain a wealth of esoteric knowledge .
Right above the higher level of the library ( representing the 33rd level of Masonry ) is the base of the pyramid .
This is where Freemasonry symbolically ends and the hidden order of the Illuminati begins .
Right under the apex of the pyramid , on the floor , we can find sacred geometry patterns .
Jerry Golden has mentioned that a crystal is embedded right in the middle of the pattern , right under the eye of the pyramid .
What does it signify ?
Judges Bringing Illumination
The prison cells , the courtroom and the judge ’s quarters are placed one on top of the other , symbolizing the threefold nature of the world .
The inmates are stuck in cells , symbolizing the prison of the lower material world .
The courtrooms , placed right over the prison cells , represent the “ higher world ” where divinity gets in touch with humanity :
In the courtrooms , the judges are illuminated by a natural source of light .
So the judges , hearing the pleas of the masses sit there with divine light constantly shining upon them .
After the hearings , the judges retire to their quarters , situated right over the courtroom .
They symbolically “ ascend ” to the divine world .
When a decision is taken , they “ descend ” to bring illumination to the lower world .
Fertility Symbol
Outside the courtrooms is a stairway leading to a lower level .
No occult temple would be complete without those next two features .
In the middle of the stairway is the shape of a vesica piscis ( representing female genitals ) “ penetrated ” by a column ( phallic symbol ) .
This is an obvious fertility symbol , a union of the male and female principles .
Numerous occult temples insert a fertility symbol on their lower floor ( see the Manitoba Legislative Building or Washington Capitol ) .
But wait , there ’s usually a rotunda along with the
fertility symbol .
Oh , there it is .
Outside
The exterior of the Supreme Court contains loads of symbolic features .
Just follow the “ Dorothy de Rothschild ” stone to see where it leads you .
Obelisk
This is the Dorothy de Rothschild grove .
The obelisk is the most commonly used and the most blatant occult symbol used throughout the world .
In ancient Egypt , the cult of this phallic symbol was associated with the god Osiris , who was cut into 13 pieces by Seth .
Isis traveled far and beyond to retrieve all of Osiris ’ body parts and was successful , except for one body part , the p---s , which was swallowed by a fish .
“ The lost phallus ” is thus representative of male energy and is almost always placed ( as in this case ) inside a circle , which represents female genitalia and energy .
The obelisk in the middle of a circle represents the sexual act and the union of opposite forces .
In our modern world , obelisks are found on nearly all important landmarks , and thus became and symbol of the occult elite ’s power .
Courtyard
The courtyard has a beautiful zen - like feel .
A source of water is constantly bubbling and streaming through a narrow path towards a strange stone .
Official Supreme Court documentation says that the courtyard is a physical representation of the verse from Psalm 85:11 :
“ Truth springs from the earth , And righteousness looks down from heaven ”
The judge ’s offices overlook the courtyard , so they are symbolically “ looking down from heaven ” .
The stream of water goes straight and ends up right under a strange and enigmatic stone .
What is this thing and why is “ truth who sprung from the earth ” leading towards it ?
The stone ’s polished surface reflects a distorted image of the courtyard .
What does it represent ?
Trampled Cross
At the center of the parking facilities are pathways shaped like Christian cross .
Jerry Golden has mentioned that this cross has been specifically placed to be trampled on by visitors .
He is most probably right .
In a building where spiritual symbolism reigns supreme , there are effectively little chances that the layout of those pathways has n’t been thoroughly thought out by the architects .
In other words , this ca n’t be just a coincidence .
The visitors have to go down the stairs – symbolically “ descend ” to lower spheres – to reach the cross .
As you might have noticed , the importance of the act of ascending and descending in this building is very important .
This is not an exception .
Occult secret societies have historically been at odds with the Christian church who repeatedly persecuted and accused them of all sorts of heresies .
During the Middle - Ages the Knights Templar ( ancestors of Freemasonry ) have been accused by the Archbishop of Canterbury of numerous anti-Christian deeds , including “ trampling the Cross under foot ” during their initiation processes .
Are they poking back at Christianity with this symbol ?
Pomegranates
Those pomegranates lying on the floor might seem extremely insignificant for the average onlooker .
They , however , hold a special signification for students of the Mysteries and of Freemasonry .
“ Among the ancient Mysteries the pomegranate was also considered to be a divine symbol of such peculiar significance that its true explanation could not be divulged .
It was termed by the Cabiri “ the forbidden secret . ”
Many Greek gods and goddesses are depicted holding the fruit or flower of the pomegranate in their hands , evidently to signify that they are givers of life and plenty .
Pomegranate capitals were placed upon the pillars of Jachin and Boaz standing in front of King Solomon ’s Temple ; and by the order of Jehovah , pomegranate blossoms were embroidered upon the bottom of the High Priest ’s ephod ”
- Manly P. Hall , Secret Teachings of All Ages
As stated by Hall , pomegranates were placed on top of the two pillars standing in front of Solomon ’s Temple .
If you have minimal knowledge of Masonic teachings , you know that the Temple of Solomon and the pillars named Jachin and Boaz are of utmost importance .
“ The capitals were enriched by pomegranates of bronze , covered by bronze net - work , and ornamented with wreaths of bronze ; and appear to have imitated the shape of the seed - vessel of the lotus or Egyptian lily , a sacred symbol to the Hindus and Egyptians . ”
- Albert Pike , Morals and Dogma
We know that the Masons patiently look forward to the day they ’ll rebuild the Temple of Solomon on its original grounds – Temple Mount , Jerusalem .
Are those pomegranates waiting to be placed on the pillars of the next Temple ?
In Conclusion
This article barely scratches the surface of the occult symbolism of the Israeli Supreme Court .
It is however clear that the building ’s architecture carries important symbolism relating to spirituality and the attainment of illumination .
There are no religious monuments relating to Judaism or any organized religion .
The Supreme Court is a temple of the Mysteries , which are an amalgamation of pagan rituals interlaced with an esoteric interpretation of the Scriptures .
The teaching of the Mysteries is reserved to members of occult secret societies , which the Rothschilds are obviously part of .
The esoteric meaning of this building is concealed from the public but it unmistakably reveals to the initiates who possess real power in the world .
Mitch , Frank and Beanie are disillusioned with their personal lives beginning when Mitch 's nymphomanic girlfriend , Heidi , cheats on him , then former party animal Frank gets married , but unwilling to let go of his wild life , and Beanie is a family man seeking to reclaim his wild and crazy youth .
Beanie suggests that they form their own fraternity in Mitch 's new house on a college campus to re-live their glory days by bringing together a variety of misfit college students , losers , middle - aged and elderly retirees as their new friends and later try to avoid being evicted by the new Dean of Students , Pritchard , whom still holds a personal grudge against all three of them .

Tokyo Cabinet is a trove of hidden of gems , the more you learn about it , the more you will appreciate the design and technical decisions behind it .
By database standards it is a young project ( started in 2007 ) , but since it is a successor to the QDBM project developed by Hirabayashi- san ( 2000 - 2007 ) , we could make the argument that it has been , in fact , nine years in the making .
Best of all , the rewrite allowed the project to shed its past baggage and build on a more modern stack with a better perspective of the required features for a modern deployment ( Drizzle is another recent example from the MySQL camp ) .
Case in point , Tokyo Tyrant supports

If you have played with Lego Mindstorms , or ever tried to script your phone or a gaming environment ( WoW ) , chances are you ’ve worked with Lua .
Due to its extremely small footprint ( ~212 kb for source , documentation , and examples ) , fast interpreter , portability and easy to understand syntax it has become the de-facto embedded scripting language for many applications .
Explore the available tutorials , or pick up “ Programming Lua ” by the creator of the language for a more in depth look , it ’s a fun language !
So why is Lua scripting such an exciting feature for Tokyo Tyrant ?
Because it lowers the barrier for programming and extending the database by an order of magnitude !
If you have ever worked with MySQL UDF functions , you ’ll definitely appreciate the ease and the speed of development .
No need for mucking with internal API ’s , nothing to compile or link against , and execution is done within a stable and sandboxed environment .
Extending Tokyo Tyrant with Lua
Anytime you bootup a Tokyo Tyrant server you can tell it to load arbitrary Lua code alongside which will then be evaluated at runtime if the client requests it .
From there , the developer of the extension has full access to the incoming request and the underlying Tokyo Cabinet database , allowing us to inject arbitrary functionality .
To get a flavor for the workflow , take a look at some of the examples in the following slides :

tokyo-recipes.git - Lua Extensions for Tokyo Tyrant
Because the Lua scripting interface is relatively new , the number of available extensions and documentation is not very large .
For that reason , I ’ve started the tokyo - recipes repo on GitHub , in which I ’ve aggregated some of the available extensions , and added extra documentation and examples to help grease the wheels : TTL functionality ( ala memcached ) , working with Sets ( ala Redis ) , session timestamping and a wordcount map - reduce example just to name a few .
Give it a try , it is an extremely powerful feature !
ShockTillYouDrop.com recently talked to director David Twohy about continuing the “ Chronicles of Riddick ” franchise ( an interview you can read here ) , but Vin Diesel has commented now as well on his Facebook profile :
The Riddick discussion is about rating now …
Though Hollywood likes their PG Ratings , the next chapter in the COR series was always envisioned as an R rating , like Pitch Black …
One Studio exec suggested doing both “ The Underverse ” and “ The Furyan , ” ( working titles ) at the same time , allowing us an R rating for the first and a PG rating for the second .
The good news - David
Twohy ’s script comes in next month .
Do you think Diesel and Twohy should continue the series ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
One of 44 people arrested last week in a sweeping federal probe of political corruption and money laundering in New Jersey has been found dead in suspicious circumstances , authorities said .
Jack Shaw , 61 , a longtime Democratic political consultant , was discovered dead at his Jersey City home on Tuesday afternoon in circumstances Hudson County Prosecutor Edward DeFazio called “ suspicious , ” local media reported .
An autopsy was scheduled for Wednesday .
The prosecutor told The New York Times that the death did not appear to be murder but could be natural , accidental or a suicide .
Shaw was accused of accepting a $ 10,000 cash bribe from a government informant posing as a real estate developer hoping to win project approval and public contracts , according to documents in the case .
He had been working for developers in northern New Jersey , the Times said .
Shaw previously worked for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and former New Jersey Governor Jim Florio and helped with New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine ’s race for the U.S. Senate in 2000 .
Prosecutors said Shaw asked the informant to donate the cash to the re-election campaign of Jersey City Mayor Jerramiah Healy , who was not charged .
Shaw also introduced the informant to other officials who were charged in the massive investigation of corruption , human organ sales and money laundering involving several mayors and rabbis , they said .
NETWORK OF CORRUPTION
The 10 - year investigation exposed influence - peddling and bribe - taking among a network of public officials .
A separate multimillion dollar money - laundering ring funneled funds through charities operated by local rabbis , said the U.S. Attorney ’s office in Newark , New Jersey .
Among those arrested were the mayors of Hoboken , Secaucus and Ridgefield , state lawmakers , city council members , zoning officials , building inspectors and political candidates .
The mayor of Secaucus , Dennis Elwell , resigned on Tuesday , the first of the accused political officials to do so .
The Democratic governor has said all officials swept up in the probe should resign .
One of his appointees , Community Affairs Commissioner and former Bayonne mayor Joe Doria , last week tendered his resignation after his home was searched .
Charles Richman is serving as acting commissioner , an agency spokesman said by e-mail .
The agency helps cities and towns with their finances , including bond sales , and the spokesman said he was not aware of any delays in their bringing debt to market .
The money - laundering network by rabbis operated between Brooklyn and Deal , New Jersey , and Israel , authorities said .
They laundered some $ 3 million for the undercover witness between June 2007 and July 2009 , authorities said .
The probe also exposed a Brooklyn man accused of conspiring to broker the sale of a human kidney for a transplant .

For two Saturday mornings now , we ’ve enjoyed the company of some remarkably friendly butterflies at Nathan ’s soccer games .
Locals : we encounter these in the east central part of Palmer Park , on the field colloquially known as “ lower lower north . ”
These are n’t fleeting , lucky shots .
These butterflies land on you as soon as you sit down and hang around as long as you let them , pretty much .
There are never very many of them ; there seem to be four or five around at one time .
These are cell phone shots .
I ’m taking my SLR next time .
I poked around for more than a few minutes looking for positive identification , and never came up with anything solid .
Best I can tell , it looks like it might be a species of Painted Lady .
Is there a lepidopterist in the house ?
Hope you ’re having a good weekend .

While the plates have appeared on other Web sites , it was not until they showed up on the popular Wikipedia site that psychologists became concerned .
“ The more test materials are promulgated widely , the more possibility there is to game it , ” said Bruce L. Smith , a psychologist and president of the International Society of the Rorschach and Projective Methods , who has posted under the user name SPAdoc .
He quickly added that he did not mean that a coached subject could fool the person giving the test into making the wrong diagnosis , but rather “ render the results meaningless . ”
To psychologists , to render the Rorschach test meaningless would be a particularly painful development because there has been so much research conducted  tens of thousands of papers , by Dr. Smith ’s estimate  to try to link a patient ’s responses to certain psychological conditions .
Yes , new inkblots could be used , these advocates concede , but those blots would not have had the research  “ the normative data , ” in the language of researchers  that allows the answers to be put into a larger context .
And , more fundamentally , the psychologists object whenever diagnostic tools fall into the hands of amateurs who have n’t been trained to administer them .
“ Our ethics code that governs the behavior of psychologists talks about maintaining test security , ” Steve J. Breckler , the executive director for science at the American Psychological Association , said in an interview .
“ We would n’t be in favor of putting the plates out where anyone can get hold of them . ”
Alvin G. Burstein , a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , wrote in an e-mail message that his preference was to have the images removed but that he did not think they would harm the psychological process .
“ The process of making sense of one ’s experience , ” he wrote , “ is gratifying .
To take Rorschach ’s test is to make sense of ambiguity in the context of someone who is interested in how you do that . ”
Image In June , Dr. James Heilman posted all 10 plates on the site , along with research about the most popular responses to each .
Trudi Finger , a spokeswoman for Hogrefe & Huber Publishing , the German company that bought an early publisher of Hermann Rorschach ’s book , said in an e-mail message last week : “ We are assessing legal steps against Wikimedia , ” referring to the foundation that runs the Wikipedia sites .
AT&T is evil .
This is news ?!
July 26 , 2009
I recently saw a posting on reddit about AT&T blocking a web site , 4 chan.org .
Are people really surprised about this ?
Perhaps they do n’t have AT&T , and hence do n’t know .
I have a friend that runs presidentmoron.com , a site about former president Bush .
Whilst living in southern Orange County , and having AT&T as the only broadband offering ( there is no cable laid in the condo complex I lived in ) , I have noticed that this website has been periodically blocked by Ma Bell over the course of the last 1.5 years .
Now , granted my friend that runs this site has it hosted at a home server , and could go down .
I meticulously verified that the server was in fact running each time I could not connect .
I connected through a corporate VPN to another computer not serviced by AT&T , and could reach the site .
Being pro-net neutrality , I decided to try and take a stand against evil , I decided to do something .
Well , what did I do about it , you ask ?
First , I called AT&T customer support .
After talking to them for the better part of an hour , the tech concluded that either :
I must have some type of virus .
The site is actually down .
The site is under attack .
I explained that I can get to the site through VPN ( just not through my AT&T connection ) , and hence it is not down , or under attack , and my virus status is irrelevant .
This , of course , does n’t matter .
Nothing can be AT&T ’s fault .
My next option was to contact the FCC , which I did .
I sent in a request on their web site .
All I got in return was a lengthy letter telling me that it was not their problem , and to contact the local better business bureau .
Well , I ’m on to my last option to get some justice from multi-national corporations .
The people .
Perhaps if this story gets popular , AT&T will have to submit .
Here ’s to hope .
In flip - flops , a faded old T - shirt and ragged trousers , Abraham Laeyea looked the image of Africa 's frustrating , dispiriting poverty .
" We like Obama , " he said .
" We want him to come and rule all African countries .
He brings hope but we need employment , jobs for the youth .
Yes , we all have schooling as far as O - level here but then there is no work .
People who have succeeded with business in this area move away . "
Abraham was among the young men standing in a crowded street beside an open drain in Jamestown , once a flourishing fishing village on the edge of the capital , now one of the city 's poorest areas .
The seaside slum of shacks is home to thousands of people .
Most make ends meet by casual labouring or by buying something – anything , a couple of batteries or a plastic key ring – and selling it for a tiny margin .
Most eat once a day , if they are lucky .
These people represent the challenge that President Barack Obama is trying to address with a major policy speech today addressed not just to Ghana , but to Africa .
He flew here straight from the G8 summit in Italy where promises were remade to help Africa reach the Millennium Development Goals in health , infant mortality and education .
Ghana is one of the few African countries which might reach them .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Between 1992 and 2006 , the percentage of the population in poverty dropped from 52 per cent to 28 per cent .
Politically too , it is stable .
After two decades of chaotic and often violent politics it hit rock bottom in 1983 , but a decade later democracy was restored and since then five elections have been held , two of them resulting in a change of ruling party .
There is no doubting the goodwill that Ghana has poured out to welcome the American President , even if some Ghanaians are a bit blasé about visiting US leaders .
Bill Clinton came in 1998 , drawing his largest ever crowd .
And last year , George Bush came to Accra on one of his last foreign outings .
The streets of the capital are lined with the stars and stripes alongside Ghana 's national flag and pictures of Mr Obama and President Atta Mills .
The street hawkers have abandoned their usual fare of newspapers , plastic flowers and sunglasses in favour of Barack and Michelle T - shirts .
Women walk tall in full - length costumes imprinted with Mr Obama 's face .
But few will see America 's first black President in the flesh .
Security as well as a forecast of heavy rain have forced him to hold his major policy speech in a conference centre before visiting the slave fort at Cape Coast .
The main thrust of his policy , already laid out by Johnnie Carson , head of the Africa bureau at the State Department , encourages African governments to rule better and end conflicts then concentrate on growing their economies .
He does not put aid to Africa at the top of his priorities but appears to be trying to look beyond to an Africa that earns its living in the world , no longer reliant on aid .
Ghana 's government receives 16 per cent of its GDP and 73 per cent of its government expenditure from aid .
The US provides part of that but its trade with and investment in Ghana is tiny .
Next year Ghana 's newly discovered oil comes on stream but no US oil major has shown much interest , and the small company developing it is more likely to sell to China .
There is little sign that American companies are flocking to invest in the country .
But Ghana is important to America in another way .
It was chosen for Mr Obama 's first visit to sub-Saharan Africa because it was the first African country to become independent .
Though less important than Nigeria or South Africa , it is seen as a leader in Africa and the destination for many African - Americans and African - Caribbeans returning to their " homeland " .
Known as the Gold Coast before independence , Ghana is also littered with remnants of the slave trade of which 10 major sites built by European traders remain , places of painful pilgrimage for black visitors from the Americas .
Today , the President and Mrs Obama , who is descended from slaves , will visit Cape Coast fort , a major Swedish , Dutch and lastly British slave trading post .
Inside its massive walls , a Latin inscription in stone in the courtyard proclaims faithfulness to God , and its upper rooms are elegant but simple with pleasant views of the sea .
Below , in shocking contrast , is a vast dungeon where slaves were crammed in and kept manacled until they were shipped to America .
Yesterday , representatives of the African American diaspora communities held a highly charged meeting in Accra recalling this past and welcoming Mr Obama and his family , though in private they complained that they had yet not been invited to any events .
" He gives us the psychic energy we need , " said Dr Charlotte Gardener , president of the Caribbean Ghana Association .
" We are so happy to see one of our own coming out of America . "
Questioned about Mr Obama 's own ancestry ( his father was Kenyan so he does not come from a slave background ) Janet Butler , an African American who has lived in Africa for 14 years , said that although he is not " old diaspora " , his life choices have made it clear that he is able to identity with their experience .
President Obama has been slow to turn to Africa , expending more energy on the Middle East .
But he has kept the US on track to meet its Gleneagles G8 aid commitments made in 2005 .
He also appears to be looking beyond aid to ways in which African countries can make sustainable improvements to farming production .
All of which will be good news for one of the world 's biggest cocoa producers and potentially a huge food producer .
That may not provide a job for Abraham and his friends soon but they live in hope .
Ghanaian shopkeepers love to give their shops slogans , often religious ones .
One in Jamestown reads , " Never give up – there is time for everything " .
Do we square up ?
Mini -Obama eager to see real thing
It is an uncanny resemblance and one that has turned the Ghanaian schoolboy Felix Afriyie into something of a celebrity .
" Even in school , my mates , my teachers call me Obama , " he said as the west African country whipped itself up into a frenzy ahead of the US President 's visit .
He has travelled 125 miles from his hometown of Kumasi to be in the capital , Accra , for a chance of seeing his lookalike .
His father , Agyaba , a gold jeweller , said : " My son to meet Obama face to face , I would be proud of it . "
But Felix , it seems , does not want to grow up to be a president .
He hopes instead to become a pastor .
The way that certain images , videos or concepts can suddenly spread like wildfire across the web , using email and social websites to propagate , is one of online culture ’s most unique phenomena .
Now Spanish researchers claim to have found a way to accurately predict how quickly and widely new pieces of information , or “ memes ” as they are called , will spread .
The ability to forecast this “ viral ” behaviour would be of great interest to sociologists and marketeers , among others .
The secret , they say , is to recognise the fact that people vary in how “ infectious ” they are when it comes to sharing content online .
While some people pass on things they receive right away , others do so after some delay , or not at all .
Medical models
The viral spread of information online has conventionally been modelled using epidemiological tools developed to analyse the spread of biological viruses .
One of the concepts borrowed is that of an infection ’s R 0 , or basic reproductive number , which describes how many other people someone with the virus can be expected to infect .
Advertisement
Knowing the R 0 number help predict the likelihood and extent of real life epidemics , such as H1N1 swine flu .
But models that apply the idea to online information can only indicate whether an internet meme is likely to be successful or to die out quickly , says Esteban Moro at the Carlos III University of Madrid , Spain .
Moro , working with José Luis Iribarren at IBM in Madrid , used IBM ’s company email newsletter to show the importance of variations between people ’s infectiousness in propagating memes online .
Email trail
They started a reward scheme offering prize draw tickets for recommending the newsletter by providing email addresses of other people and tracked how widely and quickly the recommendations spread .
After two months it had reached 31,000 people .
But while people took 1.5 days to respond to a recommendation email on average , there was a huge variation at the individual level : some users responded within minutes , other in months , says Moro .
And only by combining some expectation of that variation with the R 0 number is it possible to build a model able to predict the meme ’s spread .
The team use a small chunk of the initial data on the content ’s spread to predict how many people it will reach in total , and how fast .
“ Our model can give predictions within 1 per cent error once secondary reproductive number and human activity are estimated , ” Moro says .
The model cannot predict whether a piece of content will go viral before it has been released ; only its likely reach once it starts spreading .
And the researchers think their approach to modelling should apply to information spreading via social networking sites and other online services as well as email .
‘ Remarkable result ’
Statistician Claudio Castellano , at the “ Sapienza ” University of Rome , calls the match between prediction and real result “ remarkable ” .
He adds that there is other evidence to back up the idea people vary in online infectiousness .
For instance , David Liben - Nowell at Carleton College in Northfield , Minnesota , and colleague Jon Kleinberg at Cornell University last year traced an 11 - year - old email chain letter to show up the differences between the spread of real viruses and viral information .
Moro ’s study agrees with his own results , says Liben - Nowell .
“ Many models of information propagation discount both the role of time and [ differences between ] people . ”
But , there is more to discover , he says .
For example , how people may vary in infectiousness depending on the type of content they receive .

Anyone who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds , and arise from two causes , either from coming out of the light or from going into the light , which is true of the mind 's eye , quite as much as of the bodily eye ; and he who remembers this when he sees anyone whose vision is perplexed and weak , will not be to ( sic ) ready to laugh ; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter life , and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark , or having turned from drakness to the day is dazzled by excess of light .
And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being , and he will pity the other ; or , if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light , there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den .
Plato , The Republic
Editorial | Sunday , 23 August 2009 Conduct unbecoming The Malta Police Force has some serious explaining to do .
Not only have three separate cases of alleged police brutality surfaced in the space of two weeks ; but in written replies to a journalist ’s questions , the Force ’s Community and Media Relations Unit ( CMRU ) appears to have also been caught out in a lie .
Two weeks ago , this newspaper reported allegations of police brutality involving a young man from Rabat , who claims to have been violently beaten in the St Julian ’s police station last March .
The following week , MaltaToday was alerted to a second allegation of violent and aggressive behaviour – also at the St Julian ’s police station , and involving the same police officer – this time targeting an 18 - year - old woman ; and in a separate case , our sister paper Illum has reported yet another allegation of violence involving the police .
Details of the second case , carried today on our front page , make for particularly unpleasant reading .
The victim , whose apparent ‘ crime ’ was to allow a Chihuahua - sized dog onto the beach at St George ’s Bay , claims to have been verbally abused by four policemen , dragged into a police car , then bodily thrown into a lock - up cell after having been roughly manhandled .
To compound matters , she also claims to have been ‘ advised ’ by a high - ranking police official not to report the incident to the Floriana headquarters , in what appears to have been an attempt to downplay the incident .
This deeply disquieting episode raises numerous questions about the role and responsibility of the Police Force in general .
But apart from the use of verbal and physical violence – unacceptable under the best of circumstances , and even more so when one considers the age , gender and vulnerability of the victim – the incident also underscores a pattern of defensive behaviour that seems to repeat itself every time the police are accused of wrongdoing .
On the day the story was published , CMRU immediately rebutted the allegations by means of a registered letter , signed by WPC101 Roberta Grima , insisting that the police had never received a report about this incident , and that the matter was not being investigated by the Force ’s Internal Affairs Unit .
This letter will be published in full as a right of reply in next Wednesday ’s edition of MaltaToday .
However , the following day ( Thursday ) , the victim not only re-confirmed her version of events with this newspaper , but also produced photographic evidence of the injuries she claims to have sustained .
More significantly still , she insisted that contrary to the CMRU ’s claims , her family did report the matter to the police : the incident was in fact referred to Police Superintendent Sharon Tanti , who in turn allegedly assured the victim that there was no need to make an official report at the Floriana HQ , as she herself would ‘ look into ’ the matter .
According to the victim , her family was later convinced not to press charges in return for a private apology .
The contradictions between this version and that supplied by the CMRU can only raise very serious questions regarding the credibility of the Police Force as a whole .
On this occasion , the CMRU appears to have been more concerned with covering up this potentially explosive incident , than with fulfilling its vital function of informing the media ( and consequently the general public ) about matters which are of direct and urgent public concern .
Given the seriousness of the allegations , one must also comment that the reaction of the minister responsible for the Police Force , quoted in the article , is hardly what one would call satisfactory either .
Furthermore , the CMRU ’s subsequent claim ( i..e. , that the incident is not being investigated by the Internal Affairs Unit ) of itself raises an immediate question : why not ?
Why has the police not initiated an internal inquiry into what can only be described as a serious crime allegedly perpetrated by its own members ?
Placed in the context of other statements issued by the same CMRU this week – for instance , the arrest and arraignment of two foreigners caught smoking a joint in separate incidents – it seems that while the Malta Police Force is very quick to take action against relatively harmless offenders , its enthusiasm for justice seems to dampen considerably when it comes to much more serious crimes committed by its own officers .
All in all , it is a pity that the shameful and brutish actions of a few execrable members should be allowed to tarnish the reputation of the entire Corps .

To Veblen , the rise of a conspicuously consuming leisure class was n’t a sign of progress .
It was a relic of barbarism , an evolutionary step from feudalism , and , hence , un-American .
The equation of luxury with British tyranny and decadence , which took hold in the revolutionary era , persisted through much of the 19th century .
Since primogeniture had been abolished in America early on , and there was n’t much point in possessing huge tracts of land when vast territories were available to the adventurous , the nation had little in the way of dynastic wealth or large enterprises .
The Civil War crushed the one peculiar institution that had enabled a small - scale leisure class in the slaveholding South .
But by the 1880s and 1890s , the new technologies — telegraph , steam , railroad , electricity — that had forged a national market in goods and services , and the rise of Wall Street as a financial center , were allowing businesspeople to amass great wealth practically overnight .
For the first time , America had individuals capable of single - handedly conjuring into existence institutions like Rockefeller ’s University of Chicago , where Veblen taught political economy .

Inge Morath / The Inge Morath Foundation — Magnum Photos
Stout Scandinavian Midwesterner that he was , Veblen hated waste and loved efficiency .
And leisure , which he defined as “ nonproductive consumption of time , ” was wasteful .
But “ The Theory of the Leisure Class ” is more than a polemic ; it ’s one of the first works of pop sociology , and one that sold well despite a distinct lack of Gladwellian zing .
There ’s a little Darwin — “ life in a modern industrial community . . . acts by a process of selection to develop and conserve a certain range of aptitude and propensities ” — and plenty of Marx .
There ’s also a healthy measure of anthropology .
We learn of Polynesian kings who would starve rather than use their own hands to feed themselves , and why college football players seem to be inordinately devout .
At times Veblen is a proto-Seinfeld , unintentionally dabbling in Victorian - era observational humor : “ No explanation at all satisfactory has hitherto been offered of the phenomenon of changing fashions . ”
Although the book was written in the infancy of American social science , chunks of it anticipate more sophisticated arguments made by present - day economists .
As some people grow so wealthy that they can’t spend all their money on themselves , “ the aid of friends and competitors is therefore brought in by resorting to the giving of valuable presents and expensive feasts and entertainments ” — which pretty much explains Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group inviting friends and frenemies to his $ 5 million 60th birthday party .
But it ’s not just hedge - fund guys who are driven to spend for the sake of display .
The Cornell economist Robert H. Frank has argued that the demand for “ positional goods ” like bigger houses and private - school education has created a financial arms race from the top down .
Here ’s Veblen : “ The members of each stratum accept as their ideal of decency the scheme of life in vogue in the next higher stratum , and bend their energies to live up to that ideal . ”
Veblen called out the domestic leisure class for mimicking their decadent European antecedents .
My work as an economics journalist occasionally takes me into the private lives of billionaires , and it ’s amazing the degree to which tough , self - made businessmen still mimic the habits of the fey European nobility .
Once , as I entered the office of one magnate , a generation removed from the shtetl , my eyes were drawn to a photo of him , clad in tweed and boots , rifle on his shoulder , dead ducks fanned out at his feet under a gray British sky .
Yet other parts of Veblen ’s argument simply clang .
“ The leisure class is in great measure sheltered from the stress of those economic exigencies which prevail in any modern , highly organized industrial community , ” he writes .
Back then , an industrial baron could embark on a leisurely European Grand Tour without worrying that his company would be disintermediated before he crossed the Atlantic .
But today , Wall Street billionaires can be reduced to mere millionaires in a few months , and dot - com entrepreneurs can go from flip - flops to Gucci loafers and back again in a single business cycle .
Arming the Boston Police with Assault Rifles
Whose idea is this ?
The Boston Police Department is preparing a plan to arm as many as 200 patrol officers with semiautomatic assault rifles , a significant boost in firepower that department leaders believe is necessary to counter terrorist threats , according to law enforcement officials briefed on the plan .
The initiative calls for equipping specialized units , such as the bomb squad and harbor patrol , with the high - powered long - range M16 rifles first , the officials said .
The department would then distribute the weapons to patrol officers in neighborhood precincts over the next several months , according to the two law enforcement officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly .
Remember , the “ terrorist threats ” that plague Boston include blinking signs , blinking name badges , and Linux .
Would you trust the police there with automatic weapons ?
And anyway , how exactly does an police force armed with automatic weapons protect against terrorism ?
Does it make it harder for the terrorists to plant bombs ?
To hijack aircraft ?
Sure , you can invent a movie - plot scenario involving a Mumbai - like attack and have a Bruce Willis - like armed policeman save the day , but — realistically — is this really the best way for us to be spending our counterterrorism dollar ?
Luckily , people seem to be coming to their senses .
EDITED TO ADD :
These are semi-automatic rifles , not fully automatic .
I think the point is more about the militarization of the police than the exact specifications of the weapons in this case .

From the rhetoric of President Bush to his dispatch of Patriot air - defense systems and a second carrier battle group to the Persian Gulf , there are growing signs that the Bush administration is showing its willingness to solve the Iranian nuclear crisis with a preemptive military attack .
The already tense US - Iran relationship is now a tinderbox .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was correct in stating recently that Iran is " acting in a very negative way " in the Middle East .
The Islamic Republic trains and supports Hizbullah and Hamas .
It provides aid and explosives to Iraqi Shiite militias who attack American soldiers .
Most alarming , it seems determined to develop a nuclear bomb .
This panics moderate Arab states and poses an existential threat to Israel .
The ruling mullahs in Tehran terrorize their own citizens , especially pro-democracy groups .
Bombing Iran , however , will not resolve any of these dangers – it would exacerbate them .
But where military strikes would fail , containment and comprehensive negotiations would succeed .
Contrary to conventional accounts , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is neither the most powerful official in Iran nor is he loved by the Iranian people .
The authoritarian regime is not united behind Mr. Ahmadinejad and his policies , but divided and uncertain about who will prevail .
The real kingpin in Iran is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei , and his failing health has launched a succession struggle .
On one side of this fight are Ahmadinejad , a cabal of leaders from the Revolutionary Guards , and the Basij ( the militia - cum - gangs that terrorize the regime 's opponents ) .
On the other side is a loose coalition united by their disdain for Ahmadinejad 's gross economic mismanagement and reckless hubris .
This includes Iran 's bulging generation of young people , along with businessmen , technocrats , reformists , allies of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani , and even the conservative Motalefe Party .
After a year of rising stardom , Ahmadinejad is starting to lose in this power struggle .
He has not delivered on his campaign pledges to fight corruption or improve the lot of the working classes and the poor .
In recent elections for local councils as well as for the powerful 80 - man Council of Experts ( entrusted with the task of choosing the next spiritual leader ) Ahmadinejad and his allies suffered humiliating defeats .
To reverse his waning popular support , Ahmadinejad has tried to change the subject from his domestic failures to his foreign adventures .
He knows there is only one thing that could bring the people back to him – a US military attack on Iran .
His repulsive remarks about Israel and his nuclear bravado aim precisely to provoke such an attack , which would create the crisis conditions necessary for his faction to seize full power .
Just as Iran 's reactionaries are pining for war , some of Iran 's more moderate leaders have written a letter asking the Saudi government to help reduce tensions between the US and Iran .
Military confrontation with US forces would silence this camp domestically .
In fact , Iran 's democratic opposition warns that a US military strike would strengthen the regime hard - liners and weaken their own already limited ability to operate .
If Ahmadinejad welcomes war with America and Iran 's dissidents fear it , should n't the Bush administration think twice about the unintended consequences of military action ?
If Ahmadinejad does consolidate power , Iran would act in an even more negative way .
Moreover , it would do so with soaring support throughout much of the Muslim world , for an American attack would elevate him to hero status .
This would only fan his faction 's ambitions to establish Iranian hegemony in the Middle East .
Its support for terrorist organizations would increase .
Terrorism , polarization , and sectarian violence would intensify in Iraq , Lebanon , the Palestinian territories , and Afghanistan , and could begin to engulf Bahrain and even the Shiite region of Saudi Arabia – where most of the country 's oil is .
A sustained US bombing campaign would disrupt Iran 's nuclear weapons programs .
But the newly consolidated hard - line regime in Tehran would be even more emboldened to acquire nuclear weapons .
A preemptive attack , which would lack international legitimacy , would also prompt Iran to withdraw entirely from the nuclear nonproliferation regime , as some of Ahmadinejad 's allies have already threatened , while inducing the crucial international fence - sitters – Russia and China – to back Iran without hesitation .
There is an alternative .
Rather than throw the reactionaries in Tehran a political lifeline in the form of war , the United States should pursue a more subtle approach : Contain Iranian agents in the region , but offer to negotiate unconditionally with Iran on all the outstanding issues .
Comprehensive negotiations could offer the powerful inducements – such as a lifting of the economic embargo and a significant influx of foreign investment and thus jobs – necessary to persuade Iran to halt nuclear enrichment .
And if the hard - liners reject the offer , they would have to contend with an angry Iranian public .
Such internal strife would be far preferable to an Islamic Republic united against the attacking forces of the " Great Satan . "

Man , I ’m sick of all this Michael Jackson shit .
It sure would be nice for the media to get over it already .
Motherfucker was n’t Jesus . .
he was actually creepy as hell and had a pet chimp .
A fucking chimp !
It ’s not like Michael does n’t deserve some respect , but what is this .
. day 8 ? Everyone ’s acting like music is dead .
We ’re going to be fine , I promise .
Do n’t yall know that we still have Jermaine ?
But I digress .
Last night was a serious session .
The crew assembled in the camouflage lodge for drinks and extra curricularz .
As our brains got hazy , John mentioned local hamburger joint , McDonalds , had finally added a new sandwich to their already diverse vegan - hating menu .
Was it the McDLT 2 ?
The Arch Deluxe revisited ?
The McJordan special coming out of retirement ?
Keep guessing . . think bigger . . think saltier . . think about type 2 diabetes .
Whatever it was , I was going to get in on the ground floor of this shit .
I want to be able to tell my kids that I was there on opening weekend . . my generation ’s Woodstock .
That is , if the burger does n’t make me sterile .
Check your head :
Curiously , there appeared to be a hate crime taking place on the cover of the box .
As I opened the box , my left arm began to ache in anticipation .
That ’s right , the burger is wearing a grease resistant undershirt .
It ’s called the Angus Deluxe and it ’s a 750 calorie hubcap of death .
A socially acceptable form of suicide and reason # 42 why Al Qaeda hates us .
It actually absorbs all ambient light once removed from the packaging .
If sober , one would be forced to question the decision making process that would lead them to consume such a self destructive item .
But when drunk , you do n’t have time for such foolish thoughts .
It tastes exactly how it looks – deadly .
What has science done ?
It is the second saltiest and third most caloric burger in the Mcdonald ’s roster . . . edged out only by the bacon embellished incarnation .
It beats out the double quarter pounder in nearly every negative category .
It will kill you .
It will kill us all .
You have got to try it .
Suggested pairing : I recommend enjoying this abomination with a fine single malt scotch .
The oak flavor accentuates the 39 grams of fat and really helps you taste the 1700 mg of sodium .
70 % through the burger , I felt my hypothalamus urging me to stop ( as well as my pituitary gland oddly throbbing with pain . )
There is no fucking way I ’m going to be able to finish this thing .
For the first time in my life there is a McDonalds meal that I simply cannot complete regardless of intoxication .
Joey Chestnut would be disappointed .
3 minutes later :
Oh my god .
What have I done ?
For a more in depth comparison of these new threats to society , check out time out ’s take on it .
It probably seemed a good idea at the time .
But Russia 's attempt to create a joint gas venture with Nigeria is set to become one of the classic branding disasters of all time ‑ after the new company was named Nigaz .
The venture was agreed last week during a four - day trip by Russia 's president Dmitry Medvedev to Africa .
The deal between Russia 's Gazprom and Nigeria 's state oil company was supposed to show off the Kremlin 's growing interest in Africa 's energy reserves .
Instead , the venture is now likely to be remembered for all the wrong reasons ‑ as a memorable PR blunder , worse than Chevrolet 's Nova , which failed to sell in South America because it translates as " does n't go " in Spanish .
Alert users of Twitter first highlighted the unfortunate English connotations of Nigaz , which appears to have eluded Medevedev 's Russian - speaking delegation .
Writing on Monday , shunty 75 observed : " Nigaz is the name for the new Gazprom Nigeria venture .
They need a new PR outfit .
NO WAY !!
Haha !! "
Other twitterers also derided the name .
An article in Brand Republic pointed out the obvious : that the name has " rather different connotations " for English - speakers .
It recalled other international branding mishaps including the Ford Pinto ‑ which in Brazil means small penis ‑ and the Pepsi slogan " come alive with the Pepsi generation " .
In Taiwan this rousing motto translated as " Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead " .
It is unclear why nobody alerted Medevedev to the blunder .
But one possible explanation is that the offending word is still widely used in Russia , and was even famously employed by the poet Vladimir Mayokovsky in the 1920s .
The new company Nigaz plans to invest at least $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.5 bn ) in oil and gas exploration and aims to build refineries , pipelines and gas power stations across Nigeria .
" We have a chance to become major energy partners , " Medvedev declared last week following a meeting with Nigeria 's presient Umaru Yar 'Adua in the capital Abuja .
Nothing better than having some surprise donuts with my late morning coffee .
The sweet , sweet round deep fried sugar treats with a couple of sprinkles , or a look at what Android OS 2.0 will have in store for us ; either will do .
And the latter is what we got .
RootMaster cyanogen uncovered the latest release as well as some of the sweet features it has in store for us .
Features which range from gestures , to automated backups , to “ tons of performance tweaking ” .
From his thread over at XDA , cyanogen taunts us with what he ’s found in a small bulleted list . :
multitouch
gestures
cdma
search integrated into everything
wpa enterprise
vpn support
automated backups
tons of performance tweaking
First off , multitouch .
One of the things that Android was seriously lacking ; and it was allegedly not included because they did n’t want to make Apple mad ?
Well , put that in your iPod and smoke it .
The first things that comes to mind is that I ’ll finally be able to fire up my emulators on my myTouch 3G and can permanently closet the G1 , which is so last year .
Tons of performance tweaking ?
Faster is better ; and yes , that ’s what she said .
I recall reading somewhere that the Weather Channel has their hands on Android SDK 2.0 and can comment on how smooth Android 2.0 ( Donut ) runs .
Does this confirm it ?
I hope so .
One thing that I did notice to be missing was a mention of additional bluetooth suport .
Sure A2DP was nice , but times are moving fast .
And while bluetooth is by no means my favorite protocol for anything , I would still like to see full support for it .
However , the day is young , and so is Donut .
One thing to note is that as of last read on the XDA thread , cyanogen did say that installing the current build fails on the Dream .
So no donut testing quite yet ; but that does n’t mean that the massive community of modders cant relinquish some of the features and throw them into their personal builds .
[ via cyanogen@ XDA | Thanks , Carl C ! ]
[ Update 2 ]
According to cyanogen ’s twitter , he has successfully flashed it to the HTC Dream !
[ Update ]
Did n’t take long to get some sweet screen shots ; and Carl C once again came through with a record breaking tip off time .
These screen shots originated from cyanogen on this post at XDA .
And I have shamelessly stolen them .
Intro
I come from a long line of entrepreneurs .
My grandfather came to America at the age of 18 from the Netherlands .
He spoke no English but was fully equipped with determination and charm as he managed to woo and marry my grandmother within his first year in the states .
He is a brilliant and generous man who continues to run several successful companies and still makes his way into the office every day .
My father started his business when I was born .
I am the last of three kids .
Now having children of my own I see what an immense challenge my parents faced .
The business has thrived and is in its 27th year .
My dad has much to be proud of .
By the age of 7 I had caught the business bug .
In my career I have sold lemonade , wild flowers , painted cards & flower pots and handcrafted jewelry made from polymer clay .
While all the other little girls were playing with dolls and painting their faces with their mother ’s make - up my best friend and I were playing “ store ” and dreaming of our future careers as cartoonists , teachers , designers , etc .
In my life I am never devoid of a goal .
I set them high and work like mad to accomplish them .
Nothing is too lofty or unattainable .
Along the way , my equally goal - orientated father has taught me on several occasions that the goal itself is not the reward .
It is in the journey .
The journey .
In the journey there is learning .
Every part of my being is opened up , awake and alive .
With the excitement of a child I am eager to devour anything I can that will inch me closer to the goal .
Bumps and bruises are expected but they make the end that much more anticipated and celebrated .
You imagine all will be well when the goal has been reached .
“ I will be happy when _______ ( fill in the blank ) ” .
You get to the end and now what ?
The goal has been accomplished and you may relish in it briefly but moments later a new goal is set and a new journey begins .
As to be expected currently I have many goals but one particular Sunday a couple of weeks ago I realized that I am beginning to understand what for years my father has been trying to teach me – Enjoy the journey .
Sunday was a day to delight in .
A humbling and joyful message heard , a smooth ride across the sound while one child slept and the other was filled with an acquisitive joy .
Sun. Berries .
New friends .
Re-united with old friends .
Swings .
Kids .
Pork .
Fat .
Salt and sugar .
I attribute this new phase of life called parenting for forcing me to enjoy the journey .
Parenting has proven to be the most thrilling , painful , joyous and utterly exhausting journey I have ever embarked on .
It has forced me to put other goals on hold to fulfill one of my most important goals of all – raising children .
In the midst of the tantrums and disciplines , the bumps and band - aids I see this phase as one that is fleeting .
Some days I find great hope and pleasure in this other days I hold them tight and pray that this moment will never cease .
I have to remind myself daily to stop .
Breathe .
And enjoy the journey .
So now back to Sunday .
The day that caused me to smile and pause long enough to realize these days are precious , vital and make this journey so sweet .
It was Pork that united us .
Shauna ( a.k.a. Gluten - Free Girl ) invited my family and I to their beautiful home to enjoy a Pork Potluck .
Anticipating many savory dishes I opted to contribute something sweet – which of course comes at little or no surprise .
But this sweet needed to stick to the guidelines of being studded with a portion of pork .
No problem .
We all know that I am a sucker for all things sweet and savory .
And really who can argue with the marriage of a smokey , savory and salty bacon cooked until completely crisp then tossed into a sweet and creamy caramel flavored with maple syrup and dark brown sugar ?
I guess there probably are a few people who might argue with this union but until you pop one of these chewy candies into your mouth you have no platform on which to proclaim your disgust .
a.k.a.
Do n’t knock it ’till you try it .
I casually sprinkled the thick - cut Hempler ’s bacon with cayenne before frying to a nearly blackened crisp .
Once the caramel had reached its perfect molten temperature I stirred in a handful of the bacon then reserved the rest to get sprinkled on top .
The caramel set beautifully .
Some were cut and served as is while a select few were covered in tempered dark chocolate .
All of them were devoured .
Bacon Caramel
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup butter
1 cup heavy cream , divided
1/4 cup maple syrup
Bacon fried to a crisp .
The amount is up to you .
I used 8 - 12 strips of thick - cut bacon .
I REALLY love bacon .
Reserve 1/2 cup of the heavy cream .
Combine all the other ingredients in a medium sauce pan .
Stir to combine .
Set on medium high heat .
Stir occasionally and cook until 240* .
The candy is now at firm - ball stage .
Remove from the stove and carefully stir in the remaining 1/2 cup cream .
Place back on the heat and continue to cook to 245 * .
Immediately remove from heat and stir in a portion of the crispy bacon .
Pour the caramel into a buttered dish ( the size depends on how thick you want your caramels .
8×8 = thick caramels 9×13 = thin caramels .
You can also use a cookie sheet ) .
Scatter the remaining bacon on top .
Let set for at least 3 hours before cutting .
Wherever you are in the process of fulfilling your goals I do hope that these caramels inspire you to take a moment to stop , chew and savor the journey .
It is , after all , the best part .

Having a constantly running toilet is bad all the way around .
It 's bad for the environment because of the waste of water .
It 's bad for your waste system in general as it will cause accelerated corrosion or mineral buildup , and it 's bad for your budget because it 's wasting water that you pay for .
So , to start let 's see why it 's running .
Carefully remove the toilet tank lid and look into the tank .
Usually one of two things will be happening .
Either the float is set too high and the water is running into the overflow tube or the flush valve is not sealing and the water isnâ€™t running into the overflow tube .
The overflow tube is a Ð… - 1 inch diameter tube sticking up in the middle of the tank and usually has a small hose attached to the top pointing down into the tube .
If water is running down this tube you need to adjust the float .
There are several styles .
One is the older float ball that resembles a balloon on a stick .
The other is a cylinder that slides up and down the valve where the water comes out .
Either way the adjustment is the same principal , to make the float close the valve at the appropriate height , lower .
The ball and arm type is easy , either turn the screw in the top of the valve down a turn or two or bend the arm slightly so the ball is lower in the tank .
Flush and see if this takes care of the problem , if not repeat the process and try it again .
This should take care of it .
The other type float is a little more involved and requires that you shut the water off to the tank , empty the tank by holding the flush handle down , sponging out the remaining water and then removing the valve from the tank .
Once you have the valve out you will see that the top of the valve will turn to adjust the level of the water .
Make sure you turn it so the float is lower .
Then reinstall the valve making sure the valve gasket in the bottom of the tank is securely seated so there are no external leaks .
Once everything is back together again turn on the water slowly and refill the tank .
If after completing the described steps the valve still runs it has either failed or has debris in it that is not allowing the diaphragm to close .
Removing the top of these valves is fairly easy .
Once again turn off the water to the tank and drain it .
No need to sponge it out this time .
The screws holding the top of the valve in place are obvious .
Remove them very carefully and set them aside .
Carefully lift the top of the valve .
Watch for any small springs or other parts that might be there to fall out .
With the valve top and diaphragm removed hold your hand over the top of the valve and slowly turn on the water just a small amount .
Allow the water to flow through the valve for five seconds then shut the water off and reassemble the valve top .
Fill the tank and check it .
If the problem remains you will have to replace the valve .
If no water is running down the overflow tube when you first lift the tank lid , but the toilet is running , your flush valve is not seating .
Sometimes they get dislodged slightly , but usually it is from age .
They get less pliable and just simply no longer seal .
If you can see right away that the vale is slightly askew and can reposition it to correct the problem great .
If not , then replace it .
They are very inexpensive .
In the end if any of these remedies begin to be more trouble than they are worth , they probably are , and my advice would be to replace everything .
An entire valve system , complete with flush valve and float valve can be found at most hardware stores for between $ 15 - $ 30 and it would give you an opportunity to upgrade the system to a newer , more efficient style .
I hope this helps .
Toilets are not that complex , but if in the end you decide you canâ€™t fix it or donâ€™t want to mess with it , call a plumber or handyman .
Either one should be able to take care of it quickly at not too great an expense .
Secession Week : Friday – Non-territorial Secession
Welcome to our penultimate Secession Week post , in celebration of Independence Day tomorrow .
Today ’s concept is non-territorial secession , or seceding without moving .
For those who are totally unfamiliar with the concept , I offer a brief introduction .
Overview
This is not a new concept , and has been proposed by many names and in many flavors , such as :
Polycentric Law : “ a legal structure in which providers of legal systems compete or overlap in a given jurisdiction , as opposed to monopolistic statutory law according to which there is a sole provider of law for each jurisdiction . ”
Market Anarchism : a “ philosophy in which monopoly of force held by government would be replaced by a competitive market of private institutions offering security , justice , and other defense services – “ the private allocation of force , without central control ” .
A market would exist where providers of security and law compete for voluntarily paying customers that wish to receive the services rather than individuals being taxed without their consent and assigned a monopoly provider of force . ”
FOCJ : Functional , Overlapping , and Competing Jurisdictions – A reinvention of these 150 - year old ideas by Swiss economists Bruno Frey and Reiner Eichenberger in the 1990s , in articles like FOCJ : Competitive Governments For Europe .
Panarchy : “ a conceptual term first coined by the Belgian botanist and economist Paul Emile de Puydt in 1860 , referring to a specific form of governance ( - archy ) that would encompass ( pan - ) all others … In his 1860 article “ Panarchy ” de Puydt … applied the concept to the individual ’s right to choose any form of government without being forced to move from their current locale .
This is sometimes described as “ extra- territorial ” ( or “ exterritorial ” ) since governments often would serve non-contiguous parcels of land . ”
Arnold Kling contributes a post about the idea , which he calls Virtual Secession :
The problem with physical secession is that it is very difficult to achieve critical mass .
There is probably not much overlap between the people you want to live with and the people who want to choose your particular form of government .
The vast majority of us put up with government we dislike in order to live in proximity to people with whom we want to work and play .
With virtual secession , you could still live in San Francisco or Manhattan or Silver Spring while seceding from much of the government at the city , state , and Federal level .
You and your next - door neighbor might belong to very different governmental units .
Arnold also has a paper on Competitive Government which covers a number of different models , some much like non-territorial secession , with great references .
( A post of mine about how seasteading relates ) .
Historical Cases
Historical context is very important when it comes to questioning the current method of governing .
If a system has worked in the past , it is much more likely to be able to work in the future .
I have two favorite references for historical methods of providing today ’s government services privately on a person - by - person basis .
The first is The Voluntary City : Choice , Community , and Civil Society , edited by David Beito , Peter Gordon , and Alexander Tabarrok .
Its essays contain a wide range of examples of past methods of providing today ’s monopoly services on a voluntary basis .
The second is The Enterprise of Law : Justice Without The State , by Bruce Benson .
In addition to offering theoretical discussions of virtual secession , the author covers the history of law enforcement in England over the last millennia .
This history gives the lie to today ’s automatic assumption that courts and police must be public monopolies .
Systems very different from what we are used to can function , and function well – sometimes even better than our own .
This book influenced me strongly , by giving historical reality behind a set of ideas that I had thought might only work in theory .
There are other interesting examples of societies where laws enforcement was provided in a non-territorial fashion , such as David Friedman ’s work on Iceland and the Xeer law in Somalia .
Peter Leeson ’s Cato Unbound essay Self - Governance Works More Often Than You Think contains numerous historical examples as well .
Polycentric Law
This article by law professor Tom Bell is a good introduction from a legal perspective , and Randy Barnett wrote an entire book , The Structure of Liberty , exploring the idea of a polycentric constitutional order .
Bruce Benson , whose book will be discussed below , has a good article about Polycentric Governance :
Let me say that my own preferred terminology here is “ customary law communities ” ( bottom - up development of rules and institutions as opposed to top - down imposition of rules and institutions under “ authoritarian law ” ) .
These communities do not just rely on self - enforcement in the sense of unilateral ( morality - driven ) or bilateral ( e.g. tit - for - tat ) actions .
They often establish third party dispute resolution mechanisms ( arbitration , mediation ) backed by ostracism threats , and other institutions .
The first point I want to make is that while these communities may be based on geographic proximity , they also may be based on kinship , functional proximity as in a trade association or the “ business community , ” religion , or any of a number of factors that create repeated dealings and / or reputation effects ) .
This article is part of an entire issue of Cato Unbound , in August 2007 , devoted to a discussion of non-territorial governance , although with a rather more provocative title :
Market Anarchism
Wikipedia states that the main 20th century proponents of this model were Murray Rothbard and David Friedman ( who happens to be my dad ) .
David ’s book Machinery of Freedom is an excellent introduction to the subject , focused somewhat on libertarians , and written very accessibly .
This annotated bibliography contains the key Rothbardian references and a number of others .
Bryan Caplan ’s FAQ is another great source of information .
The best current work being done in this area , in my opinion , is by Stefan Molyneux at Freedomain Radio .
He has some excellent books available for free online , as well as over a thousand podcasts and many videos , like this introduction to the site :
A glaring hole in most market anarchist works is the lack of any reasonable incremental path to get from current monopolistic governments to ones where unbundled services are provided privately .
Agorism addresses this by proposing a steady process of economic secession to develop private provision of police and courts over time .
I have questioned Agorism on this blog , although a number of Agorists believe I have misunderstood or misanalyzed the approach .
Regardless of the merits of Agorism ’s specific incremental strategy , at least they have one .
Panarchy
Reader Adam Knott offers a selection of works to read :
First , the original essay “ Panarchy , ” published in 1860 by Paul Emile de Puydt .
In this essay , de Puydt lays out his vision of the idea of multiple nonterritorial coexisting governments .
This essay is one of the most wonderful essays in libertarian literature , written entirely without rancor .
In this essay , de Puydt explains that government should be something open to individual choice and something nonterritorial in nature , just as religions are .
Second , a compilation of essays written by living panarchist authors , including John Zube , the oldest living panarchist philosopher .
These are wonderful and original essays that make the case for voluntary choice in governments .
One of the articles , by Gene Callahan , is written specifically on the subject of secessionism .
But all the essays are about the individual ’s right to choose his government ( his right to exit , join , or form them ) and not have it imposed upon him on the basis of geography .
And finally , The Present State of Liberty is an essay I self published in 2007 .
In this essay , I argue that libertarianism has failed as a political movement because it is still a movement that thinks in terms of political monopolism and geographic government .
I argue that libertarians generally either support liberalizing a democracy , or they support the utopian vision of a particular author ( such as Rand or Rothbard ) , but neither of these things is true liberty , because neither vision includes the right to opt out or secede and go one ’s own way .
Liberty exists when the individual may choose , not only goods and services and his place of domicile , but also the government he lives under .
Here at Let A Thousand Nations Bloom , we could n’t agree more .
Everyone has a different concept of freedom and utopia , and we seek a world where any group who share a vision can go form a sovereign country , and thus individuals have a myriad array of choices for types of governments to live under .
( Note that there is a Facebook group for Supporters of Libertarian Extraterritorial Secession . )
This post is merely a short overview of some of the flavors of and references for virtual , extraterritorial , or non-territorial secession .
Functional , overlapping , and competing providers of government services is a large area of political thought , with numerous high - quality books , essays , and academic papers .
These references should be a good start .
We hope you ’ll take a brief break from your BBQing and fireworks to join us tomorrow for our final day of Secession Week , focused on the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution .
Last week I ’ve done the ctype wrapper of Glib GString , but the performance issues when compared with cStringIO or StringIO was very poor , due to overhead of the ctypes calls .
So I ’ve written a new C extension for Python , the source - code ( for linux ) and install packages ( for win32 ) are available at the project site .
Here is some performance comparisons :
Those tests were done to test string concatenation ( append ) of the three modules .
You can find more about the tests and performance in the project site .
I hope you enjoy =)
Americans have a love affair with credit cards .
Many Americans have more credit cards in their wallets than they do dollar bills .
When 8,000,000 credit cards were yanked from circulation many consumers realized that this was a new era of austerity .
Credit card debt otherwise known as revolving debt , peaked in September of 2008 at a stunning height of $ 976 billion .
Nearly a trillion ( with a t ) was reached during the peak and a spike in borrowing occurred because of good and bad times .
Americans were attempting to balance their short - fall in wages with debt during the recession but during the boom , credit cards were seen as a form of wealth .
As long as access to debt was available , it did n’t seem like much of a problem to many .
Now with nearly 1 out of 5 Americans eligible for work being unemployed or underemployed the usage of credit cards was trying to spike but credit card insurers have cut back access to debt :
* In billions
Since the peak in September , revolving debt has been on a steady decline .
Since that point , some $ 50 billion in credit card debt has been removed from the system .
At the same time , the average credit card interest rate has gone up from 12.72 percent in 2004 to a current rate of 13.31 percent .
This is happening in a time when the Federal Reserve is holding rates near their zero bound yet very little of this is making its way to the consumer .
Banks are not lending because they realize that for an entire decade they have been giving too much debt to people highly unlikely to pay it back .
Under the guise of helping the consumer , banks and Wall Street intimidated the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve to give them access to cheap and plentiful amounts of debt .
Remember the argument of keeping the life blood of America going linking credit to this premise ?
Well as you can see , access to debt is becoming more and more restrictive .
But the game is radically changing .
Credit card companies cannot squeeze more juice out of a turnip so they are now going after borrowers on good terms and playing fast and easy with contracts and terms :
“( MSNBC )
When James received a great credit card offer two years ago – a 4.99 percent interest on balance transfers for the life of the card – he jumped at it .
He used the cheap money to remodel the kitchen of his Los Angeles - area home .
He never expected the new kitchen would turn him into a pawn in a chess match playing out among Congress , bank regulators and credit card firms .
The offer , from JP Morgan Chase had only one obvious stipulation :
No late payments .
Because the rate was far lower than a home equity loan at the time , James used the credit card for the construction project , borrowing around $ 20,000 .
His monthly payments were very affordable – just under $ 300 .
Paying the minimum 2 percent each month , he ’d pay off the loan in about 8 years .
James , who requested anonymity because he ’s uncomfortable discussing his personal finances in public - made sure to pay on time each month , jealously guarding the terms of his cut -rate loan .
Little did he realize that Chase could find a way to make his life miserable without raising his interest rate .
But Chase recently threw James– and perhaps hundreds of thousands of other consumers – a huge credit card curveball .
The firm sent letters to customers beginning in late June indicating that minimum payments would be raised from 2 percent to 5 percent .
In August , his monthly payment will spike to $ 750 . ”
Now imagine someone who has lost their job or has had their hours cutback .
For most Americans finding an additional $ 750 a month is not an easy task .
I can speak from my own experience that credit card companies are doing these kind of tactics .
I had a 4.99 percent balance transfer offer that I went after in 2007 for the life of the entire balance .
During that time , the credit card company continually tried to advertise great deals and how I should use the card to purchase goods .
Of course , doing this would force the new debt onto the higher 20 percent area .
And when you pay back this credit card , your payment would go to the 4.99 percent balance and not the new 20 percent purchase .
These are the kind of gimmicks they use but I never purchased anything beyond the balance transfer .
However , the system they used switched to paperless and they stopped sending a statement to my home recently .
When they sent an e-mail bill it was spam blocked along with Nigerian scams and a few days later I noticed the entire balance was up to 20 percent .
Now I do n’t recommend carrying a balance .
This is a bad move .
But I had figured that at 4.99 percent the money was a good deal .
Yet I talked with my attorney and wrote the credit card company a note which brought the promotional rate back .
Either way , credit card companies can do what they want .
They are not in the business of charity .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are looking out for banks and Wall Street .
American consumers are on their own .
You need to be vigilant .
Most of the credit card companies are trying to jack up their rates before new legislation makes it harder in 2010 to pilfer the American public :
“ Tens of millions of Chase customers have taken advantage of our promotional low rate financing over the last five years , ” she said .
“ Most of these loans have been paid back in less than 24 months .
However , there have been a small percentage of customers that have not made as much progress in paying down these loans .
Our desire is to have these balances paid back in a reasonable period of time . ”
Bill Hardekopf , who runs LowCards.com , said banks are following through on warnings that credit card expenses for consumers would rise after passage of the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility , and Disclosure Act .
“ From an issuer standpoint , they are looking at their default rates going up , they are in tremendous economic distress and they are trying to minimize their risk as much as possible , ” he said .
“ Issuers feel they need to find ways to make up for revenue they are projecting they are going to lose once the legislation takes effect . ”
Chase told msnbc.com that it would work with consumers who are unable to make their new payments , but James said that ’s merely an invitation into a lion ’s den .
The only offer he received was a severe change in terms to his account with a much higher , variable interest rate .
When the new federal regulations take effect next year , they will severely limit banks ’ ability to change rates unless cardholders have variable - rate agreements , so banks are trying to steer consumers away from fixed - rate cards .
Bank of America , for example , recently sent notices to cardholders with fixed rates telling them their accounts will be changed to variable rates starting next month . ”
So for the moment , they ’ll be changing rates at will for the tiniest infractions .
Or because they feel like it .
Also , I have gotten a few letters where you actually have to call to opt - out of a rate increase .
I have a credit card with a fixed 6 percent purchase rate but recently , the issuer sent out a notice stating that they would raise the rate to a variable rate of 15 percent if I did n’t opt - out .
I nearly tossed the letter into the junk mail bin but did a double - take .
Who in the world would sign on to this ?
They are betting on many , like I almost did , tossing the letter into the trash and one day waking up seeing the rate skyrocket to 15 percent .
This is the new reality .
The massive amount of debt created by the multi- decade long housing bubble created a cultural psychology and love with debt .
The last generation from the Great Depression knew the slippery slope of debt and many stayed away from it or at the very least , were very skeptical .
That was not the case for the past 20 years .
Credit cards were glorified and even became a designer symbol .
A gold card used to mean something .
Now , everyone has a gold card , platinum card , or some titanium card .
Who really cares ?
The real value comes from the terms which have become more onerous .
Yet psychology is a big player here because people “ feel ” richer with a titanium card in their wallet even though they are flat broke and in massive debt .
If you want a sample look of where things are going , take a look at FDIC insured charge off rates for California :
The charge off rate went from $ 12 million in 2006 , to $ 17 million in 2007 , to $ 30 million in 2008 .
The current rate is tracking over $ 40 million for the year and keep in mind late payments are shooting up .
This may seem tiny but these are highly leveraged products and banks have these items as assets on their books .
More losses coming down the pipeline and more pressure for banks to squeeze the American public so make sure you stay vigilant .

Ever wonder who uses Internet dating services like Match.com and eHarmony.com ?
The answer may surprise you .
I think , “ Well , gee , everybody uses them ! ”
But that ’s not the case .
There ’s a particular psychological profile that researchers have discovered of users of Internet dating services .
The researchers ( Kim et al. , 2009 ) surveyed 3,345 people in the U.S. , of which 1,588 ( 47.5 % ) were men and 1,757 ( 52.5 % ) were women .
Ages ranged from 19 to 89 with a mean of 48 years old .
They gathered their data using a number of standardized questionnaires and psychological measures .
The researchers found that people who are more “ sociable are more likely to use Internet dating services than are those who are less sociable .
This finding challenges the stereotypical profiling of
Internet daters as being just lonely and socially anxious people . ”
Indeed , that finding confirms the idea that Internet dating is firmly in the mainstream now .
While that may have not been the case 10 years ago , times have changed and using the Internet as a means of finding a prospective partner is no longer thought of as unusual .
The researchers finding in this regard is not unique — previous research has come to the same conclusion , so it ’s considered a robust research finding .
For people who are already sociable , using the Internet as a dating method is just one more tool at their disposal .
But not all sociable folks consider the use of Internet dating .
If you have high self - esteem and consider romantic relationships to be an important part of your life , you ’re more likely to use Internet dating .
If you have low self - esteem and consider romantic relationships not to be an important part of your life , you ’re also more likely to use Internet dating .
So the researchers found that if you have low self - esteem and put some value on to your romantic relationships , you ’re actually less likely to use Internet dating .
The researchers explain the findings this way :
If the success of romantic relationships is the domain of self worth , one may try to increase the prospect of success and avoid failure in romantic relationships .
In the context of Internet dating , when sociable people consider romantic relationships to be an important domain for self - worth , those with high self - esteem will be more likely than those with low self esteem to use Internet dating services .
The reason is that when sociable people consider romantic relationships to be an important domain for self - worth , those with high self - esteem will find it comfortable to present themselves to a multitude
of anonymous people , whereas those with low self - esteem will be more likely to experience a higher level of stress just thinking about disclosing and promoting themselves on the Internet .
Less confident individuals may not want their negative self - views publicized or viewed by others .
To reduce such negative feelings and protect their self - worth , those with low self - esteem will adopt avoidance strategies and distance themselves from Internet dating services .
Makes sense .
High self - esteem folks feel like they have little to lose by trying Internet dating .
Low self - esteem folks have more to lose , since more of their own self - value is tied up in the process — unless they say , “ Ah , yeah , it ’s nice to have a partner , but whatever .
I ’m also just fine without one . ”
The upshot is that Internet dating is no longer the domain of the desperate nor those with low self - esteem ( if it ever was ) .
The New York Times has a related article about the science ( or lack thereof ) behind the sites that claim such science helps you make better choices about dating .
I think the science of such sites is ultimately of limited value , since no amount of data is going to predict whether two people will experience that indefinable quality of a “ spark ” on a first date .
Without that , there will be no relationship .
Technology Review also weighed in this past week about the overwhelming number of choices of online dating and the research that has shown the more choices we have , the harder it can be sometimes to make a decision ( “ cognitive overload ” ) .
That ’s why the sites try their best to offer you a way to limit the results displayed , but ultimately can fail in paring things down enough to make a difference to your brain .

Europe may now decide not to send a rover in 2016 The European and US space agencies ( Esa and Nasa ) have taken a significant step towards teaming up to explore Mars .
They have announced a joint initiative for robotic exploration of the Red Planet following a two - day summit in Plymouth , UK , last month .
But this means European space ministers now face tough decisions over the future of Esa 's ExoMars rover mission .
They need to decide whether to totally re-scope ExoMars in the light of new options opened up by the collaboration .
Nasa and Esa have been eyeing a mutual arrangement on Mars exploration because of the growing cost of such missions and because of shared science goals .
The new plan is called the Mars Exploration Joint Initiative , or MEJI , and will investigate collaborative activities between the agencies for launch opportunities in 2016 , 2018 and 2020 ( launch opportunities to Mars come up roughly every two years ) .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Nasa and Esa envisage sending landers and orbiters to conduct astrobiological , geological and geophysical investigations on the Red Planet over the coming decade .
The ultimate goal of the collaboration is an international mission to bring back geological samples from the Red Planet .
Speaking to BBC
News on the eve of the Plymouth talks , Nasa 's associate administrator for science , Dr Ed Weiler , said : " We have very similar scientific goals , maybe we ought to consider working together jointly on all our future Mars missions , so that we can do more than either one of us can do by ourselves . "
He said the talks would see if Esa and Nasa could come up with a " western hemisphere Mars programme " .
The US space agency 's delegation to Plymouth was led by Dr Weiler .
They were joined at the table by an Esa team headed by Professor David Southwood , the European agency 's director of science and robotic exploration .
Mars Science Laboratory is due to launch in 2011
In order to have launched the ExoMars mission as it was previously envisaged , Esa would have needed up to about 1.5 bn euros .
The rover is currently expected to launch in 2016 , and will scour the Martian surface for signs of past or present life .
But last year , following a process where space ministers indicated what they could subscribe , Esa 's director - general Jean - Jacques Dordain promised European governments that the cost of the project would be kept as close as possible to the resulting total of 850 m euros .
Esa officials believe the way forward is through collaboration with the US , which is now expected to make a major investment in the mission .
Under one scenario which has been discussed , America would supply a launch rocket , a carrier spacecraft and an orbiter to accompany the European - built rover to the Red Planet in 2016 .
But other possible options have emerged since the bilateral agency talks in Plymouth .
These might see just an orbiter being sent to Mars in 2016 and then two rovers being dispatched to the surface in 2018 .
Getting together Dr David Parker , director of space science at the British National Space Centre ( BNSC ) , said : " The UK is very supportive of Esa and Nasa getting together .
" We feel it makes sense in the long term to minimise duplication of effort in terms of , for example , the number of rockets you need to buy to do Mars exploration . "
Dr Parker , who is also chair of the International Mars Exploration Working Group ( IMEWG ) , added : " Nasa has the goal of launching an orbiter in 2016 to focus on the methane that was discovered by [ Europe 's ] Mars Express [ satellite ] .
" If there 's a way of Europe being involved in following up the Mars Express findings ... that would be very exciting because the methane either implies geological activity or something else even more dramatic .
" In terms of the UK interest , we really want to make sure there is a sophisticated rover with a good set of life search instruments .
That remains our key priority in the UK . "
As plans develop , they will be reviewed by Esa member states for approval and by the US National Academy of Sciences .
Spreading the cost If ExoMars were to be re-scoped , there could be important ramifications for European industry , as contracts for developing elements of the mission are already in place .
And if financial contributions to the mission from Esa member states were to change substantially , the space agency might have to re-visit the balance of industrial work allocated to different countries through the process of " juste retour " .
Esa 's rules of juste retour ensure the work which returns to a member state reflects the financial contribution it makes to a programme .
In return for the US investment in ExoMars , European money would be put into future Red Planet missions .
America has its own concerns : Nasa is having to plan ahead with reduced money for Mars exploration , and , like Europe , is keen to discuss sharing the cost of future missions to the Red Planet .
Nasa is due to launch a $ 2.3 bn nuclear - powered rover known as Mars Science Laboratory ( also called " Curiosity " ) to the planet in 2011 .
MSL was previously to have launched in 2009 .
However , technical difficulties forced Nasa to delay the mission by two years , adding about $ 400 m to the cost .
In addition to the MEJI venture , the agencies agreed to establish a " joint architecture review team " to assist both sides in planning the Mars mission portfolio .

The " Blair for EU President " drum is being banged again .
Whether this is part of some jockeying strategy designed to increase the UK 's bargaining power on other matters or not , it seems that it 's time to speak out again :
Tony Blair would be a most unsuitable " President of the European Union " ;
the Blair candidature encounters strong opposition among EU citizens .
The new President of the European Council , under the Lisbon Treaty , would have very considerable powers allied to the prestige of representing the 27 - nation union and its citizens .
The post seems necessarily to call for a consensual figure whose past acts have been unambiguously in favour of the core values and the harmonious development of the European Union .
On each of these counts , Tony Blair fails to convince .
He is not consensual , either in terms of the support he might command among EU citizens , or in terms of his international reputation , stained by the invasion of Iraq on false pretences , his recent non-performance as Quartet envoy to the Middle East while apparently performing to his own profit as an international consultant and public speaker .
He has not been unambiguous in his support of core values of the European project : his government in the UK was marked by a major decline in civil liberties and by complicity with the US in the programme of extraordinary renditions , contrary to the European Convention of Human Rights , and he opposed the inclusion in the Lisbon Treaty of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights , securing an opt - out for the UK .
Though he speaks of himself as pro-European , Blair 's decade as British Prime Minister did not see his country join essential European structures like the Euro and Schengen .
And he steadfastly opposed , in the Lisbon negotiations , social and tax harmonisation measures and a common defence and foreign policy .
For these reasons alone , a Blair presidency would be incongruous .
And his candidature sparks off strong opposition .
If you have n't already done so , join those who have signed our Stop Blair ! petition .

Virus May Signal First ' Zombie ' Cell Phone Network
For first time , hackers may have created a network of infected cell phones .
July 18 , 2009  --
For the first time criminal hackers may have succeeded in creating a network of " zombie " cellphones , infected without the owners ' knowledge with software that can be used to send spam or carry out cyber attacks .
Botnets , as such networks are known , are usually made up of infected personal computers and are used to make money from spam or extortion .
Millions of machines worldwide are secretly running botnet software and it has been estimated that one in four US personal computers is part of a botnet .
No botnet has ever been discovered running on mobile devices – until now , that is .
Security firm Symantec , headquartered in Cupertino , California , says that a piece of software known as Sexy Space may be the first case .
Unsafe Sex Message
Sexy Space uses text messages reading " A very sexy girl , Try it now ! " to jump between phones .
The messages contains a link that , when clicked , asks the user to download software which , once installed , sends the same message to contacts stored in the phone .
Similar SMS viruses have been seen before .
But Sexy
Space is unusual in that it also communicates with a central server and can thus be controlled by the hackers who created it – the feature that gives conventional botnets their power .
If the network of infected phones is seen to be responding to remote commands , it can be described as a true botnet .
Zulfikar Ramzan , Symantec 's technical director of security response , notes that it is not yet clear how Sexy Space will use the connection to the central server .
" But this has all the makings of a mobile botnet , " he says .
Network Threat
" As PC botnets go it 's unsophisticated , " adds Ben Feinstein of SecureWorks , a computer security firm based in Atlanta , Georgia .
" But it 's a new development in the world of mobile malware . "
Mobile botnets would pose entirely new security threats , says Feinstein .
For example , researchers have shown that one could disable parts of the mobile phone network by flooding it with text messages .
i Phone Could Spy on IT Infrastructure
Infected devices could also be used to infiltrate computer networks .
In a demonstration last year , a team from Errata Security , also in Atlanta , used an iPhone sent to a company to spy on its IT infrastructure .
While it sat in the firm 's mailroom the phone sent back information about the local wireless systems and computers .
A criminal hacker could use the same technique to break into a company 's internal computer network , Errata 's researchers claim .

The economic position that the United States is now in is the result of a series of economic bubbles .
To explain the nature of bubbles , I 'm going to start by talking about their history ; I 'm not going to go all the way back to Tulip Mania and John Law , but I do want to mention some things from the Roaring Twenties that might sound familiar to us today .
Over the eight - year period of that boom , the money supply increased by 62 percent .
All kinds of new appliances and gadgets were sold : refrigerators , phonographs , electric irons , toasters , and vacuum cleaners .
Many more cars were built — more than twice as many in 1929 than in 1919 .
More and more leisure activities became popular .
More hotels were built , as were more roadside diners .
There was an explosion of movie theaters , and of developments in Hollywood .
Professional sports became a big business .
Skyscrapers such as the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building were started .
There was a speculative boom in Florida real estate .
The stock market boomed .
Hoover promised a chicken in every pot .
I do n't know what Obama 's going to promise — maybe pot in every kitchen .
I always talk about the economics of booms and bubbles in the framework that Murray Rothbard outlined in his great book , What Has Government Done To Our Money .
He points out that inflation confers no general social benefit .
Just creating more money does not create more benefit for the general public .
It merely redistributes wealth to the first people to receive the new money .
Since 1998 , the money supply ( as measured by M2 ) has doubled .
In fact , it has increased elevenfold since 1971 , when we gave up the last ties of the gold standard .
So we have an expansion in the money supply now that is similar to what we had during the Roaring Twenties .
We also have a series of bubbles : a tech bubble , then a real - estate bubble — all part of what Bill Fleckenstein calls " Operation Enduring Bubble . "
Of course , inflation and the resulting bubbles have disastrous economic effects .
But in Human Action , Mises wrote that
The boom produces impoverishment .
But still more disastrous are its moral ravages .
It makes people despondent and dispirited .
The more optimistic they were under the illusory prosperity of the boom , the greater is their despair and their feeling of frustration .
The individual is always ready to ascribe his good luck to his own efficiency and to take it as a well - deserved reward for his talent , application , and probity .
But reverses of fortune he always charges to other people , and most of all to the absurdity of social and political institutions .
He does not blame the authorities for having fostered the boom .
He reviles them for the inevitable collapse .
That is exactly what most people are doing today .
They 're blaming Wall Street .
Everyone congratulated themselves when their homes were doubling in value .
Everybody thought they were smart to pick those stocks in their 401 ( k ) plans .
But now that the bubble has popped , it 's all Wall Street 's fault .
I spent 22 years in banking in Las Vegas — I guess that means I was somewhat in the bubble business myself .
There was a couple in Las Vegas : the gentleman was a house painter and his wife was a hairdresser .
One day , a lady came in to get her hair done .
The hairdresser mentioned to her , " Gee , you know , I 'm really interested in getting into real estate . "
This was 2004 , at the height of the real - estate bubble in Vegas .
– Ludwig von Mises
" The individual is always ready to ascribe his good luck to his own efficiency … .
But reverses of fortune he always charges to other people …. "
Well , the woman getting her hair done said , " Boy , have I got the person for you .
My husband 's a realtor , and he 's a mortgage broker ; he can find you tenants ; he can do the whole thing , soup to nuts . "
The painter and the hairdresser had a combined income of $ 60,000 .
Nonetheless , they felt at the time that they were capable of buying seven homes .
Of course , the guy who was a real - estate salesman and a mortgage broker found them not only one no -money - down loan ; he found them seven no -money - down loans .
And it just so happens that the broker 's wife was also a mortgage - loan processor .
It really was a one - stop shop .
So the painter and the hairdresser bought the seven houses , taking on a debt of $ 2.6 million .
And the real - estate broker said , " You know , you 've made a great investment because , based on my calculations about where real estate 's going to go in Las Vegas , within five years you 're going to have home equity of $ 1.3 million . "
Well , you already know how this turns out .
Their monthly debt payment was $ 5,772 .
If you take their $ 60,000 , and divide it by 12 , you get $ 5,000 ; so their payments were more than their gross income between the two of them .
So they took on $ 2.6 million worth of debt , with the hopes that the properties would be worth $ 4.4 million within a couple of years .
That assumption meant that the price of those seven homes had to reach $ 286 per square foot .
Now , I can tell you that those homes in Vegas today are selling for less than $ 86 a square foot .
You might think that , in the end , these folks just filed bankruptcy , and learned a lesson — " Well , I guess we are n't as smart as we thought we were . "
No .
They sued .
They sued the realtor , who was of course the mortgage broker , whose wife was the mortgage - loan processor .
That story really captures what Mises was talking about in Human Action .
In a boom , when it 's going well , we all feel really smart ; we believe that all the good things that seem to be happening are our own doing .
Then , afterwards , when things do n't work out , we blame it all on other people .
The Illusion of Efficiency
During a boom , inflation distorts business calculations .
Entire business plans are built on a boom , based on the ability of people to borrow and consume .
Look at the recent bankruptcies that we 've had : Circuit City , Sharper Image , Goodies , Gottschalks , CompUSA , and Levitz Furniture .
In Vegas , Herbst Gaming has already gone bankrupt , and now even the Riviera is talking about it .
All these business plans that seemed like a good idea in the boom did n't work out .
The most obvious effects this time around are in real estate .
We all know about real estate .
What you may not realize is there is still more excess real estate coming online .
There are 93,000 high - rise condos coming online this year .
That 's a 28 percent increase in the US inventory of high - rises .
When you build a big tall cylinder , it 's not like you can quit halfway up .
You 've got to go all the way .
It may have seemed like a good idea during the boom , but now you have to finish it during the bust .
There are these 93,000 condos ; 12,000 of those are in New Jersey and New York ( I do n't think they 're creating a whole lot of new jobs in New York right now ) 4,000 of them are in Vegas ; 5,500 in Chicago ; and 3,500 in Florida .
So we 'll see more and more real - estate fallout .
The main difficulty is getting people to close on real - estate purchases .
This is a problem even if you 're The Donald .
Donald Trump built a nice tower in Las Vegas , and it was completely sold out within days .
However , now that the project is ready for people to move in , he 's only closed 25 percent of his sales .
He 's been quoted as saying , " We 're really doing very well in Vegas , if you take into account that Vegas is in a depression . "
That 's keeping the sunny side up , I would say .
I read in the Wall Street Journal recently that the downturn will be less severe because the service economy is more stable than farming was during the Great Depression .
And I thought , that does n't make sense .
That would mean that the masseuses and blackjack dealers are more likely to keep their job than the farmers — the people who grow food ?
It seems crazy , but that 's what people are talking about .
During a boom , inflation creates illusory profits and distorts economic calculation .
What the free market does best is penalize the inefficient and reward the efficient .
But when you get a boom , the rising tide lifts all boats .
I used to have borrowers who built houses .
They were continually over budget and never got anything done on time .
But during the boom , were they penalized ?
No , because the price went up over time .
In fact , they thought they were doing the right thing ; they were smart by being over budget , and taking an extra six months to build a house — the price went up !
Well , that 's not what 's supposed to happen , and in the end , the bust penalized them .
Because of these illusory profits , everybody wants to get in on the boom .
Everyone thinks they can do everything .
My favorite example is that doctors become real - estate developers .
You go into a doctor and all he wants to talk about is his real - estate project .
Furthermore , during inflation , the quality of work goes down .
Everyone tries to manufacture products as quickly as they can .
There 's no emphasis on how long things will last .
That was certainly the case with new houses in Arizona , California , and Nevada .
In general , people become enamored with get - rich - quick schemes .
In fact , entire countries have done this with the collateralized debt obligation ( CDO ) market .
Iceland , for instance , has become one big hedge fund .
And now we 're going to have entire countries go broke .
People scorn sober effort in favor of getting in on the house - flipping craze .
Bartenders become real - estate agents and mortgage brokers .
I remember a guy in the locker room at the country club , talking on the phone , telling somebody that he was on the list to buy a home at nine different new home tracts .
That was whole his business plan .
If he got on the initial waiting list , it was certain that immediately after each home was built he was going to be able to flip it and make 50 or 100 thousand dollars .
He planned on becoming a millionaire just like that .
I had a borrower who was a real - estate developer .
We went to dinner one night , and he brought his girlfriend .
I asked , " Harry , how'd you meet your girlfriend ? "
" Well , " he said , " I was driving through our project one night and I saw a girl jumping over a fence , looking at the homes . "
It turns out that she was a schoolteacher and she wanted to buy a home , but did n't have time to tour the models during the day .
" When you build a big tall cylinder , it 's not like you can quit halfway up . "
Of course , by the time I met Harry 's girlfriend at dinner , she was not a schoolteacher anymore .
She was now selling real estate for Harry .
Is that any wonder in Vegas , during the boom ?
There were 17,700 real - estate agents : one for every 100 people in the city .
It was hard not to have a bunch of friends who were selling real estate .
Nowadays , one in every 60 homes in Las Vegas is in foreclosure .
Those two numbers are probably connected somehow .
During a boom , everybody also wants to get involved in banks .
Investing in new start - up banks was a craze all over the country .
Investors in small community banks in Las Vegas made a lot of money .
So everyone just assumed that once you got your bank opened , it would be worth one and a half times what you put in it .
And by the time you showed a profit , your investment would have doubled .
By 2006 , there were 17 new banks in Nevada , and 50 in California , seeking regulatory approval .
I remember being in Phoenix , Arizona , on a business trip , and stumbling on an ad in a business journal that said , " Start Your Own Bank . "
Inflationary booms penalize thrift and reward debt .
The most poignant story about this is a man named Scott Coles , who was a hard - money lender in Phoenix , Arizona .
He had a huge operation that he had inherited from his father .
Hard money is lending money — that investors have actually saved — to real - estate developers who can't get bank finance .
Lenders like Mr. Coles can generally charge 10 to 15 percent for these loans .
The banks may be a lot cheaper , but the hard - money lenders are a lot easier to deal with .
At that time , Phoenix real estate became so overheated that people were borrowing on their home - credit lines at 5 percent , in order to turn around and lend hard money at ten percent , to play the arbitrage .
Of course , this all did n't work out : the projects did n't get done ; the loans did n't get paid back ; and , unfortunately , Mr. Coles committed suicide .
Inflation also lowers the general standard of living .
In the very course of creating a tinsel atmosphere of prosperity , people have to work harder .
They have to have two - income families just to keep up .
We all think we 're doing better : we 're buying more stuff , and we 're buying bigger houses to put our stuff in .
But we 're really getting less prosperous , and that 's what inflation does during a boom .
Mises wrote ,
If the crisis were ruthlessly permitted to run its course , bring about the destruction of enterprises which were unable to meet their obligations , then all entrepreneurs — not only banks but also other businessmen — would exhibit more caution in granting and using credit in the future .
Instead , public opinion approves of giving assistance in the crisis .
Then , no sooner is the worst over than the banks are spurred on to a new expansion of circulation credit .
And that 's where we are today .
That 's exactly what the Obama administration , and Ben Bernanke at the Fed , are trying to do .
There was a Treasury secretary , once upon a time , in 1929 , named Andrew Mellon .
He said to Herbert Hoover ,
Liquidate labor , liquidate stocks , liquidate the farmers , liquidate real estate . …
It will purge the rottenness of the system .
High costs of living and high living will come down .
People will work harder , live a more moral life .
Values will be adjusted , and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people .
Herbert Hoover did not listen to Andrew Mellon .
And believe me , Tim Geithner is no Andrew Mellon .
The Kennedy family will hold a private wake on their Cape Cod compound for Eunice Kennedy Shriver , the sister of former President John F. Kennedy , who died Tuesday at 88 .
Shriver 's body was returned this afternoon to the Hyannisport , Mass. , Kennedy compound , where WCVB - TV Boston reported the family will host her wake .
Shriver , who recently suffered a series of strokes , had been hospitalized in Massachusetts since last week and died early Tuesday morning at Cape Cod Hospital in Barnstable , Mass. , where her family was holding vigil .
In a statement released by her family , Shriver was described as " the light of our lives ... who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith - driven life of love and service to others . "
President Obama said today Shriver was an " extraordinary woman " who taught the world that " no physical or mental barrier can restrain the power of the human spirit . "
Shriver championed the rights of the mentally disabled and co-founded the Special Olympics in 1968 .
Her mentally handicapped sister , Rosemary , served as the inspiration for her efforts .

The nation ’s governors , Democrats as well as Republicans , voiced deep concern Sunday about the shape of the health care plan emerging from Congress , fearing that Washington was about to hand them expensive new Medicaid obligations without money to pay for them .
The role of the states in a restructured health care system dominated the summer meeting of the National Governors Association here this weekend  with bipartisan animosity voiced against the plan during a closed - door luncheon on Saturday and in a private meeting on Sunday with the health and human services secretary , Kathleen Sebelius .
“ I think the governors would all agree that what we do n’t want from the federal government is unfunded mandates , ” said Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont , a Republican , the group ’s incoming chairman .
“ We ca n’t have the Congress impose requirements that we are forced to absorb beyond our capacity to do so . ”
The governors ’ backlash creates yet another health care headache for the Obama administration , which has tried to recruit state leaders to pressure members of Congress to wrap up their fitful negotiations .
Both Ms. Sebelius , who was Kansas ’ governor before she joined the cabinet in April , and the federal Medicaid chief , Cindy Mann , made appearances at the meeting on Sunday .
Meanwhile , other administration officials spent the day pushing President Obama ’s proposal on television talk shows .

From TPM Reader DK …
I could be wrong , but I get the feeling Obama ’s approval is directly linked to Health Care .
I definitely cooled to him quite a bit , and it ’s due to the fact that he does n’t seem willing to reform financial institutions or go for the gold on the public option .
This seems to be a critical moment in his presidency .
A real healthcare bill with a public option will restore faith in him from the base and give centrists , who are more result oriented than concerned with what the results are , something to latch on to that he ’s still in control .
A toothless health care reform bill will be very difficult to recover from because he will be both chastened , and people like me will have lost faith in his boldness and commitment to change .
Obama , and the Democrats , fate is now entirely dependent on whether they come out of the health care fight taking on the special interests for the people , or having lost their spine in the face of corporate pressure .
I do n’t think the Democrats and Obama realize this , in their bubble facing pressure from insiders and industry , but at this point , self - preservation requires that a bill with a public option be passed by Democrats alone .
What does the party run on in the midterms if they do n’t ?
We know what the GOP will run on : the party ’s biggest failure .

The BBC is reporting that Obama ’s special envoy to AfPak , Richard Holbrooke , has had a shouting match with President Hamid Karzai over the desirability of a second round in the presidential election .
At the moment , with 17 % of ballots counted , Karzai is ahead of his nearest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , by 45 % to 35 % .
That tally would not allow the incumbent to avoid a run-off ( he needs 50 % for that outcome ) .
So I ask myself , why is Holbrooke in Karzai ’s office insisting that there be a run-off ?
Would n’t whether there is a second round depend on the outcome of the election ?
Why try to persuade Karzai ?
The only way this scenario makes sense to me is if US / NATO intelligence is reporting from the field that Karzai is rigging the election returns so as to ensure he gets to 50 % .
The presidential election , which had been intended by Obama and his NATO allies as a political victory over the Taliban , is swiftly turning into a major debacle .
Voter turnout fell from some 70 percent in the last presidential election , likely to only 30 - something percent this time ( not the 50 % initially estimated , presumably by someone with an interest in hyping the event for propaganda purposes ) .
In some southern provinces such as Helmand , turnout was only 10 percent , a datum that demonstrates that the people of Helmand simply had no voice in this election and it does not meet international standards of legitimacy .
( Voters must be held harmless from threats and violence ) .
Another presidential candidate , Sarwar Ahmadzai , has called for a do - over of the election in 12 provinces where there were “ irregularities ” :
‘ Sarwar Ahmadzai told a press conference in Kabul most of the rigging took place in Kandahar , Helmand , Uruzgan , Zabul , Nangarhar , Laghman , Kunar , Nuristan , Logar , Paktia , Paktika and Khost provinces .
He accused supporters of Hamid Karzai and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah of involvement in irregularities .
He said the rigging ranged from ballot box stuffing to voting by minors . ’
Abdullah Abdullah has also alleged ballot fraud .
If Karzai is so widely suspected of stealing this election , why is there not the same global reaction against him as there was against Ahmadinejad in Iran ?
Is there an unwritten rule that allies of the West get cut some slack ?
Moreover , it is clear that one of Karzai ’s less savory campaign techniques was to enlist the old sanguinary warlords on his side .
The US has lodged a complaint with Karzai about his choice of Northern Alliance general Mohammad Fahim as his vice president .
The Afghan Pajhwok News Service remarked dryly , “ Asked why the Obama administration did not want Fahim to be in the government , the official replied it could be for a number of reasons narcotics , drug trade and human rights violations . ”
Many officials from NATO countries with troops in Afghanistan are fed up with Karzai , who , they say , says all the right things and makes promises but never delivers on them .
Pepe Escobar is scathing on the failure of the elections as a justification for NATO ’s Afghan mission .

Mark Shuttleworth has offered to put more Canonical employees on to Debian at the expense of Ubuntu , in a potential compromise with angry Debian developers .
The offer is designed to help Debian hit a proposed code freeze date for the next version of the Linux distro in December .
Shuttleworth said the diversion would mean " we 'll get less done " on Ubuntu , which is based on Debian .
Shuttleworth hopes the offer will encourage Debian developers to agree to the freeze .
Shuttleworth positioned the offer in the spirit of working together to help all Linux distros and Debian itself .
" To achieve anything together , we 'll both need to work together , we 'll need to make compromises or we 'll need to contribute effort to the other side , " Shuttlewoth wrote on a Ubuntu mailing list .
His offer came after members of the Debian community objected to the proposed freeze , apparently slamming Ubuntu and Shuttleworth personally for using Debian to further their own commercial interests .
Shuttleworth said several folks had invoked his name and ascribed motivations that were " a little upsetting . "
" I 'd like to focus on what we can achieve together , and how we can lead a very significant improvement in the health of the whole free software ecosystem , " Shuttleworth said .
A plan to freeze Debian every two years was announced at the distro's DebConf on July 29 , in Spain .
This December was to be the first freeze in that cycle .
Such was the outcry , however , that the idea was immediately put on ice .
The Debian Project said on July 30 it had : " Decided to revisit its decision on December 2009 as the proposed freeze date " and promised a " new timeline " in early September .
Debian cited " consideration of the Debian community 's feedback " to the initial plan .
Only a day before Debian had proudly announced the planned freeze as being in the best interests of the project , Linux distros , and users .
" The new freeze policy will provide better predictability of releases for users of the Debian distribution , and also allow Debian developers to do better long - term planning .
A two - year release cycle will give more time for disruptive changes , reducing inconveniences caused for users , " Debian said in a statement on July 29 .
The reason for the reversal seems to be the freeze was taken by community members to mean Debian would be put on a timed release cycle of every two years .
Some might see that as a good thing for reliability and frequency .
Debian aims for a release every 18 months , but delays have happened in the past .
Debian freezes lock down critical or severe bugs and sets release goals for the many packages that comprise Debian .
It 's currently working on an edition called Squeeze .
Some see the Debian freeze as serving the needs of Ubuntu , which has a history of hitting a regular release cycle .
The increasingly popular Ubuntu is released twice a year , in April and October .
A December 2009 freeze of Ubuntu would potentially help the next April release , at least , work from a relatively stable Debian base .
The current version of Debian , Lenny , was frozen in July 2008 ahead of October 2008 's Inteprid Ibex and April 2009 's Jaunty Jackalope releases of Ubuntu .
Shuttleworth has long been a proponent of greater co-ordination between difference Linuxes to take on Windows and Microsoft .
If there 's agreement to use the same version of the Linux kernel , for example , then there could be co-ordination on fixing bugs , he 's said .
Coordination would mean users and developers outside the core projects could rely on their distros .
It could even mean greater application compatibility and portability across different distros .
Coordination is an idea that 's found currency elsewhere in open source - notably the Eclipse Foundation in tools for open - source and Java .
For the last few years , Eclipse has coordinated an ever growing number of projects to make sure they come out at the same time .
Ironically , Debian developers have also supported the idea of greater coordination between Linuxes in the past .
Shuttleworth repeated the theme in his Debian mailing list post , where he noted the freeze idea was not about Debian changing to meet the needs of Ubuntu .
" I love free software and want it to win .
If it wins properly , it will not come in a single package branded ' Debian ' or ' Ubuntu ' or ' Red Hat ' , it will come in a coordinated diversity , " Shuttleworth said .
" The debate on this list has mostly been about " Ubuntu vs Debian " , which misses the real goal : let 's send a signal to upstreams that they can participate and help shape the way end users will experience their software .
To do that , we need to get multiple distributions , " he wrote .

What Price Growth ?
The economy of this country , and probably the entire world , is built on population growth and the ever increasing demand for products and services .
Capital is invested on the supposition that such growth will continue into the future .
State governors , city mayors and chambers of commerce all clamor for “ growth ” , i.e. more businesses , more tourists , more construction , more sales and more jobs .
All well and good , but few are giving any thought to the negative aspects of growth .
When the population grows , so do the problems of waste disposal , polution of air and water , traffic congestion , destruction of forests and natural habitat , and drain on the water supply .
Is it worth it ?
Can we learn to live with zero growth ?

LUXEMBOURG ( Reuters ) - European Union member states are ready to help resettle detainees freed from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , the EU said on Monday .
In this photo , reviewed by the U.S. Military , a guard stands near the shadow of a detainee at Guantanamo 's Camp 5 detention center , at the U.S. Naval Base , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , January 21 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Brennan Linsley / Pool
A joint statement by Brussels and Washington said the EU backed the decision by the United States to close the detention center and set out a framework for cooperation under which member states would be able to receive released detainees .
It said Washington would share with EU member states information about detainees who had been cleared for release and would consider , on a case - by - case basis , contributing to the costs incurred by EU states in receiving former detainees .
“ By supporting the U.S. determination to shut down Guantanamo , the EU hopes to contribute to changing U.S. policies and to help the United States turn the page , ” the joint declaration said .
The Guantanamo Bay prison camp , opened under former U.S. President George W. Bush after the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States , drew international criticism for holding prisoners indefinitely , many without charge .
U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered the closure of the prison , which now holds 229 detainees , by the end of January .
The 27 - nation EU wants to help Obama meet his goal by taking in some detainees cleared for release , and EU officials say member states could accept about 60 former detainees .
But the issue has proved controversial because Europe ’s open borders mean a former inmate accepted by one state could travel freely through most of the region .
“ It will now be for each country in the EU to decide whether to take detainees from Guantanamo or not , knowing that we have agreed on general principles , ” Jonathan Faull , a senior European Commission official , told reporters in Brussels .
He said a member state ’s decision to resettle a detainee or detainees could not be vetoed by another EU state .
“ It is up to a member state , in its interest and the interest of other member states , to know and share information , ” he said .
“ Other member states can make representations ... but the competence to decide whether to admit people in their country is on the member state alone . ”
EU ministers agreed this month to share information with each other before accepting anyone for resettlement .
As we are in the final run-up to the 2009 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference ( WWDC ) , it is again time to take a look at what IT managers and developers can expect from next week 's event .
My colleague Dan Moren recently noted the public features in iPhone 3.0 OS , and that reminded me that there were quite a few items in the Apple special event for the iPhone 3.0 OS that were presented near the end .
Since quite a few of these are near and dear to IT 's heart , I thought this would be a good time to talk about a few of them .
It 's worth noting that each of these items was on that slide I mentioned , but I 'm not sure at this point how Apple plans to implement them , so this is where I use my imagination a bit .
LDAP
LDAP is support is important for anyone in an LDAP environment , ( Apple 's Open Directory , Microsoft 's Active Directory , OpenLDAP , Novell 's eDirectory , etc. ) , as it allows iPhone users to access contact info that is stored in the company directory , rather than relying on their own contacts .
This would allow iPhone users to not have to use third party software , ( like LDAPeople ) or have to copy a company 's global address list to their iPhone to have things like email addresses and phone numbers for coworkers on the device .
EAS Policies
EAS , or Exchange ActiveSync policy support could make using an iPhone in a corporate environment much easier .
EAS policies help system administrators better handle remote wiping of devices and adding password protection to the device .
It can also help IT manage polices like disabling the phone , disabling Wi-Fi / Bluetooth access and other functions .
If you 're someone who works in IT for a company that deals with sensitive data -- medical and financial records , for example -- you have to be able to lock down devices .
EAS policies are a great way to do this .
VPN on Demand
This can mean a lot of things , so my presmption is that Apple will introduce a method to connect your iPhone to a Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) that you would n't normally connect to .
This way you do n't have manually configure VPN settings -- that the VPN connection will happen automatically when you want to bring up a protected site or server .
If Apple has a way to do this , it 'll make a lot of IT people happy .
Create Meeting Invites
You know , some days , I wonder about Apple .
Like this one : they introduce networked calendaring via EAS in the iPhone OS 2.0 , but then they do n't give you the ability to create meetings .
That 's annoying .
So in the iPhone 3.0 OS , you can now create meetings .
I guess they had to do this , since they 're introducing CalDAV support as well .
Support for multiple networked calendaring protocols and the inability to create meetings from the iPhone would be astoundingly dumb .
So , I 'm glad to see Apple avoided that .
Finally .
The only question is , what took so long ?
Call Logs
Another thing that is pretty much a business - only need .
For anyone in a profession where phone calls are billable hours , call logs are critical to your life , and ( again , assuming that my interpretation of two words are correct ) the addition of call logging in the iPhone will make it a lot more useful to those folks who need them , especially the legal world .
OTA / Encrypted Profiles
While Apple 's iPhone Configuration Utility is a decent first start , it has issues .
For example , while I can e-mail the configuration file to a device , there is still a significant amount of work to be done on the device to enable that profile , and once installed , the profile info is not protected terribly well .
Let 's assume for the moment that this update allows a sysadmin to push profile data out over the air without any kind of e-mail intermediary , and then encrypts that data on the iPhone .
System administrators who have to provision hundreds or even thousands of devices will be able to take another look at the iPhone if this comes to pass .
Other
Quite frankly , if I 'm right about these six , I 'll be a happy scooter .
I love my iPhone , I use it constantly , but there are aspects of managing them , and using them in a corporate / business environment that make me want to throw the thing into traffic at times .
If Apple can make improvements on the back end like with iPhone Configuration Utility , then a lot of places that could n't use iPhones , or were reluctant to , will have solid reason to re-evaluate their stances .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Once he roamed the streets , moving from shelter to shelter .
Now , Oliver Gomes rubs shoulders with Washington 's elite .
Oliver Gomes says working in the halls of Congress gave him the motivation and money to get off the streets .
Squatting next to a white wall outside a Senate hearing room recently with a cell phone glued to his ear , Gomes is being paid to hold a place in line for a lobbyist at a hearing on the climate - change bill .
Gomes -- 6 feet tall , with long curly hair pulled back , wearing a polo shirt and shorts -- is one of the contracted men and women holding places in line for this hearing .
Many have been waiting since midnight to ensure their clients a seat .
By 9 a.m. , more than 100 people are lined up for the hearing .
Only 10 seats are available to the public , and the first 10 spots are held by line - standers .
The rest are shut out .
Though the practice is controversial , Gomes said it has lifted him from life on the street .
" Sitting in the halls of Congress made me feel a little better , " he said .
" It elevated me and made me feel like , well , you know , maybe I do belong here , maybe I can contribute even at that little minute level . "
Watch Gomes tell his story »
As the need for couriers on Capitol Hill declined with e-mail and fax , courier services like Quick Messenger Service of DC , Inc. have added the service of contracting men and women to hold places in line for lobbyists at hearings .
The seats are valuable to lobbyists because the hearing is often their only face time with legislators .
Do n't Miss Student hopes to go from homeless to Harvard
For big hearings with limited availability , line - standers may wait 20 to 30 hours .
They 're paid anywhere from $ 11 to $ 35 an hour .
Gomes was living in a shelter when he started line - standing .
He said working in the halls of Congress gave him the motivation and money he needed to get off the streets .
He now makes extra money by recruiting men for the line - standing services from the homeless shelters where he used to stay .
" When I was down and out and I was on the Hill and I had that little bit of hope that while I was actually here , it gave me the incentive to dress a little better , more professional , " Gomes said .
Many of the contracted line - standers are homeless or formerly homeless like Gomes .
Williams Howard Johnson Jr. , one of Gomes ' recruits , found his bright yellow button - down shirt , green patterned tie , and slacks at a donation center because he wanted to dress well for his job .
" That comes from being a part of something that 's really meaningful to not only me but to society , " Johnson said .
Johnson was among those who had been in line since midnight for the 10 a.m. climate - change bill hearing , but he said he was happy to be there .
" I'm a part of something today and I 'm very happy about that , " Johnson said .
Although Johnson and Gomes are glad to have a job and a feeling of importance on Capitol Hill , many people are opposed to the practice of hiring line - standers .
Kalen Pruss , a fellow at the Internet environmental group avaaz.org , and her group of cheering green T - shirted environmentalists were shut out of the hearing .
" It 's very unfortunate that the people who come here to line - stand always beat us here cause they can stand here all night , " Pruss said .
John Winslow , director of linestanding .com , said the committees might be creating the lines by limiting the number of seats for the public in the hearing rooms .
At this hearing , some of his clients that paid for line - standers to wait at midnight were not able to get into the hearing .
" It 's really a question of logistics , how many people does the committee want to service , " Winslow said .
" And it seems like overwhelmingly they try to limit the number of people who attend these hearings and that just drives up demand artificially . "
Critics see the practice as just another way lobbyists are buying influence on Capitol Hill .
In 2007 , Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri introduced legislation to ban the practice of line - standing .
" I have no problem with lobbyists being in hearings , but they should n't be able to buy a seat , " McCaskill said .
" It seems to me that if we are going to make sure lobbyists are n't buying meals for senators , and we are going to make sure lobbyists are n't buying elected officials gifts , then we ought to make sure they are n't buying seating at a public hearing . "
Maria Foscarinis , an advocate for the homeless , thinks it 's ironic that some of the most powerful people in the country are using some of the most vulnerable to hold a place in line for them .
" They 're likely to be standing in line for people who well may be opposed to universal health care that would be a benefit for poor and homeless people , " Foscarinis said .
" And yet they may be standing there for the purpose of access for the interests that are opposed to their own . "

The 18 - year - old who was briefly charged with murder in the death of Borisshell Washington in Southeast Portland last month has remained in custody since his arrest , despite being cleared of taking part in the shooting .
Friday , a deputy district attorney argued in Multnomah County Circuit Court that Todd Rutherford ought to stay in custody for his own protection and that of the community .
Deputy District Attorney Mike Riedel said that Rutherford is a known gang member with two weapons violations and an assault on his record .
Ralph Banks , Rutherford 's caseworker with the county Juvenile Department , testified that Rutherford was placed in danger by reports in The Oregonian and other news media saying that he had talked to police and had given them leads that helped the investigation .
No one has been arrested in the case .
Washington , 18 , a senior at Jefferson High School , was fatally shot May 31 at a Raymond Park party where she was celebrating a friend 's release from jail .
Banks said that Rutherford is now " perceived in the community as being a snitch . "
But Rutherford 's Public Defender , Al Karpinski , argued that Rutherford was in no danger and had only given police information leading to his exoneration .
" He did provide evidence to police , " Karpinski said .
" He provided evidence that he did n't do it . "
Karpinski argued that if Rutherford had provided police with leads in their investigation , he would have been held as a material witness instead of the probation violations .
Officials with the Police Bureau and the district attorney 's office declined to comment on how much Rutherford helped their case , citing their ongoing investigation .
Judge Maureen McKnight asked why the Juvenile Department had not brought up the probation violations at Rutherford 's last probation hearing , in April .
She released the teenager to the custody of a halfway house and ordered him to wear an electronic monitoring device with GPS capabilities .
The judge directed Banks to find a suitable facility and provide reports on Rutherford 's condition every 48 hours .
Karpinski said Rutherford recently graduated from the alternative Helensview School and was arrested the day before his graduation ceremony .
According to Karpinski , Rutherford was on his way to pick up his cap and gown on June 1 when police surrounded him near Northeast 22nd Avenue and took him into custody .
Police announced Rutherford 's arrest the next day and released his mug shot to the media .
He was arraigned June 3 and charged with Washington 's murder .
The murder charge was dropped the next day , but Rutherford has been held for eight more days on the probation violation charges .
Police spokeswoman Detective Mary
Wheat said police are cautious about what information they release after shootings .
" We try not to inflame the situation because we do n't want to create any more shootings , " she said .
" They 're the hardest cases we have . "
She said community involvement in solving homicide was of the utmost importance for the Police Bureau .
" We really need the community 's support in solving these cases , " she said , " but we do n't always get it . "
She recommended that if Rutherford fears for his safety , he should call police for protection .
At a community meeting in Northeast Portland Friday , Police Commissioner Dan Saltzman repeated the comments he made at Washington 's funeral on Monday .
" There 's a new imperative among all of us , and that 's to find the person who shot Borisshell , " he said
Community leaders at the meeting said they were worried about the possibility of more violence , especially with school letting out and warm weather approaching .
As Rutherford left court in a prison - issued gray sweatshirt , he had asked that his belly chain be loosened , a request that was granted .
After McKnight 's ruling , he turned to his mother , Shawnti Eaden , 39 , and mouthed , " I love you . "

Carrots boiled whole before being cut up are better at fighting cancer and are tastier than when they are sliced before being cooked , a study has shown .
It may require a bigger saucepan but cutting a carrot after boiling it could boost its health - giving properties by a quarter .
Researchers at the University of Newcastle found that " boiled - before - cut " carrots contained 25 per cent more of the anti-cancer compound falcarinol than those that were chopped up first .
And the sugars which give the carrot its distinctively sweet flavour were also found in higher concentrations in the carrot that had been cooked whole , so the vegetable tasted better as well as being healthier .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The health benefits of falcarinol were first discovered four years ago when Kirsten Brandt , who led the study , found rats fed on a diet containing carrots or isolated falcarinol were a third less likely to develop tumours than those in a control group .
" Chopping up your carrots increases the surface area so more of the nutrients leach out into the water while they are being cooked , " said Dr Brandt .
" By cooking them whole and chopping them up afterwards you are locking in both taste and nutrients .
We all want to try to improve our health and diet by getting the right nutrients and eating our five - a- day .
" The great thing about this is it 's a simple way for people to increase their uptake of a compound we know is good for you . "
The team presented their results at a conference in Lille , France , yesterday .
They also carried out a blind taste test on almost 100 people comparing the taste of " boiled - before - cut " versus " cut- before - boiled " carrots .
The response was overwhelming with more than 80 per cent saying that carrots cooked whole tasted much better .

Today the Australian magazine Cosmos , along with a vast number of other blogs and publications , reprinted an article by Simon Singh , in slightly tweaked form , in an act of solidarity .
The British Chiropractic Association has been suing Singh personally for the past 15 months , over a piece in the Guardian where he criticised the BCA for claiming that its members could treat children for colic , ear infections , asthma , prolonged crying , and sleeping and feeding conditions by manipulating their spines .
The BCA maintains that the efficacy of these treatments is well documented .
Singh said that claims were made without sufficient evidence , described the treatments as “ bogus ” , and criticised the BCA for “ happily promoting ” them .
At a preliminary hearing in May , to decide the meaning of this article , Mr Justice Eady ruled that Singh ’s wording implied the BCA was being deliberately dishonest .
Singh has repeatedly been clear that he never intended this meaning , but has been forced to defend this single utterance , out of his own pocket , at a cost that has run to six figures .
Soon we will get to the story of the backlash , but first , while you may view this as a free speech issue , there are also some specific worries raised when people sue in medicine and science .
It is possible in healthcare to do great harm , while intending to do good , and so medicine thrives on criticism : this is how ideas improve , and therefore how lives are saved .
The three most highly rated articles in the latest chart from the British Medical Journal are all highly critical of medical practice .
Academic conferences are often bloodbaths .
To stand in the way of ideas and practices being improved through critical appraisal is not just dangerous , it is disrespectful to patients , and even if someone has been technically defamatory in their wording , it is plainly undesirable for all critical discourse in healthcare to be conducted in a stifling climate of fear .
Neither the General Medical Council nor the British Medical Association have ever sued anyone for saying that their members are up to no good .
I asked them .
The idea is laughable .
But beyond whether it is right , there is the more entertaining issue of whether it was wise , and here it is hard to contain a sense of schadenfreude as the chiropractors ’ world unravels .
First , there is the media exposure .
This case and the chilling effects of libel threats in science have now been covered by the Times , the Daily Mail , the Daily Telegraph , the Independent , Nature , the Economist , Times Higher Education , the Sunday Times , Channel 4 , the Financial Times , the Wall Street Journal , Private Eye , the Observer , the BBC , and an editorial in the British Medical Journal , to name just a few .
This story has travelled around the world .
Most of these articles drew attention to the evidence for chiropractic ’s efficacy , which is often not compelling .
Some discussed chiropractic ’s dubious origins : it was invented by a magnet therapist , convicted of practising medicine without a licence , who suddenly decided in 1895 that 95 % of all diseases are caused by displaced vertebrae , and compared himself to Christ , Muhammad and Martin Luther .
Who knew ?
An international petition against the BCA has been signed by professors , journalists , celebrities and more , with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Fry alongside the previous head of the Medical Research Council and the last government chief scientific adviser .
There have been public meetings , with stickers and badges .
But it is a ragged band of science bloggers who has done the most detailed work .
Fifteen months after the case began , the BCA finally released the academic evidence it was using to support specific claims .
Within 24 hours this was taken apart meticulously by bloggers , referencing primary research papers , and looking in every corner .
Professor David Colquhoun of UCL pointed out , on infant colic , that the BCA cited weak evidence in its favour , while ignoring strong evidence contradicting its claims .
He posted the evidence and explained it .
LayScience flagged up the BCA selectively quoting a Cochrane review .
Every stone was turned by Quackometer , APGaylard , Gimpyblog , EvidenceMatters , Dr Petra Boynton , MinistryofTruth , Holfordwatch , legal blogger Jack of Kent , and many more .
At every turn they have taken the opportunity to explain a different principle of evidence based medicine – the sin of cherry - picking results , the ways a clinical trial can be unfair by design – to an engaged lay audience , with clarity as well as swagger .
Then the formal complaints began .
There have been successes with the Advertising Standards Authority , including one which concluded that claims to treat colic breached the guidelines on “ truthfulness ” and “ substantiation ” .
This interested many , since treating colic was a claim sued over by the BCA when Singh called it “ bogus ” .
Professional complaints followed in May , mostly about individual chiropractors ’ claims .
Then , in June , blogger Simon Perry found the BCA database of 1,029 members online , containing 400 website URLs .
He wrote a quick computer program to automatically identify all the chiropractors in the UK claiming to treat colic , locate their local Trading Standards office , and report them ( more than 500 in total ) automatically , followed up with printed letters .
Chiropractic is also a profession regulated by the General Chiropractic Council , supervised by the Health Professional Council , which are obliged to investigate all complaints .
So Perry reported over 500 chiropractors to them , alleging they had made claims without adequate evidence .
The GCC rejected his letter , saying it only takes individual complaints .
A pile of individual complaint letters were instantly generated and delivered to their door .
Astonishingly , ZenosBlog had done exactly the same thing .
These 1,000 complaints are now being investigated .
You may view this as bullying individuals , and initially I had some sympathies .
But my heart was hardened , reading commentary from the chiropractic and alternative therapy community , saying Singh must expect six - figure consequences for criticising them , and transgressing the letter of the law , even in just one article .
Some clue to whether chiropractors feel able to defend these complaints over the evidence for their practices came a few days later .
On 8 June the McTimoney Chiropractic Association sent a confidential email to its members , which has been obtained and is available in full on Quackometer .
“ If you have a website , ” this email begins , “ take it down NOW … REMOVE all the blue MCA patient information leaflets , or any patient information leaflets of your own that state you treat whiplash , colic or other childhood problems in your clinic … IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THIS ADVICE , YOU MAY BE AT RISK FROM PROSECUTION .
Finally , we strongly suggest you do NOT discuss this with others ” – and on this they were clear – “ especially patients . ”
The MCA says this is a “ vexatious campaign against the profession ” , that it has nothing to hide , and believes its members have not intentionally breached any rules regarding their websites ’ content .
The entire MCA website disappeared on the same day , and continues to be nothing more than a holding page ( it “ is currently being updated ” ) , but its former site , along with every single chiropractor ’s website , has been archived in full online by the science blogging community , for anyone who is interested to look .
We could go on , but there are lessons from this debacle – beyond the ethical concerns over suing in the field of science and medicine – and they are clear .
First , if you have reputation and superficial plausibility more than evidence to support your activities , then it may be wise to keep under the radar , rather than start expensive fights .
But more interestingly than that , a ragged band of bloggers from all walks of life has , to my mind , done a better job of subjecting an entire industry ’s claims to meaningful , public , scientific scrutiny than the media , the industry itself , and even its own regulator .
It ’s strange this task has fallen to them , but I ’m glad someone is doing it , and they do it very , very well indeed .
Only 20 years left ?
Sensational pictures of Australia 's Great Barrier
Reef bring home the natural treasure we look to lose
Advertisement
These sensational pictures show Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef in all its glory .
But the beautiful structures , laced in vibrant turquoise , green and deep blue hue , are a wonder that our children may never see .
The striking images are a poignant reminder of the sad legacy we are passing on to future generations , experts believe .
Feast for the eyes : Aerial views of The Great Barrier Reef in Cairns , Australia taken today
A recent report by marine scientist Charlie Veron claimed that global warming will destroy the World Heritage site within just 20 years .
The former chief scientist of the Australian Institute of Marine Science says that CO2 levels have risen so much it is now impossible to save the natural structure .
' There is no way out , no loopholes , ' he said .
' The Great Barrier Reef will be over within 20 years or so . '
Under threat : Marine scientist Charlie Veron claims the reef will be gone within 20 years
And the marine expert is not alone in his gloomy predictions - nor the most extreme .
Sir David Attenborough warned at a meeting of wildlife experts in July that all of the world ’s tropical reefs face ‘ imminent destruction ’ unless CO2 levels are slashed .
Hopes that cutting emissions will be enough to save our natural world have been dashed by marine experts .
They say we must now find ways to remove gas already in the atmosphere .
Feat of nature :
The coral reef is the largest single structure to be built by living organisms
As well as their exceptional beauty , coral reefs are one of the richest eco-systems in the sea , providing homes to over a million species .
Their abundant life is a valuable source of food for millions of people and provides thousands of jobs by supporting a huge tourism industry .
But the precious structures , built by a battery of tiny organisms called corals polyps , are especially vulnerable to man ’s impact on the environment .
Recognition ?
The coral reef system has been shortlisted for an online contest to select the seven natural wonders of the world
Slow increments in levels of CO2 are gradually making the oceans more acidic and dissolving coral in the process .
And temperature rises caused by the same emissions are bleaching the coral , as the beauty fades .
Sir David , who chaired the meeting at the Royal Society in early July , said : ' Coral reef is the canary in the cage as far as the oceans of the world are concerned .
Gloomy predictions : Sir David Attenborough said the world 's tropical reefs face ' imminent destruction ' unless CO2 levels are slashed
' They are the places where the damage is most easily and perhaps most quickly seen .
' Anybody who has had the privilege of diving along a coral reef will have seen the natural world at its most glorious and its most diverse and most beautiful .
‘ Anybody who has done that would be appalled at the thought … that the reefs should die and be covered with brown slime and turn to a gravel pit . '
Up to 20 per cent of the World ’s coral has been lost since the 1980s .
Experts believe CO2 levels have risen from 280 parts per million before the industrial revolution to 387 ppm today .
The scientists who attended the Royal Society meeting agreed that levels must be capped well below 350 ppm to ensure coral reefs survive in the long term .
The spectacular structure , which is so vast they can be seen from outer space , has been shortlisted for an online contest to select the seven natural wonders of the world .
UC Berkeley food expert Michael Pollan , who advocates smaller - scale farming , nicely summarized these industry rules as " sanitizing " agriculture in a " foolhardy " excursion down the path to " food grown indoors hydroponically . "
In the name of food safety , farmers in California are compelled to comply with " scorched - earth strategies " in the " quest for an antiseptic field of greens . "
Food safety now means remove beneficial insects from farms , destroy crops and eliminate ponds so that farms can ostensibly be as sanitary as food plants .
For example , organic buffers are not allowed .
A farmer surrounded his organic vegetable fields with a protective shield of hedges of fennel and flowering cilantro that attract beneficial insects as an alternative to using pesticides .
This is a large - scale version of companion planting I use to grow my organic garden by planting marigolds around the garden to deter certain bugs .
In the name of food safety , these hedges had to be destroyed " because his big customers demand sterile buffers around his crops .
No vegetation .
No water .
No wildlife of any kind . "
Animals are banned from the fields .
If a squirrel nibbles on some leafy greens at the edge of crop field or a deer walks through the field without even one nibble , then 30 feet of crops in the area must be destroyed .
Yet , the rules then place " poison - filled tubes " in the lettuce fields to kill rodents .
The poison kills the rodents , and also the owls and hawks that are the natural predators of the rats .
Frogs are not linked to E. coli , but mechanically harvested greens may include the remains of frogs , so the industry adds elimination of frogs to the food safety list .
Yet , a two - year study by a state wildlife agency , a university and the federal department of agriculture " found that less than one - half of 1 percent of 866 wild animals tested positive for E. coli O157:H7 in Central California . "
Ponds and trees are " poisoned and bulldozed " in the name of food safety .
" Farmers are told that ponds used to recycle irrigation water are unsafe .
So they bulldoze the ponds and pump more groundwater , opening more of the aquifer to saltwater intrusion ... . "
Vegetation buffers used to filter storm runoff and harbor pollinators are cleared .
Yet , there is science indicating that removing these vegetation buffers located near field crops can render food less safe because vegetation and wetlands serve as a filter of pathogens .
UC Davis scientists found that vegetation buffers can remove as much as 98 percent of E. coli from surface water .
UC Davis advisers warn that some rodents prefer cleared areas .
These rules are part of the " leafy greens marketing agreement " drafted by large growers to establish food safety with leafy green vegetables , such as spinach and lettuce .
The rules are based on what the large farming industry deems to be secret " super metrics " standards .
While some of the large food companies are now a de facto government food regulatory agency , their extensive guidelines for leafy green food safety is confidential , proprietary information not to be publicly disclosed .
Many of the known rules are unscientific , and conflict with environmental and organic standards .
Farmers must follow them if they expect to sell their crops .
These can include vast bare - dirt buffers , elimination of wildlife , and strict rules on water sources .
To enforce these rules , retail buyers have sent forth armies of food - safety auditors , many of them trained in indoor processing plants , to inspect fields .
These indoor food safety auditors are not familiar with outdoor farms , and this results in interesting rules :
Auditors have told Kimes that no children younger than 5 can be allowed on his farm for fear of diapers .
He has been asked to issue identification badges to all visitors .
Science does not support all the rules , which are destined to create havoc with ecosystems causing more environmental problems .
But , hey , " neutering " small , organic farms is one way to get a monopoly on factory farm food production methods that are so much safer than those organic veggies growing in the WH garden and mine .
" All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others . "
George Orwell – Animal Farm
The United States has gradually degenerated from a Republic based on individual liberties to a socialized oligarchy run by an exclusive few .
The country was founded upon the platform of individual rights .
We declared our independence from Great Britain because of excessive regulation and taxation .
Americans fought for the right to live their lives free from the subjugation of an overbearing governmental body .
The Founding Fathers declared our independence with these immortal words :
We hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Since the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , the United States has gone from taking personal responsibility for our own lives to dependence on government to make all decisions in our lives .
There are 306 million Americans and we have defaulted on our responsibility for governing this nation to 535 corrupt politicians , 10 " too big to fail " banks , a secretive Central Bank , 17,000 corporate lobbyists , and thousands of government bureaucrats .
Essentially 306 million citizens are managed by a few thousand elitist rulers .
George Orwell 's classic novel Animal Farm was inspired by the a scene he witnessed :
" I saw a little boy , perhaps ten years old , driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path , whipping it whenever it tried to turn .
It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them , and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat . "
Orwell wrote the novel during World War II and published it in 1945 .
It was a contemptuous indictment of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union .
He recognized that propaganda and abuse of language could smoothly control the opinions of enlightened intellectuals in democratic countries .
He saw through the prism of Soviet propaganda to the true evil of Stalin and his KGB Dogs .
Intellectuals in Great Britain's Ministry of Information attempted to censor his right to publish the book because it would offend their supposed ally Joseph Stalin .
He knew the truth , while intellectuals were horribly wrong .
Stalin murdered 700,000 Russian citizens during the Great Purge of the 1930s .
The plot of Orwell 's Animal Farm is quite simple .
It follows the Russian Revolution from 1917 through 1944 .
Three pigs – Snowball ( Leon Trotsky ) , Napoleon ( Joseph Stalin ) , and Squealer ( Vyacheslav Molotov ) formulate Old Major 's ( Vladimir Lenon ) – principles into a philosophy called Animalism .
The animals defeat the farmer Mr. Jones ( Czar Nicholas II ) in a battle , running him off the land .
They rename the property Animal Farm ( Soviet Union ) .
The cart - horse Boxer ( Russian working class ) devotes himself to the cause with particular passion , committing his great strength to the prosperity of the farm and adopting as a personal axiom the affirmation " I will work harder . "
Napoleon ( Stalin ) and Snowball ( Trotsky ) increasingly argue over the future of the farm , and they begin to struggle with each other for power and influence among the other animals .
After a speech , nine attack dogs ( KGB ) burst into the barn and chase Snowball ( Trotsky ) from the farm .
Napoleon ( Stalin ) assumes leadership of Animal Farm ( Soviet Union ) and declares that there will be no more meetings .
From that point on , he stresses , the pigs alone will make all of the decisions for the good of every animal ( Workers ) .
Napoleon ( Stalin ) begins expanding his powers , rewriting history to make Snowball ( Trotsky ) a villain .
Napoleon ( Stalin ) also begins to act more and more like a human being – sleeping in a bed , drinking whisky , and engaging in trade with neighboring farmers .
The original Animalist principles strictly forbade such activities , but Squealer ( Molotov ) , Napoleon 's propagandist , justifies every action to the other animals , convincing them that Napoleon ( Stalin ) is a great leader and is making things better for everyone despite the fact that the common animals are cold , hungry , and overworked .
Looking in at the party of Pigs and Farmers through the farmhouse window , the common animals can no longer tell which are the Pigs and which are the human beings .
The perversion of founding principles is not limited to communist countries .
On the farm there were the Seven Original Commandments :
Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy .
Whatever goes upon four legs , or has wings , is a friend .
No animal shall wear clothes .
No animal shall sleep in a bed .
No animal shall drink alcohol .
No animal shall kill any other animal .
All animals are created equal .
All of the Seven Commandments are eventually broken by the pigs for their own gain .
Squealer ( Molotov ) constantly changes the Commandments to the pigs ' benefit , taking advantage of the other animals .
Through the manipulation of language , the Pigs accumulate more power and privileges :
No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets
No animal shall drink alcohol to excess
No animal shall kill any other animal without cause .
Ultimately , all the commandments are boiled down to one commandment :
All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others .
Could this degeneration of founding principles happen in the United States ?
The distressing answer is that it already has .
It has accelerated at a breakneck pace since 2000 .
Orwell 's themes are as true today as they were in 1944 .
Corruption
" All political thinking for years past has been vitiated in the same way .
People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes , and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome .
Political language … is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable , and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind . "
George Orwell
Our elected officials are supposed to represent the wishes of the citizens that elected them .
They derive their just powers from the governed .
In the early days of our Republic , citizens could freely enter the White House without hesitation .
Federalist Papers 55 and 56 explicitly promised , without qualification , that there would be one Representative for every thirty - thousand inhabitants .
The framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights intended that the total population of Congressional districts never exceed 50,000 to 60,000 .
Currently , the average population size of the districts is nearly 700,000 and , consequently , the principle of proportionally equitable representation has been abandoned .
Our elected officials no longer represent the people .
They represent the 17,000 corporate lobbyists who spend $ 3.3 billion per year to " persuade " them what is best for their special interests .
This is why a Congressperson can receive 9 to 1 calls from their constituents against a $ 700 billion banker bailout bill and still vote for the bill .
The ideals of our fledgling Republic have been corrupted by politicians who have sold their souls to corporate and banking interests .
The corruption became more insidious with the creation of the Federal Reserve and the institution of the Federal income tax in 1913 .
The levers of money printing and raising taxes gave the select few ( Pigs ) the wherewithal to control and manipulate the working class population .
Debt and taxes are the friends of a corrupt politician .
The Cabal of bankers who control the Federal Reserve has been printing money for 96 years to such an extent that the U.S. dollar has lost 96 % of its purchasing power versus gold .
But , with Orwellian irony our government leaders proclaim a " strong dollar policy " .
This is a lie .
The only way out of the current colossal debt dilemma is by allowing our currency to depreciate even more so that the debt becomes less burdensome in dollar terms .
The National Debt is now $ 11.6 trillion .
The National Debt in 1913 was $ 2.9 billion .
Therefore , the National Debt has gone up by 400,000 % in 96 years .
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PERCENT !
I had to go back and check my calculation three times .
The people we elected to Congress have spent $ 11.6 trillion more than the government has generated in revenues , with $ 10 trillion of it accumulated since 1981 .
Despite this " investment " spending by our elected officials , the country 's infrastructure is crumbling , we import 66 % of our energy supplies versus 28 % in 1982 , our public education system is on par with a Third World country , our healthcare system is bloated , expensive and corrupt , and we have racked up another $ 56 trillion of future liabilities for unfulfillable promises made by our myopic leaders .
The Bills passed by Congress ( written by lobbyists ) exceed 1,000 pages , with payoffs and pork to constituents , corporate contributors and other influential allies .
These Bills are not even read by our leaders before being passed .
Hundreds of pages of amendments are added at 3:00 am .
As the ruling pigs in Animal Farm are slowly corrupted , they take the spoils while the working class proletariat toil for nothing .
Congress and the bankers are the ruling Pigs , we are the overworked common animals .
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive .
Do as I say not as I do because
The shit so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet 's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I 'll hit you again
I 'm a smart ass but I 'm playing dumb
Standards set and broken all the time
Control the chaos behind a gun
Call it as I see it even if
I was born deaf , blind and dumb
Losers winning big on the lottery
Rehab rejects still sniffing glue
Constant refutation with myself
I 'm a victim of a catch 22
Green Day – Walking Contradiction
Class Oppression
If you want a vision of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever .
George Orwell
The American Revolution was fought for the ideals that " All men are created equal " and we had the right to " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness " .
The Russian Revolution of 1917 was based upon Karl Marx ' idealistic Communist Manifesto which pitted the oppressors against the oppressed .
Communism was supposed to be a system in which goods were owned in common and available to all as needed .
The ten conditions for a transition to Communism are :
Abolition of property in land application of all rents of land to public purposes .
A heavy progressive or graduated income tax .
Abolition of all right of inheritance .
Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels .
Centralization of credit in the hands of the State , by means of a National Bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly .
Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State .
Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State ; the bringing into cultivation of waste - lands , and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan .
Equal liability of all to labor .
Establishment of industrial armies , especially for agriculture .
Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries ; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country , by a more equal distribution of the population over the country .
Free education for all children in public schools .
Abolition of children 's factory labor in its present form .
Combination of education with industrial production .
George Orwell 's 1984 and Animal Farm were biting condemnations of the Soviet Union , its perversion of the revolution 's ideals and class tyranny that ultimately widened in its society .
The American Republic was constructed upon the individual and their freedom and liberty .
After reading the above list of conditions , the United States is at least 50 % of the way to a perverted form of communism as our leaders have instituted a progressive income tax , restricted the right of inheritance through taxes , centralized credit in the hands of the State , allowed corporate farms to dominate agriculture along with providing tax breaks and protective tariffs , gotten into bed with the Military Industrial Complex , banking industry , and auto industry , provide free public education to the working classes while they send their privileged children to private schools .
By satiating the poor working classes with bread and circuses like welfare programs , easy credit , no income taxes , cable TV , fast food , cheap liquor , and drugs , the ruling classes are able to reap obscene riches through the systematic raping of the American public through the use of inflation and taxes on the middle class .
" There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent person could believe in them . "
George Orwell
The success of any system of government is ultimately dependent upon the integrity , honesty and honor of its leaders .
If they become corrupted by power and money , the system will ultimately collapse .
It may be a natural progression in all societies that intellectuals with superior intelligence will take advantage of those who perform physical labor .
The intelligentsia in Animal Farm is the Pigs , who learn to walk on two legs , wear clothes , sleep in beds , drink alcohol and consider animals that walk on four legs as their inferiors .
They perverted the founding principles of the revolution .
The intelligentsia of the United States has perverted the founding principles that all men are created equal and we are each entitled to our individual liberty .
The ruling elite constitute the 1 % richest Americans and the politicians they have bought .
The top 1 % own 35 % of all the net worth in the country .
They own as much as the bottom 90 % of Americans .
They " earn " 22 % of the income and pay 40 % of the taxes in the U.S.
I would contend that the majority of the intelligentsia has utilized their private education , Washington and Wall Street connections and ability to manipulate the financial and political system to further enrich themselves at the expense of the average American .
Gullible Working Class
" It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it ; consequently , the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy , and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning . "
George Orwell
The definition of democracy is : government by the people .
Today , the United States is democratic in name only .
The political class , which supposedly represents the citizens , has perverted the original concept of a representative democracy .
Our representatives were supposed to personally sacrifice by taking time off from their everyday professions to do what was best for the country .
After performing this noble duty they would go back to their original vocations .
Instead 40 % of Congress is lawyers , their goal is to make a career in Washington DC and after leaving Congress they seek riches as lobbyists .
Once elected , they utilize the power and money gained from the position to maintain that position permanently .
This is why incumbents win elections 95 % of the time .
In 2004 , incumbents spent $ 700 million to get re-elected , while challengers spent $ 200 million .
These obscene sums of money have perverted the original intention of the Founders .

The combination of a permanent political class with an undereducated , uninterested , gullible , naive electorate has permitted the few to wield immense power over the majority .
In Animal Farm , the working class is represented by Boxer the workhorse .
He is a hard working non-thinking animal that repeats over and over that " Napoleon ( Stalin ) is always right " .
He is representative of those who believe everything that Barack Obama says is gospel .
Ultimately , Boxer is sacrificed so that the Pigs can live more luxuriously .
A highly educated involved electorate would be dangerous to those in power .
An atrocious public education system is actually beneficial to the Pigs .
There are 34 million Americans without a high school degree , constituting 15 % of those over 18 years old .
Another 112 million have graduated high school without progressing any further with their education .
Many of these people are functionally illiterate , can't add , can't spell , do n't know when World War II happened , or who is the Vice President .
Only 69 % of entering 9th graders in the public school system graduate high school .
The graduation rates and educational achievements of minorities are dramatically worse than these numbers .
Only 26 % of the population has a bachelor 's degree , with only 6 % possessing a master 's degree .
The proliferation of drugs among the poor keeps them dazed and sedated .
Various welfare programs and easy credit keep them from rioting as they can " purchase " luxury cars and electronic gadgets enjoyed by the upper classes .
The bad debts are picked up by the taxpayers .
As a further control , those in power have put 2.3 million people in prisons , most of whom are poor and 60 % who are minorities .
By distracting the majority of people in the country with cable TV entertainment , the internet , Twitter , cell phones , sports , movies , and shopping malls , the Pigs who run the show are able to oppress and control the masses .
The highly educated use the idiocy and naivete of the oppressed to their advantage by using the rigged financial system to generate ever more riches for themselves .
The banker gods peddled fraudulent mortgage schemes throughout the world in order to enrich themselves .
When it blew up in their faces , they turned to their government co-conspirators ( Hank Paulson , Ben Bernanke , and most of Congress ) to keep their riches .
Their Congressional benefactors have obliged by stealing trillions from the taxpaying classes and redistributed it to the Pigs running Goldman Sachs , Citicorp , and Bank of America .
Abuse of Language
George Orwell 's most pointed criticism of political leaders was their misuse of language to further their wicked agendas .
He exposes the outrageous abuse of words in 1984 and Animal Farm .
The ruling elite manipulate the language as an instrument of control over the masses .
" The great enemy of clear language is insincerity .
When there is a gap between one 's real and one 's declared aims , one turns , as it were , instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms , like a cuttlefish squirting out ink . "
George Orwell
The intelligentsia understands that the masses can be manipulated with convincing talking points and misleading slogans .
Politicians never tell their constituents they are doing some pork barrel spending .
Every dollar of new spending is spun as " investment spending " .
We have evidently made $ 11.6 trillion of " investments " in our National Debt .
Somehow we enacted " campaign finance reform " and still manage to spend $ 1.3 billion on political campaigns .
Our beloved numbskull Vice President Joe Biden said last week , " We have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt " .
President Bush said , " I 've abandoned free - market principles to save the free market system " .
President Obama insisted that the only way to save our country from catastrophe caused by excessive debt was to borrow $ 700 billion and spend it on infrastructure projects , of which only 3.5 % was allocated to our crumbling infrastructure .
During the Vietnam War a U.S. Major declared , " It became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it . "
In 1947 the government changed the name of the Department of War to the Department of Defense , as we today have garrisons of 100,000 troops in 117 foreign countries .
The Department of Homeland Security , Patriot Act , and War on Terror are all deceptive titles and slogans purposely meant to hoodwink Boobus Americanus .
" In our age there is no such thing as ' keeping out of politics . '
All issues are political issues , and politics itself is a mass of lies , evasions , folly , hatred and schizophrenia .
The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world .
Lies will pass into history . "
George Orwell
President Obama and his cronies hammer away that 47 million Americans are uninsured .
It is a lie , but that does not deter them from continuing to make the claim .
The latest Census report says that within the borders of the United States as of 2007 there were 45.65 million people without health insurance .
But this number included 9.73 million foreigners , leaving only 35.92 Americans who were uninsured .
Among the uninsured in the United States there were also 9.1 million people making more than $ 75,000 per year who did not choose to purchase health insurance .
Therefore , we are imposing a trillion dollar solution for 28 million people who are poor and uninsured .
That is $ 36,000 per person while imposing a huge invasive bureaucracy on the lives of the other 278 million Americans .
The masses believe the lies .
Green Extremists have convinced children and dullards that global warming is destroying the planet .
They state their position as fact , when their thesis does not meet the scientific method criteria as fact .
Their contentions are based on computer models .
Our financial system was also based on financial models that said that worthless mortgages were really gold .
We know how that worked out .
The facts are that the earth has warmed prior to the industrial revolution and has cooled .
The sun , water vapor , earth 's orbit , volcanoes , interstellar clouds , cosmic rays , tectonic plates , land use , CO2 , sunspots , gravitational pulls , ocean currents and solar flares all impact earth .
It is far too complex to declare that we know what is happening .
Let 's get tomorrow 's weather forecast right first .
Men plan and God laughs .
The Orwellian language of Big Government turns people into pliable subjects .
It lulls us into passively accepting ever - increasing taxes while encouraging our reliance on an embedded and mutating bureaucracy administered by corrupt career politicians and backed by corporate sugar daddies .
Wall Street shysters have mastered the art or twisting and distorting reality to benefit themselves .
Subprime loans , which triggered the worldwide financial crisis , were called " nonprime " .
The billions of worthless toxic loans that still sit on the books of our biggest banks at original cost are now referred to as " legacy loans " .
How quaint .
The lowest rated bonds of the worst companies are referred to as " high yield debt " , not junk bonds .
We describe our economy as " free market " .
There is nothing further from the truth .
Bailouts for corporate failures and rewarding the excess risk takers are not hallmarks of free market capitalism .
Government takeovers of banks , insurance companies , and auto companies are not free market capitalism .
It is a warped form of corporate fascism – the intermingling of the State and corporations for the benefit of a few .
Kevin Depew from Minyanville.com described the Orwellian lies of Hank Paulson as he sat before Congress explaining his criminal actions last Fall :
" Paulson asserted throughout his testimony that he , almost single - handedly , averted an " economic collapse " and , moreover , that we should actually be thanking him for it .
The ugly assemblage of half - truths , obfuscations , smarmy evasiveness and prickly showboating would have embarrassed Bernie Madoff .
But it was n't Bernie Madoff .
It was a former United States Treasury Secretary . "
Myopia
" Enlightened people seldom or never possess a sense of responsibility . "
George Orwell
Animal Farm represents any human society whether it be capitalist , socialist , fascist , or communist .
Leaders are capable of being corrupted by power within any form of government .
The myopic thinking of the Pigs in Animal Farm will eventually destroy the farm .
Orwell ends the novel with the animals watching the Pigs mingling with farmers through a window .
They could n't tell the difference between the supposed revolutionaries and those they had fought against .
If he had looked into the future he would have seen that the Soviet Union would decay from the inside as the corrupt few eventually came to believe their own lies and propaganda .
It collapsed 44 years later as a corrupt , bankrupt , shell of a country .
The combination of myopia , greed , wickedness , ignorance and indifference are a brew that are leading the United States down the same path .
As the Pigs in our society have enriched themselves , the average American has seen their real standard of living stagnate over the last 40 years .
The Pigs have manipulated government inflation statistics so the masses think they are getting ahead .
The myopia of our politicians has put the country into a predicament that we can't escape without tremendous pain and suffering .
In order to keep their positions of power they have passed bills for decades that promise trillions more in goodies than we can possibly pay for .
They have paid no thought to the long - term consequences of their actions because they do n't care .
Future generations are of no concern to gluttonous power hungry Pigs .
During the eight years of the Bush presidency the ruling class used fear tactics and propaganda to ram through laws which allow Government to monitor the movements and communications of every American .
Liberties have been stripped and freedoms have been restricted .
Now President Obama is attempting to take control over the few aspects of our lives that remain relatively free .
The Orwellian phrase " Cap & Trade " sounds much more innocuous than an energy tax of $ 1,500 on every household in America that will drive manufacturers out of the country , along with millions of jobs .
" America 's Affordable Health Choices Act " is the Orwellian name for a bill that will create a massive new bureaucracy , cost at least $ 1 trillion , cost small businesses billions more in health costs , give government the final decision on whether you are worth saving , and provide more freebies to poor Americans .
This will keep the poor sedated and less likely to cause trouble for the ruling class .

" During times of universal deceit , telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act . "
George Orwell
As we look through the window at the raucous party between the Pigs and the farmers it is impossible to distinguish between the imperial monarchists who taxed the colonies to such an extreme that it caused a revolution and the revolutionaries that have adopted the same characteristics and traits of those they revolted against .
The American people are like sheep being led to slaughter .
Our Founding Fathers declared that the common people were in control .
Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government .
The time has come to abolish the corrupt system and institute a new Government .
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away ;
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air .
You better watch out ,
There may be dogs about
I 've looked over Jordan , and I have seen
Things are not what they seem .
What do you get for pretending the dangers not real .
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel .
What a surprise !
A look of terminal shock in your eyes .
Now things are really what they seem .
No , this is no bad dream .
Have you heard the news ?
The dogs are dead !
You better stay home
And do as you 're told .
Get out of the road if you want to grow old .

Poll : Either GOP challenger could topple Harry Reid
WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid famously ignores polls , but he might be paying attention to this one .
Results released today show not only does Reid remain unpopular in Nevada , he would be clobbered in next fall ’s election by either of two potential Republican challengers .
The poll has been bouncing around Washington today – other takes on the poll are available from Politico and CQ Politics .
The poll shows Reid being beat by 11 percentage points ( 38 percent to 49 percent , with 13 undecided ) by Republican Danny Tarkanian , a real estate professional who has run twice unsuccessfully for public office .
His father was the legendary basketball coach at UNLV .
If the matchup were today , Reid also would fall to Sue Lowden ( 40 percent to 45 percent , with 15 undecided ) , the chair of the state ’s struggling Republican Party who has not yet entered the race .
The former state legislator and television news journalist is expected to announce in the next few weeks if she will run .
The poll conducted by Mason - Dixon Polling & Research for the Las Vegas Review - Journal , surveyed 400 Nevadans and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent .
Some pundits like to say the only poll that matters is the one on Election Day , and Reid has rarely had great numbers in the politically split state going into campaign season .
Even though Barack Obama won the state last fall , the president ’s popularity nationally has been dipping and next fall ’s congressional races will surely be influenced by the success or failure the Obama agenda .
The numbers in Nevada show the work ahead for the senator , who has long said he has a target on his back as Republicans prioritized their efforts to oust the Democratic leader .
Reid promises to raise $ 25 million for the campaign , and his team plans to tell Nevadans the story of the Senator from Searchlight .
They have also promised an “ aggressive ” campaign , which is a polite way of saying research is likely underway on possible opponents .
Perhaps more interesting to Nevada voters was respondents ’ choice for the Republican ticket .
Tarkanian easily bested Lowden in a Republican matchup , 33 percent to 14 percent , with 47 percent undecided , according to additional polling of Republicans that had a slightly larger margin of error .
Tarkanian has rarely been mentioned by party officials nationally or operatives in Nevada among their top choices to go after Reid .
The National Republican Senatorial Committee strongly courted Republican Rep. Dean Heller to run .
But Heller declined .
The poll shows he would have beat Reid by 10 points ( 50 percent to 40 percent ) .
Former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle , a conservative who narrowly lost a primary to Heller in 2006 , took 5 percent .
Reid ’s approval rating remains upside down at home ( 37 percent of Nevadans polled viewing him favorably , 50 percent unfavorable ) , though not much has changed in there over the past year .
Not surprisingly , CNBC has spent the day salivating over Obama 's supposed plan to raise taxes on the middle class .
What did catch our attention , however , was a terrifying statistic about the country 's dramatic wealth erosion cited by Melissa Francis about four minutes into the above quote :
If you took all the money from all the billionaires in the US , and there are 1,000 of them or something , if you took all their money away if would n't be enough to pay off the debt for just next year .
Taxing just the rich is n't gonna work .
But wait !
Is it naive of us to wonder when exactly " billionaire " became the only tax bracket incapable of credibly claiming to represent the middle class ?
There are lots of other rich people we could tax .
For instance , say , our nation 's 14,000 or so centimillionaires ?
Or is a net worth between $ 100 and $ 999 million basically the same as " middle - class " to Melissa Francis ?
Also , Melissa Francis is just wrong .
After last year 's market calamity America actually does n't have anywhere near 1,000 billionaires .
Nonetheless , the remaining 359 of them control such a staggeringly outsized percentage of America 's wealth that they could very easily pay off the projected $ 1.8 trillion 2009 budget deficit -- and still be very wealthy !
The $ 2.07 trillion our billionaires collectively control would not , unfortunately , front the entire $ 3.1 trillion budget -- which probably explains why the government is going after their Swiss bank accounts , too .
Unfortunately , we could only do this trick once .
The very next year we'd be faced with another staggering budget deficit and we'd have no billionaires left .
Now we realize Melissa Francis was speaking off the cuff , and it is hard to get these things right on live television .
So her error is forgiveable .
But we thinks someone needs to fact check those fast talkers on CNBC .

It ’s Friday morning , finally finished with a week while living for the weekend , so I ’m feeling loose .
My modest proposal for the day : Tear down our capitalist system and replace it with a free market .
The two terms are usually used synonymously – and I ’m sure I am guilty of this myself .
But after a long night of fevered dreams about politics and policy ( yes , I really do dream about such things )
I woke up realizing there is an important difference between the two ideas .
( Perhaps as my unconscious mind dredged up some forgotten piece of writing from years ago . )
The free market is a commonsensical idea – as it is based on the values of competition , individual opportunity , and liberty .
Adam Smith ( from what I know of him ) was only a proponent of this system – which he called “ the system of natural liberty ” – rather than a proponent of “ capitalism ” – a term he never actually used .
Smith – arguing for this system – argued against government being used to prop up industries or to direct them .
What he did not argue for though was “ capitalism ” as it has been understood for the past century .
In many ways , the idea of capitalism evolved to defend our system from Marxist ideas – so it evolved to preserve the status quo rather than to describe an ideal system .
In this way , America ’s economic system is different from its political system .
The political system was created by men who held certain agreed - upon ideals and who attempted to write a governing document incorporating and protecting these ideals .
This allowed later generations to try to better follow these ideas – to constantly seek “ a more perfect union . ”
Rather than merely defending the status quo , it created an ideal to strive for .
Our economic system though was created in an ad - hoc manner – and the ideology which grew up to defend it lacked any clear ideals .
So , this ideology was defined then by what it opposed rather than a positive protection of certain principles .
Capitalism then means less government interference , less centralized control of the means of production , less regulation .
What this capitalism has created though is a rather unfree market – in which a small number of individuals own most of the capital – in which competition is thwarted by monopolistic practices , by bigger and bigger mega- corporations , by regulations proposed by the mega - corporations to keep out competitors , by bailouts .
Our capitalist system is based on valuing capital over labor , of seperating mangament and labor from ownership , of limiting the liability of individuals for their actions in corporate environments , of externalizing as much cost as possible to the public commons , of profit over all things .
It is hard to see what most of these principles contribute to the creation of a free market .
Indeed , many of them undermine it – creating a closed market , profitable only for a princely few who have the capital .
This new feudalism is called freedom – but it is only free to an elite class of “ ultracitizens ” while the overwhelming majority of people get by in a “ Sharecropper ’s society ” ( to use terms introduced by David Rothkopf and Warren Buffett respectively . )
What we need is a founding economic document – that will describe the free market as it should be .
A free market based on competition instead of capital ; in which the government ’s role is clear , predetermined , and predictable – rather than arbitrary and constantly contested ; where regulation is seen as a protector of the free market rather than an encroachment upon it – as it forces externalized costs which are imposed on the society at large to be taken into account by the market ; where the government ’s role is in protecting and enhancing the opportunity of its citizens – rather than protecting the status quo and mega-corporations .
The fact is – capitalism as it is currently practiced has undermined the free market at every turn .
While our current capitalist system has proved more productive than many other systems in the past , it has clearly fallen short of those implicit promises of what a free market should be .
This economic crisis we are still going through – even as the financial crisis has passed – will offer up an opportunity to redefine the social bargain underlying our economic system if we are bold .
So , we must be bold then – as soon as we figure out how to approach this .

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is asking for feedback via Twitter on various bills including including AB 2567 , which would designate May 22 Harvey Milk Day .
The bill encourages schools and other educational institutions to recognize Harvey Milk on that date through appropriate commemorative exercises .
The bill however does not pressure educators to indoctrinate children into the “ homosexual lifestyle , ” nor does it teach cross - dressing or same - sex attraction , despite what others would have you believe .
Last year Gov. Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar measure , saying that Milk ’s commemoration should be restricted to San Francisco only and not state wide .
Recently however President Barack Obama awarded Harvey Milk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom , a national honor , which certainly ups the stakes .
If you would like to encourage Gov. Schwarzenegger to pass the AB 2567 , feel free to send the tweet below , courtesy of Change.org :
@ Schwarzenegger : Sign the Harvey Milk Day bill !
He gave his life , the least you can do is give him a day .

When FUNimation ran their “ Sneak Preview ” panel at AnimeNEXT weeks ago , their centerpiece was a new title from studio Gonzo called Romeo x Juliet ( pronounced “ Romeo and Juliet ” ) .
In this Youtube clip , FUNi rep Adam Sheehan describes the unique dub that they did for this series :
An English dub consisting of actual lines of Shakespeare and next episode previews written in iambic pentameter ?
That sounded interesting .
And so he showed off two clips from the show , and sure enough , the dub did appear quite impressive .
Many people in the audience left the panel eager to see more of this show and its unique dub .
So now that I ’ve had a chance to watch the series , does it live up to the hype surrounding it ?
Well , yes , but not in the ways that I thought it would .
Romeo x Juliet takes the old Shakespearean classic about the star - crossed lovers and sets it into a world more appropriate to anime .
The entire house of Capulet has been slain by Lord Montague , and the sole survivor is young Juliet .
The poor girl is kept hidden away disguised as an orphaned boy her whole life .
When she grows older , she spends her days as a masked crime fighter protecting the streets of Neo Verona , when she finally meets the dashing Romeo and his flying horse .
Yes , Romeo has a flying horse , just like in the original play by Shakespeare . 😉
As expected , the two leads fall madly and deeply in love with each other .
But on Juliet ’s 16th birthday , she learns about how her family fell at the hands of the Montagues , and how it is now her destiny to seek vengeance for the sake of her name .
Will their love prevail in this fantasy remake or will they meet the same tragic end that we ’ve come to expect from this centuries - old tale ?
First and foremost , I must talk about the unique dub that FUNimation created and has hyped up about so much .
The clips that were shown at that AnimeNEXT panel were taken from the second episode of the series , and indeed , the dub in that episode is absolutely fantastic .
Almost every line from start to finish in this episode is so brilliantly thought out to recreate the feeling of watching a Shakespearean - inspired story .
Even little subtleties like having Juliet yell , “ Never you mind ! ” when she ’s mad rather than simply saying , “ nevermind ! ” brings this ambitious idea to full realization .
From the perspective of an English - speaking anime viewer , I think this is the first time I have ever felt the dialogue actually matter while watching an anime show .
The art of language just does n’t translate from Japanese to English , so FUNimation took it upon themselves to adapt life and creativity back into this script .
But unfortunately , and I really mean unfortunately , this adaptation turns out to be a major disappointment in the long run .
For some reason , only the second and ninth episodes are written in this way .
The Shakespearean language quickly goes away after the episode is over , and only comes back for the poetic “ next episode ” previews and sporadic moments through out the rest of this 12 - episode volume .
They ’ll surprise you with the occasional rhyming couplet thrown in here and there , but besides that , all you really have is just a same - old same - old dub translation that you ’d find in any other series .
Where did it go ?
Why did n’t they stick with it ?
I could understand that adapting a show like this in this way was probably not an easy task to accomplish .
The Japanese script was in no way intended to fit into Shakespearean language , and there are many places where the lip flaps would not allow the right amount of syllables to be spoken in this way .
But they made it look so easy within those two episodes !
I really do n’t see why they did n’t continue with it beyond that .
If they had challenge themselves to stick with the Shakespearean adaptation through out the entire dub , we could potentially have seen the best English adaptation I have ever encounter .
FUNimation teases us with how awesome this could have been in those two selected episodes , but sadly , they do not follow through on that promise .
But while FUNimation disappoints in adaption , the Japanese more than make up for it in the source material .
As ridiculous at it may sound to have Juliet as a caped crusader or Romeo to have a flying horse in an adaptation of the classic play , I ’ve really got to give the folks at Gonzo credit where credit is due –
They wrote one fantastic story !
From the very first moment of the first episode to the point that the series leaves off in the twelfth , I was hooked every minute of every episode .
The settings and scenarios in this fantasy world lead to very entertaining action sequences .
All the supporting cast members are notable and lovable , and they provide great drama and interest amongst themselves .
And the pacing is the best I have ever seen in a serialized series .
Every time the credits began to roll at the end of each episode , I found myself amazed that the full half hour had pass by so quickly like that .
There ’s never a single boring moment within this two - DVD box set .
But I think the reason why this story is so good is the relationship between the ill - fated lovers .
Gonzo kept the best aspects of the original story , and that is the tragic beauty of the two falling for each other despite being destine to be enemies .
But on top of that premise , they made the two characters absolutely believable .
Through the emotions they display on their animated faces and the actions they take within the story , you believe that these cartoon characters are actually in love with each other .
This is amazing storytelling , and I do n’t think I could ever praise it enough in this review .
You must watch this series and experience it for yourself .
* * *
The Good : Fantastic story filled with enough drama and action to keep you sucked in each and every episode .
The Bad : FUNimation could have potentially done great things with the English adaptation , but holds back for most of the series .
Final Verdict :
There is no doubt that Gonzo has created a fantastic take off of the Shakespearean classic with Romeo x Juliet .
This is one of the best releases so far this year , and truly a “ must watch ” series for any anime fan out there .
There 's not been a greater escape since Steve McQueen jumped aboard his motorcycle .
The state of California has been ordered to release more than 55,000 prison inmates to ease pressure on its ailing penal system .
Federal judges ruled last week that California 's 33 adult jails have become so overcrowded that they violate the constitutional rights of inmates , subjecting them to " cruel and unusual " punishment that is causing at least one death a month .
Just over a third of the state 's 158,000 prisoners must be set free by 2012 to ensure that basic healthcare is provided to those who remain behind , the judges said .
The majority will go through early release and parole schemes .
Critics claim the ruling amounts to throwing open the doors of the biggest prison system in America , and will endanger the public .
California 's Attorney General , Jerry Brown , announced an immediate appeal to the Supreme Court , saying : " This order is a blunt instrument that does not recognise the imperatives of public safety , nor the challenges of incarcerating criminals , many of whom are deeply disturbed . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Jerry Powers , who heads the state 's chief probation officers ' association , called it " a game of Russian roulette " .
But regardless of their concerns , something needs to be done : California 's prison population has increased by nearly 80 per cent since 1990 , and its penitentiaries are operating at nearly double their intended capacity of 84,000 .
A rise in the number of elderly prisoners is also affecting resources ; 11 per cent of inmates are aged 50 or over and the average cost of housing a single prisoner is now $ 46,000 ( £ 32,000 ) a year .
Building more prisons is not an option , since state finances are in such disarray that public workers are forced to take two unpaid days ' leave each month .
The state government is running an annual deficit of $ 12bn .
The prison crisis is not limited to California .
In Des Moines , Iowa , county officials plan to start charging prisoners for toilet paper .
Michigan , where Detroit has America 's highest murder rate , will release 4,000 prisoners who have served their minimum sentences .
New Jersey , Carolina and Vermont are putting drug - addicted offenders into treatment rather than prison .
Louisiana , which has one of the highest incarceration rates in the developed world , is hoping to reform a system that spends more on prisons than on higher education .
These measures are controversial in a nation that views prison as a place for retribution rather than rehabilitation .
Many states have a " three strikes " rule that means relatively petty criminals are given life sentences .
The next , and potentially final , upgrade to Apple 's Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard operating system will address loose ends in the software 's underlying service technologies with a particular focus on networking and syncing .
Just two betas of the Mac OS X 10.5.8 Update have made their way into developers ' hands thus far , the first of which was labeled build 9L12 and arrived for an extremely limited group of testers early last week .
That distribution was quickly followed by the release of build 9L14 to all registered Mac OS X developers this past weekend .
Unlike Mac OS X 10.5.7 , which addressed roughly two dozen system components and applications , Mac OS X 10.5.8 's focus appears more narrow from the onset .
People familiar with the update say Apple has asked developers to concentrate their evaluation efforts on just a dozen key technologies , only two of which represent forward - facing applications : Automator and iCal .
The remainder of the update addresses underlying service technologies that include 802.1 x wireless protocols , Apple Filing Protocol , AirPort , Bluetooth , graphics drivers , iDisk syncing , networking , Spotlight indexing , Sync Services , and USB .
Similarly , many of the roughly two - dozen code corrections already baked into the first two pre-release builds also target underlying networking and syncing technologies .
For example , Apple has reportedly made note of fixes to AFP and TimeMachine syncing , iCal time and calendar syncing , execution of startup items on Network home folders , and problems with DHCP client and 802.1 x integration .
Upcoming : Secession Week Blogging !
The Fourth of July is commonly known as Independence Day , but a better term for it is Secession Day .
Secession almost always involves multiple groups of people , some small and local , others large and distant , who want to rule the same territory .
And history tells us that large , distant rulers are often reluctant to grant independence .
The word “ independence ” takes all the historical messiness involved in winning freedom from a hostile enemy and sweeps it under the rug , while the term “ secession ” puts this inherent tension right out into the open .
So Saturday , July 4th is Secession Day .
And to commemorate this day , Let A Thousand Nations Bloom is going to host a Secession Week Blogging Event .
Starting on Monday ( 6/29 ) , we will post a roundup of secession - related links every day .
Some will be original pieces here , some original pieces from other blogs , and some older articles .
This is a brand new event , so I do n’t know how popular it will be , but secession is a hot topic lately so we should be able to get a decent following that we can build on in future years .
If you ’d like to make an original contribution to the event , write a post next week and email it to us at athousandnationsbloom@gmail.com , or just trackback one of our posts .
If you have a blog or website and find our Secession Week posts interesting , please post links to us .

Rwanda has strongly denied reports that its parliament is considering a draft law which would forcibly sterilise people who are mentally disabled .
Damascene Ntawukuriryayo , deputy speaker of parliament , was responding to a call by US - based activists Human Rights Watch to scrap the proposed law .
He also told the BBC that plans for HIV testing before couples get married are strictly voluntary , not compulsory .
Mr Ntawukuriryayo said the lobby group should check before releasing reports .
He said he had never seen a bill or provision which proposed forcible sterilisation .
Earlier , HRW 's Joe Amon had said : " Provisions in the current bill that increase stigma , rely on coercion and deny ... reproductive rights should be removed . "
Forced sterilisation is regarded as a crime against humanity by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court .
Rwanda has successfully managed to lower the spread of Aids in recent years thanks to its HIV campaign , according to World Bank figures .
" While Rwanda has made notable progress in fighting stigma and responding to the Aids epidemic , and has pledged to advance the rights of persons with disability , forced sterilisation and mandatory HIV testing do not contribute to those goals , " said Mr Amon , the health and human rights director at Human Rights Watch .
" These elements of the bill undermine reproductive health goals and undo decades of work to ensure respect for reproductive rights . "
Goldman Sachs ’ remarkable comeback from the brink of financial Armageddon is adding luster to Warren Buffett ’s investment street cred — and more importantly , lining the billionaire investor ’s outsize pockets .
Buffett ’s $ 5 billion investment in Goldman is yielding a paper return of more than $ 2.5 billion for his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway , which last September extended a billion - dollar lifeline to Goldman after Lehman Brothers collapsed .
Back then , as the credit crisis was roiling Wall Street , Goldman was among a handful of big - name Wall Street firms feared to be on the verge of suffering a fate similar to that of the now - defunct Bear Stearns and Lehman .
That made Buffett ’s investment all the more risky .
Both Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley sought protection from market turmoil by taking the unprecedented move of converting into bank holding companies at the peak of the market ’s hand - wringing .
However , during the first half of the year , Lloyd Blankfein ’s Goldman has so far emerged as one of Wall Street ’s biggest winners , making Buffett look like a genius .
Goldman last week reported a 33 percent jump in second - quarter earnings to $ 2.7 billion on the back of the firm ’s fixed - income trading .
Buffett ’s Goldman investment sees him owning roughly 43 million warrants to purchase Goldman ’s stock at the strike price of $ 115 a share .
Factoring the difference in the strike price at which Buffett ’s options might be converted , given Goldman ’s closing price of $ 165.45 yesterday and the 10 percent dividend on the preferred shares , Buffet ’s investment is worth some $ 2.6 billion .

Many patients are put under sedation
The recent ruling by the law lords in the case of Debbie Purdy has re-ignited the debate over assisted suicide .
Polls suggest that while a majority of the public would support a change in the law to allow assisted dying , most doctors are against it .
But there is evidence that some clinicians may already be using continuous deep sedation ( CDS ) , as a form of " slow euthanasia " .
Research suggests use of CDS in Britain is particularly high - accounting for about one in six of all deaths .
It seems that there 's substitution from the practice of euthanasia to the practice of continuous deep sedation
Dr Judith Rietjens
Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam Every year more than 1,000 people are admitted onto the wards at St Christopher 's Hospice in Sydenham , south London .
It is at the forefront of research and education in end - of - life palliative care .
Dr Nigel Sykes , medical director , said only a handful of patients each year require sedation to make them unconscious at the end of their lives .
" Deep sedation , in the sense that you are wanting to make someone unaware of their surroundings , they are asleep , comatose , that is something that is required very uncommonly indeed . "
Last option Dr Sykes said CDS can be appropriate for patients who become confused and deeply agitated - but only when nothing else can relieve their distress .
There is really no excuse for a doctor to take the line of consciously using deep sedation as an alternative to euthanasia because he can't think of anything else to do
Dr Nigel Sykes
St Christopher 's Hospice
But research by Clive Seale , professor of medical sociology at Bart's and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry , suggests the use of CDS across the UK is far from " uncommon " .
" The only other two countries where the prevalence has been measured is in the Netherlands and Belgium , " said Professor Seale .
" The surprising thing was that in the UK the prevalence of continuous deep sedation until death was very high indeed , 16.5 % of all UK deaths . "
That is twice as high as in Belgium and the Netherlands .
But while rates of CDS in the Netherlands appear to be rising , the use of euthanasia has declined .
Cancer patients Dr Judith Rietjens , from Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam , said this shift is particularly marked among GPs looking after cancer patients .
" It seems that there 's substitution from the practice of euthanasia to the practice of continuous deep sedation , " she said .
The Debbie Purdy case has put assisted suicide back in the headlines " We can see in our study that those sub - groups where we saw an increase of continuous deep sedation - just in those sub - groups - we saw a lowering of the frequency of euthanasia . "
Professor Seale thinks something similar may be happening in the UK .
" There is good evidence from the Netherlands and Belgium to show that quite a lot of doctors who find providing euthanasia very emotionally distressing and ethically difficult , find that providing continuous deep sedation is an easier thing to do , " he said .
" In those countries euthanasia is an option - it 's legal .
In the UK it is n't .
" Whether doctors in the UK are thinking in this way , and nurses as well , is something which is worth exploring more . "
There are fears that CDS is being used inappropriately .
Father 's death Dr Philip Harrison , a GP now based in New Zealand , set out his concerns recently in the British Medical Journal , following the death of his father in Doncaster Royal Infirmary .
He was put under continuous deep sedation without being consulted , and so had no chance to say goodbye to his family .
Dr Harrison reached the hospital two hours before his father died .
It was as near to a form of murder that I had come across ,
Dr Philip Harrison
GP " I 'm 100 % certain he would have been horrified to know that he would never see us even though we were coming , " he said .
" There was no reason on earth why he would have wished to have been put to sleep , unless he was obviously distressed or agitated or in pain .
" But there was no evidence he was in pain at any stage during his admission . "
Dr Harrison , who has long experience in palliative care , decided not to sue the trust - but he did try to get reassurance that it could n't happen again .
Despite an apology he is still not satisfied .
" I do n't know what the legal term is but to me it was as near to a form of murder that I had come across , " he said .
" I have never seen that in my medical practice before .
I 've seen euthanasia once , but I 've never seen anybody being put to death without consent . "
Dr Harrison said he is concerned about what could be going on across the NHS in the name of caring and terminal sedation .
The truth is , no one knows .
No clear definition Dr Nigel Sykes said one problem was the lack of a clear definition of CDS .
He also points out that many patients close to death lose consciousness regardless of their medication .
He emphasised the importance of discussing treatment - with the patient whenever possible , with the family , and with specialist colleagues .
" There is really no excuse for a doctor to take the line of consciously using deep sedation as an alternative to euthanasia because he can't think of anything else to do .
" There are sources of advice available because specialist palliative care is now available and accessible across the country . "
Dr Sykes said there was a need for further research to establish how much sedation is being used , who is using it , and why .

Ten years ago , the launch of EverQuest arguably changed the gaming industry forever .
Its combination of gameplay , story and cosmetic appeal was precisely what gamers had been waiting for and would soon be the inspiration for many great , and some not so great games to come .
Over the years , Sony Online Entertainment has released a number of subsequent EverQuest games set in the world of Norrath ; most notable of which being EverQuest Online Adventures and EverQuest II .
While both titles continue to retain an active player - base , lately " Will there be an EverQuest III ? " has been an increasingly popular subject .
Keep reading for official confirmation that " EverQuest Next " is in development .
Recently , we got our hands on a copy of the 10th Anniversary EverQuest Book written by Rusel DeMaria and Paul Lipscombe .
The last chapter of this book is intriguingly titled " EverQuest Next " and was individually written by EverQuest Creative Director , Rich Waters .
" As we contemplate future EverQuest games , we have to ask , what does the modern MMO player really want from today 's games ?
What will they want four years from now ?
Current MMOs are still designed traditionally with a pen-and - paper game feel behind them - lots of stats and numbers , experience - based levels and a focus on auto - attack dice roll combat .
Will that work for next - gen MMOs , or do we try something different ? "
Waters writes inquisitively .
Later he mentions how they were " ahead of the curve " with EverQuest Online Adventures for the PlayStation 2 because " few players had network adapters for the PS2 , and even fewer knew what an MMO was " .
It 's the final statement of the Chapter that confirms " EverQuest Next " , however .
" So you can see there 's a lot to wrestle with as we begin laying the foundation for EverQuest ' Next . '
As I write this , we have concept artists and game designers working hard in our studio - taking the lessons of the past , the best parts of the present and the most promising ideas for the future - to bring the world of Norrath to a new generation of players , as well as the dedicated legions of fans who made the EverQuest franchise timeless .
I hope we 'll see you there . "
Does this mean that " EverQuest Next " will give players an innovative , outside of the MMO box look at Norrath ?
Is it safe to assume that the next installment of EverQuest will be console bound ?
Currently , there 's not much room for anything other than speculation .
One thing is clear though , with a confirmed EverQuest Movie and a new EverQuest MMO in the works , our beloved franchise has a bright future ahead of it .
In 1996 , Columbia Journalism Review published an article called " The Vincent Foster Factory , " detailing the role played by Joseph Farah , then head of the Western Journalism Center , in promoting conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Clinton White House counsel Vince Foster .
It states :
One of the Center 's major activities is trying to inject the dark view of Foster 's death into mainstream reporting and thinking .
Last year , to this end , the Center bought full - page ads in several major newspapers , including The New York Times , to showcase Ruddy 's work and to offer for sale special Vince Foster reports , including a compilation of Ruddy 's stories , titled " The Ruddy Investigation , " for $ 12 , and a forty - minute " riveting new video documentary " titled " Unanswered -- The Death of Vincent Foster , " which Ruddy helped produce , and which goes for $ 35 .
Sound familiar ?
That 's the same playbook -- promotion , conspiracies and selling trinkets to true believers -- Farah is running against Barack Obama on the birth certificate conspiracy .
As he did back then , Farah insisted his work is n't partisan .
In 1996 , Farah claimed the WJC was merely " a vigorous watchdog on government " ; on July 29 , he asserted that " this is not a left - right issue .
This is not a conservative - liberal issue .
This is not a Democrat - Republican issue .
This is not an ideological issue .
This is a matter of what 's true and what 's not . "
Both claims are , in essence , false .
As ConWebWatch detailed , Farah 's WJC was interested in being " a vigorous watchdog on government " only when Democrats were in charge ; the organization was dormant throughout the Bush presidency , and only recently sprung back to life under the leadership of right - wing political operative Floyd Brown just in time for a new Democratic administration .
Brown , like Farah , is obsessed with the birth certificate issue .
The WJC 's disdain for holding Republicans accountable carried over to WND .
As ConWebWatch noted , WND stayed away from the issue of Bush 's service in the National Guard in early 2004 when others were reporting on the issue and Bush 's reluctance to release relevant information ( though WND found time to smear Bush 's eventual 2004 opponent , John Kerry , by publishing false and discredited rumors of an affair ) .
It arrived late to the game with a single article that was more interested in covering for Bush than acting like a watchdog on the issue .
WND was completely silent , however , on another recent birth certificate - related issue .
Blogger Andrew Sullivan crusaded throughout the 2008 presidential campaign and beyond demanding that Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin release the birth certificate of infant Trig ; Palin has presented Trig as her son , but rumors swirled that Trig was actually the son of Palin 's teenage daughter , Bristol .
WND devoted no articles to the Palin controversy , and Palin to this day has refused to release the birth certificate .
Yet , in an August 2 article , WND praised Sullivan for joining " the rising chorus of voices across the political spectrum calling for Barack Obama to release his original , long - form birth certificate to put aside growing doubts about his eligibility for the presidency . "
WND made no mention of Sullivan 's longtime demand that Trig Palin 's birth certificate be released .
Farah 's pursuit of Foster and the Obama birth certificate share another trait -- a fondness for false claims .
CJR reported in 1996 :
As 60 Minutes reports , Ruddy has acknowledged one serious error .
In two chapters of " The Ruddy Investigation , " both copyrighted in 1994 , he questions how the fatal gun could have been found in Foster 's right hand when Foster was left - handed .
In fact , Foster was right - handed .
Farah says , " Ruddy and I have been at the forefront of the information trail to correct " this error .
But in early 1996 , the Center was continuing to sell " The Ruddy Investigation " with the error still standing .
Further , Ruddy 's book stemming from the WJC - linked Foster investigation was rejected even by conservatives like Ann Coulter , who wrote in her book " Slander " : " Even if Christopher Ruddy 's The Strange Death of Vince Foster was considered a conservative hoax book , it was also conservatives who discredited it . "
All of that , of course , was counter to the numerous investigations by people without an ideological ax to grind -- and , in independent counsel Kenneth Starr , someone who arguably did -- that all came to the same conclusion : Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park .
As ConWebWatch has detailed , Farah and WND have reported numerous claims regarding the birth certificate that have been proven false , but WND has made no effort to correct the record .
WND has also told numerous falsehoods about Obama in general .
Since the truth does not appear to matter to Farah , WND 's falsehood - strewn trail would seem to put the lie to his assertion that " This is a matter of what 's true and what 's not . "
Yet it 's also about something else Farah is loath to mention :
It 's a matter of dollars and cents .
At the end of Farah 's July 29 column was this note : " Want to turn up the pressure to learn the facts ?
Get your signs and postcards asking for the president 's birth certificate documentation from the Birth Certificate Store ! "
Indeed , WND has a cornucopia of items related to the issue .
Among them :
In a rehash of the WJC 's purchase of full - page newspaper ads to reprint Ruddy 's dubious Foster reporting , WND is buying space on billboards across the country ( and asking readers to pitch in ) asking the question , " Where 's the birth certificate ? "
The question , of course , can just as easily apply to Sarah Palin .
WND even sold readers a letter it would send to Obama in time for his birthday Aug. 4 for the low , low price of $ 6.95 .
But even that letter contained a falsehood :
It asserted that " The problem with the short - form certification is that it could easily be obtained for a birth that took place out of the state or out of the country .
All it would take is the word of one parent . "
That claim has been debunked by none other than the Western Journalism Center -- the Farah - founded organization that attacked the Clinton administration over Foster .
WND later claimed that it sent out " more than 1,200 personalized letters . "
At $ 6.95 a letter , that 's a gross of more than $ 8,340 .
It most assuredly did not cost WND $ 8,340 to personalize those letters , print them out and FedEx them to the White House -- meaning that WND made a tidy profit on the venture .
CJR noted that " About half of the $ 500,000 that came into the Center last year [ 1995 ] came from individuals who bought Foster merchandise . "
The same pattern appears to be recurring with WND 's birther pursuit .
All those trinkets must keep the money rolling in .
And unlike the nonprofit WJC ( Farah claimed not to take a WJC salary ) , WorldNetDaily is a for - profit venture , so Farah -- as WND 's majority owner -- is making coin in a way he reportedly did n't from the WJC .
Since WND is privately held , it does n't have to release financial records .
That 's ironic given Farah 's demand for transparency from Obama .
Indeed , WND has operated in a very opaque manner regarding its birth certificate coverage , almost as if it were hiding something .
Which would not be a surprise .
After all , it was largely unknown at the time that the WJC was essentially a closed circle of promotion -- it accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from right - wing philanthropist Richard Mellon Scaife to finance and promote reporting by an employee of a Scaife - owned newspaper .
It 's also not a surprise that Farah would run the Foster playbook on Obama .
To Farah , Foster and the birth certificate are indistinguishable , serving only as a tool , a means to the end of smearing a president with whom he disagrees .
Only this time , he profits directly from his activism .
And if WND ever starts telling the truth and admits the birth certificate issue is bogus , a burgeoning source of revenue evaporates .
Simply put , it 's not in Farah 's financial interest to tell the truth about Obama 's birth certificate , and WND 's coverage has borne this out .
Ultimately , Joseph Farah 's record shows all too well what he really is .
He is not a journalist -- he 's a partisan political operative , just as he was before .
He is not looking to uphold the Constitution -- he wants to destroy a duly elected president , just as he tried to do before .
He does not care about the truth -- just as he did before , he peddles lies .

I initiated the divorce because my partner had serious issues that he was unwilling or unable to change .
I was fortunate that I had a good job and a supportive family .
However , my social life was seriously effected - I lost many friends and many of the friends that I kept invited me to " couple events " which was difficult for me .
I felt rage and sorrow about my personal situation .
My son was confused and , at times , angry .
I had to do tasks that were unfamiliar and difficult for me .
Despite my former partner 's personal issues , there were still aspects of him that I missed ; I was lonely and overwhelmed .
I looked around , but I could not find the resources that I needed , to deal with what was happening to my life .
I promised myself that when I made the journey to " beyond " , I would make the necessary resources available to other women that were having a similar experience .

The gig :
He does n’t make the cars of the future ; he makes the cars of the future go .
As chief executive of AC Propulsion Inc. , Tom Gage advances the technologies under the hoods of electric transportation .
The high - tech batteries and drive systems made by the San Dimas company power a growing number of electric vehicles .
Those include a test fleet of BMW ’s electric Minis , which are currently whooshing -- silently -- over roads in California , New York and New Jersey .
From the pits to this : A self - described “ car nut ” since childhood , Gage moved to Georgia to work as a race mechanic after graduating from Stanford University with an engineering degree .
After a few years tinkering with turbos and emissions systems , he wiped off the grease , got an MBA and landed a job at Chrysler .
There he got his first jolt of electric transportation , working on a program to develop plug - in passenger vehicles .
That effort sputtered , and Gage ultimately left Detroit for California to consult on advanced vehicle technologies .
In 1994 , he met Alan Cocconi , who had put an electric drivetrain into an old Honda Civic .
Driving it , Gage said , “ was a life - changing experience for me . ”
Soon after , he “ started hanging out at AC Propulsion , ” Cocconi ’s company , and worked his way up the ladder .
Big break :
For a while , AC Propulsion cobbled together its own vehicle line , dubbed the eBox , by converting Toyota ’s Scion xB hatchbacks into electric cars with a 120 - mile range for $ 55,000 ( plus the cost of the Scion ) .
The first customer was actor Tom Hanks , Gage said .
AC Propulsion also helped Tesla Motors of San Carlos , Calif. , develop its $ 109,000 electric Roadster .
But the real breakthrough came last year when BMW picked Gage ’s company to supply the drivetrain and battery for its Mini E electric program , an order for some 600 cars .
Advertisement
“ When that came along , we totally dropped eBox , ” Gage said .
“ We had our hands full . ”
Not too fast , but furious :
With a staff of just 35 employees in the U.S. and 50 in the Shanghai factory it opened in 2006 , AC Propulsion is n’t a high - volume shop .
Each month it manufactures just 40 drive systems , which sell for roughly $ 25,000 apiece .
Still ,
Gage says the privately held company is making money , a rarity in the world of electric cars .
“ We ’re very profitable , and that distinguishes us from just about everybody in the business , ” Gage said .
The future is current : Gasoline engines can be great for power or for fuel economy , but not both , Gage said .
That ’s a compromise that electric cars do n’t have to make .
He said vehicles running AC Propulsion ’s drivetrain , called the tzero , can have bullet - like acceleration yet still get from point A to point B for just a few pennies ’ worth of juice .
The only limitation is range , which is rapidly increasing as lithium battery technology improves .
Advertisement
“ The most compelling feature is that you do n’t use petroleum , ” Gage said .
“ For many uses , electrics are superior . ”
Why Detroit will win : Start - ups like AC Propulsion are leading the development of electric vehicles .
Still , Gage is n’t counting out old - line automakers .
Blame the eight years spent at Chrysler .
“ When you see the precision and scale of a huge auto factory , you realize just how hard and expensive it is to mass - produce cars , ” Gage said .
He believes that giants like Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. will ultimately buy up promising companies in the car space .
“ Making parts for 10,000 or 100,000 cars is too much for us , ” Gage said .
“ Our goal is to be a participant in the early part of the process and then plan a timely exit . ”
Advertisement
The more things change :
In some ways Gage , who is 59 and has two kids , has come full circle .
One of his first jobs was running a business that removed the emission - control devices from sports cars so that they would go faster .
Three decades later , he ’s running a company that removes emissions from cars altogether .
“ It ’s always been about modifying cars to make them things that people want to drive , ” he said .
What ’s he driving ?
Gage generally scoots about in an eBox or a Mini E but admits to owning a Toyota and a pair of Volkswagens .
And because his Sunnyvale home is 375 miles from work , he logs quite a few miles on airplanes , which he knows are n’t exactly carbon neutral .

“ It just rubs me the wrong way to start up a gas engine , ” Gage said .

She has a red catnip mouse we call red dog that she chases down when you throw it and brings it back to you .

For years , breast cancer awareness campaigns have urged women over 40 to get a yearly mammogram .
When women hesitate to comply , it ’s often to avoid the discomfort of having their breasts squeezed or the fear of getting called back for more tests , even if it turns out there ’s no cancer .
But screening poses another downside : A routine mammogram can find cancers that would never have become life - threatening , subjecting women to painful and toxic treatments they never actually needed .
A new study calculates that this is just what happens in as many as one in every three breast cancers diagnosed by a screening mammogram .
That research , published July 9 in the British Medical Journal , comes on the heels of several other studies suggesting that some breast cancers found on mammograms would naturally have regressed on their own without treatment .
The studies do n’t mean that women should abandon mammography , most experts say .
But some think it ’s time to reconsider the way that mammogram screening is done .

“ For too long , we ’ve taken a brain - dead approach that says the best test is the one that finds the most cancers -- but that ’s wrong , ” says Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon , N.H , who wrote an editorial accompanying the British Medical Journal study .
“ The best test is the one that finds the right cancers and nothing else . ”
The detection of tumors that would never have caused trouble is known in the medical trade as overdiagnosis .
It ’s a common problem with screening tests , which , by definition , aim to detect disease in people without symptoms .
Breast cancers generally behave in one of three ways .
Some grow very aggressively and metastasize ( i.e. spread to other tissues ) long before any mammogram can detect them .
Others grow more gradually and can be successfully treated if caught early .
Still others grow so slowly that they ’ll never cause the woman a problem .
Autopsy studies have found undetected breast cancer in about 37 % of women who died of some other cause .
And a study of 42,238 Norwegian women published in November calculated that 22 % of symptom - free cancers found on a screening mammogram naturally regressed on their own .
Advertisement
The problem is that , even under a microscope , it ’s impossible to distinguish these different types of cancer from one another , and mammograms are better at catching the less dangerous kinds .
“ Screening is really good at finding the slow , ploddy , probably - not - going - to - kill - you cancers , but it ’s not so good at finding the fast , aggressive ones , ” says Susan Love , president of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation and author of “ Dr. Susan Love ’s Breast Book . ”
The July 9 study , by researchers at the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen , examined rates of breast cancer in regions of the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , Sweden and Norway before and after these countries instituted national mammography programs .
The scientists reasoned that if screening mammography were preventing early - stage breast cancers from progressing , these programs should have resulted in a drop in the number of advanced breast cancer cases -- those showing signs of spreading -- among women who had been screened .
Advertisement
The researchers did n’t find that .
Instead , they found that mammography screening programs increased the overall number of breast cancers diagnosed but did not reduce the number of advanced cancers .
The team calculated , based on these results , that for every 2,000 women screened by mammography over 10 years , one will avoid dying from breast cancer and 10 others will receive treatments for a cancer that would have never become life - threatening .
In other words , “ screening causes 10 times as many women to become cancer patients unnecessarily as it prevents from dying from breast cancer , ” says lead author Karsten Jorgensen , a researcher at the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen .
To screen or not ?

Because scientists do not yet have a way to distinguish cancers that will turn life - threatening from the harmless ones , they must treat every case as if it were the worst kind .
As a result , Jorgensen says , for every woman whose life is saved , several others are subjected to surgery , radiation therapy and sometimes chemotherapy that they did n’t need , for cancers they never would have known about without the screening .
“ The question is no longer whether overdiagnosis occurs , but how should we react to it , ” Welch says .
The recent studies suggest that “ it ’s not an imperative to be screened ; in fact , it ’s a close call . ”
Breast cancer survivor Barbara Brenner , executive director of Breast Cancer Action , a breast cancer advocacy group in San Francisco , says it ’s time to address this problem .
“ Every woman who had a breast cancer found on a mammogram thinks the mammogram saved her life , ” she says .
“ There are probably some women whose treatments have led to their early deaths .
But no one wants to talk about that . ”
Advertisement
But Elizabeth Thompson , vice president of health sciences at Susan G. Komen for the Cure , a breast cancer advocacy group based in Dallas , says she worries that these studies will undermine her group ’s awareness efforts .
“ I do n’t think you can say that we ’re overtreating those women .
We know that some of these cancers become invasive , ” she says .
“ We need to keep hammering away at our basic message , which is , early detection saves lives . ”
Dr. Eric Winer , director of the breast oncology center at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute and chief scientific advisor for Susan G. Komen for the Cure acknowledges that messages about mammography may need revamping .
“ As painful as it is to admit , we have oversold mammography to the American public , ” he says .
“ Frankly , I do n’t know what to do with this .
On the one hand , I do n’t want to push people away from mammography , but I do n’t want to encourage them to have misconceptions about mammograms either . ”
Advertisement
Winer says it might be worth studying the effects of doing the screens less frequently .
The U.S. is the only country that recommends yearly mammograms starting at age 40 .
Most European countries begin mammography at age 50 and recommend them only every two or three years .
Welch thinks it ’s time scientists figured out ways to make mammograms more effective .
“ We need to reevaluate what we call abnormal on a mammogram , ” he says .
Instead of looking so hard for very early cancers , doctors should focus on finding the ones most likely to turn deadly .
Perhaps , he says , some minor abnormalities could be ignored , in particular small microcalcifications , miniature specks of calcium that are usually harmless but occasionally occur in tandem with precancerous changes in the breast .
Unclear diagnosis

But radiologists are unlikely to adopt guidelines that call for a wait - and - see approach , says Dr. Fred Vernacchia , a radiologist and medical director at the San Luis Diagnostic Center in San Luis Obispo .
Mammograms are the No. 1 source of malpractice lawsuits against radiologists , he says , and this creates an incentive to overdiagnose breast cancer .
“ The choice is , overbiopsy and overdiagnose -- or live through another lawsuit , ” he says .
The conclusion that many breast cancer patients never needed treatment may seem disheartening , but there is good news here also , Love says .
“ What this says is that there ’s such a thing as cancer without disease .
It means you do n’t have to just blast away every cancer cell , ” she says .
Now , she adds , scientists need to figure out ways to tell which cancers are which and what factors in the breast might make dormant cancer cells wake up and start causing trouble .
Advertisement
“ We should n’t stop doing mammograms , because we have no alternative , ” she says .
“ But women need to walk away from this study recognizing that things are not as simple as we thought .
We used to think that all cancers were the same and that early detection was prevention .
“ Well , it ’s not prevention .
And early detection may not always be in your best interest . ”

What women really know
Do women fully understand the pros and cons of an annual screening mammogram ?
Studies suggest they do not .
Advertisement
A 2000 survey of 479 women without a personal history of breast cancer found that only 8 % knew that a mammogram could harm a woman ( by subjecting her to treatments she did n’t need ) and nearly all ( 94 % ) did not know that some early - stage breast cancers do not progress .
Likewise , a survey of more than 10,200 Europeans published Aug. 12 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that 92 % of the women surveyed dramatically overestimated the ability of mammography to cut cancer deaths or said they did n’t know the magnitude of its benefits .
Here ’s how the benefits and risks stack up .
If 1,000 50 - year - old women have a yearly mammogram for 10 years :
Advertisement
* One will avoid dying from breast cancer .
* Two to 10 will be treated for a cancer that never would have harmed them .
* Ten to 15 will learn earlier that they have cancer than they would have otherwise , but this earlier diagnosis will not change their prognosis .
* One hundred to 500 will have at least one false alarm .

Mobile phones and the internet create new challenges for today ’s parents .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Poor parenting is not the reason for an increase in problem behaviour amongst teenagers , according to research led by Oxford University .
A team led by Professor Frances Gardner from the Department of Social Policy and Social Work at the University of Oxford found no evidence of a general decline in parenting .
Their findings show that differences in parenting according to family structure and income have narrowed over the last 25 years .
However , the task of parenting is changing and could be getting increasingly stressful , particularly for some groups .
Parents and teenagers are choosing to spend more quality time together than 25 years ago , with 70 per cent of young people regularly spending time with their mothers in 2006 compared to 62 per cent in 1986 .
For fathers , the figure had increased from 47 per cent to 52 per cent .
This research follows a Nuffield - funded study in 2004 , which identified an increase in both adolescent conduct and emotional problems over the last 25 years .
Despite the rise , this latest study shows that today ’s parents are more likely to know where their teenage children are and what they are doing than their 1980s equivalents .
The proportion asking what their children were doing has increased from 47 per cent in 1986 to 66 per cent in 2006 .
Differences in the monitoring of teenage children , according to family type and income , have narrowed .
For example in 1994 , 14 - 15 year olds from single parent families were more likely to be out late without their parents knowing where compared with two parent families , but by 2005 this difference had disappeared .
Professor Gardner said :
‘ We found no evidence for declining standards of parenting overall , and this leads us to believe this factor does not generally explain the rise in problem behaviour . ’
Parents of teenagers are increasingly likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety themselves , particularly one - parent families and those on low incomes .
For example , the proportion of parents from the most economically disadvantaged group who reported symptoms of depression and anxiety had increased by more than 50 per cent between 1986 and 2006 .
The research highlights a different set of challenges for parents compared with 25 years ago .
Young people now are reliant on their parents for longer , with higher proportions of 20 - 24 year olds living with their parents .
Many more remain in some kind of education or training into their late teens .
In addition , the development of new technology , such as mobile phones and the Internet , has created new monitoring challenges for parents .
' Today ’s parents have had to develop skills that are significantly different and arguably more complex than 25 years ago , and this could be increasing the stress involved in parenting , ’ Professor Gardner said .
The research , commissioned by the Nuffield Foundation for a briefing paper , Time trends in parenting and outcomes for young people , was authored by Dr Ann Hagell , Head of the Nuffield Foundation ’s Changing Adolescence Programme .
The research team reviewed published evidence , and analysed two sets of UK nationally representative data .
The first was the British Household Panel Survey ( BHPS ) , with annual data on parenting reported by teenagers and their parents from 1994 onwards .
The second data source comes from a related Nuffield - funded project , led by Dr Stephan Collishaw , to study causes of trends in youth mental health .

If there is something unique about this story it is the level of interest that it has generated .
Neither spying , nor the influence peddling is new ; but until professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt broke the silence on the lobby ’s influence , few were willing to discuss either .
Things have moved on considerably since .
Many fine books have come out in recent years that have shed light on the lobby ’s operations , specifically on its frequently decisive role in shaping US Middle East policy .
No analyst however has been as tenacious as Grant F. Smith of the Institute for Research : Middle Eastern Policy ( IRMEP ) who in a series of books has brought crucial new information to light through the use of the Freedom of Information Act .
His latest , America ’s Defense Line : the Justice Department ’s Battle to Register the Israel Lobby as Agents of a Foreign Government , focuses on an important aspect of the lobby ’s origins that has implications for how it operates today .
Supporters of the Israel lobby have long maintained that the reason it does not have to register as an agent of a foreign government is that its funding and composition are indigenous to the US .
Even critics such as Mearsheimer and Walt have declared its operations “ as American as apple pie . ”
However , as Smith reveals , the lobby was only able to turn into the powerhouse it is today because of the start - up funding it received from Israel and its ability — through stonewalling , deception and subversion of the legal process — to stave off the State Department and the Department of Justice ’s attempts to have it registered as a foreign agent .
In fascinating detail supported by hundreds of declassified documents ( reproduced in the Appendix ) Smith reveals the various mechanisms it employed to avoid the purview of the Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) .
The lobby ’s greatest success — to propagate the myth that Israel and the US have identical interests and common enemies — would not have been possible had the Department of Justice succeeded in securing its compliance with FARA .
This law requires entities registered under it to mark all their informational material with the disclaimer that their author is the agent of a foreign government .
Central to Smith ’s investigation is the person of Isaiah L. Kenen , the Canadian - born founder of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , whose brief stint as a journalist segued into his long lobbying career .
( It is from Kenen ’s 1980 history of the lobby , Israel ’s Defense Line : Her Friends and Foes in Washington , that Smith draws the title of his book .
If for Kenen the lobby was Israel ’s defense line , for Smith the US judicial system is America’s . )
Kenen began as the director of information for the American Emergency Committee for Zionist Affairs but after the creation of Israel he went on to work for the Israeli embassy ’s Office of Information as a press officer .
Already in the late 1940s , writes Smith , Kenen began probing the FARA unit for weaknesses , keenly aware that its restrictions would never allow him “ to properly ‘ frame ’ issues in a sophisticated way that transformed and sold their presentation from Israeli needs to perceived American interests . ”
He therefore left the Office of Information and joined the American Zionist Council ( AZC ) as Israel ’s domestic lobbyist .
The AZC had recently delegated the activities previously carried out by the Jewish Agency at David Ben Gurion ’s suggestion in order to bolster the appearance of “ indigenous American control . ”
However , it faced a formidable challenger in the anti-Zionist American Council of Judaism ( ACJ ) , which rejected “ all those self - appointed spokesmen who presume to make their partisan claims in the name of all Americans of the Jewish faith . ”
It was the ACJ that finally took the AZC ’s case to the Justice Department , eventually forcing it to register under FARA .
This led Kenen to form the American Zionist Public Affairs Committee , soon to be subsumed by AIPAC , as a means of escaping FARA regulations .
He also founded a biweekly publication , Near East Report , which introduced many of the themes familiar from the Israel lobby ’s recent propaganda .
The publication was underwritten by the Jewish Agency , the executive arm of the World Zionist Organization headquartered in Jerusalem .
The Justice Department ’s drawn - out struggle to register the lobby under FARA is chronicled by Smith in remarkable detail .
These efforts were given a boost first by the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration ( deeply resented by Kenen ) , which would withdraw the AZC ’s tax - exempt status , and subsequently by John F. Kennedy , whose Justice Department would eventually lead the AZC to register under FARA .
Throughout this period the AZC had to rely on funding from the Jewish Agency .
The growing scrutiny only spurred the lobby to devise more sophisticated means of masking this funding through the use of various offshore shell corporations which laundered back tax - exempt aid first raised in the US .
Once these mechanisms were revealed during the Fulbright hearings , however , the lobby finally switched to domestic funding .
The dogged attempts by Department of Justice officials such as Irene Bowman and Nathan Lenvin eventually came to naught when the assassination of Kennedy led the new Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to go with the prevailing winds ( decidedly pro-Israel under president Lyndon Johnson ) and scrap the investigation .
Smith also details the strong anti-Zionist current that characterized American Jewry before it was eventually overwhelmed by the better resourced Zionist factions .
The initial charge against the Israel lobby was led by the American Council of Judaism , which was headed by reform rabbis such as Elmer Berger , and Jewish universalists such as the philanthropist Lessing Rosenwald .
When The Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was concerned about offending “ Jewish opinion , ” he was deluged with letters from American Jews rejecting the notion as a myth .
They saw themselves first and foremost as Americans and they wanted Kennedy to do all that he felt was necessary to protect US interests , including registering the lobby as a foreign agent .
However , after the 1967 war , Jewish anti-Zionism would go into hibernation until its revival four decades later by the Iraq war and the role of the mostly Jewish neoconservatives in instigating it .
Despite a 90 page appendix including useful profiles of the various organizations , key declassified documents , samples of racist cartoons published by Near East Report , and a history of incidents related to FARA enforcement , the book could have benefited from adding a concise chronology of events .
Better editing could have also eliminated some of its repetitiveness and reduced the confusion that results from the sometimes non-linear narrative style .
Nevertheless , the writing remains engaging throughout and the analysis is invariably sharp .
In the wake of the Harman - AIPAC spy affair , calls have intensified for the leading Israel lobby institution to be registered as an agent of a foreign state .
The lobby , as one of its stalwarts colorfully put it , is like a “ nightflower ” which wilts in the sunlight .
Those seeking justice for the Palestinians and accountability for the disastrous course of foreign and domestic policy under the lobby ’s tutelage could do worse than to ensure constant sunlight .
Given the nature of the scandal , the Department of Justice is susceptible to public pressure and thanks to Smith ’s indispensable work , we are privy to the means employed by the lobby to thwart similar investigations in the past .
Armed with this information , it may finally be possible to uphold what Smith calls “ America ’s defense line ” — the US laws that govern the operations of foreign agents .

Confronted with images of corpses floating in the blackened floodwaters or baking in the sun on abandoned highways , there are n’t too many people left who see what happened following Hurricane Katrina as a purely “ natural ” disaster .
The dominant narratives that have emerged , in the four years since the storm , are of a gross human tragedy , compounded by social inequities and government ineptitude — a crisis subsequently exploited in every way possible for political and financial gain .
But there ’s an even harsher truth , one some New Orleans residents learned in the very first days but which is only beginning to become clear to the rest of us :
What took place in this devastated American city was no less than a war , in which victims whose only crimes were poverty and blackness were treated as enemies of the state .
It started immediately after the storm and flood hit , when civilian aid was scarce — but private security forces already had boots on the ground .
Some , like Blackwater ( which has since redubbed itself Xe ) , were under federal contract , while a host of others answered to wealthy residents and businessmen who had departed well before Katrina and needed help protecting their property from the suffering masses left behind .
According Jeremy Scahill ’s reporting in The Nation , Blackwater set up an HQ in downtown New Orleans .
Armed as they would be in Iraq , with automatic rifles , guns strapped to legs , and pockets overflowing with ammo , Blackwater contractors drove around in SUVs and unmarked cars with no license plates .
“ When asked what authority they were operating under , ” Scahill reported , “ one guy said , ‘ We ’re on contract with the Department of Homeland Security . ’
Then , pointing to one of his comrades , he said , ‘ He was even deputized by the governor of the state of Louisiana .
We can make arrests and use lethal force if we deem it necessary . ’
The man then held up the gold Louisiana law enforcement badge he wore around his neck . ”
The Blackwater operators described their mission in New Orleans as “ securing neighborhoods , ” as if they were talking about Sadr City .
When National Guard troops descended on the city , the Army Times described their role as fighting “ the insurgency in the city . ”
Brigadier Gen. Gary Jones , who commanded the Louisiana National Guard ’s Joint Task Force , told the paper , “ This place is going to look like Little Somalia .
We ’re going to go out and take this city back .
This will be a combat operation to get this city under control . ”
Ten days after the storm , the New York Times reported that although the city was calm with no signs of looting ( though it acknowledged this had taken place previously ) , “ New Orleans has turned into an armed camp , patrolled by thousands of local , state , and federal law enforcement officers , as well as National Guard troops and active - duty soldiers . ”
The local police superintendent ordered all weapons , including legally registered firearms , confiscated from civilians .
But as the Times noted , that order did n’t “ apply to hundreds of security guards hired by businesses and some wealthy individuals to protect property … [ who ] openly carry M - 16’s and other assault rifles . ”
Scahill spoke to Michael Montgomery , the chief of security for one wealthy businessman who said his men came under fire from “ black gangbangers ” near the Ninth Ward .
Armed with AR - 15s and Glocks , Montgomery and his men “ unleashed a barrage of bullets in the general direction of the alleged shooters on the overpass .
‘ After that , all I heard was moaning and screaming , and the shooting stopped .
That was it .
Enough said . '”
Malik Rahim , a Vietnam veteran and longtime community activist , was one of the organizers of the Common Ground Collective , which quickly began dispensing basic aid and medical care in the first days after the hurricane .
But far from aiding the relief workers , Rahim told me this week , the police and troops who began patrolling the streets treated them as criminals or “ insurgents . ”
African American men caught outside also ran the risk of crossing paths with roving vigilante patrols who shot at will , he says .
In this dangerous environment , Common Ground began to rely on white volunteers to move through a city that had simply become too perilous for blacks .
In July , the local television station WDSU released a home video , taken shortly after the storm hit , of a local man , Paul Gleason , who bragged to two police officers about shooting looters in the Algiers section of New Orleans .
“ Did you have any problems with looters , ” [ sic ] asked an officer .
“ Not anymore , ” said Gleason .
“ Not anymore ? ”
“ They ’re all dead , ” said Gleason .
The officer asked , “ What happened ? ”
“ We shot them , ” said Gleason .
“ How many did you shoot ?
“ Thirty - eight . ”
“ Thirty - eight people ?
What did you do with the bodies ? ”
“ We gave them to the Coast Guard , ” said Gleason .
Gleason told his story with a cup of red wine in one hand and riding a tractor from Blaine Kern ’s Mardi Gras World .
Although the government ’s aid efforts were in chaos , those involved in the self - generated community rescue and relief efforts were often seen as a threat .
Even so , Common Ground , founded in the days after Katrina hit , eventually managed to serve more than half a million people , operating feeding stations , opening free health and legal clinics , and later rebuilding homes and planting trees .
But they “ never got a dime ” from the federal government , says Rahim .
The feds did , however , recruit one of Common Ground ’s founders , Brandon Darby , as an informant , later using him to infiltrate groups planning actions at the 2008 Republican National Convention .
And while the government could n’t seem to keep people from dying on rooftops or abandoned highways , it wasted no time building a temporary jail in New Orleans .
Burl Cain , the warden of the notorious Angola Prison , a former slave plantation that ’s now home to 5,000 inmates , was rushed down to the city to oversee “ Camp Greyhound ” in the city ’s bus terminal .
According to the New Orleans Times - Picayune , the jail “ was constructed by inmates from Angola and Dixon state prisons and was outfitted with everything a stranded law enforcer could want , including top - of - the - line recreational vehicles to live in and electrical power , courtesy of a yellow Amtrak locomotive .
There are computers to check suspects ’ backgrounds and a mug shot station — complete with heights marked in black on the wall that serves as the backdrop . ”
In the virtual martial law imposed in New Orleans after Katrina , the war on the poor sometimes even spilled over into the war on terror .
In his latest book Zeitoun , published in July , Dave Eggers tells the story of a local Syrian immigrant who stayed in New Orleans to protect his properties and ended up organizing makeshift relief efforts and rescuing people in a canoe .
He continued right up until he was arrested by a group of unidentified , heavily armed men in uniform , thrown into Camp Greyhound , and questioned as a suspected terrorist .
In an interview with Salon , Eggers said :
Zeitoun was among thousands of people who were doing “ Katrina time ” after the storm .
There was a complete suspension of all legal processes and there were no hearings , no courts for months and months and not enough folks in the judicial system really seemed all that concerned about it .
Some human - rights activists and some attorneys , but otherwise it seemed to be the cost of doing business .
It really could have only happened at that time ; 2005 was just the exact meeting place of the Bush - era philosophy towards law enforcement and incarceration , their philosophy toward habeas corpus and their neglect and indifference to the plight of New Orleanians .
Through all the time that the federal and local governments , in concert with wealthy New Orleanians , were pitching their battle , there was virtually no one fighting on the other side .
Reviewing the “ available evidence ” a month after Katrina , the New York Times concluded that “ the most alarming stories that coursed through the city appear to be little more than figments of frightened imaginations . ”
The reports of residents firing at National Guard helicopters , of tourists being robbed and raped on Bourbon Street , and of murderous rampages in the Superdome — all turned out to be false .
Since then it has become increasingly clear that the truth of what happened in New Orleans — vigilantism and racially tinged violence , a military response that supplanted a humanitarian one — is equally sinister .
Next Friday the BLS employment report for August will be released .
Last month , when the unemployment rate dipped slightly to 9.4 % from 9.5 % in June , there were several articles like this one from the LA Times : Unemployment rate decline may indicate the recession has hit bottom .
Earlier I pointed out that the dip in unemployment was just monthly noise : Jobs and the Unemployment Rate
FAQ : How can the unemployment rate fall if the economy is losing net jobs , especially since the population is growing ?
This data comes from two separate surveys .
The unemployment Rate comes from the Current Population Survey ( CPS : commonly called the household survey ) , a monthly survey of about 60,000 households .
The jobs number comes from Current Employment Statistics ( CES : payroll survey ) , a sample of approximately 400,000 business establishments nationwide .
These are very different surveys : the CPS gives the total number of employed ( and unemployed including the alternative measures ) , and the CES gives the total number of positions ( excluding some categories like the self - employed , and a person working two jobs counts as two positions ) .
...
[ T ]he jobs and unemployment rate come from two different surveys and are different measurements ( one for positions , the other for people ) .
Some months the numbers may not seem to make sense ( lost jobs and falling unemployment rate ) , but over time the numbers will work out .
Click on graph for large image .
the graph does n't start at zero to better show the change .
Here are a couple of scatter graphs to illustrate this point ... The first graph shows the monthly change in net jobs ( on the x - axis ) as a percentage of the civilian workforce , and the change in the unemployment rate on the y - axis .
The data is for the last 40 years : 1969 through July 2009 .
Obviously there is a correlation - the more jobs added ( further right on the x- axis ) , the more the unemployment rate declines ( y - axis ) .
And generally the more jobs lost , the more the unemployment rate increases .
But the graph sure is noisy on a monthly basis .
If the economy added 0.2 % net jobs in one month ( as a percent of the civilian workforce , or about 300 thousand net jobs currently ) , the unemployment rate could - and still be within the normal scatter .
The second graph covers the same period but on a quarterly basis :
Now we see a much sharper correlation .
The Red squares are the for 2008 , and the first two quarters of 2009 .
This recession fits the normal pattern .
If the economy loses about 200 thousand jobs per month in August and September , this relationship suggests the unemployment rate will probably be close to 10 % by the end of September .
This also suggests the economy needs to be adding about 0.33 percent of the civilian workforce per quarter to keep the unemployment rate from rising .
That is about 170 thousand net jobs per month .
Note that the trend line is a 2nd order polynomial ( equation on graph ) .
When the economy starts to add jobs , more people start looking for work - and the relationship between net jobs and unemployment rate is not linear .
This graph show the employment - population ratio ; this is the ratio of employed Americans to the adult population .
Note : The general upward trend from the early ' 60s was mostly due to women entering the workforce .
This measure fell slightly in July to 59.4 % , the lowest level since the early ' 80s .
However once the economy starts adding jobs , more people will be looking for work , and the employment - population ratio will start to increase .
This means the stronger the economy , the more net jobs required each quarter to lower the unemployment rate by the same amount ( as shown on the 2nd graph above ) .
The bottom line is the unemployment rate will still increase , and we will probably see 10 % later this year .
GOP TOWN HALL HANDBOOK REVEALED
Excerpts from the book entitled " Taking My Country Back from Those People " ' [ Senator / Representative ]
Please explain whether Obama 's plan would make us kill our grandmothers with poison or with a knife ? '
Satire by R J Shulman
GRAYSON , New Mexico - ( PTSD News ) -
The Post Times Sun Dispatch has obtained portion of a secret Handbook sent to loyal Republicans regarding what they should do at town hall meetings , originally established to discuss health care .
The following are excerpts from the book entitled " Taking My Country Back from Those People . "
Chapter One : Fail to the Chief
As you know , job one for the true patriot is to do whatever is necessary to make Barack Obama fail .
Whatever he is in favor of you know is just his sick subversive plan to take away your guns , have illegal aliens take over your house , and grant abortions on demand to legally married gays .
( You will notice we do n't call him ' President ' because as you all know , he imported dozens of thugs from Kenya where he was born a Muslim , to rig the last election which he stole from our real president , Sarah Palin . )
So , since Obama is in favor of health care reform , you have to be against it .
Ignore all the America - hating liberals who tell lies that there is anything wrong with our health care system .
Remember , if you do n't have health care or your health insurance plan has just said they wo n't pay for your illness , it 's only because you have n't been praying enough .
So keep shouting " we 're number one , we 're number one , " to let them all understand that you are smart enough to know America has the greatest health care in the world .
Alternative uplifting pro-life slogans to shout are , " Death to Health Care " " I 'd rather die than be stuck with socialized medicine " and " Health care Reform : DOA . "
Chapter Five : Know your Rights !
When those Christ - haters who own the media start to tell you that bringing guns and shouting down any discussion on health care is wrong , just tell them you are exercising your First and Second Amendment Rights .
Having the God - given right to shouting and waving guns are all you need to know about your rights .
The other stuff in the Bill of Rights is Communist propaganda .
When Sarah Palin takes her proper place as our real president , she will abolish the useless Third through Tenth Amendment to the Constitution and replace them with the Ten Commandments .
Chapter Eleven : Questions to Ask your Representatives
If the shouting fails because you run out of slogans or your voice gives out , here are some questions to ask your Senator or Representative if you are forced to actually have a conversation on the issues of health care .
1 . [ Senator / Representative ]
Please explain whether Obama 's plan would make us kill our grandmothers with poison or with a knife ?
2 . Was it three or four years that we would have to wait for a doctor in an emergency -- and will it be Pakistani or Iranian doctors we would get stuck with ?
3 . Should I get a fake ID that shows I am an illegal alien because they are the only ones who will get health care ?
And , if you are lucky enough to attend a town hall meeting hosted by Obama himself , ask him : 1 . Could you please tell me , Mr. Obama , just when did you stop beating your wife ?
The Post Times Sun Dispatch will provide more of this handbook as soon as we can decipher more of it :
The Dispatch 's only copy had a bullet hole where the owner accidentally shot himself in the pocket with the handbook still in it .

Major UK
Internet provider BT opened up yesterday on the discriminatory traffic throttling it applies to streaming online video under certain plans .
BT 's John Petter says that the " free ride " is over for popular streaming services like the BBC's iPlayer and that they need to pay up for " developing very profitable business models " by using BT 's pipes .
It all sounds depressingly familiar .
AT&T boss Ed Whitacre — the new head of General Motors — leveled the same charges at popular websites like Google back in 2005 :
How do you think [ websites ] are going to get to customers ?
Through a broadband pipe .
Cable companies have them .
We have them .
Now what they would like to do is use my pipes free , but I ain't going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it .
So there 's going to have to be some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion they 're using .
Why should they be allowed to use my pipes ?
AT&T never got around to charging websites for access to its customers , due in large part to a public outcry , the start of the " network neutrality " war , and interest from the Federal Communications Commission .
But the idea never died in the ISP community , and Petter now says " that the quid pro quo of payment from content owners might be guarantees of picture quality , " according to the Financial Times .
The argument here has evolved slightly since Whitacre first made it , and BT appears to be saying that high - bandwidth video streaming , in particular , is just too expensive to offer without limits on its cheapest plan .
That plan , called " Option 1 , " offers 10 GB / month of data transfer , imposes throttling on P2P connections during parts of the day , throttles anyone who 's a " heavy user , " and places a limit of 896 Kbps on video streaming services between 5 pm and midnight .
BT 's own " fair usage policy " spells all this out , which makes the discrimination legal in the UK .
But the policy justifies the bandwidth cap by saying , " We do not impose any restrictions that affect the viewing quality of services such as BBC iPlayer or Catch Up on Channel4.com or ITV.com , as these stream at up to 800 Kbps . "
This is patently untrue .
The iPlayer offers several different streaming levels , including one at 1.5 Mbps .
In April 2009 , the Beeb added a 3.2 M bps HD streaming option .
With HD streaming burning through 1.5GB / hour , though , Option 1 users can't watch for long without bumping up against their monthly cap .
Innovation impact
Such restrictions certainly have an impact on innovation , especially when they are implemented by the largest ISPs in a country .
After covering this issue last week and raising the question about whether a " company will try to launch a new HD streaming site , for instance , if it knows that several of the country 's largest ISPs will throttle the service during peak hours , " the founder of Highdefnow.com contacted us and said that this was his exact problem .
Kieran Kunhya said that throttling is n't as big a deal for established services and brands , but for startups like his , it can be killer .
" It 's different for smaller startups because the onus is on us to demonstrate that our product is good — i.e. , if the service is running slow [ customers ] will blame us for the poor service even though it might be ISP throttling ( or poor ISP connectivity ) .
Some of our users I 've spoken to have experienced throttling and do feel that it is us offering a poor service when in fact we have relatively large amounts of bandwidth ...
All in all this unlevels what was the level playing field of the Web , making it difficult to innovate . "
But BT says it 's losing millions by giving content owners " a completely free ride . "
Content owners pay big bandwidth bills for the privilege of putting their material on the Internet , though ; if BT does n't see those fees directly , that 's only because it " peers " ( exchanges traffic freely ) with other ISPs of similar size , a move that benefits BT just as much as the other party .
The UK allows such behavior from its ISPs in large part because of the more competitive landscape there .
The last - mile copper network is controlled by a company called OpenReach , which resells to every DSL provider who wants to buy access .
The end result has been that , instead of a duopoly commonly seen in the US , many UK residents have access to four , five , or six ISPs — and can go elsewhere if unhappy .
In a finding that sheds new light on the neural mechanisms involved in social behavior , neuroscientists at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) have pinpointed the brain structure responsible for our sense of personal space .
The discovery , described in the August 30 issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience , could offer insight into autism and other disorders where social distance is an issue .
The structure , the amygdala — a pair of almond - shaped regions located in the medial temporal lobes — was previously known to process strong negative emotions , such as anger and fear , and is considered the seat of emotion in the brain .
However , it had never been linked rigorously to real - life human social interaction .
The scientists , led by Ralph Adolphs , Bren Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience and professor of biology and postdoctoral scholar Daniel P. Kennedy , were able to make this link with the help of a unique patient , a 42 - year - old woman known as SM , who has extensive damage to the amygdala on both sides of her brain .
" SM is unique , because she is one of only a handful of individuals in the world with such a clear bilateral lesion of the amygdala , which gives us an opportunity to study the role of the amygdala in humans , " says Kennedy , the lead author of the new report .
SM has difficulty recognizing fear in the faces of others , and in judging the trustworthiness of someone , two consequences of amygdala lesions that Adolphs and colleagues published in prior studies .
advertisement
During his years of studying her , Adolphs also noticed that the very outgoing SM is almost too friendly , to the point of " violating " what others might perceive as their own personal space .
" She is extremely friendly , and she wants to approach people more than normal .
It 's something that immediately becomes apparent as you interact with her , " says Kennedy .
Previous studies of humans never had revealed an association between the amygdala and personal space .
From their knowledge of the literature , however , the researchers knew that monkeys with amygdala lesions preferred to stay in closer proximity to other monkeys and humans than did healthy monkeys .
Intrigued by SM 's unusual social behavior , Adolphs , Kennedy , and their colleagues devised a simple experiment to quantify and compare her sense of personal space with that of healthy volunteers .
The experiment used what is known as the stop - distance technique .
Briefly , the subject ( SM or one of 20 other volunteers , representing a cross-section of ages , ethnicities , educations , and genders ) stands a predetermined distance from an experimenter , then walks toward the experimenter and stops at the point where they feel most comfortable .
The chin - to - chin distance between the subject and the experimenter is determined with a digital laser measurer .
Among the 20 other subjects , the average preferred distance was .64 meters — roughly two feet .
SM 's preferred distance was just .34 meters , or about one foot .
Unlike other subjects , who reported feelings of discomfort when the experimenter went closer than their preferred distance , there was no point at which SM became uncomfortable ; even nose - to - nose , she was at ease .
Furthermore , her preferred distance did n't change based on who the experimenter was and how well she knew them .

" Respecting someone 's space is a critical aspect of human social interaction , and something we do automatically and effortlessly , " Kennedy says .
" These findings suggest that the amygdala , because it is necessary for the strong feelings of discomfort that help to repel people from one another , plays a central role in this process .
They also help to expand our understanding of the role of the amygdala in real - world social interactions . "
Adolphs and colleagues then used a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanner to examine the activation of the amygdala in a separate group of healthy subjects who were told when an experimenter was either in close proximity or far away from them .
When in the fMRI scanner , subjects could not see , feel , or hear the experimenter ; nevertheless , their amygdalae lit up when they believed the experimenter to be close by .
No activity was detected when subjects thought the experimenter was on the other side of the room .
" It was just the idea of another person being there , or not , that triggered the amygdala , " Kennedy says .
The study shows , he says , that " the amygdala is involved in regulating social distance , independent of the specific sensory cues that are typically present when someone is standing close , like sounds , sights , and smells . "
The researchers believe that interpersonal distance is not something we consciously think about , although , unlike SM , we become acutely aware when our space is violated .
Kennedy recounts his own experience with having his personal space violated during a wedding : " I felt really uncomfortable , and almost fell over a chair while backing up to get some space . "
Across cultures , accepted interpersonal distances can vary dramatically , with individuals who live in cultures where space is at a premium ( say , China or Japan ) seemingly tolerant of much closer distances than individuals in , say , the United States .
( Meanwhile , our preferred personal distance can vary depending on our situation , making us far more willing to accept less space in a crowded subway car than we would be at the office . )
One explanation for this variation , Kennedy says , is that cultural preferences and experiences affect the brain over time and how it responds in particular situations .
" If you 're in a culture where standing close to someone is the norm , you 'd learn that was acceptable and your personal space would vary accordingly , " he says .
" Even then , if you violate the accepted cultural distance , it will make people uncomfortable , and the amygdala will drive that feeling . "
The findings may have relevance to studies of autism , a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects an individual 's ability to interact socially and communicate with others .
" We are really interested in looking at personal space in people with autism , especially given findings of amygdala dysfunction in autism .
We know that some people with autism do have problems with personal space and have to be taught what it is and why it 's important , " Kennedy says .
He also adds a word of caution : " It 's clear that amygdala dysfunction cannot account for all the social impairments in autism , but likely contributes to some of them and is definitely something that needs to be studied further . "
The work was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health , the Simons Foundation , the Della Martin Foundation , and a global Center of Excellence grant from Japan .

Aspen is n't very flammable , making for a slow - burning , non-fingertip - singeing matchstick .
Potassium Dichromate
This strong oxidizer in the match head is highly combustible .
Diamond Brands , the sole US manufacturer of strike - anywhere matches , wo n't say what it does , preferring to keep the role of K 2 Cr 2 O 7 a secret .
Our bet :
It accelerates burn rate .
Potassium Chlorate
It 's a source of emergency air on planes , submarines , and spacecraft that releases oxygen when heated .
When mixed with wax , it makes a plastic explosive .
When mixed with sulfur , phosphorus , and the kind of heat you get from , say , friction , it 's very unstable .
Phosphorus Sesquisulfide
4 3 P 4 S 3 also ignites easily by friction .
It burns itself out instantly after the match is lit but generates enough heat to ignite the aspen shank .
Diamond released its patent for P 4 S 3 matches in 1911 so competitors could stop using an extremely dangerous alternative : white phosphorous .
MonoAmmonium Phosphate
A compound found in some dry chemical fire extinguishers , MAP melts at 374 degrees Fahrenheit .
Match makers soak the wood with a solution of this stuff to make sure that when you blow the match out , melted MAP smothers any afterglow .
Ground or Powdered Glass
First , it roughens the texture of the match head , helping to create friction wherever you strike it .
Second , it melts under fire but cools and fuses quickly when you blow the flame out , keeping ash from falling .

World motorsport 's governing body the FIA has ruled that F1 championship leader Jenson Button 's car is legal .
Button has won both races this season and there were complaints that his Brawn GP team and rivals Toyota and Williams used an illegal diffuser .
But following eight hours of strongly worded evidence the International Court of Appeal ruled that the cars " comply with the applicable regulations " .
All three teams are free to race in the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai .
" The decision comes as no great surprise , " said BBC Radio 5 Live Formula 1 commentator David Croft .
" Already this season two sets of stewards , an FIA president and an FIA race director have thought that the diffuser design of Brawn , Williams and Toyota was OK .
we had every confidence that the design of our car would be confirmed as legal
Toyota statement " It 's a sensible decision for Formula 1 .
The FIA 's court of appeal were highly unlikely , on technical grounds , to go against the decision of the stewards .
Seven teams are now playing catch up and have to do something about it very , very quickly . "
Brawn GP team boss Ross Brawn said in a statement following the verdict : " We respect the right of our competitors to query any design or concept used on our cars through the channels available to them .
" The FIA technical department , the stewards at the Australian and Malaysian Grands Prix and now five judges at the International Court of Appeal have confirmed our belief that our cars have always strictly complied with the 2009 technical regulations . "
Brawn GP currently lead the constructors ' world championship with 25 points , with Toyota in second place on 16 points .
A statement from the Japanese team said : " Our team studied the wording of the new 2009 regulations in precise detail to ensure we interpreted them correctly .
" We also made full use of the consultation procedure with the FIA which was a helpful process to ensure our interpretation of the technical regulations was correct .
WHAT IS A DIFFUSER ?
It is the rear part of the floor of the car between the rear wheels and under the rear wing
It is crucial to the aerodynamics , and small changes can have a big impact on downforce - and therefore grip and speed " Therefore we had every confidence that the design of our car would be confirmed as legal , firstly by race stewards in Australia and Malaysia and subsequently by the Court of Appeal . "
Williams chief executive Adam Parr admitted his relief at the outcome and predicted the rival teams would install rear diffusers " within days " .
BMW motorsport director Mario Theissen said the team would accept the decision but did n't consider it fully legitimate .
In a statement Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali added : " We are waiting to hear the reasons the ICA rejected the appeal .
" Unfortunately this decision forces us to intervene on fundamental areas of the car 's design in order to be able to compete on an equal footing with some of the teams from a point of view of the technical regulations , and that will take time and money .
" We will now double our efforts to get the team back to the highest level of competitivity . "
The judges in Paris heard evidence from both sides , with Ferrari 's legal representative , Nigel Tozzi QC , describing Brawn GP team boss Ross Brawn as " a person of supreme arrogance " .
Brawn defended himself robustly and insisted his team 's diffuser was simply " an innovative approach of an existing idea " .

And Brawn 's criticism of Ferrari consultant Rory Bryne and Red Bull technical guru Adrian Newey saw sparks fly in the courtroom , with the Englishman refusing to retract his statements .
FIA technical director Charlie Whiting was also grilled , with accusations his organisation are " getting it wrong , and not understanding the point " .
The row broke out when Ferrari , Renault and Red Bull protested against the legality of the split - level diffusers on the eve of the season - opening grand prix in Australia , but race stewards in Melbourne rejected their claims .
BMW Sauber then had a similar protest rejected at the Malaysian Grand Prix while McLaren have recently added their weight to the official protest .
Speaking from outside FIA headquarters in Paris on Tuesday , BBC sports news reporter Joe Wilson said : " Rear diffusers this season were supposed to get smaller , but Brawn and a couple of other teams have ended up with bigger ones , exploiting a little loophole in the laws . "
The protesting teams said the split - level design contravenes a rule that states the diffuser - an aerodynamic body part which aids performance - must have an upper edge that runs in a horizontal straight line ..
606 : DEBATE
Teams like Ferrari , MM and Renault will all get new diffusers at some point - the question is when ?
ColchesterPaul
They also believed the design is negating the main aim of this season 's new rule changes , which is to make overtaking easier
The split - level diffusers generate more downforce at the rear of the car , resulting in a clear performance advantage of around 0.5 seconds per lap .
With the FIA 's ruling , the seven teams who are running without the split - level diffusers are expected to try to incorporate the design into their cars as soon as possible .
But setting about such a radical redesign with the season under way will not be easy .
Many of the teams running with regular diffusers argue the cost of making the changes is too great , especially during a climate of cost - cutting within the sport in the face of the global economic crisis .
" I 've heard several of them complaining about the cost , " said Brawn before the verdict .
" But there are lots of things teams copy from each other and the cost does n't get debated .
" I think some teams will be able to do it very quickly , but for other teams it will be more difficult because of their suspension configuration or other elements of the car . "

Get ready to hear these a lot on the cable news next month : Republican Minority Leader John Boehner issued his members their August Recess Talking Points .
They 're a little familiar , and a lot dishonest .
First : health care .
Boehner gave everyone a copy of the hilarious chart that 's already been presented as an actual piece of policy analysis on Fox News .
Everyone already had a copy of the chart of course , but you can never be too careful .
What we love about the GOP's " Scary Democratic Health Care Reform is Scary and Complicated : The Home Game " chart is not that it 's inaccurate ( it pretends there is one " House Democrats ' Health Care Plan " when there are like four of them being worked out simultaneously , which is why there has n't been a vote yet ) or ill - advised ( the current health care system is just as complicated and much worse for everyone ) , it 's that it is not even that scary - complicated .
Look , the big gray bar goes directly from " Health Care Providers " to " Health Insurance Exchange " to " Consumers . "
How hard is that ?
All the other agencies and arrows and words and colors are kinda extraneous .
This looks like a fine plan to us !
But here is the line your local Republican congressman will use :
" During a recession that has seen the loss of 6.5 million jobs , Democrats propose a government takeover of health care that will lead to increased costs , fewer jobs , higher taxes and less health coverage , " according to the GOP talking points .
Right .
6.5 million jobs have been lost , but " a government takeover of health care " will lead to " less health coverage " ?
We do n't think they understand how things work !
Oh , but that is not all !
Did you know that Barack Obama wants to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and bus the terrorists to your child 's school ?
" To fulfill a campaign promise , President Obama ordered that the detention facility be closed , " one bullet in the packet said .
" Now the President has missed the deadline he promised the American people for a plan to relocate the detainees and has kicked the deadline down the road . "
Republican leaders , in another bullet , raise the question : " The more than 200 terrorists left at Guantanamo Bay represent the worst of the worst .
How will closing Guantanamo make us safer ? "
Here is what we love about those two talking points : they are criticizing Obama for missing the deadline to close Guantanamo , like he promised he'd do , and they are outraged and shocked that he wants to close Guantanamo .
But yes , you will hear some of these sentences word - for - word on the news , over and over again , in the coming month .
So enjoy .
YoGen : Efficient Human - Powered Cell and Laptop Chargers
Our culture is rapidly becoming a mobile one , with virtually every other person carrying a cell or smartphone , plus maybe a digital camera , an iPod , or a laptop in the backpack , all of which operate on battery power .
So what do you do when you need more juice than your battery will hold ?
Find an outlet and hope you have your charger with you ?
Pretty soon , you ’ll be able to pull out your human - powered charger and continue with your phone call , take more pictures , or finish your email without having to find that plug or carry your adapter with you .
The YoGen charger , by Easy Energy , is a pocket - sized , hand - powered charger that operates by repeatedly pulling a cord ( similar to a lawnmower starter ) to offer enough electrical generation to power or charge a cell phone or other portable electronics .
The YoGen is built with a high efficiency alternator that turns the kinetic motion from the spinning flywheel into electrical output for charging or operating small gadgets .
It comes in two versions , one a straight generator , and the other with a 650 mAh 3.7V battery for backup .
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXwGXnM72eg
Easy Energy also developed the YoGen Max , a foldable , treadle - type charger for laptops and other portables needing a 50 - 60 W power supply .
The Max folds up to a book - sized package that will travel easily and provide power on the go .
When your battery meter is low and you still need to work ( or play ) , unfold the YoGen Max , plug in to your laptop , and press repeatedly on the spring - loaded pedal .
The device is adjustable to the proper output for your machine , and an optional bank of rechargeable AA batteries can bridge any foot fatigue that may happen during extended usage .
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYnnX-aAj5o
The latest product being developed by Easy Energy is the YoGen Bat : a rechargeable battery that works just like the YoGen , but is installed in the device instead of being an external charger .
I think the YoGen Bat is going to be a big hit once it ’s fully developed , but I ’m laughing to myself as I imagine all the cell users yanking the cord to charge their batteries , while trying to continue the conversation .
Right now , Easy Energy is only taking orders for the YoGen series from wholesalers and distributors , but if that ’s you , you can get more information from the company ’s site .

The de facto president of Honduras , Micheletti , entered the Presidential Palace on Monday , not through the main doorway but through the rooftop , with the aid of a military helicopter .
He came in the way robbers do .
The loot was democracy .
It was stolen from Honduras this weekend .
Rightwing business and ranching interests , together with the military , took advantage of a referendum called by the legitimate president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , in order to justify what they had longed for , for some time : the re-taking of absolute power .
The justification for kidnapping a leader , humiliating him and sending him into exile , the justification for going after the officials of an elected government and for re-militarizing Honduras is disproportionate .
Calling a referendum is not an attempt on democracy , as the Honduran putschists maintain .
This referendum was a simple opinion poll , without a binding character .
It was no kind of threat to the state of law .
Nor did it imply a departure from the Constitution : rather , it left open the possibility that Honduran citizens might consider whether it would be pertinent to hold a vote at the end of the year about whether or not to convene a constitutional assembly .
If the rightwing had cared to act in a democratic manner , it could have questioned Zelaya 's poll through legal means .
But there 's nothing legal about this .
To speak of a referendum , for the Honduran rightwing , is to speak of the ghost that stalks the nightmares of the Latin American oligarchy : Chávez , just like Castro before him .
A perversely elemental kind of logic : Referendum = Chávez , just as Micheletti's accusation , made when he was still head of the Honduran congress , was perversely elemental .
Micheletti said that Zelaya 's referendum would lead to parental rights being put in the hands of the State .
To paraphrase a certain fascist , we might put the following words in the mouths of Micheletti and the Honduran putschists : " When I hear the word referendum , I feel like reaching for my gun . "
As is plainly obvious , the justifications are weak , but it's a well - known fact that Latin American putschists have relied more on the argument of weapons than the weapon of argument .
Zelaya 's crime was to start from a conservative position and then lurch to the left , and through these lurches , arrive at a position beyond the traditional left .
Zelaya 's crimes against the constitution and the laws of Honduras were , among others , joining ALBA , confronting rightwing business on the subject of corruption , approving social measures , encouraging literacy programs and medical cooperation with Cuba .
Of course all of this carries a high price .
The interesting thing in this case is that this coup is taking place in a international arena distinct from the military uprisings of prior decades , behind which was the commanding voice of a Kissinger or other similar puppeteer .
Obama 's government has refused to recognize the putschists .
The scene in Central America is also different , considering that in the past , any kind of military usurper would have felt himself in good company .
What will Micheletti say if he sticks his head out at the SICA ( Central American Integration System ) under the reproving stares of Funes , Colom , Ortega and Arias , as well as Zelaya himself ?
We 'll see if the Central American and Latin American community of nations will have the same ability to influence a situation where constitutional order has been broken , such as UNASUR did in facing the separatist oligarchs in Bolivia .
This will be important in order to avoid the putschists ' consolidation of power and in preventing them from continuing to punish those who oppose them , such as has happened with the cartoonist Allan McDonald , kidnapped by the military from his house as I was finishing writing this piece .
The home of the artist , who continues in the best rebellious tradition of Latin American caricature , was ransacked by the military .
His work has been published in Honduran media and in Rebelión , and can also be seen at his website : http://www.allanmcdonald.com .
Just as in Nazi times , his drawings were thrown on a bonfire .
McDonald was kidnapped , it must be added , with his daughter , a 17 month old .
McDonald 's case may be being repeated every minute in Honduras , with citizens of the widest variety of occupations : Terror has returned .
These violations must cease immediately .
Micheletti and his accomplices have wanted to hide the obvious : they came in through the roof and are destroying everything .
It 's the same rapacious oligarchy that for forty years - just like the Salvadoran military and oligarchy - has exacerbated the worst sentiments with the poison of nationalism , sowing enmity between the two people who amount to more than they want to acknowledge .
But now , neither Salvadoran nor Honduran society is willing to die or to kill in order to defend the interests of these oligarchies .
And from there comes the necessity to resort to force , in contravention of all logic , legal imperatives , and even the international community .
It 's the desperate measure of a dead man walking who wants to drag everyone down with him .
For the past three centuries , humans ’ effects on their environment have escalated .
Most importantly , our carbon emissions may cause global climate patterns to depart from their natural course for many millennia to come .
As a result , scientists and engineers face a daunting task during the Anthropocene era : to guide us towards environmentally sustainable management .
Anzeige
It seems appropriate to assign the term “ Anthropocene ” to the current , in many ways human - dominated , geological epoch , supplementing the Holocene – the warm period of the past 10 – 12 millennia .
The Anthropocene Period could be said to have started in the latter part of the eighteenth century , when analyses of air trapped in polar ice showed the beginning of growing global concentrations of CO2 and methane .
This date also happens to coincide with James Watt ’s design of the steam engine in 1784 .
Mankind ’s growing influence on the environment was recognized as long ago as 1873 , when the Italian geologist Antonio Stoppani referred to the “ anthropozoic era , ” defined by a “ new telluric force , which in power and universality may be compared to the greater forces of earth . ”
In 1926 , V. I . Vernadsky similarly acknowledged the increasing impact of mankind on “ [t ] he direction in which the processes of evolution must proceed , namely towards increasing consciousness and thought , and forms having greater and greater influence on their surroundings . ”
Vernadsky and Teilhard de Chardin used the term “ noösphere ” – the world of thought – to mark the growing role of human brain - power in shaping its own future and environment .
Anzeige
Humans ’ rapid expansion in terms of population and per capita use of Earth ’s resources has continued apace .
During the past three centuries , the human population has increased ten - fold , to more than six billion , and is expected to reach 10 billion in this century .
As a result , 30 – 50 % of the planet ’s land surface is now exploited by humans .
At the same time , the methane - producing cattle population has risen to 1.4 billion , contributing to the increasing rate of destruction of tropical rainforests , which releases carbon dioxide and contributes to faster species extinction .
Land conversion for grazing ( and construction ) , together with crop tillage , has also caused soil erosion at 15 times its natural rate .
Indeed , at its current pace , anthropogenic soil erosion would fill the Grand Canyon in 50 years .
Similarly , dam building and river diversion have become commonplace , as humans ’ water consumption has risen nine - fold over the past century , to the point that mankind now uses more than half of all accessible fresh water – roughly two - thirds of it for agriculture .
Fisheries remove more than 25 % of the primary production in upwelling ocean regions and 35 % in the temperate continental shelf .
Anzeige
Moreover , energy use has grown 16 - fold during the twentieth century , causing 160 million tons of atmospheric sulfur - dioxide emissions per year – more than twice the total of natural emissions .
Likewise , more nitrogen fertilizer is applied in agriculture than is fixed naturally in all terrestrial ecosystems , and nitric - oxide production from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass also surpasses natural emissions .
At the same time , of course , human consumption of fossil fuels , together with our agricultural activities , have caused substantial increases in concentrations of “ greenhouse ” gases – CO2 by 30 % and methane by more than 100 % .
Indeed , these concentrations are higher than at any point in the past 400 millennia , with more growth to follow , because so far these effects have largely been caused by only 25 % of the world population .
The consequences are numerous and profound : acid precipitation , photochemical “ smog ” and global warming , among others .
Hence , according to the latest estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , Earth will warm by 1.4–5.8 °C during this century .
Many toxic substances are released into the environment , even some that are not toxic but nonetheless are highly damaging – for example , the chlorofluorocarbons that caused the Antarctic ozone hole ( and which are now regulated ) .
Anzeige
Things could have become much worse : the ozone - destroying properties of halogens have been studied since the mid-1970’s .
If it had turned out that chlorine behaved chemically like bromine , the ozone hole would by then have been a global , year - round phenomenon , not just an event of the Antarctic spring .
More by luck than by wisdom , this catastrophic situation did not develop .
Unless there is a global catastrophe – a meteorite impact , a world war , or a pandemic – mankind will remain a major environmental force for many millennia .
As a result , scientists and engineers face a daunting task during the Anthropocene era : to guide us towards environmentally sustainable management .
This will require appropriate human behavior at all levels , and may well involve internationally accepted , large - scale geo-engineering projects to “ optimize ” climate .
At this stage , however , we are still largely treading on terra incognita .
Back to English News homepage
Provincetown , a port that once serviced the whaling industry of New England , sits at the tip of Cape Cod on the eastern seaboard of the United States .
The philosopher Henry David Thoreau called it a place where " a man might stand and put all America behind him " .
But its history is not exactly peaceful .
In the 19th century , hundreds of ships left here to slaughter thousands of whales around the globe .
Now , ironically , it is one of the best places in the world from which to go whalewatching - a vivid reminder of how quickly we have moved from seeing whales as a resource to be consumed to a natural wonder to be conserved .
I first came to Provincetown in 2001 , but it was only on the last day of my visit that I took a whalewatch trip .
As a boy I 'd been fascinated by whales , but that fascination had lain dormant for years .
It was about to be powerfully re-invoked .
As we sailed out of Provincetown harbour , we left the calm protected waters , passing breakwaters colonised by cormorants and lounging seals .
A series of lighthouses , icons of Cape Cod , signalled that we were entering the open ocean .
I do n't know what I expected to see that day .
My only previous experience of living cetaceans ( the collective name for whales and dolphins is cetacea , Greek for sea monsters ) was of captive animals , a distinctly depressing sight .
A tame orca in an overgrown swimming pool in Windsor safari park ; performing dolphins in Brighton 's underground car park of an aquarium ; a pair of blemished and pathetic beluga in a tank on Coney Island .
Guilt dominated those visits .
What I saw in the Atlantic that afternoon overturned my pessimism about humanity 's interaction with whales .
In the distance , we saw seabirds circling - a good indication of whales ahead .
The next came from the animals themselves : distant blows , breaking the horizon like individual clouds , as if their creators were carrying their own weather with them .
Experts can identify cetacean species merely from the shape of such airy semaphores ( a whale 's blow is not sea water but condensed breath , much as you see your breath on a frosty morning ) .
A fin whale shoots a tall column in the air ; a right whale sends a v-shaped spout from its twin nostrils ; a sperm whale 's blow is sharply cantered to the left , from a single nostril .
Such signs were once advertisements to whale hunters .
Now they announce an imminent miracle : the bushy blows we could see were those of humpback whales .
One of nature 's greatest displays
In Moby - Dick , Herman Melville calls humpbacks " the most gamesome and light - hearted of all the whales " .
Other whales betray little of themselves at the surface .
Lay in wait for a minke - one of the smaller baleen whales ( even though an adult is bigger than a London bus ) , and the most you are likely to see is a sharp - pointed snout ( hence its Latin name , Balaenoptera acutorostrata ) , followed by a disappearing back .
Equally , the fin back , Balaenoptera physalus - at a maximum of 26 m ( 85 ft ) , second only to the blue whale in size - is , for all its vastness , just as elusive , allowing a glimpse of barely a tenth of its body .
You must simply imagine , as this great creature speeds by at 20 knots or more - earning its nickname , the greyhound of the sea - the vast , streamlined torpedo that lies below .
The humpback is a different prospect .
Its Latin name , Megaptera novaeangliae , translates as " big- winged New Englander " .
And in a few moments , I was to discover exactly why .
As we came upon the feeding whales , surmounted by flurries of opportunistic gulls , we saw distinctive grey - green patches rising through the water .
For any whalewatcher , this is the most immediate intimation .
In a unique technique , humpbacks blow precisely calibrated streams of bubbles to create underwater nets around their prey - tiny sand - eels .
In these fertile waters , schools of millions of sand - eels can stretch over areas the size of playing fields .
They provide the main source of food for humpbacks ; an adult whale will eat a tonne of fish a day to sustain its vast bulk .
As I watched the spiralling bubbles rise to the surface , the excitement was intense .
Even our naturalist 's voice went up an octave as he told us what we were about to see .
Suddenly , the surface broke with the yawning , gaping mouth of a monster .
The whale had appeared right beside the boat , gulping hundreds of gallons of seawater .
I was peering into the jaws of the leviathan .
I could see sand - eels leaping out of the animal 's mouth in a vain attempt to escape .
Using its baleen - the fibrous plates that line its upper jaw instead of teeth - the whale was catching fish like pasta in a strainer .
I could even smell its breath - pretty bad , if you 're wondering - and as it dived again to repeat the process , the spray from its blow hit my face .
It felt like a kind of baptism .
Watching humpbacks bubble - feed is one of nature 's greatest displays .
I have seen it many times now , but it never fails to amaze .
On one research trip with Dennis Minsky from the Provincetown Centre for Coastal Studies , we were surrounded by whales in every direction , more than 100 humpbacks feeding en masse .
Minsky just put down his camera and clipboard and gaped in astonishment .
The forest of blows and their elephantine trumpets seemed to celebrate a lost Eden ; a vision of a time before man had made his irrevocable mark on their world .
But humpbacks have something even more spectacular in their repertoire .
Breaching is another of the whalish mysteries , a phenomenon observed by the ancient Greeks , yet unexplained by modern scientists .
And nothing prepares you for the sight .
That first trip , as I stood at the prow , without warning a 50 ft , 50 - tonne humpback launched itself entirely out of the water .
For a split second the animal appeared like some vast and improbable whale - angel against the sky , its huge , gnarled flippers outstretched like wings .
Every detail was visible .
I saw its great ribbed belly , the rorqual pleats that expand when feeding .
I saw the barnacles on its skin , the parasites that hold fast to the animal , making it a travelling colony of its own .
Then , as if someone had taken their finger off the pause button , the animal bowed to gravity and fell back into the sea , creating a splash that resounded for miles .
Forgetting that I was surrounded by schoolchildren , I blurted out an inadvertent , " Fuck ! "
Hardly an erudite response , but I challenge anyone to be indifferent to a close encounter with a whale .
I have seen grown men cry at their first sight of a cetacean .
They simply exist in another universe ; aliens occupying vast oceans of which we have less knowledge than we do of the surface of the moon .
To see a whale is a privilege .
But it can also become an obsession .
This spring , I succeeded in a long - held ambition : to watch right whales from the shore .
Each year , these rotund , blubbery whales - so - called because they were the right whales to hunt , since they floated when dead - assemble in Cape Cod Bay .
The North Atlantic right whale ( Eubalaena glacialis ) is one of the most endangered animals on earth ; fewer than 400 individuals remain .
Yet if you are lucky , you can see these magical creatures just tens of feet from the cape 's outer shores .
The most mysterious of all whales
As I trekked out to a remote strand , a curtain of gulls rose to reveal a group of whales so close I could almost have waded out to them .
A glorious welter of black fins and flukes , they were interacting with paradoxical sensitivity , ignorant of my presence , or of the sole harbour seal that stayed at the edge of the surf , as if reluctant to share the waves with these cavorting behemoths .
I almost felt I was intruding .
My experiences in Cape Cod were extraordinary , but as a confirmed whalehead , I was now eager to see other species .
In the summer of 2007 , along with the crew of the BBC Arena film , The Hunt for Moby - Dick , I travelled to the Azores .
There I came closer to whales than I have ever done before .
One thousand miles due west of Lisbon , the Azorean archipelago lies in the middle of the Atlantic , caught between three tectonic plates and surrounded by some of the deepest seas in the world .
Only 100 m out , its volcanic shores plunge to a mile in depth - then descend even deeper to the abyssal plain .
These waters are a perfect environment for the most mysterious of all whales .
Sperm whales were prized by hunters for their oil ; it burned clear and smokeless in lamps and made pure white candles .
For more than a century , sperm whales lit and lubricated the industrial revolution .
As a result , their numbers were drastically reduced from three million to a tenth of that number ; a toll exacerbated by the mechanised hunting carried on in the 20th century by Britain , Norway , Japan and the former Soviet Union .
Even the Azores had their own whale - hunt , using methods learned from the Yankee whalers , which ended only in 1986 .
Ominous stone slopes still mark whaling factories were whales were hauled out of the depths and ground down into fertilizer .
Now islands such as Faial and Pico have turned to watching , rather than hunting .
Zooming out of Lajes harbour on a rib ( rigid inflatable boat ) , we sped into the deep blue Atlantic , common dolphin riding our bow like competitive racers , gloriously streamlined .
They were a good sign .
Ahead , we saw blows - but utterly unlike any I 'd ever seen before .
Distinctly right - angled , they came from what looked like logs lying in the water .
As João , our captain , cut the engine and the boat bobbed to a halt , the shapes resolved themselves into animate objects .
Grey heads rose out of the waves , blunt and almost cartoon - like .
It was difficult to tell which end of the animals was which until their massive flukes drew up and dived in a choreographed departure .
For such gigantic creatures , they left no whirling vortex behind , only a calm circle of spinning water .
The Inuit believe these qaala , as they call them , to be mirrors into the whale 's soul ; and mirrors into ours .
As the whales dived , our first mate , Marco , lowered a hydrophone over the side .
We listened to the clicks of the animals hunting squid , hundreds of feet below .
As we waited for the whales to reappear , alerted by their eerie morse code , I felt a certain anxiety .
The Azorean government had given me permission to get into the water with the whales - something I had dreamed of all my life .
But when the moment came , there was barely any time to think about what I was doing .
As we approached a school of 12 sperm whales , João urged me into the water .
I jammed on my fins and pulled on my snorkel and mask .
Visibility was about 20ft ahead as I swam , unseeing , towards the whales .
Suddenly they were there , filling the entirety of my vision , lying peacefully in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the water .
Then , as if in slow - motion , one large animal detached itself from the group , and moved towards me .
For seconds that seemed like hours , I thought its great granite head was about to collide with me - or , perhaps , open its jaws and swallow me whole .
Sperm whales are the only cetaceans which could swallow human beings , and have done so .
Instead I felt , rather than heard , the animal 's echolocation focusing on my puny body .
Its sonar was scanning my skeleton like an MRI , recreating an image of me in its head , diagnosing me inedible .
I think it is the silence of the encounter that stays with me .
That , and the utter placidity of the huge animal .
Silhouetted against the blue , the whale turned and looked at me , eye to eye .
It was the most disconcerting moment of my life .
Then it dived , perpendicularly into the profound blackness , and was gone .
That night , I could n't close my eyes .
Every time I did , the whale swam into my head .
It has yet to leave my dreams .

This sign , outside of Constance Bay near Ottawa , was designed with a grid of six boxes with symbols indicating the town 's attractions for passers by .
The problem is there were only five noteworthy things for the sign — leaving a perfect opportunity for an anonymous graffiti artist .
Town leaders realized something was wrong when traffic to the local pet store , Chetsteron 's Cat House , suddenly increased .

A Japanese gaming blog compared some screenshots that were released in August 2008 to the new screenshots from June 2009 .
There have been some visual upgrades and downgrades as you can see from the screenshots Square Enix released for Final Fantasy XIII
As you can see the face , hair , background is changed a lot here .
Even hair color changes are made .
Wondering what was wrong with red hair ?
Square - Enix has also released 18 new high resolution screenshots today which you can find below .
Additionally , for those who have missed the awesome extended trailer from E3 , you can view it once again below as well .

New from Loreal : Hydra Energetic Turbo Booster moisturizer .
Itâ€™s moisturizer , but for MEN ( as if you couldnâ€™t already tell ) !
Yeah , you heard right !
Hydra Energetic !
Not just merely hydrating , weâ€™re talking several mythological heads of moisture - embedding manliness !
In TURBO !
This is a moisturizer so energetic and masculine , the effect of applying it is like furiously masturbating while sprinting through a girlâ€™s college dorm wearing an antique diverâ€™s suit filled with lager !
Hell yes indeed , itâ€™s moisturizer .
For your man face .
Not a performance enhancing device for your car , though you may be forgiven for thinking otherwise .
And with a name like Hydra Energetic Turbo Booster , what appearance conscious male could resist ?
It seems acceptable to buy an effeminate and vain beauty product if itâ€™s got a ludicrously overblown name like an engine part for a Ferrari .
If there was a new male eyeliner ( itâ€™s known as â€œguylinerâ€ , apparently ) in the shops called Bastard V8 Musclepencil or something , Iâ€™m sure truckloads of them would sell , for a while anyway .
To be fair , for all I know this product might do exactly what it says on the tin .
That is to say , once you get past all the meaningless hyper - bumpf , it actually moisturizes your skin .
In essence , what Loreal are selling you is some liquid chemical that you rub on your face in the vain hope that itâ€™ll make you more attractive to women and at a retail price of $ 13.25 for a 50 ml bottle is probably more expensive than gold .
But , it is Turbo and everything , so thatâ€™s ok .
Basically , itâ€™s simple business expediency : a product that mainly sells to one audience is pitched to a new market by simply changing the packaging and advertising campaign .
The product is not new , but you can dress it up to look new and give it a manlier scent ( if that ’s not an oxymoron ) and colour .
Your average man on the street usually wouldnâ€™t dream of buying a â€œfemale moisturizerâ€ , but as long as itâ€™s got words like â€œturboâ€  and â€œenergeticâ€  on it , heâ€™ll fork out for the exact same product .
Itâ€™s rather like how those tiresome teenage emo / goth / nu-metal types â€œhateâ€ pop music and refuse to listen to it , yet will gladly and enthusiastically consume the very same garbage as long as itâ€™s played with angsty guitars and impotent shouting and wailing over it like a transsexual whoâ€™s just been mugged .
You can apply this uniquely modern ailment to almost anything – food , clothes , books , movies , even people ( see Obama , hipsters etc ) .
The challenge we face everyday in our society is to get past all the nonsense and see what actually lies behind .
That way you can ignore all the useless stuff that tempts you with surface gimmickry but has no real substance , saving yourself a lot of money and more importantly , time .
In a world like ours itâ€™s an essential life skill to be able to sniff out bullshit and scams like man moisturizer , Apple products and voting for â€œchangeâ€ .
Anyway , next week Iâ€™ll be reviewing the new range of Scud Destroyer desert camouflage menâ€™s handbags exclusively designed by ex-SAS hardman Andy McNab .
I canâ€™t wait !

Nmap 5.00 Released
July 16 , 2009 -- Insecure .
Org is pleased to announce the immediate , free availability of the Nmap Security Scanner version 5.00 from http://nmap.org/.
This is the first stable release since 4.76 ( last September ) , and the first major release since the 4.50 release in 2007 .
Dozens of development releases led up to this .
Considering all the changes , we consider this the most important Nmap release since 1997 , and we recommend that all current users upgrade .
About Nmap
Nmap ( " Network Mapper " ) is a free and open source ( license ) utility for network exploration or security auditing .
Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory , managing service upgrade schedules , and monitoring host or service uptime .
Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network , what services ( application name and version ) those hosts are offering , what operating systems ( and OS versions ) they are running , what type of packet filters / firewalls are in use , and dozens of other characteristics .
It was designed to rapidly scan large networks , but works fine against single hosts .
Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems , and official binary packages are available for Linux , Windows , and Mac OS X .
In addition to the classic command - line Nmap executable , the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer ( Zenmap ) , a flexible data transfer , redirection , and debugging tool ( Ncat ) , and a utility for comparing scan results ( Ndiff ) .
Nmap was named “ Security Product of the Year ” by Linux Journal , Info World , LinuxQuestions .
Org , and Codetalker Digest .
It was even featured in eight movies , including The Matrix Reloaded , Die Hard 4 , and The Bourne Ultimatum .
As free software , we do n't have any sort of advertising budget .
So please spread the word that Nmap 5.00 is now available !
Top 5 Improvements in Nmap 5
Before we go into the detailed changes , here are the top 5 improvements in Nmap 5 :
The new Ncat tool aims to be your Swiss Army Knife for data transfer , redirection , and debugging .
We released a whole users ' guide detailing security testing and network administration tasks made easy with Ncat .
The addition of the Ndiff scan comparison tool completes Nmap 's growth into a whole suite of applications which work together to serve network administrators and security practitioners .
Ndiff makes it easy to automatically scan your network daily and report on any changes ( systems coming up or going down or changes to the software services they are running ) .
The other two tools now packaged with Nmap itself are Ncat and the much improved Zenmap GUI and results viewer .
Nmap performance has improved dramatically .
We spent last summer scanning much of the Internet and merging that data with internal enterprise scan logs to determine the most commonly open ports .
This allows Nmap to scan fewer ports by default while finding more open ports .
We also added a fixed - rate scan engine so you can bypass Nmap 's congestion control algorithms and scan at exactly the rate ( packets per second ) you specify .
We released Nmap Network Scanning , the official Nmap guide to network discovery and security scanning .
From explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing low - level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers , this book suits all levels of security and networking professionals .
A 42 - page reference guide documents every Nmap feature and option , while the rest of the book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve real - world tasks .
More than half the book is available in the free online edition .
The Nmap Scripting Engine ( NSE ) is one of Nmap 's most powerful and flexible features .
It allows users to write ( and share ) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks .
Those scripts are then executed in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap .
All existing scripts have been improved , and 32 new ones added .
New scripts include a whole bunch of MSRPC / NetBIOS attacks , queries , and vulnerability probes ; open proxy detection ; whois and AS number lookup queries ; brute force attack scripts against the SNMP and POP3 protocols ; and many more .
All NSE scripts and modules are described in the new NSE documentation portal .

Change details
The Nmap Changelog describes nearly 600 significant improvements since our last major release ( 4.50 ) .
Here are the highlights :
Nmap Scripting Engine ( NSE )
The Nmap Scripting Engine ( NSE ) is one of Nmap 's most powerful and flexible features .
It allows users to write ( and share ) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks .
Those scripts are then executed in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap .
It existed in Nmap 4.50 , but has been dramatically improved :
Zenmap graphical front - end and results viewer
Zenmap is a cross-platform ( Linux , Windows , Mac OS X , etc. ) Nmap GUI and results viewer which supports all Nmap options .
It aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while providing advanced features for experienced Nmap users .
Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles to make them easy to run repeatedly .
A command creator allows interactive creation of Nmap command lines .
Scan results can be saved and viewed later .
Saved scan results can be compared with one another to see how they differ .
The results of recent scans are stored in a searchable database .
While Zenmap already existed in Nmap 4.50 , it has improved dramatically since then :
While Nmap stands for “ Network Mapper ” , it has n't been able to actually draw you a map of the network — until now !
The new Zenmap Network Topology feature provides an interactive , animated visualization of the hosts on a network and connections between them .
The scan source is ( initially ) in the center , with other hosts on a series of concentric circles which represent the number of hops away they are from the source .
Nodes are connected by lines representing discovered paths between them .
Read the full details ( and oogle the pretty pictures ) in our article on Surfing the Network Topology .
Topology views can be saved as a PNG , postscript , PDF , or SVG image .
The scan aggregation feature allows you to combine the results of many Nmap scans into one view .
When one scan is finished , you may start another in the same window .
Results of the new scan are seamlessly merged into one view .
Zenmap has been internationalized and translated by volunteers into four languages ( French , German , Brazilian Portuguese , and Croatian ) .
We have instructions on using an existing translation and we 're always looking for volunteers to translate Zenmap into your native language .
Overhauled the default list of scan profiles to provide a much more diverse and useful set of default profile options .
If users do n't like any of these canned scan commands , they can easily create their own in the Profile Editor .
Added a context - sensitive help system to the Profile Editor .
Mouse - over options to learn more about what they do and their argument syntax .
Added advanced search functionality to Zenmap so that you can locate previous scans using criteria such as which ports were open , keywords in the target names , OS detection results , etc .
Try it out with Ctrl - F or " Tools - > Search Scan Results " .
The “ Compare Results ” feature now uses our new Ndiff scan comparison tool .
And more :
An animated throbber has been added to indicate that a scan is running , and a new cancel button lets you stop a scan in its track .
The Nmap output window now scrolls automatically , and ports are colored based on open / closed state .
David wrote an exceptional users ' guide , which also became a chapter of Nmap Network Scanning .
Ncat data transfer , redirection , and debugging tool
. . \` -" ' " -'/ } 6 6 { ==. Y , == /^^^\ . / \ ) ( ) -( ) / _ -" "---" "--- / / Ncat \_/ ( ____ \_.=|____E
Nmap 5 introduces Ncat , a general - purpose command - line tool for reading , writing , redirecting , and encrypting data across a network .
It aims to be your network Swiss Army knife , handling a wide variety of security testing and administration tasks .
Ncat is suitable for interactive use or as a network - connected back end for other tools .
Ncat can :
Act as a simple TCP / UDP / SSL client for interacting with web servers , telnet servers , mail servers , and other TCP / IP network services .
Often the best way to understand a service ( for fixing problems , finding security flaws , or testing custom commands ) is to interact with it using Ncat .
This lets you you control every character sent and view the raw , unfiltered responses .
Act as a simple TCP / UDP / SSL server for offering services to clients , or simply to understand what existing clients are up to by capturing every byte they send .
Redirect or proxy TCP / UDP traffic to other ports or hosts .
This can be done using simple redirection ( everything sent to a port is automatically relayed somewhere else you specify in advance ) or by acting as a SOCKS or HTTP proxy so clients specify their own destinations .
In client mode , Ncat can connect to destinations through a chain of anonymous or authenticated proxies .
Run on all major operating systems .
We distribute Linux , Windows , and Mac OS X binaries , and Ncat compiles on most other systems .
A trusted tool must be available whenever you need it , no matter what computer you 're using .
Encrypt communication with SSL , and transport it over IP v4 or IPv6 .
Act as a network gateway for execution of system commands , with I /O redirected to the network .
It was designed to work like the Unix utility cat , but for the network .
Act as a connection broker , allowing two ( or far more ) clients to connect to each other through a third ( brokering ) server .
This enables multiple machines hidden behind NAT gateways to communicate with each other , and also enables the simple Ncat chat mode .
These capabilities become even more powerful and versatile when combined .
Ncat is our modern reinvention of the venerable Netcat ( nc ) tool released by Hobbit in 1996 .
While Ncat is similar to Netcat in spirit , they do n't share any source code .
Instead , Ncat makes use of Nmap 's well optimized and tested networking libraries .
Compatibility with the original Netcat and some well known variants is maintained where it does n't conflict with Ncat 's enhancements or cause usability problems .
Ncat adds many capabilities not found in Hobbit 's original nc , including SSL support , proxy connections , IPv6 , and connection brokering .
The original nc contained a simple port scanner , but we omitted that from Ncat because we have a preferred tool for that function .
Ncat is extensively documented in its Users ' Guide , man page , and home page .
Host discovery and port scanning performance and features
Nmap has been doing host discovery and port scanning since its release in ' 97 , but we continue to improve this core functionality .
We 've added many new features and dramatically improved performance !
Here are the biggest enhancements since 4.50 :
Nmap now scans the most common 1,000 ports by default in either protocol ( UDP scan is still optional ) .
These were determined by spending months scanning tens of millions of IPs on the Internet .
This makes Nmap faster ( used to scan 1,715 TCP ports by default ) and yet more comprehensive since the smaller number of ports are better chosen .
Nmap fast scan ( - F ) now scans the top 100 ports by default in either protocol .
This is a decrease from 1,276 ( TCP ) and 1,017 ( UDP ) in Nmap 4.68 .
Port scanning time with - F is generally an order of magnitude faster than before , making -F worthy of its " fast scan " moniker .
The -- top - ports option lets you specify the number of ports you wish to scan in each protocol , and will pick the most popular ports for you based on the new frequency data .
For both TCP and UDP , the top 10 ports gets you roughly half of the open ports .
The top 1,000 ( out of 65,536 possible ) finds roughly 93 % of the open TCP ports and more than 95 % of the open UDP ports .
Added a new -- min -rate option that allows specifying a minimum rate at which to send packets .
This allows you to override Nmap 's congestion control algorithms and request that Nmap try to keep at least the rate you specify .
A complementary -- max - rate option was added as well .
They are documented here .
Added SCTP port scanning support to Nmap .
Stream control transmission protocol is a layer 4 protocol used mostly for telephony related applications .
This brings the following new features : SCTP INIT chunk port scan ( - sY ) : open ports return an INIT - ACK chunk , closed ones an ABORT chunk .
This is the SCTP equivalent of a TCP SYN stealth scan .
SCTP COOKIE - ECHO chunk port scan ( - sZ ) : open ports are silent , closed ports return an ABORT chunk .
SCTP - specific IP protocol scan ( - sO - p sctp ) .
SCTP - specific traceroute support ( - - traceroute ) .
The server scanme.csnc.ch has been set up for your SCTP scan testing pleasure .
But note that SCTP does n't pass through most NAT devices .
David spent more than a month on algorithms to improve port scan performance while retaining or improving accuracy .
The changes , described here , reduce our " benchmark scan time " ( which involves many different scan types from many source networks to many targets ) from 1879 seconds to 1321 without harming accuracy .
That is a 30 % time reduction !
Fyodor made a number of performance improvements as well .
The host discovery ( ping probe ) defaults have been enhanced to include twice as many probes .
The default is now " - PE - PS443 - PA80 - PP " .
In exhaustive testing of 90 different probes , this emerged as the best four - probe combination , finding 14 % more Internet hosts than the previous default , " - PE - PA80 " .
The default for non -root users is - PS80,443 , replacing the previous default of - PS80 .
In addition , ping probes are now sent in order of effectiveness ( - PE first ) so that less effective probes may not have to be sent .
ARP ping is still the default on local ethernet networks .
Fixed an integer overflow which prevented a target specification of " *.*.*.*" from working .
Support for the CIDR /0 is now also available for those times you wish to scan the entire Internet .
When Nmap finds a probe during ping scan which elicits a response , it now saves that information for the port scan and later phases .
It can then " ping " the host with that probe as necessary to collect timing information even if the host is not responding to the normal port scan packets .
Previously , Nmap 's port scan timing pings could only use information gathered during that port scan itself .
A number of other " port scan ping " system improvements were made at the same time to improve performance against firewalled hosts ( full details ) .
Fyodor 's Nmap book
Fyodor released Nmap Network Scanning : The Official Nmap Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security Scanning .
From explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing low - level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers , this book suits all levels of security and networking professionals .
A 42 - page reference guide documents every Nmap feature and option , while the rest of the book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve real - world tasks .
It was briefly the # 1 selling computer book on Amazon .
More than half of the book is already free online .
A German translation is available from Open Source Press ; Korean and Brazilian Portuguese translations are forthcoming .
Operating system detection
Thanks to fingerprint submissions from thousands of Nmap users around the world , the 2nd generation OS detection database has nearly doubled in size since 4.50 to 2,003 entries .
These include the latest versions of Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X as well as more specialized entries such as oscilloscopes , ATM machines , employee timeclocks , DVRs , game consoles , and much more .
Keep those submissions coming !
In addition to doubling the database size , we enhanced the OS detection engine and its tests to improve accuracy .
For example , we added a new SEQ .
CI test ( IP ID sequence generation from closed TCP port ) and removed the U1.RUL , U1.TOS , IE.DLI , IE.SI , and IE .
TOSI tests .
Version detection
Nmap 's version detection system interrogates open ports to determine what service ( e.g. http , smtp ) is running and often the exact application name and version number .
The version detection database grew by nearly a thousand signatures .
It grew from 4,558 signatures representing 449 protocols in Nmap 4.50 to 5,512 signatures for 511 protocols in 5.00 .
You can read about Doug 's signature creation adventures here , here , and here .
The service protocols with the most signatures are http ( 1,868 ) , telnet ( 584 ) , ftp ( 506 ) , smtp ( 363 ) , pop3 ( 209 ) , http - proxy ( 136 ) , ssh ( 123 ) , imap ( 122 ) , and irc ( 48 ) .
Among the protocols with just one signature are netrek , gopher - proxy , ncat - chat , and metasploit .
Ndiff scan comparison tool
The new Ndiff utility compares the results of two Nmap scans and describes the new / removed hosts , newly open / closed ports , changed operating systems , or application versions , etc .
This makes it trivial to scan your networks on a regular basis and create a report ( XML or text format ) on all the changes .
See the Ndiff man page and home page for more information .
Ndiff is included in our binary packages and built by default , though you can prevent it from being built by specifying the - - without - ndiff configure flag .
Here are excerpts from an Ndiff comparison between two scans for the Facebook network :
> ndiff -v facebook - vscan- 1237136401.xml facebook-vscan-1237395601.xml - Nmap 4.85BETA3 at 2009-03-15 10:00 + Nmap 4.85BETA4 at 2009-03-18 10:00 +arborvip.tfbnw.net ( 69.63.179.23 ) : + Host is up .
+ Not shown : 100 filtered ports www2.02.07.facebook.com ( 69.63.180.12 ) : Host is up .
Not shown : 98 filtered ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION - 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 1.3.41.fb2 +80 /tcp open http Apache httpd 1.3.41.fb1 443/tcp open ssl/http Apache httpd 1.3.41.fb2
And here is a trivial cron script demonstrating how easy it is to scan a network daily and mail yourself the changes ( and full results in this case ) :
#!/bin/sh date=`date " +%s " ` cd /hack / facebook / scripts / nmap - T4 -F -sV - O --osscan - limit -- osscanguess - oA facebook - $ {date} [ netblocks ] > / dev/null ndiff facebook - old.xml facebook - ${date}.xml > facebook - diff - ${date} cp facebook - ${date}.xml facebook-old.xml echo "
********** NDIFF RESULTS **********
" cat facebook - vscan - diff - $ {date} echo "
********** SCAN RESULTS **********
" cat facebook - vscan - ${date}.nmap
You could do a similar thing using Windows ' scheduled tasks .
IronGeek has created an Ndiff 5 introductory video demonstrating command - line Ndiff plus its use within Zenmap .
Documentation and web site improvements
While Nmap Network Scanning may be the most exciting documentation news for this release , we did make many other important web site and documentation changes :
Added German and Russian translations of the Nmap Reference Guide ( Man Page ) .
You can choose from all 16 available languages from the Nmap docs page .
Nmap has moved .
Everything at http://insecure.org/nmap/ can now be found at http://nmap.org .
That should save your fingers from a little bit of typing .
A copy of the Nmap public svn repository ( / nmap , plus its zenmap , nsock , nbase , and ncat externals ) is now available at http://nmap.org/svn/.
We update this regularly , but it may be slightly behind the SVN version .
It is particularly useful when you need to link to files in the tree , since browsers generally do n't handle svn:// repository links .
Portability enhancements
Nmap 's dramatic improvements are of little value if it does n't run on your system .
Fortunately , portability has always been a high priority .
Nmap 5.00 runs on all major operating systems , plus the Amiga .
Portability improvements in this release include :
A Mac OS X Nmap / Zenmap installer is now available from the Nmap download page .
It is rather straightforward , but detailed instructions are available anyway .
As a universal installer , it works on both Intel and PPC Macs .
It is distributed as a disk image file ( .dmg ) containing an mpkg package .
The installed Nmap include OpenSSL support and also supports Authorization Services so that Zenmap can run as root when necessary .
Nmap 's special WinPcap installer now handles 64 - bit Windows machines by installing the proper 64 - bit npf.sys .
The Nmap installer was updated to handle the Windows 7 release candidate .
The Windows version of Nmap ( both .zip and executable installer ) now supports OpenSSL , as do the Linux RPM binaries we distribute .
The UNIX source tarball has supported OpenSSL for years .
We now compile in IP v6 support on Windows .
In order to use this , you need to have IP v6 set up .
It is installed by default on Vista , but must be manually installed for XP .
Even more improvements
The compile - time Nmap ASCII dragon is now more ferocious thanks to better teeth alignment : ( ) /\ _ ( \ | ( \ ( \. ( ) _____ \ \ \ ` ` ) \ ( ___ / _ \ ( _` \+ . x ( .\ \/ \____-----------/ ( o ) \_ - .- \+ ; ( O \____ ) \_____________ ` \ / ( __ +- . ( -'.-
The new -- stats - every option takes a time interval that controls how often timing status updates are printed .
It is useful when Nmap is run by another program as a subprocess , or if you just like frequent timing updates .
Completion time estimates provided in verbose mode or when you hit a key during scanning are now more accurate .
The nmap - dev and nmap - hackers mailing list RSS feeds at SecLists .
Org now include message excerpts to make it easier to identify interesting messages and speed the process of reading through the list .
Feeds for all other mailing lists archived at SecLists .
Org have been similarly augmented ( details ) .
Fixed an integer overflow in the scan progress meter .
As an Nmap user , few things are more discouraging than seeing your estimated completion time rise so high that it goes negative .
Nmap 's output options ( - oA , - oX , etc. ) now support strftime ( ) - like conversions in the filename .
%H , %M , %S , %m , %d , %y , and %Y are all the same as in strftime ( ) .
%T is the same as %H%M%S , %R is the same as %H%M , and %D is the same as % m%d %y .
So means that " - oX ' scan-%T -%D.xml ' " uses an XML file in the form of " scan-144840-121307.xml " .
Removed Brazilian poetry / lyrics from Zenmap source code ( NmapOutputViewer.py ) .
We 've seen enough of it in the debug logs .

The Liverpool and England midfielder ­Steven Gerrard was last night charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray following an incident at a Southport bar which left a man needing hospital treatment for facial injuries .
Gerrard , one of six men arrested following the incident , was charged with two other men after being held by police for nearly 24 hours following his arrest at the Lounge Inn , a venue in a quiet part of the Merseyside town .
He was released in the early hours of this morning .
Earlier in the day the bar had shown one or two signs of the alleged incident that led to the arrests .
A high - powered sports car – owned , it is thought , by the player – was still parked outside , with a ticket slapped on the frost - covered windscreen .
Inside the bar and restaurant , it was easy for onlookers to make out the mess .
On a table near the window were smashed drinks glasses .
Drops of blood could be seen under a bar stool – evidence , ­perhaps , for the four Merseyside detectives who turned up later .
Quite what happened , to whom and how , was still unclear , but by the early hours of this morning , Gerrard was still in police custody after a night out to celebrate his team 's comprehensive defeat of Newcastle United on Sunday .
The alleged victim was the club 's 34 - year - old DJ .
The Lounge Inn is a favoured nightspot for celebrities in the genteel seaside town .
One report suggested Gerrard and a group of his friends were involved in an altercation after the man refused to allow them to choose the songs played on the venue 's sound system .
Gerrard is a big fan of Phil Collins and counts the singer 's greatest hits as his favourite album .
He is also partial to Coldplay .
Neither the police nor Liverpool FC were prepared to give any details of the fracas that led to a man being taken to hospital for treatment for cuts to his face .
It was also reported that the injured man had lost a tooth , but he has been released from hospital .
Merseyside police had confirmed the force was investigating an alleged assault that took place at 2.30 am on Monday morning .
A statement read : " Six men were arrested on suspicion of section 20 assault on Lord Street .
The men , four , aged 33 , 31 , 29 and 19 , who all come from the Huyton area , a 28 - year - old man from Formby and a 18 - year - old man from Litherland remain in police ­custody . "
The police added : " A 34 - year - old man from Southport was taken to hospital with facial injuries . "
Gerrard 's wife , the model Alex Curran , 26 , left a coffee shop close to the police station in Southport , but remained silent about her husband .
The timing of the incident could not come at a worse time for Liverpool FC .
The club has a real chance of winning the Premier League – it has n't claimed the title in 19 years .
On Sunday Gerrard was the club 's star player in a 5 - 1 thrashing of Newcastle , scoring twice , and in interviews after the game he said the club were genuine contenders .
The Lounge Inn is situated in a wealthy area of Southport , off the main shopping thorough­fare .
The area is known as the bridal quarter as it houses a cake shop , wedding planner and bridal wear shops .
At the neighbouring Lucy Briars bridal shop , staff expressed their dismay .
" The restaurant and bar are upmarket and a pleasant place to go where you can feel comfortable , " said an assistant .
The sister of the Lounge Inn's co-owner , Dario Curcillo , said : " As far as I know he comes here regularly and it was just a normal night at the bar .
I do n't know anything about what happened last night . "
A nearby newsagent said : " My milkman told me that there were police officers and forensics outside the club at about 5.30 am after a fight had taken place . "
Gerrard , who grew up on Huyton 's Bluebell estate , has been capped 70 times for England and has captained his country four times .
He was made an MBE last year and an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University .

A Greek woman has appeared in court accused of setting fire to a British tourist in Crete after he allegedly groped her in a bar .
Stuart Feltham , 23 , from Swindon , is recovering from second - degree chest and stomach burns in a private clinic .
Maria Fanoudaki , a 26 - year - old student , said she poured a drink over Mr Feltham after he made inappropriate advances , but denied setting fire to him .
She faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison if she is convicted .
The trial in the town of Iraklion in northern Crete was adjourned until Monday .
' Absolute nonsense '
Ms Fanoudaki's lawyer Nikos Maniadakis said : " He fondled my client 's breasts and buttocks and she poured her drink over him and left .
" Shortly afterward she heard cries and saw her friends trying to extinguish him . "
The woman was charged with assault on Thursday after she turned herself in to police .
The story has made national headlines in Greece , where some have hailed the woman as a heroine .
Mr Feltham 's parents have insisted reports their son sexually harassed the woman were " absolute nonsense " .
Ian Feltham , 48 , said his son was approached out of the blue by a complete stranger who threw accelerant over him .
Stuart Feltham was at a bar in the town of Malia at the end of a two - week holiday with five friends .
William Penn ’s Spiritual & Practical Advice to His Children
Before the likes of Jefferson , Washington , Franklin , and Adams , we had William Penn , the founder of Pennsylvania who is rightly considered by many to be America ’s first Founding Father .
A champion of religious freedom and democracy , Penn stands out among many early American settlers in his good relations and treaties with native - Americans .
A Quaker ( the Religious Society of Friends ) , William Penn was good friends with George Fox , the founder of the Quakers and like Fox , Penn combined a refined spiritual outlook with practical sensibilities .
In the following passages , we find Penn offering sound advice to his children , as they begin their journey through life .
In our current age , where Facebook , Twitter , online forums , and blogs are national obsessions , Penn ’s final piece of advice regarding acquaintances and intimates should inspire serious meditation .
** In conversation , mark well what others say or do .
Hide your own mind , at least until last , and then open it as sparingly as the matter will let you .
A just observance and reflection upon men and things give wisdom and are the great books of learning seldom read .
The laborious bee draws honey from every flower .
Be always on your watch , but chiefly in company .
Then be sure to keep your wits about you , and your armor on .
Speak last and little , but to the point ; interrupt none ; anticipate none .
Read Proverbs 10 : 8,13 .
Be quick to hear , slow to speak : ( Prov. 17 : 27 ) .
It gives time to understand and ripens an answer .
The truest eloquence is plainest , and brief speaking ( I mean brevity and clearness to make yourselves easily understood by everybody , and in as few words as the matter will allow ) is the best .
** Return no answer to anger , unless with much modesty , which often turns it away .
But rarely make replies or rejoinders , for these add fuel to the fire .
It is a wrong time to vindicate yourselves , because the true ear is never open to hear it .
People are not themselves , and know not well what emotions control them .
Silence to passion , prejudice , and mockery , is the best an answer , and often will conquer what your resistance would have otherwise inflamed .
** Have but few books , but let them be well chosen and well read , whether of religious or other subjects .
Shun fantastic opinions ; measure both religion and learning by practice ; reduce all to that , for that brings a real benefit to you ; the rest is a thief and a snare .
And , indeed , reading many books takes off your mind too much from meditation .
Reading yourselves and nature , and the dealings and conduct of others , is the truest human wisdom .
More true knowledge comes by meditation and just reflection than by reading ; for much reading is an oppression of the mind , and extinguishes the natural candle , which is the reason we have so many senseless scholars in the world .
** Have very few acquaintances , and fewer intimates , but of the best in their kind .
Poets have been asked for their most hated words .
What are yours ?
' What word do you hate and why ? ' is the intriguing question put to a selection of poets by the Ledbury festival .
Philip Wells 's reply is the winner for me - ' pulchritude ' is certainly up there on my blacklist .
He even explains his animosity in suitably poetic terms :
" it violates all the magical impulses of balanced onomatopoeic language - it of course means " beautiful " , but its meaning is nothing of the sort , being stuffed to the brim with a brutally latinate cudgel of barbaric consonants .
If consonants represent riverbanks and vowels the river 's flow , this is the word equivalent of the bottomless abyss of dry bones , where demons gather to spit acid . "
For Geraldine Monk , " it 's got to be ' redacted ' which makes me feel totally sick .
It 's a brutish sounding word .
It does n't flow , it prods at you in a nasty manner . "
Both these poets understand that the key to words that make you feel nauseous is not the meaning - it 's easy , after all , to hate the word ' torture ' – but something else entirely .
Something idiosyncratic , something about the way the word feels in your mouth as you say it .
The horrors of ' membrane ' , for instance .
Or the eccentricity of ' gusset ' .
Having said that , I 'm still trying to get my head around Paul Batchelor 's explanation that " I 've always hated the word ' APPAL ' ( or ' appalled ' or ' appalling ' ) because I dislike hearing the sound of my name inside other words . "
I can't work out if there 's a case of extreme ego or extreme self - hatred going on there .
And I can't help feeling that Ros Barber misses the point with her rather po-faced reply .
" Words are to be loved .
Their associations may be unpleasant but words themselves are full of poetry ( and history , and geography ) , " she says .
" Delicious vowel sounds and tongue - tickling consonants .
There is n't a word in the English language that does n't excite me if I think about it long enough . "
Sorry , Ros , I can't agree .
I 'm with Rhian Edwards on ' chillax ' - " the most unnecessary and obnoxious linguistic blend to have ever been coined " .
Except possibly for ' no - brainer '...
Whether it's ' hubby ' or ' sassy ' or ' webinar ' – what are the words that make you wince ?
Budd Dwyer Suicide took place during press conference in front of many people and TV cameras .
Not being able to handle his corruption and conviction charges , Budd Dwyer pulled out a .357 magnum hand gun from a paper bag , scaring present media representatives but asked them to calm down or else someone would get hurt .
The rest went down very quickly .
Budd Dwyer committed swift suicide by putting the loaded gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger immediately .
The shot took his life as he slid down leaning against the wall , while the camera zooms in to capture the footage of loads of blood spewing out of his nose and mouth .
Budd Dwyer death was recorded in real time and below is the original , uncut video footage of it .
R. Budd Dwyer was actually a successful politician .
He was intelligent , started out as a school teacher who loved his wife and kids .
The political career became his nightmare and eventually cost his life as he committed suicide on live TV .
As he speaks his last words before he shoots a bullet in his head , Budd Dwyer sounds like a man who simply got pushed on the edge , not quite like an emo kid who likes to cut , talks about death a lot and wants to die by committing suicide .
Bud Dwyer wanted to live , but had no other choice but to take his own life .
The exact truth behind Budd Dwyer Suicide may never be known .
He took it with him to his grave .
He was obviously troubled , maybe confused , and hopeless .
He worked hard to achieve something in politics and was about to lose it all due to accusations of corruption .
The bio of Robert “ Budd ” Dwyer is simple .
He was born on November 21 , 1939 and became a treasurer for the state of Pennsylvania .
Televised press conference during which he committed suicide took place on January 22 , 1987 at the state capitol in Harrisburg .
Members of media gathered around expecting his to resign form office of treasurer , but instead they saw him put a revolver in his mouth and shoot himself to death .
To the last second of his life , Budd Dwyer claim to be innocent and an honest man .
He was facing a up to 55 years in prison and an additional $ 300,000 fine as he was convicted of receiving kickbacks .
By killing himself before he was released from office , Budd Dwyer secured full survivor benefits for his family – over $ 1.28 million .
Before he pulled the revolver form the envelope , he left his wife a suicide note .

A young Irish girl who lost her purse on a Ryanair flight was appalled when she had to give away a quarter of her pocket money for its return .
Nine - year - old Emma Lally , from Dublin , became distressed when she realised she had lost her purse while buying presents on a flight home from Salou , Spain , two weeks ago
Her father , Sean , tracked down the lost purse but Emma was dealt another hard blow when she learned that she would have to pay a € 10 administration fee for its return .
Sean contacted the airline 's lost property provider Greencap who told him it had the purse — but Emma would have to pay € 10 for its return .
“ I was a bit annoyed that I had to pay back money for something that was ours .
I was delighted to get it back but she 's only a child , ” Sean said .
The father criticised the system in which Greencap , the lost property service provider used by Ryanair , charges people € 10 for the recovery of their items .
Dublin Airport Authority charges € 6 for recovery .
“ Fair play to the Ryanair staff for finding the purse and handing it in , ” he said .
“ I contacted Greencap and I was told that it was ready for collection . ”
But Sean is still fuming about the charge because he feels that there should be no charge on a Lost and Found section , especially when a child loses something .
“ Her name and address were written inside the purse in a child 's handwriting .
It was very obvious that it was a child 's purse . ”
Thankfully , the € 42 Emma had saved for her holiday spending money was still in the purse when it was returned but she still parted with a quarter of the money to get it back .
“ She ’s a good kid and she went away and had a little think about it and came to me and said she wanted to give me the money . ”
“ I paid the tenner and took the purse .
Emma was delighted to get it back but she could n't believe that she had to pay the money .
I do n't see why it can't be given back without a charge . ”
A spokesperson for Ryanair says it uses Greencap for the management of lost and found since Dublin Airport Authority ( DAA ) does not accept lost and found items from airlines .
“ Only items found on the airport premises are administered by the DAA .
The DAA and Greencap charge an administration fee for the recording , storing and recovery of lost items , ” the spokesperson said .
However , the DAA said it has never refused any items being handed in at its Lost and Found section .

I spent nearly three and a half years working on technical documentation for a UNIX vendor during the early 90s .
Along the way , I learned Perl ( against orders ) , accidentally provoked the invention of the robots .
txt file , was the token Departmental Hippie , and finally jumped ship when the company ran aground on the jagged rocky reefs of the Dilbert Continent .
At one time , that particular company was an extremely cool place to work .
But today , it lingers on in popular memories only because of the hideous legacy of it 's initials ... SCO .
SCO was not then the brain - eating zombie of the UNIX world , odd though this may seem to young 'uns who 've grown up with Linux .
Back in the late eighties and early nineties , SCO ( then known more commonly as the Santa Cruz Operation ) was a real UNIX company .
Started by a father - son team , Larry and Doug Michels , SCO initially did UNIX device driver work .
Then , around 1985 , Microsoft made a huge mistake .
Back in those days , MS developed code for multiple operating systems .
Some time before then , they 'd acquired the rights to Xenix , a fork of AT&T UNIX Version 7 .
SCO did most of the heavy lifting on porting Xenix to new platforms ; and so , when Microsoft decided Xenix was n't central to their business any more , SCO bought the rights ( in return for a minority shareholding ) .
By late 1991 , when I joined SCO , SCO was n't just about Xenix .
They had their own official UNIX SVR3 port , SCO UNIX , and ( with X11 and a Motif - based GUI on top , and various other gadgets ) this formed the core of a fairly neat desktop workstation environment , SCO Open Desktop .
SCO back then was about 1200 people , with development centres in Santa Cruz ( focussing on X11 and desktop integration ) , Toronto ( the compiler team ) and Watford , just outside London ( where the UNIX kernel and command line utilities were maintained ) .
It was , in short , a thriving software multinational with a somewhat Californian culture .
There was , for example , a dress code : " clothing must be worn during office hours , " which was imposed in the wake of an incident when it was n't ( which unfortunately coincided with an on - site visit by some major investors ) .
( If you are scratching your head and wondering why this does n't sound much like the SCO Group that is the object of so much hatred these days , that 's because it 's not the same company .
SCO Group started out as Caldera Systems , a Utah - based Linux startup bankrolled by Ray Noorda in the late 90s .
They bought the name , trademarks , and — they thought — the UNIX intellectual property assets from the Santa Cruz Operation in 2001 .
The original SCO renamed itself " Tarantella Inc " and went away to do , well , Tarantella -ish things before being absorbed by Sun , and then Oracle .
The SCO Group then went on to play merry hell with the Linux community and take a copious metaphorical shit all over my resumé .
That 's life in silly valley , I guess . )
When I answered the job ad for technical author , I did n't have much idea of what I was getting into .
I 'd bluffed my way into Real World Graphics , figured out what I was doing on the fly , and carved out a niche — but RWG was small , so small that I 'd never worked with another tech author .
SCO , in contrast , had an entire freaking department .
In fact it had three departments , with about thirty folks in Santa Cruz , fifteen in Watford , and five in Toronto .
If that sounds like a lot , well , SCO 's techpubs operation was writing , maintaining , and pushing out something like thirty thousand pages of documentation on an eighteen month production cycle .
By trade publishing standards they were over - staffed , but trade publishers do n't generally employ their own authors in - house .
About half the techpubs crew were editors or typesetters ; and about half of us were writers .
" We 'd like you to do an aptitude test , " said Bridget , the department head , when she interviewed me .
" Here 's a notepad .
I 'd like you to take a stab at writing a house style guide for a techpubs department .
You 've got half an hour . "
I eyeballed the Wyse terminal in the office behind her .
" I thought you said you had Microsoft Word running on that ? " I asked .
" My handwriting 's not very good ... mind if I use it ? "
Bridget gave me a very strange look : it was to be the first of many .
( Later , she told me that of all the candidates she 'd interviewed for tech writing jobs , I was the only one who'd asked to use a word processor . )
With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight , I did n't fit in too well at SCO ; it was just my good luck that SCO suffered from acute multiple personality disorder and had plenty of room for the barkingly eccentric , as long as they could get the job done .
SCO had arrived in the UK in the late 1980s , acquiring the UNIX division of a large British software house who really did n't understand this hippyish Californian stuff .
A number of Californians had come over with the new company , and there 'd been some cross-fertilization .
The result : a company where some folks wore suits , some folks wore flip - flops and torn jeans , and the only common denominator was that everyone obeyed the dress code .
The parent company was keen on training courses ( we had an internal training division , and a budget ) , and team building exercises .
A team building exercise in Santa Cruz meant something like midnight drumming on the beach ; in Watford it was code for a lunchtime trip to the pub .
Technology wise ... you probably are n't interested so I 'll keep it brief : we ate our own dogfood .
When I joined the EMEA techpubs unit , we had sixteen green screen terminals hanging off a single 33MHz 386 PC running SCO UNIX , and we were editing our doc set in vi with a bastardized , weird set of troff macros for markup and sccs for version control .
When I left , some years later , I abandoned a nice 486 workstation with a 17 " monitor , running Open Deathtrap — sorry , Open Desktop — but still editing files with the same weird macros ( apart from the odd foray into Framemaker for dealing with documents from our newly acquired subsidiary in Cambridge , IXI ) .
At SCO , I admit I went a bit wild .
I got into a four month burn - out cycle ; because I was doing a job I understood , in a comfortable environment , but within a bizarrely corporate administrative structure .
About six months after I arrived , I went through the first downsizing of the 1990s — a cross-industry initiative to set up a rival platform to IBM and Microsoft crashed and burned , and SCO took a 10 % headcount reduction in the course of recovering from the mess .
We then lurched into developing a new product , SCO OpenServer .
OpenServer was to be the all - singing all - dancing successor to Open Desktop ; a desktop workstation environment with support for a whole barn - full of then - sexy UNIX technologies — diskless workstation installs ( a 500 Mb hard disk cost about £ 500 back then ) , remote administration via a scripted GUI environment written in a high level language ( Tcl ) using a graphics server that could cope with both X11 and CURSES displays , and I forget what else .
The OpenServer development program turned out to be a bear .
Originally scheduled to take 15 months , it succumbed to specification creep ; by the time I left , three years later , it had just gone golden master and was about to ship .
From the techpubs point of view , we were documenting a complex operating system product — it ran to about 8 million lines of code , on the same order as Windows NT 4.0 , against which it would compete ( badly ) in the server market — and for the first time it would come with a revolutionary hypertext environment to display the documentation — a program called NCSA Mosaic .
The trouble with the mission creep from my point of view was that Parkinson 's Law applies ; work expands to fill the time available for its completion .
A lot of the processes within SCO 's techpubs environment were incredibly inefficient .
But on the other hand , SCO was getting into the whole ISO 9000 quality assurance fandango .
Consequently , everything got re-written , revised , edited , and chewed over sixteen bazillion times , and everyone got to try on a variety of ornamental and not particularly useful headgear .
During this process I discovered several things about myself .
I do not respond well to micro-managing .
I especially do not respond well to being micro-managed on a highly technical task by a journalism graduate .
Also , I 'm a lousy proofreader .
Did I say lousy ?
I meant lousy .
Santa Cruz does indeed have a nice beach for late evening walks with your girlfriend .
Oh , and : vi not emacs .
Around the early 90s , one of the perennial headaches in SCO 's techpubs department received a permanent solution .
The problem was this : how to simultaneously manage ( a ) an online help system and ( b ) printed paper manuals ?
Especially as paper is going away , because the cost of printing the documentation set on dead tree added about £ 40 to the cost of goods of a copy of SCO UNIX or Open Deathtrap — which is to say , took £ 40 per sale off the profit margin .
The solution we came up with was called HTML , a fun little SGML - derived markup language that ran on a client server platform called , ambitiously , the World Wide Web .
In late 1992 or early 1993 , SCO techpubs collectively went WWW - crazy .
( That 's why we ended up with the personal workstations ; to run a web browser . )
Our weird troff macro set was designed to support a future upgrade to SGML document management ; now our coders purched into action with a bizarre mixture of awk and ksh scripts to chow down on troff and spit out HTML .
Masses of HTML .
Mountains of HTML .
When OpenServer shipped there were something like a quarter of a million HTML links in the documentation tree .
It took a server something like eleven hours to chew down on the troff source and spit it all out .
But from mid-1993 on we were committed to the web .
And reading the web at work .
Did I say " reading the web " ?
The web was kind of small in those days .
There was a daily mailing list called , if I remember correctly , " what 's new on the web " .
It listed every new website that had shown up , and I mean every new website .
I used to read it with my morning coffee , visiting those that interested me ; I 'd usually finished by 10 am .
( It finally grew too big to follow by late 1994 , and was abandoned some time in 1995 . )
I confess , the web fascinated me .
And I was getting increasingly bored and fractious with my job over those years .
I wanted to code ; but I 'd talked myself into a comfortable , well - paid niche in which I was pretty much paid not to code .
Or write fiction .
( Almost without noticing , I 'd tailed off to about two or three short stories a year , plus half a dozen articles for Computer Shopper . )
During one of my periods of burn - out I decided to teach myself Perl .
So I started by trying to write a web spider — a bot that did a depth - first traversal of the web , to retreive ( and eventually index ) what it found , or just to download pages ( a la wget or curl ) .
There were n't many resources for robot writers back then ; the internet in the UK was pretty embryonic , too .
( SCO EMEA had a 64 K leased line in those days , shared between 200 people . )
I was testing my spider and , absent - mindedly , gave it a wired - in starting URL .
What I did n't realize was that I 'd picked a bloody stupid place to start my test traversals from ; a website on spiders , run from a server owned by a very small company — over a 14.4 K leased line .
I guess I 'd unintentionally invented the denial of service attack !
Martin , the guy who ran the web server , got in touch , and was most displeased .
First , he told me to stop hammering his system — advice with which I hastily complied .
Then he invented a standard procedure : when visiting a new system , look for a file called " robots.txt " , parse it , and avoid any directories or files it lists .
I think I may have written the first spider to obey the robots .
txt protocol ; I 'm certainly the numpty who necessitated its invention .
( You can find the evidence here ( look for websnarf ) . )
All good times come to an end .
In early 1995 I 'd been doing some work on the side ; both writing for Computer Shopper , and the beginnings of a web book for Addison - Wesley ... and also some perl programming for a guy from Edinburgh who was providing web technical support for Demon Internet .
SCO was clearly in a tight spot , two years overdue on OpenServer , and I was getting a bit itchy around the soles of my feet ; I could see the public internet and the web coming , and knew they were going to be huge .
One morning , our managers did a walkthrough of the cubicle hive , taking down all the Dilbert print - outs stapled to the beige fabric walls , and telling everybody to be ready for a magical mystery tour , leaving from the central courtyard at 1 pm .
I knew the signs ; executives from head office are apparently subject to mysterious taboos , and must not under any circumstances be allowed to gaze upon the work of Scott Adams lest it bring bad luck to the department .
And the magical mystery tour ... there was going to be some kind of big announcement .
And it had to be big — we were in functional freeze and the mad dash to the final release candidate for the product that was more than two years overdue and which would make or break the company , with over five hundred Severity
One bugs to fix !
So what could possibly justify dragging the entire development group , and QA , and techpubs , and marketing , and sales , and admin , to an offsite for half a day ?
I did n't know , but I spent the rest of that morning updating my CV — just in case .
Now , I have learned , over the years , to be alert for Bad Signs when evaluating a company 's health .
Here is an example of a Bad Sign :
They bus everyone to an offsite meeting in a conference centre , hand out cups of grape juice , usher you into a theatre , dim the lights ... then the sound system comes up , playing Things Can Only Get Better as the board of directors run on - stage in their grey suits , punching the air and giving each other high - fives , to announce that :
a) The Chief Executive is retiring , and
b ) His successor is the current Chief Financial Officer , and
c ) Said CFO promises to grow the company revenues by 500 % in 5 years
This was a company in the UNIX on PC sector at a critical time in its development .
Linux was coming up on our radar with increasing frequency .
The internet was not merely visible , but becoming a vital tool without which our internal processes would n't work , and public adoption was growing at something like a compound 50 % per month — but the high - level management response was to emit a fart of a product , a neutered " personal " build of Open Desktop with a voucher for 10 % off the cost of a leased line from UUNet or Pipex , priced at about the cost of a decent second - hand car .
Do I need to explain why putting an accountant in charge of a technology - driven company is not necessarily a wise , visionary , and forward - looking move ?
At this point I considered myself to be on notice .
But I was fat and happy at SCO , earning more than I 'd ever earned before ; it was n't until another month had passed that I realized just how bad the situation was about to become .
As a Californian software corporation , SCO was prone to various types of American management disease ; no alcohol on corporate premises , for example : and then the annual recurring Maoist self - criticism and re-education ritual known as the performance appraisal .
Maybe I 'm being unjustly critical here ; maybe my line manager ( not Bridget ) had grounds for her criticisms in 1995 .
Certainly I was n't a team player — but then , the way I was working at that point was typically as a trouble - shooter , going in and fixing the more technical stuff that some of our other tech authors just did n't understand .
Be that as it may , after one particularly bruising session I headed back down to the department under something of a cloud , following my manager .
She departed , en route to a meeting ; my course back to my cubicle went past her desk .
I saw a blue hardback on the desk .
" That 's funny , " I thought , " it 's not like her to be reading a novel at work .
It 's probably something relating to management theory .
Hmm . "
I nosily flipped open the book and read the flyleaf .
Did a short , sharp intake of breath .
Closed the book carefully , marched back to my desk , picked up my phone , and dialed a number in Edinburgh .
" Fearghas .
That job you were talking about ... "
" Yes ?
We 're kind of tight right now . "
" Um , I really need it . "
" Are you sure ?
We 've got enough money in the bank to pay for just one month .
This is a start - up .
I can't make any promises . "
" Fearghas , I need a new job . "
" Okay .
When can you get up here ? "
Here is an example of a Terminally Bad Sign for any organization in the computer business :
...
When you discover that your line manager 's recreational reading is the 1980 edition of the IBM Staff Handbook .
This may not make much sense to you if you 're from the outside of the computer biz , but let 's put it this way : IBM was the company that grew fat and happy catering to folks like those at Imperial Merchandise .
Here 's a transcript of an interview with an ex-IBMer from that period .
Note how very corporate the corporate culture is .
Note also that in 1993 IBM 's traditional culture crashed and burned , running up what was then the biggest loss in American corporate history as they finally lost control of the PC business to Microsoft .
If you see your managers taking helpful hints from the corporate equivalent of the Titanic on a speed - run through the ice - infested waters of the North Atlantic , it is clearly time to leave : and so I gave notice , packed my bags , drove up to Edinburgh , and enlisted in my second start - up death march ....

June 18 , 2009
Associated Press
HAGERSTOWN , Md. -
An inventory of deadly germs and toxins at an Army biodefense lab in Frederick found more than 9,200 vials of material that was unaccounted for in laboratory records , Fort Detrick officials said Wednesday .
The 13 percent overage mainly reflects stocks left behind in freezers by researchers who retired or left Fort Detrick since the biological warfare defense program was established there in 1943 , said Col.
Mark Kortepeter , deputy commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases .
He said the found material included Korean War -era serum samples from patients with Korean hemorrhagic fever , a disease still of interest to researchers pursuing a vaccine .
Other vials contained viruses and microbes responsible for Ebola , plague , anthrax , botulism and host of other ailments , Kortepeter said in a teleconference with reporters .
" What happens over time , these get moved from one freezer to another , historically .
Now we have much better tracking of where they are , " Kortepeter said .
About half of the found material has been destroyed , Kortepeter said .
Samples deemed potentially useful were saved and entered into a laboratory database , he said .
The material was in tiny , 1 mm vials that could easily be overlooked in the 25 - cubic - foot freezers or even covered by clumps of minus - 80 - degree ice , said Sam Edwin , the institute 's inventory control officer .
Kortepeter said the inventory found nothing missing from about 70,000 items the institute began cataloging in 2005 .
He said Army criminal investigators have concluded that three vials of Venezuelan equine encephalitis that were discovered missing last year " were likely used up but for some reason were never recorded with the database . "
The separate search of the institute 's 335 freezers and refrigerators began Feb. 4 and ended May 27 .
Kortepeter said it was prompted by the discovery during a spot check in January of 20 samples of Venezuelan equine encephalitis in a box listed as containing 16 .
He said the review was ordered by the institute 's commander , not by higher officials .
However , the spot check that led to the inventory was part of a tightened security program the Army implemented at all five of its biological and chemical research centers in December in response to an FBI finding that a Fort Detrick scientist was responsible for deadly 2001 anthrax attacks , said Michael Brady , special assistant to Army Secretary Pete Geren .
Brady said the other labs found no discrepancies , so they did not need inventory reviews .
The new security measures also include an annual check to ensure that all material in the database is accounted for , Brady said .
" This is not going to be a once - in - a - while thing , " he said .
" This is going to be a regular , aggressive inventory accountability program to make sure we do n't have the problems we 've seen in the past . "
After Fort Detrick anthrax researcher Bruce E. Ivins killed himself in July , the FBI announced that he alone was responsible for the anthrax mailings that killed five people and sickened 17 others in 2001 .
Ivins committed suicide after learning he would be charged in the attacks .
His attorney maintains he was innocent .
This time , for " Adam and Eve " knowledge is not forbidden — it 's their mission .
Working with computers and robots in the lab , scientists have been able to generate exponentially increasing amounts of data as the technology improves .
Concerned they lack the manpower to translate the deluge of raw information into results , researchers are programming their mechanical lab assistants to share more of the workload .
A prime example of this is " Adam , " an autonomous mini laboratory that uses computers , robotics and lab equipment to conduct scientific experiments , automatically generate hypotheses to explain the resulting data , test these hypotheses , and then interpret the results .
Researchers at Aberystwyth University in Wales and England 's University of Cambridge report in Science today that they designed Adam — which is 16.4 feet ( five meters ) in length , with a height and width of 9.8 feet ( three meters ) — to perform basic biology experiments with minimal human intervention .
They describe how the bot operates by relating how he carried out one of his tasks , in this case to find out more about the genetic makeup of baker 's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , an organism that scientists use to model more complex life systems .
Using artificial intelligence , Adam hypothesized that certain genes in baker 's yeast code for specific enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions .
The robot devised experiments to test these beliefs , ran the experiments , and interpreted the results .
Because biological organisms are so complex , the details of biological experiments must be recorded in great detail so those experiments can faithfully be reproduced , even if this record - keeping is tedious , says lead study author Ross King , an Aberystwyth computer science professor .
" With a computer , all of the results and conclusions and structure are expressed in logic , " he says , " that can uniformly be understood by other researchers . "
The researchers programmed Adam to prepare samples of frozen yeast strains ; incubate them to encourage growth ( which Adam monitored using an optical sensor ) ; place the samples in a centrifuge to separate out the yeast ; mix the yeast with certain nutrients and incubate it again ; and then monitor the plates over time .
Adam did this by using robotic arms to pass the samples from work space to work space within an automated lab the size of a small room .
Although Adam does require some setup initially , " there 's no real intellectual input from humans , " once it gets started , King says .
The Adam project was financed by the government of Wales , along with the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) in England , a funding agency for life sciences research .
( The lab cost $ 1 million to build , which does not include the costs to keep it running . )
Adam helps take a lot of the grunt work out of lab experiments , says BBSRC 's director of research Janet Allen , an experimental biologist , which allows scientists to spend more time analyzing the results of their research .
BBSRC has been funding the project since 1999 , having contributed more than $ 1.3 million thus far .
" When robots first came in to the lab , people were excited about creating enormous data sets , but you also have to be able to work with all of that data , " she says .
" Adam is a way to combine experimental science ( in the lab ) with computational science " that crunches numbers and turns raw data into scientific knowledge .
King and his colleagues designed Adam to perform basic biology but they are hoping that their next automated lab , Eve , will help scientist search for new drugs to combat diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis , an infection caused by a type of parasitic worm in the tropics .
Eve , which King expects will be up and running by July , is about the same size as Adam and cost roughly the same amount to build .
" Instead of testing compounds randomly , " King says , " Eve tries to determine the best compounds to study . "
( BBSRC has contributed nearly $ 1.5 million to the Eve project since it began in May 2008 . )
In the future , Adam and Eve will work in tandem , not in Eden but rather in a lab where Adam prepares assays for Eve to use in its search for promising new chemical compounds and drug candidates .
Hej readers ,
I decided to work on making slackbuild .pl a bit more acceptable in terms of usability and looks .
The reason for this is that the dialog program does n’t exactly do what I want .
That is , it works ….
but that ’s pretty much all I can say about it .
It does n’t allow me to make a comined checkbox / menu thing that I want for my configure options part .
Next to that it ’s tedious to fork and parse its output all the time , and let ’s not even get started about looks and input issues .
So I figured : hmm , dialog is made in ncurses , perl has a Curses lib … .
let ’s play !
First off I read through most of NCURSES Programming HOWTO .
Somehow it felt familiar , probably because I already went through it when messing with iotop .
Next , I realized that google is pretty much useless when you try to search for ‘ curses ’ and perl , probably because it ’s the misspelled version of ‘ cursus ’ which means ‘ course ’ in dutch .
However , ncurses is something you can search for and find - some - ( but few ) bits and pieces of information .
Time for a hello world .
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Curses ;
# init curses
initscr ( ) ;
noecho ( ) ;
start_color ( ) ;
init_pair ( 1 , COLOR_CYAN , COLOR_BLACK ) ;
# Print some stuff and wait for user input
attron( COLOR_PAIR ( 1 ) ) ;
addstr ( 1 , 5 , " Hello , world !
" ) ;
getch ( ) ;
# Cleanup and end
endwin ( ) ;
And we run this , and voila :
Well , that was easy enough .
Of course I already knew all this shit , I made iotop after all …
Now time for more advanced trickery : windows .
What I want is simple : tailbox , yesnobox , checkboxconfigureoptionsthingy and all that with some good style .
“ YOU SAID SIMPLE ! ”
Well , I never said it would be easy 😉
So my idea was to make the stdscr the backtitle , should be easy enough to always paint that the same way right ?
And then make the other things windows above that .
Now the mysteries start .
A little code to test the windowing concepts :
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Curses ;
# init again
initscr ( ) ;
noecho ( ) ;
cbreak ( ) ; # no waiting for enter anymore on getch
start_color ( ) ;
init_pair ( 1 , COLOR_CYAN , COLOR_BLACK ) ;
# make some windows that overlap
my $ win = newwin ( 20 , 40 , 10 , 10 ) ;
my $ win2 = newwin ( 20 , 40 , 5 , 5 ) ;
# some text in them
addstr ( $win , 1 , 1 , " World ! " ) ;
addstr ( $win2 , 1 , 1 , " Hello " ) ;
# give them borders
attrset ( $win , COLOR_PAIR ( 1 ) ) ;
box ( $ win , ' | ' , ' - ' ) ;
attroff ( $win , COLOR_PAIR ( 1 ) ) ;
box ( $ win2 , '| ' , '- ' ) ;
# Show them !
( in correct overlapping order ! )
refresh ( $win2 ) ;
refresh ( $win ) ;
# Make user press ' q ' this time
my $key ;
do {} while ( ( $ key = getch ( ) ) ne ERR && $ key ne 'q ' ) ;
# cleanup and exit
delwin ( $ win2 ) ;
delwin( $win ) ;
endwin ( ) ;
And here ’s our beautiful result :
…. what the .
Our window is empty ?
But how could this be ?
MAGIC !!!!
However , it does wait for the ‘ q ’ button before exiting , so not everything failed …
This sort of nonsense is exactly the reason why I started this post .
Right now I ’m having some serious doubts about continuing this curse * COUGH*s project , but on the other hand , it ’s a nice challenge .
Probably one of the reasons dialog is such a piece of junk … the library is garbage ! 🙂
Note that there are a few other options , such as Curses : : UI , but they seem to be a bit more junk than I want , not to mention another depedency .
Nah , I ’ll figure it out using Curses for as long as I can manage to not go crazy .
Some pointers I found out :
Printing stuff outside a window ( because the window is too small ) makes it go bonkers .
It might not appear at all , overwrite other stuff … you name it .
A big pitfall is the y , x syntax .
Where one would expect coordinates in the x ,y format , curses makes you curse and reverse .
Another pitfall is forgetting the refresh , or messing up the order of the refreshes .
I ’m writing some wrappers for that in slackbuild.pl .
Overlapping windows are another source of fun , in order to make sure the overlapped window gets repainted properly you can use touchwin ( $ win ) ; on it .
Oh yeah , if you ever decide to write a curses program :
Make sure to set a __DIE__ handler that RESTORES THE TERMINAL PROPERLY !
If one thing annoys people it ’s messing up their stuff ….
and not closing Curses properly does exactly that .
For those who wonder how to get out of such a broken terminal , type in ‘ reset ‘ and hit enter .
( or twice if you ’re a bad typist ) .
No , this wo n’t reset your pc , it will simply reset your terminal to sanity .
“ But what about the broken code in the second example ? ”
Oh yeah … another case of forgetting to call refresh .
What we did there was to properly refresh the imaginary windows .
However , we forgot to refresh the real stdscr window that contains them !
So nothing was output to the screen .
Lovely .
It ’s still a bit fuzzy here though , so do n’t mind me if I screwed up the reasoning , but that ’s what I understand about it now .
It ’ll get better 😉
Anyway , insert a refresh ( ) ; at line 25 and it ’ll do what you ’d expect .
It ’ll look like this :
Good luck with your cursed rabbits !
*** followup here : ncurses magic part 2***
Ben Goldacre says the Soil Association 's criticism of the recent Food Standards Agency research on nutrients is " not about organic food " and that " the emotive commentary in favour of organic farming bundles together diverse and legitimate concerns about unchecked capitalism in our food supply " ( Bad Science : Argument is about capitalism , not food , 1 August ) .
In fact , our argument with the FSA research is about whether it gives a fair and accurate picture of organic food .
Goldacre claims that the Soil Association put forward three " bad arguments " .
If he had talked to us , he would not have misunderstood our views .
First , he said we were trying to change the argument by saying that " the important issue with organic food is not personal health benefits , but rather benefit to the environment " .
More farmland wildlife , high animal welfare and lower pollution were not mentioned in our own initial response , but were put forward strongly by the government when the FSA launched its report , and we repeated it as the government 's view , with which we agree .
Second , we argued that absence of pesticides , no routine use of antibiotics on farm animals and far fewer additives allowed in organic food all deliver health benefits .
Goldacre says that as these " cannot be measured " by the FSA research , mentioning them " is gamesmanship " .
These are real benefits , confirmed by other research .
But we also answered the FSA head - on , making clear that more recent science than the FSA 's has found more beneficial nutrients in organic food .
Third , Goldacre says we wrongly said the FSA " deliberately excluded evidence " .
When the FSA announced its review two years ago , we asked it to wait so it could include the results of the largest - ever research programme into organic food , funded by the EU .
It refused .
Goldacre claimed of the EU papers published so far , " almost all are irrelevant " .
The full results of the five years of EU research , presented at a conference in April , and including a positive review of nutritional differences , will be peer - reviewed and published next spring .
Goldacre would have learnt this if he had talked to the scientists involved .
There are real questions about how the FSA framed its review , and a rational explanation for it reaching different conclusions from more recent reviews .
For example , the FSA study was organised in ways which introduced significant variability into the data .
It included " shopping basket " studies , known to give particularly variable results for nutritional content , because they do not control for differences in growing and harvesting conditions .
So although it mostly found positive differences in the nutrients it looked at in organic food , it rejected most of them as too variable to be statistically significant .
That left a small number of positive differences in nutrients which the FSA could not dismiss as statistically insignificant .
The researchers simply decided , in their opinion , that the significant results were not " important " , and " no important differences " was the result they announced .
That really is bad science .

STUDENTS facing exams this month , take heart : your companions can smell your fear , and they empathise .
That ’s the implication of a study by Bettina Pause at the University of Dusseldorf , Germany , and colleagues .
They put absorbent pads under the armpits of 49 university students an hour before they took their final oral exam and again as the same students exercised .
Another set of students then sniffed the sweat samples while having their brains scanned .
None perceived a difference between the two types of sweat , but the pre-exam sweat had a different effect on brain activity , lighting up areas that process …
Meet Tadataka Goh , a Japanese jazz bassist who is perhaps the world ’s biggest collector of Apple - branded goods — you know , Apple t- shirts , pens and hats .
Over the last 15 years , Tadataka has amassed the largest collection of Apple knickknacks on the planet .
He has thousands of items , including hundreds of pens , t- shirts , baseball caps , posters and buttons .
He has the first issue of Macworld magazine and an Apple - branded traffic cone .
Tadataka has possibly spent more than $ 100,000 on them .
That ’s right — more than $ 100,000 .
“ Looking at his collection , he ’s probably spent several hundred thousand dollars , ” says Steve Naughton , co-owner of RedLightRunner.com , which sells Apple collectibles and counts Tadataka as its best customer ever .
The Japanese are well - known for being enthusiastic collectors , and the most otaku can be fanatical completionists .
Even so , the scope of Tadataka ’s collection boggles the mind .
He ’s got so much stuff , even he does n’t know how much he ’s got .
He recently posted pictures of more about 4,000 items to an online gallery , and has scores more pictures to upload .
Click on to see some of Tadataka ’s collection .
You have to see the photos to appreciate how big this collection is .
Tadataka ’s collection includes kids toys , plushie Mac dolls , Apple watches , toolkits and binoculars .
He has more than 350 mugs and coffee cups ; over 140 pens and pencils ; and about 400 items of clothing ( tshirts , jackets , shirts , hats and shoes ) .
He has boatloads of miscellaneous items , from Apple Zippo lighters to an ’80s denim tie decorated with a rainbow Apple logo .
Amazingly , Tadataka stores all the items in his room — in closets , chests and bookshelves .
Naughton says Tadataka is his best customer .
“ He placed more orders than any other customer at RedLightRunner , ” he says .
As well as RedLightRunner , Tadataka bought a lot of items from Bonnie , a former Apple employee who is selling off her large collection of Apple items on eBay .
Bonnie was recently interviewed in Episode 73 of RetroMacCast .
“ I have not seen any other collection as large as his , ” Naughton adds .
“ For me and I think most people , we like to have an item or two for inspiration , to remind us what Apple is about ( ie .
Think Different , innovation , creativity , etc … )
But I ’m not too sure what drives someone to have an extraordinary large collections of stuff .
Maybe he ’s a fanatic ?
Or maybe he plans on retiring off it someday ?
I always thought that he was purchasing stuff from us to resell in Japan . ”
Asked what drives him to collect Apple memorabilia , Tadataka , who speaks limited English , simply said : “ I love Mac . ”
( See the full email interview below — it ’s comically painful , so I put it at the bottom . )
<!–nextpage– >
Here ’s the link to Tadataka ’s online gallery of his collection .
And here ’s the email interview :
CoM : How many items do you have ?
Tadataka : I do n’t know .
How long have you been collecting ?
Tadataka : Probably 15 years or more .
Where do you store your collection ?
Tadataka :
In my room
Where did you buy the collectibles ?
Tadataka : Auctions and Internet Shop like Red Light Runner …
How much did the collection cost ?
Tadataka : I do n’t know .
Is the collection finished ?
Tadataka :
No , I continue , if I can .
Why are you collecting Apple memorabilia ?
Tadataka : I Love Mac .
What do you think about Apple and Steve Jobs ?
Tadataka : Mmmmm , I have no idea .
I love Mac , but Steve does not like to sell Apple items .
Probably he hate collectors like me .
Do you have a Mac , or an iPod or iPhone ?
Tadataka : I have 128K , Spartacus ( TAM ) , G3MT300 , iBookG3 , Newton 2100 .
Mainly I use iMacG4 .
I bought iPhone on begining of May .
Do you use the items you collect ?
Do you wear the shirts ?
Tadataka :
No , I do n’t use them .
Do you have any other collections ?
Tadataka : Apple or any other categories ?
Regarding Apple items , you can see almost on my gallery .
What does your wife or girlfriend ( or maybe children or friends ) think of the collection ?
Tadataka : – – – – – – – – –
What do people say when they see the collection ?
Tadataka :
Anybody do n’t know my gallery wo / you and Bonnie and few .
What is your favorite item ?
Why is it your favorite item ?
Tadataka : Insignificant questions .
Tell me about yourself .
What is your name , your occupation , your age and your city ?
Tadataka :
My name is Go. I ’m a Jazz Bassist .
Can you please email me a picture of yourself ?
Tadataka : Okay .
Do you also have a picture of the entire collection ?
Or a picture of the collection where it is stored ?
Or on display ?
Tadataka : I do n’t know .
But I ’ll sell some items that are doubled or no interesting anymore on Japanese auction site .
Here ’s a link to Tadataka ’s auction site .
It ’s currently empty .
I 've been taking a closer look at the WebOS side of my Palm Pre tonight , and I noticed that it periodically uploads information to Palm , Inc .
The first thing sent is intended to be my GPS location .
It 's the same location I get if I open the map app on the Pre .
Not very accurate in this case , but I 've seen it be accurate enough to find my house before .
{ " errorCode " : 0 , " timestamp " : 1249855555954.000000 , " latitude " : 36.594108 , " longitude " : - 82.183260 , " horizAccuracy " : 2523 , " heading " : 0 , " velocity " : 0 , " altitude " : 0 , " vertAccuracy " : 0 }
Here they can tell every WebOS app I use , and for how long .

It sends the above info on a daily basis .

There is also some info that is recorded when a WebOS app crashes .
Now , I 've seen WebOS crash hard a time or two , but it turns out apps are crashing fairly frequently behind the scenes , and each such crash is logged and a system state snapshot taken .
At least some of these are uploaded , though if things are crashing a whole lot it will be throttled .

The woman ’s story about giving birth to a child diagnosed while in the womb as terminally ill hit a nerve .
Every night for the last two months , thousands of abortion foes from across the nation logged onto a blog run by the woman who said she was unmarried , pregnant and identified herself only as “ B ” or “ April ’s Mom . ”
People said they prayed that God would save her pregnancy .
They e-mailed her photos of their children , shared tales of heartache and redemption and sent letters of support and gifts to an Oak Lawn , Ill. , post office box .
As more people were drawn to the blog -- which included biblical quotes , antiabortion messages and a soundtrack of inspirational Christian pop songs -- advertisers were queuing up .
By the evening of June 7 , when the woman blogged that April Rose had survived a home birth only to die hours later , her website had nearly 1 million hits .
There was only one problem with the unfolding tragedy : None of it was true .

The baby in the photos , swaddled in white blankets , was a doll .
“ I have that exact doll in my house , ” said Elizabeth Russell , a doll maker from Buffalo , N.Y. , who had been following the blog .
“ As soon as I saw that picture , I knew it was a scam . ”
The following day , people vented their anger on dozens of Christian parenting websites .
“ She needs to be exposed and held accountable , ” Russell said .

Sensing that people were close to establishing her identity , “ April ’s Mom ” raced to delete her website and Twitter and Facebook accounts .
But the online community already had identified her : Beccah Beushausen , a 26 - year - old social worker from Mokena , Ill .
Reached by the Chicago Tribune on Wednesday , Beus- hausen admitted to the hoax .
“ I know what I did was wrong , ” she said .
“ I ’ve been getting hate mail .
I ’m sorry because people were so emotionally involved . ”
There ’s no evidence that Beushausen benefited financially in any significant way or committed any crime .
Still , Russell said , she does not understand why anyone would create such a tale and prey on people ’s emotions .

Beushausen said she really did lose a son shortly after birth in 2005 .
She started her blog in March to help deal with that loss and to express her antiabortion views , she said .
She had ony expected only a handful of friends to read it , but when her first post got 50 comments , she was hooked .
“ I ’ve always liked writing .
It was addictive to find out I had a voice that people wanted to hear , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ Soon I was getting 100,000 hits a week , and it just got out of hand .
I did n’t know how to stop .
. . .
One lie led to another . ”
Although Beushausen said she used her real - life experiences as a basis for her fictionalized account , her devoted fans did n’t read it that way .
“ I feel emotionally exploited , ” said Jennifer McKinney , a Minnesota mother who runs the widely read Christian parenting blog mycharmingkids .
net and nearly lost her fourth child during pregnancy .
She said Beus - hausen sought her out to help promote her site and , in retrospect , had seemed more interested in attracting viewers than in her unborn child .
“ I have 11,000 Twitter followers , and I drove most of the traffic to her blog , ” McKinney said .
“ My readers were praying for her , and I feel guilty about that .
But I have to admit her stuff was beautifully written . ”

Raechel Myers , a friend of Beushausen ’s from college , heard from someone this year that Beushausen was going through a difficult pregnancy .
Myers and her husband had a daughter who died at birth , so they did more than most to support Beushausen .
“ When I heard that she was pregnant , I called her and said if she needed anything , I was there for her , ” said Myers , who lives in Nashville .
Myers sold T - shirts online to benefit both her friend and an antiabortion pregnancy clinic that Beushausen sought support for .
The couple said they sent her a few hundred dollars .
Even after learning of the hoax , Myers said , she and her husband did not regret their involvement .

“ She ’s someone who needed love and attention , and we gave her that , ” Myers said .
Beushausen said she planned to write one final blog post , coming clean and apologizing to her fans .

We ’re all a little vain .
Me more than most .
So the chance to get something customized just for you is always a good thing .
Mass customization is what is going to save musicians when the record companies all fail .
So I encourage you all to go and check out this neato site : Monsters by Mail .
For mere $ 25 , Len will draw you a customized monster based on a name that you send him .
For $ 35 , he ’ll send you a link to a YouTube video that shows him drawing your customized monster .
This year the theme is Supervillains .
Send him the crazy ass nickname you had in college ( unless it was something like Captain Ass ) and see what he turns it into .
Or better yet , pick a name for your dad and get him a unique Father ’s Day gift rather than that blue Brooks Brothers tie ( boring ! ) .
Last year ’s theme was Zombies .
I sent in a request for a Tai Chi Zombie and this is what I got :
I drew an accurate picture of the dude in red shorts below .
So last night I was hanging out and drinking with a few buddies when I decided to bring the gathering inside to relax in some air conditioning .
The night was winding down so I boot up the old Xbox to stream some South Park episodes through Netflix .
Before I found the Netflix tab I noticed a green ring glowing under my television .
It was my trusty Xbox camera that I thought would have a decent future when I purchased it .
After noticing it I decided to load
Uno real fast hoping that it would be more entertaining than sitting around watching cartoons .
It was .
I bring up the list of rooms to join and click on the first name I see .
It was something like XxxKazenonexxX or whatever .
The first thing that comes to mind when you see a name with X's and shit is that the dude is some kind of nerdy hardcore gamer ...
Right ?
Entering the room I expected to see a smaller guy with glasses , not this giant cock on my screen .
It was just chilling there .
Flaccid and everything .
The guy actually seemed relaxed just chilling there with his dick hanging out .
I think he was on the phone with someone too .
I look to the right of the screen and this other dude is beating off .
Before I could say anything I was booted from the room .
After getting an eye full of dick I was hoping to at least see some titties , so the next room I joined was hosted by WhoreXChick or something similar .
As soon as I connect I see tits ( cool ) followed by more dudes jacking off .
They were telling her what to do ( like a live cam show you 'd see on a porn site ) while they were beating off .
They booted me after about 30 seconds .
Probably because my camera did n't have a dick on it .
The next room I joined had this dude laying on his bed in short red shorts , a younger girl , and a creepy dude with a mustache and hair passed his shoulders .
Seemed pretty normal until the dude lying on the bed start jacking off .
Rather than exposing his penis he just put his hands down his pants and went to town .
The strange thing is that the other two people in the room seemed to ignore the fact that some dude was lying down and beating off .
Since nobody was doing anything about it and I was n't getting kicked from this room I decided to plug in the mic .
I do n't remember what I said exactly , but I do remember that we carried on a rather normal conversation .
He mentioned that he was masturbating over the chick that was in the room even though she was n't paying attention to anyone in it .
It was kind of like a David Lynch film .
The final room I joined was completely normal .
Everyone was having a good time playing Uno .
Then after about 2 minutes this dude asked me if I was going to pull my dick out .
After saying no I was booted from the room .
You would think that Uno would be monitored more closely .
I did join other rooms with people stripping but I was booted instantly .
I 'm also pretty sure that if I had my penis out I would n't have been booted from most of the rooms and people would be amazed by it 's size .
The Georgia Supreme Court threw out an order by Fayette County Superior Court Judge Christopher Edwards which prohibited children in a divorce case from any exposure to their father 's gay and lesbian friends :
" The ruling stems from the 2007 divorce of Eric Duane Mongerson and
Sandy Kay Ehlers Mongerson , who had been married 21 years and had four
children .
The visitation order prohibited the three youngest children , whose
ages ranged from 8 to 16 at the time , from being in contact with their
father ’s gay and lesbian friends .
The oldest child was already an adult . "
Said Justice Robert Benham : “ Such an arbitrary classification based on sexual orientation flies in
the face of our public policy that encourages divorced parents to
participate in the raising of their children …
[ The Fayette County judge’s
prohibition ] assumes , without evidentiary support , that the children
will suffer harm from any such contact . ”
Bentham said there was no evidence that the children had been exposed to inappropriate contact or that they would be adversely affected by being in the presence of gay people .
And here 's some disturbing news .
According to The Citizen , Edwards has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court which threw out his order .

Two weeks after federal judges ordered California to reduce its prison population , an arm of the Schwarzenegger administration is set to vote on increased funding to police anti-drug units , potentially putting even more offenders behind bars .
An advisory board for the California Emergency Management Agency is expected to decide today whether to channel $ 33 million in federal money to narcotics task forces around the state that have proved particularly adept at apprehending drug criminals .
Critics of government drug policies say that money should instead be directed to drug - treatment programs whose funding has been sliced amid California ’s budget woes .
“ While one side of the government is addressing prison overcrowding , another side seems to be acting directly counter to that goal , ” said Margaret Dooley - Sammuli , deputy state director of the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance .
Advertisement
The bulk of the money is slated to help multi-jurisdictional task forces in all 58 California counties that investigate and apprehend narcotics offenders .
Money also would go to marijuana - suppression efforts around the state and the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement , which coordinates with federal agents on border drug trafficking .
John Lovell , a spokesman for the California Narcotics Officers ’ Assn. , called the Drug Policy Alliance opposition “ predictable ” but wrong at a time when Mexican drug cartels are boosting methamphetamine production and operating marijuana plantations in state forests , including the one blamed for starting a wildfire Aug. 8 in Santa Barbara County .
He said the spending on anti-drug task force efforts is “ not only appropriate , it ’s too bad the amount is n’t larger . ”
Advertisement
Dooley - Sammuli believes the bulk of the money would go toward generating more arrests of street - level offenders , not on cracking down on high - level drug criminals .
“ We ’re not getting the best bang for our buck , ” she said .
As now envisioned , the state ’s anti-drug - abuse enforcement program could have its funding boosted substantially over last year , in part because of nearly $ 20 million in federal stimulus money allocated in July .
The Drug Policy Alliance estimates that the increase could yield 13,000 arrests during the coming year , resulting in prison time for nearly a quarter of those apprehended , at a cost of $ 160 million .
Advertisement
Funding for drug treatment programs was slashed roughly in half from $ 120 million two years ago .
Meanwhile , the state is grappling with pressure to reduce prison crowding .
This month , a three - judge panel ordered the state to shrink its prison population by more than 40,000 in the next two years .
Last month , legislators approved a $ 1.2 - billion reduction in prison spending .

WASHINGTON  President Obama said Friday that the encouraging report on jobs shows that “ we ’re pointed in the right direction ” and that the beginning of the end of the recession should spur policies to avoid a similar calamity for the nation .
“ We ’re losing jobs at less than half the rate we were when I took office , ” the president said in the White House Rose Garden , taking comfort in a report showing that “ only ” 247,000 jobs were lost in July , the smallest monthly drop since last August .
And in an unexpected reversal , the unemployment rate dropped to 9.4 percent from 9.5 percent the previous month .
Mr. Obama used the heartening figures to argue again for an overhaul of the health - care system , a renewed commitment to education and “ new , clean energy sources for our industries . ”
The president did not mention former President George W. Bush by name , but it was clear that he was alluding to Bush policies .
Sub -Actuality is the Paul Blart of his generation .
Blobone is every bit as untamed as a wild forest berry .
Nobody in the entire world has ever taken Bobble Bobble as seriously as Sub-Actuality is here in this image .
tooms was tragically struck down by a mummy .
“ I appreciate your efforts , and look forward to working with you so that the Congress can complete health care reform by October . ”
So declared President Obama in a letter this week to Senators Max Baucus and Edward Kennedy .
The big health care push is officially on .
But the devil is in the details .
Health reform will fail unless we get serious cost control  and we wo n’t get that kind of control unless we fundamentally change the way the insurance industry , in particular , behaves .
So let me offer Congress two pieces of advice :
1 ) Do n’t trust the insurance industry .
2 ) Do n’t trust the insurance industry .
The Democratic strategy for health reform is based on a political judgment : the belief that the public will be more willing to accept reform , less easily Harry - and - Louised , if those who already have health coverage from private insurers are allowed to keep it .
But how can we have fundamental reform of what Mr. Obama calls a “ broken system ” if the current players stay in place ?
The answer is supposed to lie in a combination of regulation and competition .
It ’s a sign of the way the political winds are blowing that insurers are n’t opposing new regulations .
Indeed , the president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the industry lobby known as AHIP , has explicitly accepted the need for “ much more aggressive regulation of insurance . ”
Zo testen ze dus of een Guard model ook echt veilig is .
Lekker erop schieten !

The end of the recession might be in sight , yet many businesses around the world are still finding it tough , especially when it comes to cash flow .
But in Italy a group of parmesan cheese makers and a bank have got together to help each other .
The cheese producers give the bank some of their cheese as collateral in exchange for a loan .
In return , the bank charges interest on the loan and , if the producer defaults , the bank can sell the highly valuable cheese .
Our correspondent in Italy , Duncan Kennedy explains the rest ...
FALLUJA , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Like many young boys , Khidir loves playing with toy cars and wants to be a policeman like his father when he grows up .
But it was his father 's very job that caused the tiny child to suffer the unimaginable .
Khidir , now 8 , was kidnapped and held hostage for two years by operatives with al Qaeda in Iraq .
Khidir was just 6 years old when he was savagely ripped away from his family , kidnapped by al Qaeda operatives in Iraq .
" They beat me with a shovel , they pulled my teeth out with pliers , they would go like this and pull it , " said Khidir , now 8 , demonstrating with his hands .
" And they would make me work on the farm gathering carrots . "
What followed was even more horrific , an ordeal that would last for two years in captivity .
Khidir and his father spoke to CNN recently , more than half a year after his rescue by Iraqi police .
Watch boy describe torture »
" This is where they hammered a nail into my leg and then they pulled it out , " he says , lifting up his pant leg to show a tiny wound .
He says his captors also pulled out each of his tiny fingernails , broke both his arms , and beat him repeatedly on the side of the head with a shovel .
He still suffers chronic headaches .
He remembers them laughing as they inflicted the pain .
" I would think about my mommy and daddy , " he replies , when asked how he managed to get through the agony .
His father , Abdul Qader , struggles for words .
" When he tells me about how they would torture him , I can't tolerate it .
I start crying , " he says .
" What hurts me the most is when they hammered a nail into his leg . "
The father , a police officer , was sleeping at the police station in Falluja when his son was kidnapped .
It was too dangerous to go home regularly .
Although Falluja was no longer controlled by insurgents , assassinations against police were common .
" I woke up to the sound of a huge explosion ... and then I heard my name on the radio .
I ran outside and they came to me saying your house was blown up , " he says .
" When the police patrol came back , they all started kissing and comforting me , " he continues .
" I was asking , ' What 's going on ?
Where is my family ? '
They told me that they took my son .
This was a disaster .
I went mad that day , I was n't normal , I was hysterical . "
Khidir 's grandmother was at home with the family at the time .
" The kidnappers climbed the fence and kicked in the door , " she says .
" They were screaming for Abdul Qader .
I told them he 's not here .
They called me a liar and said we want his son .
His son was hiding behind me , clutching my clothes .
I said this is not his son .
They hit me on the back with a rifle and ripped him out of my arms . "
The last thing she remembers were his screams of " Granny , Granny ! "
The attackers rigged the house with explosives and demolished it before taking off with the 6 - year - old .
The boy 's grandmother and seven other family members rushed out of the home before it exploded .
" The kidnappers called me on the phone and demanded that some prisoners that we had be released or they would slit his throat , " Khidir 's father says .
" But I said no to the release .
I would not put killers back out on the street that would hurt other Muslims .
So I thought to myself , ' Let my son be a martyr . ' "
He even held a secret funeral for his little boy .
He did n't want to tell the rest of the family that he had refused the kidnappers ' ultimatum , allowing them to hope that he was still alive .
Last December , nearly two years later , police in Taji , about 45 miles ( 70 kilometers ) away , received a tip that terrorists were holding kidnapped children .
" We thought that it was just a tip to ambush us , but we considered the mission as a sacrifice , " said Iraqi police Capt .
Khalib Ali .
" Either we find the children and free them or face the danger and take the risk . "
The tip led the Iraqi police to a rundown farm and a series of mud huts .
Khidir 's tiny body was twisted abnormally .
And in another hut , they found another child .
Two children are still believed to be with the kidnappers .
Al Qaeda in Iraq has historically kidnapped children for money , to pressure officials , and even to use in terrorist attacks .
For Khidir 's father , it was as if his son had come back from the dead .
" He did n't recognize his mother or his grandmother , " Abdul Qader says .
" But then he saw me in uniform and ran to me .
I went flying toward him to hug him .
People said be careful ; both his arms are broken .
So I held him from his waist , and he hugged me , kissed me , smelled me , and then broke into a smile . "
The father flips through old family photos -- all they were able to salvage from their destroyed home -- and notes some of the kidnappers are still at large .
He still fears for his son's safety , but says he wo n't quit the police force .
" Never , never , " he says .
" If I leave the police force , if others leave the force , who will protect us from the terrorists ?
We are the only ones . "

Following up on the news that Francis Collins has been nominated to head the NIH , Slate has a curious article asking whether Collins is too religious for such a position .
The article makes it clear that Collins has impeccable credentials ( MD , PhD in physical chemistry , coordinator of the national genome project ) ; not only believes in evolution and its compatibility with Christian faith , but is an outspoken critic of creationism and Intelligent Design ; and rejects the idea that human personhood begins at conception and supports stem - cell research .
From a liberal point of view , there would n’t seem any grounds for worry that Collins would replicate the Bush - era politicization of scientific decisions .
And yet , the article still manages to spend the majority of its space wringing its hands about Collins ’ possible “ religious agenda ” :
His passionate defense of religion has earned some harsh criticism .
When rumors of the appointment began to circulate in May , University of Chicago professor Jerry Coyne blogged , “ I ’d be much more comfortable with someone whose only agenda was science , ” saying he was worried “ about how this will affect things like stem - cell research and its funding . ”
( In fact , Collins is clear on his support of stem - cell research . )
Sam Harris was predictably unimpressed with Collins ’ ideas .
“ Most reviewers of The Language of God seem quite overawed by its author ’s scientific credentials , ” Harris wrote shortly after it was published .
“ His book , however , reveals that a stellar career in science offers no guarantee of a scientific frame of mind . ”
Harris does not make a genuine attempt to consider the book ’s ideas , but he is correct that the philosophy espoused by Collins , which he calls “ theistic evolution , ” has so far managed to evade sustained and careful scrutiny .
Now that he has been chosen as the most important scientific administrator in the country , overseeing $ 40 billion of grants and programs , the scientific community can be forgiven for a few jitters over exactly where Collins comes down on the inevitable , often glaring contradictions between science and Scripture .
First off , I find the idea that theistic evolution ( TE ) has evaded scrutiny pretty bizarre .
Theologians and philosophers have been wrestling with the relationship between science and scripture for over a hundred years ; just because the American political debate has been myopically focused on evolution vs. creationism does n’t mean that TE has n’t received careful scrutiny ( which is n’t to suggest it ’s free from problems ) .
But more to the point , the central claim of theistic evolution , at least in most forms , is that evolution can be understood on its own terms with reference to natural causes and without explicit reference to God .
So , pretty much by definition , it ’s hard to see what insidious influence Collins ’ faith is supposed to have here .
The article goes on to say that Collins distinguishes between “ unsolved ” and “ unsolvable ” problems : the former are those problems likely to be explicated by future scientific advances , the latter those that remain permanent mysteries of the human condition .
( The philosopher Gabriel Marcel made a similar distinction between problems and mysteries . )
The piece says that Collins sees the human moral sense as well as the apparent “ fine - tuning ” of the universe for the emergence of life as mysteries that point to the existence of God , and warns that
[ t ] his is the area where Collins ’ religion is most in danger of intruding on his science .
He believes that it ’s possible to see evidence of the divine in things like physics equations or patterns of human behavior .
While Collins would never suggest that science could furnish any final proof for the existence of God , he ’s fond of mentioning that the Bible occasionally uses the word evidence .
That is to say , he thinks the presence of the divine can be directly observed , even if it cannot be measured and tested .
I think the standard that ’s being set here is startling .
Nearly all religious people see “ evidence ” of the divine in humanity and in the order of the universe .
And nearly all religious people believe that something like direct experience of God is possible .
The implication is that virtually any religious person is potentially disqualified from important scientific positions , or at least highly suspect .
To be acceptable , is Collins required to be agnostic on all philosophical and religious questions of any significance ?
( Not to mention , in practical terms , it ’s very difficult to see how accepting a modified version of the design argument [ i.e. , the fine - tuning argument ] or suggesting that the human moral sense gives us clues to God ’s will would affect the work of a NIH administrator . )
The problem is the same as the problem with the “ new atheists ” : a kind of scientific imperialism ( or scientism ) that thinks all interesting philosophical or religious questions can be settled by empirical demonstration in the narrowest sense ( or else are meaningless ) .
It ’s the return of the old , discredited logical postivist method where “ evidence ” is construed in a way that rules out , by definition , reasonable grounds for religious belief .
US deficit to soar towards $ 1.6tn
The US government has spent heavily on attempts to ease the recession
The US budget deficit will soar to almost $ 1.6 trillion ( £ 978 bn ) this year , the highest on record , both the White House and Congress have warned .
Fuelled by President Obama's $ 787bn stimulus package and reduced tax revenues due to the recession , it compares with a $ 455 bn deficit in 2008 .
The White House says the deficit will grow further , predicting it will hit a cumulative $ 9tn from 2010 - 2019 .
However , it continues to expect the US economy to start to recover this year .
The White House expects US unemployment to pass 10 % this year , before slowly declining in 2010 .
The most recent official figures showed the rate at 9.4 % in July .
' Dire situation '
The latest deficit predictions have come from the White House and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
The alarm bells on our nation 's fiscal condition have now become a siren
Senate Republican minority leader Mitch McConnell
" Overall , it underscores the dire fiscal situation that we inherited , and the need for serious steps to put our nation back on a sustainable fiscal path , " the White House 's Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag said .
Christina Romer , one of the president 's economic advisers , said the recession " was simply worse " than first predicted .
She said the White House now estimated that the economy will contract by 2.8 % in 2009 , more than double when it predicted earlier this year .
It now expects growth of 2 % in 2010 , down from its previous prediction of 3.2 % , but with economic expansion recovering to 3.6 % in 2011 .
' Out of control ' Republicans said the latest deficit figures were a serious concern .
" The alarm bells on our nation 's fiscal condition have now become a siren , " said Senate Republican minority leader Mitch McConnell .
" If anyone has any doubts that this burden on future generations is unsustainable , they 're gone - spending , borrowing and debt are out of control . "
Analysts said the latest deficit figures increased the likelihood of US tax rises once it is confirmed that the country has exited recession .
The CBO said such a move would be required .
" Putting the nation on a sustainable fiscal course will require some combination of lower spending and higher revenues than the amounts now projected , " it said .

It 's official : Ridley Scott will be directing the prequel Alien , returning to the franchise he created .
And along for the chest - bursting ride is an up - and - coming scifi screenwriter , with a reboot idea Scott could n't refuse .

Ever since Scott announced his intentions to make an Alien prequel , speculation has abounded as to whether Scott himself would return to the director 's chair .
Word was the commercial director ( and Scott 's daughter 's current beau ) Carl Erik Rinsch might take the reigns , but that Fox refused to greenlight the project without Scott as director .
Variety now reports that Scott has agreed to direct his first Alien movie in 30 years , with Jon Spaiht attached to write the script .
Spaiht is n't a household name yet , but his philosophical science fiction romance Passengers made the 2007 Black List of best unproduced scripts .
He 's also scripting The Darkest Hour , a film described as " Independence Day in Moscow , " for 9 producer and Wanted director Timur Bekmambetov , as well as a feature for Disney titled Children of Mars .
Reportedly , Spaiht delivered a prequel pitch that wowed Scott and the studio .

So , what is this brilliant idea ?
The new film will allegedly be a direct prequel to the original Alien , which means we may get to see what occurred on the derelict ship that Ripley and her crew discover in the first film .
Or perhaps we 'll see shades of William Gibson 's idea for Alien 3 , and trace the xenomorphs to their origin .

OSCON Microsoft is standing by its decision to release thousands of lines of code to the GPL , saying the decision was n't based on a violation of the popular license .
Sam Ramji , senior director of platform strategy , has blogged that Microsoft released the Hyper - V Linux driver code to GPL for the " mutual benefit of our customers , partners , the community , and Microsoft .
" Microsoft 's decision was not based on any perceived obligations tied to the GPL v2 license , " he said .
It was the only reference to any violation of the GPL , meaning Microsoft has not tackled the original question of how it was in violation , why it happened , and what steps it has taken to prevent such an occurrence from happening in the future .
Ramji went on to reiterate Microsoft 's reason for picking GPL : " The primary reason we made this determination in this case is because GPLv2 is the preferred license required by the Linux community for their broad acceptance and engagement . "
Leaders of the Linux community , meanwhile , continue to express their support for the code drop itself .
Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin , in conversation with The Reg at OSCON , called it " good behavior we want to encourage . "
" I look at the fact Microsoft not so long ago said the GPL was terrible and open - source software is a cancer , and now it 's part of the process .
I see that as good , it 's good for Linux that the tide has definitely turned . "
He noted Microsoft was acting for business reasons , not a licensing issue , and said putting drivers in the Linux kernel was more likely designed to help Hyper - V compete against VMware .
Linux father Linus Torvalds , meanwhile , is reported to have told Linux Magazine that he welcomed Microsoft as a " new member of the community " and said we should steer clear of the " hating Microsoft disease " .
He has yet to view the code in question , but indicated that on principle he 's open to accepting it in Linux because he believes in open development .
" I'm a big believer in ' technology over politics ' .
I do n't care who it comes from , as long as there are solid reasons for the code , and as long as we do n't have to worry about licensing etc issues , " Torvalds told the magazine .
" I may make jokes about Microsoft at times , but at the same time , I think the Microsoft hatred is a disease .
I believe in open development , and that very much involves not just making the source open , but also not shutting other people and companies out . "
He called it hypocrisy to attack Microsoft for having acted out of self interest , because self interest drives development of open source . ®

ATM theft in South Africa has gotten so bad that some ATMs are being weaponized with pepper spray to deter thieves .
If the ATM detects someone trying to tamper with it , the spray is released .
These ATMs apparently can spray not only would - be bad guys but also hapless ATM technicians who are just trying to fix the darn thing .
In the technician incident , the spray spread through the shopping mall where the ATM was located .
Pepper spray in ATMs -- what could go wrong there ?
If this idea comes to the United States , I can just see it now on my bank statement : " $ 20.00 -- Pepper Spray Fee . "

By By Sitafa Harden Jul 24 , 2009 in Politics Dealing with issues of racial inequality in America is part and parcel of the tremendous responsibility President Obama willingly took on when he became our nation 's first black president .
Most pundits concur that Obama unintentionally drew attention away from his health care reform agenda by responding to the question .
They also believe that he made a mistake in weighing in on the issue — a mistake which he later regretted and sought to retract today .
I disagree .
I believe that in spite of his great desire to promote health care reform , President Obama realized that this was an opportunity to weigh in on a volatile issue plaguing America .
The President himself said as much .
Today , in a
There are some who say that as President I should n't have stepped into this at all because it is a local issue .
I have to tell you that part I disagree with .
The fact that this has become such a big issue I think is indicative of the fact that race is still a troubling aspect of our society .
Whether I were black or white , I think that me commenting on this and hopefully contributing to constructive as opposed to negative understandings about the issue is part of my portfolio .
As he demonstrated during his 2008 election campaign , President Obama does not shy away from addressing racial problems .
Against the advice of some in his own camp , he insisted on writing and delivering a speech on race relations in America entitled That turned out to be a monumental speech which was long overdue and contributed greatly to encouraging our national dialogue on racial equality .
The President went on to say in My hope is that , as a consequence of this event , this ends up being what is called a " teachable moment " .
Where all of us , instead of pumping up the volume , spend a little more time listening to each other and trying to focus on how we can genuinely improve relations between police officers and minority communities .
And that instead of pointing accusations we can all be a little more reflective in terms of what we can do to contribute to more unity .
Lord knows we need it right now .
The media further questioned why Obama chose to weigh in on this particular issue .
Since taking office he has consistently avoided directly addressing racial issues related to unemployment and the economy .
So , the media asked , why is he chiming in now ?
I think the simple answer is — because he can .
To the horror of right wingers , Obama has a pulpit now .
And while he will not abuse that soapbox , he will also never hesitate to use it to facilitate " teachable moments " to help our country or the global community as a whole .
Racial tensions , unfortunately , are still a part of the fabric of America , and addressing these issues should be included in the job description for every president .
Lord knows we need it right now .

Research which finally proves that bones found in Shropshire , England provide the most geologically recent evidence of woolly mammoths in North Western Europe publishes June 17 in the Geological Journal .
Analysis of both the bones and the surrounding environment suggests that some mammoths remained part of British wildlife long after they are conventionally believed to have become extinct .
The mammoth bones , consisting of one largely complete adult male and at least four juveniles , were first excavated in 1986 , but the carbon dating which took place at the time has since been considered inaccurate .
Technological advances during the past two decades now allow a more exact reading , which complements the geological data needed to place the bones into their environmental context .
This included a study of the bones ' decay , analysis of fossilised insects which were also found on the site , and a geological analysis of the surrounding sediment .
The research was carried out by Professor Adrian Lister , based at the Natural History Museum in London , who has conducted numerous studies into ' extinction lag ' where small pockets of a species have survived for thousands of years longer than conventionally thought .
" Mammoths are conventionally believed to have become extinct in North Western Europe about 21,000 years ago during the main ice advance , known as the ' Last Glacial Maximum ' " said Lister .
" Our new radiocarbon dating of the Condover mammoths changes that , by showing that mammoths returned to Britain and survived until around 14,000 years ago . "
As the Shropshire bones are the latest record of mammoths in North Western Europe they not only prove that the species survived for much longer than traditionally believed it also provides strong evidence to settle the debate as to whether mammoth extinction was caused by climate change or human hunting .
" The new dates of the mammoths ' last appearance correlate very closely in time to climate changes when the open grassy habitat of the Ice Age was taken over by advancing forests , which provides a likely explanation for their disappearance , " said Lister .
" There were humans around during the time of the Condover mammoths , but no evidence of significant mammoth hunting . "
Dr Lister 's findings feature in one of three papers on the Condover Mammoths which are all published in the Geological Journal .
The other papers focus on the Palaeoenviromental context of the mammoths ( Allen et al ) and a geological study of the site in which the mammoths were discovered ( Scourse et al ) .
How could Paul Krugman , winner of the Nobel Prize in economics and author of generally excellent columns in The New York Times , get it so wrong ?
His column last Sunday — “ Reagan Did It ” — which stated that “ the prime villains behind the mess we ’re in were Reagan and his circle of advisers , ” is perverse in shifting blame from the obvious villains closer at hand .
It is disingenuous to ignore the fact that the derivatives scams at the heart of the economic meltdown did n’t exist in President Reagan ’s time .
The huge expansion in collateralized mortgage and other debt , the bubble that burst , was the direct result of enabling deregulatory legislation pushed through during the Clinton years .
Ronald Reagan ’s signing off on legislation easing mortgage requirements back in 1982 pales in comparison to the damage wrought 15 years later by a cabal of powerful Democrats and Republicans who enabled the wave of newfangled financial gimmicks that resulted in the economic collapse .
Reagan did n’t do it , but Clinton - era Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers , now a top economic adviser in the Obama White House , did .
They , along with then - Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and Republican congressional leaders James Leach and Phil Gramm , blocked any effective regulation of the over - the - counter derivatives that turned into the toxic assets now being paid for with tax dollars .
Reagan signed legislation making it easier for people to obtain mortgages with lower down payments , but as long as the banks that made those loans expected to have to carry them for 30 years they did the due diligence needed to qualify creditworthy applicants .
The problem occurred only when that mortgage debt could be aggregated and sold as securities to others in an unregulated market .
The growth in that unregulated OTC market alarmed Brooksley Born , the Clinton - appointed head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , and she dared propose that her agency regulate that market .
The destruction of the government career of the heroic and prescient Born was accomplished when the wrath of the old boys club descended upon her .
All five of the above mentioned men sprang into action , condemning Born ’s proposals as threatening the “ legal certainty ” of the OTC market and the world ’s financial stability .
They won the day with the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , which put the OTC derivatives beyond the reach of any government agency or existing law .
It was a license to steal , and that is just what occurred .
Between 1998 and 2008 , the notational value of the OTC derivatives market grew from $ 72 trillion to a whopping $ 684 trillion .
That is the iceberg that our ship of state has encountered , and it began to form on Bill Clinton ’s watch , not Reagan’s .
How can Krugman ignore the wreckage wrought during the Clinton years by the gang of five ?
Rubin , who convinced President Clinton to end the New Deal restrictions on the merger of financial entities , went on to help run the too - big - to - fail Citigroup into the ground .
Gramm became a top officer at the nefarious UBS bank .
Greenspan ’s epitaph should be his statement to Congress in July 1998 that “ regulation of derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary . ”
That same week Summers assured banking lobbyists that the Clinton administration was committed to preventing government regulation of swaps and other derivatives trading .
Then - Rep. Leach , as chairman of the powerful House Banking Committee , codified that concern in legislation to prevent the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or anyone else from regulating the OTC derivatives , and American Banker magazine reported that the legislation “ sponsored by Chairman Jim Leach is most popular with the financial services industry because it would provide so - called legal certainty for swaps transactions . … ”
Legal certainty for swaps — meaning the insurance policies of the sort that AIG sold for collateralized debt obligations without looking too carefully into what was being insured and , more important , without putting aside reserves to back up the policies in the case of defaults — is what caused the once respectable company to eventually be taken over by the U.S. government at a cost of $ 185 billion to taxpayers .
Leach , an author of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which allowed banks like Citigroup to become too big to fail , is now a member of the board of directors of ProPublica , which bills itself as “ a non-profit newsroom producing journalism in the public interest . ”
Leach serves as the chair of a prize jury that ProPublica has created to honor “ outstanding investigative work by governmental groups , ” and perhaps he will grant one retrospectively to Brooksley Born and the federal commission she ran so brilliantly before Leach and his buddies destroyed her .
Obama 's reliance on the most recent iteration of the Army Field Manual , which went into effect in September 2006 , has been the subject of a number of critiques by myself , and by human rights organizations , including Physicians for Human Rights , Center for Constitutional Rights , and Amnesty International .
Its Appendix M allows for use of psychological torture techniques , including isolation , sleep deprivation , and partial sensory deprivation .
The main text of the AFM also changed the wording from the previous Army Field Manual as regards the use of drugs on prisoners , and did so in a way that allowed greater latitude for drugs that cause disruption of the senses and temporary psychosis .
You'd think this was the brainchild of someone like John " Crush the Testicles " Yoo , but you 'd be wrong .
In Yoo 's famous memo , dated March 14 , 2003 , addressed to to William Haynes , then General Counsel at the Department of Defense , Yoo supposedly was answering Haynes / DoD 's questions concerning " both domestic and international law that might be applicable to the conduct of ... interrogations " of " alien unlawful combatants held outside the United States . "
Upon public release of the memo , it seemed to many as if Yoo were advocating an " anything goes " attitude towards torture and interrogations .
Among other instances where
Yoo stretched or distorted the law to facilitate use of coercive and heretofore illegal forms of interrogation , Yoo examined the use of mind - altering drugs on prisoners .
He noted that in the law against torture ( emphasis added ) :
... [ 18 U.S.C. ] section 2340 ( 2 ) ( B ) provides that prolonged mental harm , constituting torture , can be caused by " the administration or application or threatened administration or application , of mind - altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality . "
The statute provides no further definition of what constitutes a mind - altering substance .
The phrase " mind- altering substances " is found nowhere else in the U.S.
Code nor is it found in dictionaries .
It is , however , a commonly used synonym for drugs .
Yoo twists and massages the possible meanings of the law to make it say what he wants :
For drugs or procedures to rise to the level of " disrupt[ing ] profoundly the senses or personality , " they must produce an extreme effect .
And by requiring that they be " calculated " to produce such an effect , the statute requires that the defendant has consciously designed the acts to produce such an effect ....
By requiring that the procedures and the drugs create a profound disruption , the statute requires more than that the acts " forcibly separate " or " rend " the senses or personality .
Those acts must penetrate to the core of an individual 's ability to perceive the world around him , substantially interfering with his cognitive abilities , or fundamentally alter his personality .
According to Yoo , the " profound " nature of the disruption indicated could only be found in mental states similar to " drug - induced dementia , " " brief psychotic disorder , " obsessive - compulsive disorder , or induced suicidal or self - mutilating behavior .
Even more , he notes that the use of " truth drugs , " " where no physical harm or mental suffering was apparent , " was rejected by the State parties to the UN Convention Against Torture as " not viewed as amounting to torture per se . "
This was not Yoo 's first defense of the use of drugs in interrogation .
An article by Jeff Stein at CQ Quarterly on April 4 , 2008 cited earlier memos , as early as January and February 2002 .
The famous August 1 , 2002 Bybee memo ( not the recent OLC release ) , authorizing the use of torture , was actually written by Yoo , with the help of Vice President Cheney 's chief advisor , David Addington , and White House counsel Timothy Flanigan .
My quotes from the Yoo March 2003 memo above were copied almost line for line by Yoo from the earlier Bybee - Yoo 8/02 memo .
Out Yoo-ing Yoo
The use of drugs in interrogations by U.S. agencies is , unfortunately , nothing new , but it is illegal .
In the rewrite of the Army Field Manual , supervised by Rumsfeld right - hand man , Stephen Cambone , the Pentagon changed the wording around the use of drugs in interrogations to prohibit " drugs that may induce lasting or permanent mental alteration or damage . "
Previously , the former AFM had prohibited " chemically induced psychosis . "
So , unless that psychosis causes " lasting or permanent mental alteration or damage " -- something that is not typical with the use of psychotropic , hallucinogenic , or so - called " truth " drugs , like sodium amytal -- it 's presumably allowed in the current AFM .
Oddly ,
Yoo 's memos , which were written to provide supposed legal cover for the use of drugs and other forms of torture , appear to place the Army Field Manual 's restrictions on the use of drugs out of sync with Yoo / Addington 's legal justifications .
Yoo would disallow the use of drugs that " cause profound mental harm , " that " penetrate to the core of an individual 's ability to perceive the world around him , substantially interfering with his cognitive abilities , or fundamentally alter his personality , " and are calculated to that end -- a fairly stringent standard .
But the Army Field Manual only prohibits the use of drugs in interrogations which would cause " lasting or permanent mental alteration or damage , " a much more permissive standard than " profound mental harm , " especially when the latter is defined as something similar to " brief psychotic disorder " ( per Yoo ) .
Thus , when Cambone and Company , getting off on their oh - so - smart word games in the redraft of the AFM , removed the prohibition against " chemically induced psychosis " from the old AFM , and replaced it with their new formulation , then according to Yoo 's own analysis , the Army Field Manual now allowed the drugging of prisoners in a manner that would amount to torture .
Perhaps this is yet another reason why the former chief legal counsel for the CIA 's Counter - Terrorism Center , Jonathan Fredman , told the Senate Armed Services committee that he was concerned that the current Army Field Manual might be vulnerable to documentation of torture by criteria of the UN's Istanbul Protocol .
The latter is not a treaty or a binding document , but according to a Wikipedia article " is intended to serve as a set of international guidelines for the assessment of persons who allege torture and ill treatment , for investigating cases of alleged torture , and for reporting such findings to the judiciary and any other investigative body . "
( Note : I have used the Istanbul Protocol in my own forensic work , and the Wikipedia article is , in this instance , a good description of that document , an example of when Wikipedia works . )
Meanwhile , the Pentagon is conducting an Inspector General investigation on the drugging of detainees in DoD custody .
( Note : I gave information to the OIG on the Army Field Manual changes noted above to one of their investigators after they contacted me earlier this year . )
The intervention by the IG came at the behest of Senators Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , Joe Biden ( D - DE ) and Chuck Hagel ( R- NE ) who sent letters to " the CIA and Defense Department inspectors general calling for an investigation . "
The senators were reacting to a shocking March 2008 article by Joby Warrick in the Washington Post alleging use of drugs on " detainees . "
( See more in this article by Stephen Soldz . )
It 's not known if , when complete , the report will be made public .
A DoD member connected to that investigation did not return my request for information on its progress .
The ACLU has begun a campaign for accountabilty for those involved in the torture program .
This campaign is not only about what happened in the Bush years .
As the case of the Army Field Manual vividly demonstrates , accountability extends to the actions of politicians , medical personnel , and military and intelligence officers working today .
The ACLU campaign has created a simple set of web tools that anyone can easily use to make their voices heard that torture is unacceptable , in any administration , at any time .
The torture issue stands at the heart of what America has been , where it is now , and what it will become .
No one can be neutral on this issue .
To do nothing is to allow the worst crimes to be done in our names .

When Torture Kills : Ten Murders In US Prisons In Afghanistan , by Andy Worthington
The prelude to two notorious murders — and , very possibly , three others — in the US prison at Bagram airbase began in the summer of 2002 , when 14 soldiers from the 525th Military Intelligence Brigade at Fort Bragg arrived at the prison , led by Lt. Carolyn Wood , and were soon joined by six Arabic - speaking reservists from the Utah National Guard .
Lt. Wood took over interrogations from a team led by an interrogator who later wrote a book about his experiences , The Interrogators , using the pseudonym Chris Mackey .
This is how I described what happened next in The Guantánamo Files ....
Andy has also posted a valuable story on the recent delay on the release of the CIA Inspector General report on CIA torture .

It is very likely a hoax indeed .
The resonant frequency of an object is determined largely by its size , among other material and environmental factors .
Also , resonant frequency is probably not enough to kill a chicken , even if it is very loud .
The resonant frequency of the human head is somewhere within the range of 20 to 30 hertz ( please correct me on this data ) .
Ideally , an object 's resonant frequency will increase as its size decreases , and since a chicken 's skull is smaller than that of a human's , the resonant frequency of a chicken 's skull must be at least 100 or 200 hertz .
Yet again , I would appreciate numbers from anyone who knows such an obscure detail , as I cannot do the field work myself .
Considering that the low B on a 5 - string bass resonates at a frequency of 30.8677 Hertz , and all the de-tuning that goes on in modern metal , anti-nu- metal zealots may have something scientific to squawk about now .
BEIRUT , Lebanon 
In an implicit rebuke to Iran ’s ruling elite , a conservative presidential candidate warned Sunday that the political and social rifts opened by the disputed June 12 vote and subsequent crackdown could lead to the nation ’s “ disintegration ” if they were not resolved soon .
The candidate , Mohsen Rezai , made his warning in a long statement about the election and its bloody aftermath , in which he called for reconciliation and spoke about the danger of “ imprisoning ” the legacy of the Islamic Revolution in divisive and shortsighted politics .
The statement was posted on his Web site .
Although his message was largely nonpartisan , Mr. Rezai hinted that the government response after the election had been unfair , and he urged protesters to continue their work in legal and nonviolent channels .
Like the three other opposition candidates , Mr. Rezai , a former chief of the elite Revolutionary Guards , initially said he believed that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s landslide victory involved ballot - rigging .
Mr. Rezai later withdrew his legal challenge to the results , citing the need for unity .

To make the move to a sustainable future where people are no longer threatened by an ecological catastrophe will require a number of things –- above all a strong and broad movement with effective and intelligent leadership and an accurate understanding of the current problems and how they can be overcome .
Sadly , only some parts of this constellation of forces are in place today .
In particular the green movement is not an effective political and social movement and the left is still in disarray , largely concerned with defensive politics and harking back to a world long gone .
As for ideas and analysis of the situation and what needs to be done , some powerful critiques of the current economic orthodoxies have recently appeared that set out an alternative way in which the wellbeing and prosperity of the population can be achieved and maintained .
However , these contributions are insufficient since they do not provide a sufficiently profound diagnosis of the causes of the problem .
Without such a diagnosis there can be no convincing prescription for a remedy .
But the situation is even worse than that .
There is also no convincing approach to obtaining the necessary changes .
The situation is not unlike that which Frederick Engels faced in the 1870s when he wrote Socialism , Utopian and Scientific .
Engels respected the utopian socialists Saint - Simon , Fourier and Robert Owen for their identification of the dire effects of the super - exploitative capitalist system as its growth gained speed in the first half of the 19th century .
But he pointed out that they had not understood the generative mechanisms by which it dominated society and caused these dire consequences for working people .
Nor had they any convincing praxis -- that is to say they neither had a theory of how its domination might be ended nor a programme for hastening that end .
He counterposed scientific socialism -- that is socialism that has an understanding of the causes of class dominance and the role of the working class in their own emancipation -- with utopian socialism which named the problem , proposed utopian alternatives , but was idealist in the sense that it thought it would be enough to convince enough people of the rightness of the alternative way .
It will be argued here that an analogous situation exists today with regard to the agenda of sustainability and specifically with the idea that economic growth is not sustainable .
There is still a striking consensus about the nature of the economic development that is needed , not just in the UK but on a global scale .
The main political parties , business , the unions , the international agencies , the so - called economists and the pundits in the media all assume that economic growth must continue , year on year .
First we need to look at the argument against this .
The problem with economic growth
Growth over the last 10 years in the UK has averaged 2.64 % p.a. -- an economy that doubles in size every 26 years .
The global economy is almost 5 times the size it was 50 years ago .
It is generally assumed that around 3 % growth per annum is healthy for an economy .
Such growth has an environmental cost .
The ecological footprint of the UK is 5.3 hectares per person -- that is to say we each depend on that area for our consumables , recreation , carbon sequestration and so on .
But the available ‘ biocapacity ’ of the UK provides little more than half that ( 3.7 ) -- a negative ecological debt .
As growth increases our ecological debt increases along with that of all the other countries .
As the Global Footprint Network puts it :
Today humanity uses the equivalent of 1.3 planets to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste .
This means it now takes the Earth one year and four months to regenerate what we use in a year .
Moderate UN scenarios suggest that if current population and consumption trends continue , by the mid 2030s we will need the equivalent of two Earths to support us .
And of course , we only have one .
Turning resources into waste faster than waste can be turned back into resources puts us in global ecological overshoot , depleting the very resources on which human life and biodiversity depend .
Some have suggested that it is possible to decouple growth from material throughput -- that is to make growth happen without corresponding growth in resource inputs ( fuel , food , materials ) and waste outputs ( emissions of all sorts ) -- having our cake without getting obese .
But the evidence , as reviewed by Tim Jackson , Economics Commissioner for the UK government ’s Sustainable Development Commission is that only a relative reduction in throughput is feasible .
The absolute level of resources needed and waste produced continues to rise .
So the ecological overshoot or ecological debt just goes on getting worse .
This problem is brought into stark relief by two fatal challenges :
Peak energy .
Oil , gas , uranium and even coal are at or approaching the point at which the rate of exploitation of resources falls behind the rate of use .
This means an energy crunch .
We had a taste of this in 2008 with oil prices rising steeply .
That was mostly a result of speculation , but this kind of volatility is likely to increase as the gap between exploitation and usage widens .
Climate change .
All the indications are that the situation is far worse than had been anticipated .
Positive feedback effects ( ‘ non-linearities ’ ) magnify the impact of the rising carbon dioxide levels but they had n’t been properly understood and accounted ( for example by the earlier International Panel on Climate Change reports ) and hence government targets , already too little and too late , now appear to be dramatically inadequate .
The first problem makes economic growth , reliant on its energy subsidy , implausible .
The second problem makes it suicidal .
Utopian sustainability
We can refer to two sources as representative of utopian sustainability .
First , the work of the New Economics Foundation ( NEF ) , for example the New Green Deal paper published in 2008 and the work on alternative indicators of wellbeing to gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Second , work by the Sustainable Development Commission ( SDC ) , for example the critique of economic growth cited above .
However , while critical of these efforts it is important to be very clear that they are fine so far as they go .
More , they are a vital source for a ‘ scientific ’ approach to sustainability despite their utopian , or should we say Fabian , flavour .
The problem then is that although they present sound critiques of the effects , they offer no analysis of the systemic causes .
Moreover their utopian proposals come with no analysis of how changes can be brought about– there is little or no theory of action , just a ‘ tell - and - hope ’ reformism .
Roots of the growth fetish
What we can call the growth fetish has multiple roots .
These can be divided into the ideological , the practical and the systemic .
Firstly , a belief in the inevitability and necessity of growth seems like common sense .
The idea of progress , of living better than our parents did is ingrained in our culture .
As noted above , hardly anyone questions this -- it is the current currency of political and economic discourse , both for those within the system and for many of those critical of it .
But , common sense is not the same thing as good sense .
It reflects the dominant interests in the social system , and in this case , as we will see , the ideology reflects and supports the interests of capital -- the growth fetish is hegemonic .
Secondly , growth has a practical appeal in the context of responding to social ills .
Where the cake is growing it seems not to matter if people ’s shares are unequal , so long as they are all growing .
This is actually illusory on two counts .
Firstly , there is evidence ( collated by NEF among others ) that since the mid 1970s economic growth has not been associated with rises in life - satisfaction .
Secondly , this model of an increasing but unequally shared cake is flawed as a recipe for societal wellbeing : there is persuasive evidence that more unequal societies have a greater level of social ills , not just for the poor but for all strata .
Moreover , an unequally divided cake that grows becomes means an accentuation of the inequalities in absolute terms .
Flawed it may be but this supposed practical root of he growth fetish has an extraordinary appeal -- maybe because it seems to postpone or even avoid the need for more profound , and difficult , social reform .
It therefore adds to the ideological support for the growth fetish .
Systemic causes of the addiction to growth
The root cause of the growth fetish , however , does not lie in the ideological realm but rather is to be found in the inherent and defining feature of capitalism , the dominant economic system under and within which the majority of the earth ’s population now lives -- an economic and social system that for some 200 years has efficiently created an explosion in production , access to goods and commodities , technological sophistication , population , longevity and knowledge .
The motor for this has been capital , something that within this system has the propensity to increase .
That increase in capital is based fundamentally on exploitation -- of workers , consumers and natural resources .
capitalism , then is first and foremost a system that reproduces capital , that is to say it accumulates capital .
To do this every social process is commodified : exchange , production , distribution , investment -- previously conducted through media other than markets .
And no social transaction is exempt from this process of commodification .
To endlessly accumulate capital it is necessary to extract profit .
This is done at various points in the system , and most obviously in the theft of surplus value from workers and the unequal exchange between the core areas of the system and the primary resource producing areas .
Without unequal exchange capitalism cannot work .
capitalism establishes institutions to support itself , the state with its legal and governmental system , the educational system , the welfare systems , and the armed forces .
When unequal exchange is threatened , the legal and military systems are brought into action .
capitalism as a system that reproduces capital must ever expand , finding new markets , new cheaper workforces , and new sources of raw materials , new products and new means of production .
This is because the reproduction of capital means that there is always an oversupply .
This means that new investment opportunities are continually sought .
The oversupply problem has been a major contributor to the historical cycles in the world economy .
Currently this is compounded by excess productive capacity and the suppression of wages since the late 70s -- hence the extension of credit .
capitalism then tends toward crisis .
capital , then , has to grow -- that is the condition for its survival .
It is this inexorable and inherent dynamic of capital accumulation that causes the growth fetish , the addiction to growth .
Because there are powerful interests linked to this source of growth , telling the facts about the sustainability of economic growth will have little or no impact .
The system simply cannot learn another way , it would be like suggesting that human beings should not drink water and the calls for sustainable growth are like saying ‘ well let them drink tea instead ’ .
It is the failure of the ‘ utopian ’ advocates of sustainability to properly identify the logic of capital accumulation as the root cause of the growth fetish that marks their distance from an adequate ‘ scientific ’ understanding of the nature of the problem and its resolution .
In that sense they stand in a similar place as the C19th utopian socialists , incapable of doing more than calling to people of good will in the hope that their ideas will -- against all the evidence – be taken up by a system that is fundamentally opposed to them -- that knows no other way than capital accumulation and the associated economic growth .
Scientific socialism
Now this term ‘ scientific ’ , used by Engels in his famous pamphlet , needs some explanation and justification .
Engels explained the term as follows :
These two great discoveries , the materialistic conception of history and the revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus - value , we owe to Marx .
With these discoveries Socialism became a science .
The next thing was to work out its details and relations .
Engels is pointing here to the systematic and evidence - based revelation of the underlying , historical causes of the features of the economic and social system .
Socialism was the desirable state and he and Marx never lost the humanist , ethical impulse that inspired their work t that end , but ethical direction was not enough there had to be a proper grounding .
As he indicates , this was work in progress , never finished by he and Marx , either in terms of the full analysis of the system or in terms of what the socialist alternative would look like .
The analogy with natural science is helpful , so far as it goes :
Active social forces work exactly like natural forces ; blindly , forcibly , destructively , so long as we do not understand and reckon with them .
But once we understand them , when once we grasp their action , their direction , their effects , it depends only upon ourselves to subject them more and more to our own will , and by means of them to reach their own ends .
And this holds especially of the mighty productive forces of today .
As long as we obstinately refuse to understand the nature and the character of these social means of action – and this understanding goes against the grain of the capitalist mode of production and its defenders -- so long these forces are at work in spite of us , in opposition to us , so long they master us …
Engels is not suggesting that social forces are exactly like physical forces ( he alludes to the ideological component in the last sentence ) , but he is pointing out that attempts at reform that take no account of their workings will be doomed to failure .
For Marx and Engels two key ideas made the connection between a scientific political economy as explanation of capitalist exploitation and the programme of the struggle for socialism : contradictions and class struggle .
Contradictions
The complex system that is capitalism , being composed of different elements in motion , requiring simultaneous coordination but pulling in different directions , creates internal contradictions that force it into recurrent crises .
Marx and Engels pointed to the contradiction between forces of production and relations of production -- putting large groups of workers together meant creating new social relations , a new social force , the proletariat that by its concentration was able to organise together .
Similarly the need to educate sections of the labour force also led to proletariat becoming more self - aware , more able to diagnose what was wrong with the world and to provide counter - system information , and persuasion .
They also showed how the expansion of production contradicted the impoverishment of working people leading to repeated crises of oversupply and underconsumption , leading to the cycle of boom and bust ( in Engels ’ day about every ten years ) .
It was through its contradictions that the old order would be ended , although these would not be enough on their own without the key social movement of the working class .
Struggle and the movement
Engels and Marx saw the struggle for socialism as the struggle of classes ; that is as the struggle between groupings with contradictory interests , defined by their position within the system of capitalist production and capital accumulation .
capitalism would fall through the increasing power of the proletariat , itself created by capitalism ( another contradiction ) that would eventually overthrow the bourgeois order , either through revolution or through the ballot box .
Scientific sustainability
What does this analogy with scientific socialism tell us about the process of achieving sustainability in a system that is even more dominated by the power of capital than was the case in the C19th ?
An answer will be attempted , in outline here , in relation to the two key Marxist concepts of contradiction and struggle .
Contradictions and crisis
capitalism , throughout its existence has been faced with repeated crises resulting from the internal contradictions it generates .
Time and time again has it overcome these contradictions , showing a strategic flexibility that Marx and Engels cold not have imagined .
These crises have largely been crises in capital accumulation driven by the falling rate of profit , the saturation of markets , the successful struggles of workers and other ‘ subaltern ’ populations , and the excessive productive capacity of the system .
Each time ‘ fixes ’ have been found , technological , social , military , political , and financial , sometimes applied separately and sometimes together .
Without going into a detailed analysis of these fixes , the following can be identified as particularly significant :
Employment of new , cheap forms of energy ( the energy subsidies ) .
Development of new technologies for production , distribution or as commodity lines to sell .
Importation of cheaper labour or outsourcing of production to sites with cheaper labour .
Use of internationally distributed operations to play one currency against another and evade taxation .
Creation of and expansion into new markets .
The use of state power to provide subsidies ( e.g. education and training for the workforce , health and welfare , infrastructure whether canals or satellite communications ) .
The use of state power to subdue internal or external threats to capital accumulation by legislation , force or economic sanctions and incentives .
The turning of areas of social life and nature into commodities ( e.g. urban space , water , beaches , folk music , mutual aid and so on ) that can be traded or the return of such areas to the market ( e.g. the privatisation of public services ) and hence as nodes of capital accumulation and the transfer of public assets into private hands .
The formation of cartels , whether as commercial trusts or through the legitimised international policy instruments of the World trade Organisation , IMF , World Bank , European Union , NAFTA and so on .
Financialisation – the hyper - development of credit and debt into generators of capital for example through gambling on stocks , speculation and the invention of complex financial instruments .
The most recent phase of capitalist expansion , the neoliberal period , has been characterised by the deployment of all these elements in concert .
As a result the capitalist model until very recently seemed unassailable .
Yet as the present situation clearly demonstrates , the contradictions are coming home to roost again .
And while up to now it has been the internal contradictions of capital that have created crises , now there are both internal contradictions and contradictions between the capitalist forces of production and the natural environment on which they depend ( the contradiction between production economy and earth economy ) .
So at this moment the world is faced with a set of interlocked crises -- the financial crash and recession , the food crisis , the energy crisis , the water crisis , climate change , and the accompanying legitimation crises that take differing forms in different global locations and in different social sectors .
It is these contradictions and their resultant crises that provide the key to a transition to a different sustainable system .
We do not know the precise point at which the contradictions will prove fatal for capital accumulation .
Nor do we know how bloody that end will be .
But what is now beyond doubt is that capitalism , at least in its totalising dominant viral expansionist mode will end through a combination of internal and external contradictions that can not be fixed .
It is possible , indeed likely , that a restricted capitalism will continue in certain sectors , but it can not continue to be the one principle that structures the whole economy and therefore ( in the last analysis ) all social arrangements .
However , these contradictions and crises will not just end unsustainable capitalist growth by themselves ; this depends on there being a protagonist -- the midwife of history .
Struggle and social movements
For Marx and Engels the protagonist , the midwife of history was to be the proletariat , the class consisting of those forced by ( socially constructed ) economic realities to sell their labour power to capital .
But more than a century later that protagonist no longer exists in the same form .
To be sure global capital has its proletariat , concentrated in the factories of China , the maquilas of Mexico , the polytunnels of Murcia , and these sectors will continue to struggle against their exploiters .
Yet while both wings of he socialist movement , Leninist and social democrat were founded in and of the proletariat as collective subject of transition to a new world , in none of the transformative 20th century revolutions was the proletariat the decisive protagonist ( although they played their part in each ) .
From the Mexican revolution through the Russian , Chinese , Cuban , Algerian and Vietnamese revolutions in no case was it the proletarian mass power that led the transformation .
This was only the case in the failed revolutions of the metropolitan countries .
Only in the reformist case of mitigated capitalism , best seen in Scandinavia , could it be said that the proletarian movement was the hegemonic component .
And today in Latin America the progressive protagonists in Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador and elsewhere are again to be found in other sectors , chiefly in the alliance between sectors ( Indigenous communities , the urban masses of the barrios , the landless peasants ) whose exclusion has been more profound even than that of the proletariat ( who after all are within the system of production and reproduction of capital ) and other unorthodox elements such as progressive clergy and sections of the military .
However , the most profound areas of contradiction at present , the final limits of the capitalist mode of production ( and reproduction ) , are to be found in the twin areas of climate change and peak energy .
So for anyone concerned with sustainability as a goal , having analysed why the system is unsustainable -- growth based on capital accumulation – must identify a protagonist adequate to the challenge .
And having identified that protagonist it is necessary to nurture it , just as Marx and Engels did with the embryonic proletarian movement .
Gramsci
Who is that protagonist , that collective subject , that midwife of history at the start of the 21st century ?
For this it is helpful to turn to the insights of Antonio Gramsci , the founder of the Italian communist party who was the first to systematically apply Marxist analysis to the more complex order of capitalism in a liberal democratic context .
This is not to say that Gramsci ’s context was the same as ours today -- further insights will be necessary .
However his key contribution was the analysis of the role of ideas in collective action -- essentially the roles of ideology and the nature of leadership in a mass movement .
Gramsci emphasised how a bloc of interests can come together under a leadership that can offer a unifying ideology .
That ideology will not be total -- different interest groups will be attracted by different facets of it and will pick and mix elements .
The ideology will hold the movement together and the leadership will adapt it to circumstances .
For Gramsci that leadership is composed of organic intellectuals -- intellectuals who serve not the dominant system but the movement , and are embedded within it , learning their craft within the movement .
He also identifies the collective nature of the leadership of a social movement -- in his case that was the party -- with the metaphor of the Modern Prince -- Machiavelli ’s statesman who showed adaptability , firmness , cunning and forethought , transformed into an ethical subject that coordinated the actions of the movement .
Gramsci ’s notions then are quite some way from those of the Leninists who have dominated the radical left with notions of vanguard .
They are also miles away from both the cynical electoral / media / power nexus politics of what is left of the social democratic movement , or the self - indulgent and ineffectual anarchism that pervades the Green movement ( when it is n’t being Fabian ) .
A reading of Gramsci ’s politics for today ( for we want to use his ideas today not in their actual context of the 1920s ) is that of the progressive coalition united in diversity with an adaptive core ideology that is inclusive not exclusive for all those that want to end the unsustainable system of capitalism -- planetary consumption .
Concretely this means that the protagonist has to be the broad social movement of green and left activists , trade unionists , food activists , minority rights , social and trade justice activists and internationalists .
But this movement has still to be built , using local , national and international struggles as the focus , with a shared programme for transformation from capitalism to a sustainable socialist alternative .
It will be essential to peel off layers of those who up to now have seen their fate as linked to capitalism , whether they are leaders who have developed their cities through capital - funded regeneration , legislators who have tried to ameliorate capitalism through regulation and limited redistributive policies , consumers who are waking up to the con of unsustainable consumption , state officials who have until now seen their role as administering the policy recipes of neoliberal capitalism and academics who have had enough of adapting their thought , teaching and research to the dictates of the god of endless consumption and growth , accountants who now get their sums right and find they just do n’t add up .
The form , programme , strategy , tactics -- the leadership -- of such a movement have yet to emerge but without it there is no chance of the kind of sustainable future that the utopian advocates of sustainability have promoted .
They have taken us so far but now is the time to get scientific -- in the best Marxian sense of the word -- to understand profoundly and to act .
Internationalism and localism
capitalism is a global system .
Like the life of an animal it exists at the micro ( workplace , shop , household : molecular and cellular ) level , at the meso ( firm , organ ) level and at the macro level ( conglomerate , industry , economy , state : whole animal ) as well as existing over time from generation to generation and through nested cycles of energy transactions , production , consumption , reproduction .
Everywhere you look you see it .
Everywhere you turn it is there before you .
More than that it is you -- in your food , your thoughts , your emotions and the systems that tie these together .
Around you and in you and beyond you .
This means that it has to be fought in many places at once –- locally , nationally , globally , through local projects , conversations , struggles , alliances and through actions that tie together across territories and globally .
While we take the view that the bioregional level is particularly important for interventions that prefigure ( another Gramscian reference ) a better way of organising society , this is not to deny the importance of making alliances at other levels .
It is not enough to think globally -- act locally .
It is necessary to act and think both locally and globally -- just like capital does .
Reform and revolution
Much of what has been written above will sound revolutionary and unremittingly oppositional .
The system is dominant but its dominance is not complete .
Those working within its institutions are not its unthinking servants , and their actions are not entirely constrained and determined by capital .
There are various spaces where capital has been tamed -- for example within the institutions of the local state , or where alternative social and even economic modes are in play , if only partially -- like cooperatives and some non-government and community organisations .
Working for transformation , being part of the new to - be - hegemonic social movement requires a strategy of simultaneous insider -- outsider tactics .
Where a city administration is working on a climate change action plan , for example , it is essential both to work with them to develop the plan and to work outside to keep up the pressure for real and radical action .
Indeed we should aim for proposals that cannot be delivered under capitalism as part of a broader strategy of weakening the very causes of unsustainable economic activity , both to change the system but also because such proposals are the right thing to support -- in this case the only way to deliver carbon reductions of sufficient size to avert catastrophic warming .
As an infamous politician would say -- There Is No Alternative .
An example of such a transitional demand could be the work on macroeconomic policy in Tim Jackson ’s SDS report -- not that it will have been conceived in these terms -- the intention seems to have been more naïvely Fabian in style .
He sets out the problem to be tackled like this :
…. when demand falls , revenues to firms are reduced and this leads to job losses and reduced investment .
Reduced investment leads to a lower capital stock which , together with a lower labour input , in turn reduces the productive capability of the economy .
Output falls and with less money in the economy , public revenues also fall , debt is more difficult to service and the system has a tendency to become unstable .
But does it have to work like this ?
Is it possible to configure the conventional macro-economic variables in such a way as to reduce the imperative for growth and yet maintain economic stability ?
One potential avenue of exploration is to attempt a stabilisation of economic output by altering the role or relative importance of key variables ( such as consumption , investment , public spending and so on ) within the basic macro-economic model .
Jackson explores the parameters for a national economy that does not depend on economic growth are explored drawing on the Canadian scenarios of Peter Victor .
Jackson concludes that it is possible to have an economy with low growth / resource throughput with both unemployment and poverty halved .
This depends in part on reducing working hours .
However , greenhouse gas emissions on this model only reduce slowly .
Jackson himself adds a number of cautions :
These conditions will still include a strong requirement for economic stability .
Or perhaps ‘ resilience ’ would be a better word for what is required here .
A sustainable economy must be capable of resisting the exogenous shocks and avoid the internal contradictions which have caused chaos in the last year .
But the requirement for resilience will need to be augmented by conditions that address distributional equity , impose sustainable levels of resource throughput , and provide for the protection of critical natural capital .
In operational terms , this new macro-economy will require enhanced investment in public infrastructures , in sustainable technologies and in ecosystem maintenance .
It is likely to demand a different balance between public and private goods .
It will require us to reframe our concepts of productivity and profitability .
Above all , a new macro-economics for sustainability will be ecologically and socially literate , ending the folly of separating economy from society and environment .
But in outlining these conditions has n’t Jackson identified enough reasons why a system built on capital accumulation cannot deliver this ?
Yet the need to understand how to manage a macro-economy in a different way is a real need for a transitional strategy .
The Russian , Chinese and Cuban revolutions all faced major challenges in this regard with resulting oscillations in economic policy .
An understanding of how to manage the capitalist economy into something else is clearly required by strategists of scientific sustainability : without it the likelihood is of a nightmare scenario of rising civil strife , rising poverty and political instability with the key need to rapidly move to a low carbon future severely compromised .
Conclusion
Political change comes from leadership and popular mobilisation .
And you need both of them .
It has been argued that the valuable work done by bodies such as the NEF and SDS on the zero growth sustainable economy suffer from a kind of utopianism .
That is to say they do not fully take account of the systemic causes of the growth fetish .
Nor do they identify what conditions could bring about its replacement , and as such they are bereft of political strategy .
It is argued that the root cause of the growth addiction is the system of capitalism with its central motor of capital accumulation .
Moreover it is argued that the internal and increasingly the external contradictions of that system will push it into a terminal crisis .
However , that crisis will not simply arrive and usher in a new era of sanity .
It will require a broad social movement , broader than any we have seen yet , with an intelligent and strategic leadership .
That leadership will not be based in a traditional political party but in a network of activist thinkers who share a common vision and agreement on the main dimensions of strategy .
That movement and that leadership will gather strength in the months and years to come , and its nature will change over time , in response to changing conditions .
But it is the duty of everyone who wants a sustainable and equitable future to build that movement and that leadership and to do that with unprecedented rapidity , for there is no time to lose .

The Editors of the Microsnooze .
The week before the next company meeting the Micronews had a drawing on the front page of a bunch of happy Softies in a car .
A little sign pointing in the direction of the car showed that they were headed to the meeting .
In those days we had two meetings a year and they were even more boring than they are now .
So we decided to put out a prank Micronews .
A person who has asked to remain anonymous had recently referred to the Micronews as " Microsnooze " , so we borrowed the name .
A little hacking with a pen and scissors and the cover drawing showed happy Softies leaving the meeting .
And we came up with many more funny stories , mostly referring to various things that had happened in the previous year or so .
Again , a midnight dispersal ( by the four of us , with the help of one of Raymond 's friends , Michel Jackson ) .
For some reason , a whole bunch of people decided that Karl Schulmeisters and Dave Perlin had done it .
While they were good friends of ours , they in fact had nothing to do with it .
One of the articles in the next issue was adamant about this point ... which of course merely convinced those people that they 'd done it all the more .
We did a second issue timed for April First , which was preceded by a press release announcing it .
SteveB had liked the first issue quite a bit , so we made even more fun of him in the second one .
Apparently we pushed it too far , although I think most people still enjoyed it .
But we decided that we should quit while we were ahead .
About a year later , Raymond and Todd left the company .
The Editors of the Microsnooze were dead .
A few years later , Dave Norris and I found out that the company had paid an enormous amount of money to some logo designer for an astonishingly bland new logo .
We got some buttons made , and made a memo showing the history of the Microsnooze logo ( 6 of them ! ) , with some sarcasm attacking the need to change logos and various other silly labeling and packaging things , and signed it " The Editors of the Microsnooze " , even though Todd and Raymond were gone .
One Sunday night Dave and I and several others ( for the first time including the maligned Karl Schulmeisters and Dave Perlin ) distributed 1000 of these memos and a " Save the Blibbet " button to every office chair on campus .
We ran a little short , so we had to have a few more made and distributed them a few days later .
Apparently a lot of people knew who'd done it , as one old timer pointed out to me one of the logos we 'd missed .
