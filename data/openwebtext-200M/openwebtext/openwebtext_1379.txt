BELLEVUE , Wash .
 Nathan Myhrvold wants to shake up the marketplace for ideas .
His mission and the activities of the company he heads , Intellectual Ventures , a secretive $ 5 billion investment firm that has scooped up 30,000 patents , inspire admiration and angst .
Admirers of Mr. Myhrvold , the scientist who led Microsoft ’s technology development in the 1990s , see an innovator seeking to elevate the economic role and financial rewards for inventors whose patented ideas are often used without compensation by big technology companies .
His detractors see a cynical operator deploying his bulging patent trove as a powerful bargaining chip , along with the implied threat of costly litigation , to prod high - tech companies to pay him lucrative fees .
They call his company “ Intellectual Vultures . ”
White hat or black hat , Intellectual Ventures is growing rapidly and becoming a major force in the marketplace for intellectual capital .
Its rise comes as Congress is considering legislation , championed by large technology companies , that would make it more difficult for patent holders to win large damage awards in court  changes that Mr. Myhrvold has opposed in Congressional testimony and that his company has lobbied against .
Intellectual Ventures spent more than $ 1 million on lobbying last year , according to public filings compiled by OpenSecrets.org .
In the three most recent election cycles  2006 , 2008 and 2010  Intellectual Ventures executives , led by Mr. Myhrvold , have contributed more than $ 1 million to Democratic and Republican candidates and committees .
According to the Energy Information Administration , the U.S. imports about 60 % of its oil , with more than two - thirds of it used for transportation .
Oil is essential to the basic functioning of the global economy , from the production of goods in factories overseas and across the country to their delivery to local markets .
Without oil our military would not be able to defend the country from external threats .
In short , we are critically dependent on this non-renewable resource .
The vital importance of oil and the corresponding impulse to control or safeguard its supply and price has led to repeated Western interventions in the Middle East and other parts of the world , sparking militant nationalist and revolutionary movements and causing deep and lasting resentments .
In the case of the Middle East , outside intervention against secular nationalist movements has led to the rise of Islamist terrorism as an alternative solution for a relatively small but very determined minority .
Though limited military action may be necessary in the short term to respond to this threat , America ’s long - term security ultimately requires intelligent public policy in support of a vibrant domestic market for renewable energy .
Our dependence on foreign sources of energy has made America vulnerable to militant religious fundamentalists spawned by repressive regimes — elites whom our government has in some cases covertly placed in power and whom it is pressured to continue to support , either due to lack of friendly , viable alternatives or fear of the unpredictable outcomes of successful popular movements .
To minimize such vulnerabilities and the moral and security dilemmas they create , we must put an end to the mad pursuit of fossil fuels across these war - torn and politically volatile parts of the world .
As a matter of civic responsibility and obligation to the men and women who keep us secure , the American people should press their elected representatives to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy .
The longer our elected officials remain beholden to powerful private interests , the more our families and communities will suffer .
Supporting our troops means not only taking care of them when they get home but also working to minimize the likelihood of them being sent into harm ’s way in the first place .
This effort will not be without formidable political obstacles .
Supposed conservative media figures have in recent months frequently insinuated that subsidies to the renewable energy industry are socialistic — a damning term among true conservatives — while conspicuously neglecting to point out that the much more well - established fossil fuel industry received over $ 72 billion in federal subsidies from 2002 - 2008 .
Federal subsidies to the wind and solar industries amounted to about one - sixth of this figure in the same time period based on the Environmental Law Institute ’s figures .
Since America was founded , our government has always provided limited support for innovation in emerging markets that further the national interest .
Clean energy should be no exception .
Alexander Hamilton , Founding Father and first Secretary of the Treasury , was a strong advocate for government support of industrialization as a matter of national security .
The case for government support to the renewable energy industry is no less urgent but will require sustained public pressure from across the political spectrum against entrenched private interests conflicting with the national interest .

Lenin Rediscovered : What Is To Be Done ?
In Context
By Lars T. Lih , Haymarket Books , Chicago 2008 , 840 pages
Review by Barry Healy
If a spectre haunted 19th century Europe , as Marx said of the embryonic communist movement , then the name of Lenin was no ghost for the 20th century bourgeoisie , it was a terrifying reality .
For the capitalists , with Leninism the communist phantom came howling out of the underworld , beginning with the 1917 Russian Revolution , sweeping whole continents clean of capitalist rule .
Millions of human beings found their life ’s purpose in learning from and extending into their own national contexts the ideas of Lenin .
Epic intellectual – and sometimes bitter , physical – conflicts have been waged over the meaning of Lenin ’s ideas .
Among leftists , the Trotskyists in particular , to their ever - lasting credit , argued for a revolutionary , liberationist reading of Lenin , in defiance of Stalin ’s bureaucratic evisceration , often at the cost of their lives .
On the right , a whole industry of conservative , Cold War warrior intellectuals has made an easy living proving that Lenin really opposed the independence of the working class and that his ideas led straight to Stalinism .
Their logic is that no matter how unhappy workers may feel under capitalism , they dare not tamper with the world as it is ; anything is better than the dread Leninism / Stalinism .
Better that we trudge to work each day with our eyes downcast than dream of utopias , these dreary bourgeois ideologues intone .
Their reactionary accounts almost invariably focus on one book by Lenin ( but not its entirety ) : What Is to Be Done ?
Just three words plucked from two famous paragraphs are the source of all Leninism ’s supposed faults : “ spontaneity ” , “ divert ” and “ from without ” .
Upon this rickety scaffold it is claimed that Lenin feared workers ’ spontaneous development , wanted to divert it from its natural course by the arrogant intervention of non-workers and hoped to create a new , undemocratic , centralised “ vanguard ” party operating conspiratorially .
Essentially , he is depicted as dishonestly pretending to uphold Marxist orthodoxy .
What Is to Be Done ?
So , a fundamental starting point for all readings of Lenin , be they revolutionary , Stalinist or bourgeois reactionary , is this short 1902 booklet .
Subtitled “ Burning Questions of Our Movement ” , it was a contribution to a debate within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ( RSDLP ) that culminated in the famous split in the movement at its 1903 congress , where the words Bolshevik ( majority ) and Menshevik ( minority ) first entered history .
Lenin was arguing for a new type of party organisation for the RSDLP , which came to be known as the “ Leninist vanguard ” party .
Between Trotskyists and Stalinists there developed , especially after WWII , a struggle to best exemplify this Bolshevik principle , leading to all kinds of distortions .
Stalinists , infamously , self - ordained as the working - class leadership , believed that they could dispense with such niceties as , for example , democracy in trade union elections , or freedom of thought within their organisations or the workers ’ movement as a whole .
Trotskyists , vying to outshine the Stalinists with their ardour , often displayed voluntarism ( the practice , seen as a virtue , of demanding unrealistic levels of commitment ) that was personally and organisationally destructive .
A terrible irony is that the Trotskyist movement produced some of the worst , egomaniacal leaders , dedicated to combating the Stalinist cult of the personality through constructing their own .
Such names as Juan Posadas , Michel Pablo , Gerry Healy and Jack Barnes mean little outside the tiny circle of initiates , but those individuals did much to besmirch the name of Leon Trotsky by attempting to claim his mantle , and through him Lenin .
Reactionary conservatives delight in exposing all this and drawing a line between Lenin and the foolishness perpetrated in his name .
All sins begin , they claim , with Lenin ’s elitist and manipulative attitude towards the working class and often their jaded reading of What Is to Be Done ? is their starting point .
As the Bolivarian Revolution emanating from Latin America forges a new tradition of socialism of the 21st century , Lars Lih , without stating it , has made an important contribution towards creating a “ Leninism of the 21st century ” .
He has brought penetrating linguistic expertise and an ability to forensically dig deep in the archives to bring Lenin ’s original conceptions to light .
Lih ’s project
In What Is to Be Done ? , Lenin refers to a small number of people on nearly every page , Lih points out : Elena Kuskova and Sergei Prokopovich of the Credo group , K.M. Taktarev of Rabochaia mysl , Boris Krichevskii and Alexandr Martynov and “ b - v ” ( pseudonym for Boris Savinkov ) of Rabochee delo , L. Nadezhdin of Svoboda and the Joint Letter ( which was sent to Iskra by a group of Siberian exiles ) .
Most of these barely even rate as historical footnotes anymore .
Lih ’s project is to trawl through all the Russian - language original texts that Lenin mentions ( even in passing ) , extract their meaning ( often through methodical examination of Russian grammar and tracing problems of translation ) , compare them to the overall thinking of the international socialist movement of the time , dominated as it was by the German Social Democratic Party , and explain how the debates played out within the RSDLP .
All that , plus argue a case against what he calls the “ textbook ” interpretation of What Is to Be Done ?
The “ textbook interpretation ” is that long held by both academics ( usually anti-Leninists ) and those Lih calls “ activists ” : Paul Le Blanc , Tony Cliff and other socialist leaders .
( Lih does not distinguish Stalinist “ activists ” from anti-Stalinists ; Stalinism simply does not enter into his scheme of things . )
This is all topped off with his own translation of What Is to Be Done ?
No wonder it ’s a door - stopper of a book and no wonder seemingly endless pages argue for a fine definition of , say , a particular Russian word or why an translation from 1929 , which has been carried through later editions , is inaccurate .
This is an academic tome , but only such a work could do service to Lih ’s project , which is to completely renew our understanding of Lenin and Leninism .
It is to Lih ’s credit that he successfully steers the reader through this hall of mirrors .
Lenin ’s project
Is it actually legitimate for the disparate voices asserting Lenin as their source to claim as their own What Is to Be Done ?
Lih quotes Lenin , writing in the preface to a 1907 collection of his writings called Twelve Years , warning precisely against that :
The basic mistake made by people who polemicise with What Is to Be Done ?
at the present time is that they tear this production completely out of a specific historical context , out of a specific and by now long - past period in the development of our party .
Twelve Years was written in a short period of democratic freedom forced upon tsarism by the 1905 Russian revolution .
Lenin had to argue hard and long to convince the Bolsheviks , experts at the underground struggle , of the necessity to surface and organise themselves utilising the full attributes of internal democracy .
This contrasts with the period in which What Is to Be Done ? was written , one in which the embattled Russian Marxist movement was beginning to move out of its “ small circle ” existence .
Constantly harried by the tsarist secret police , in 1903 the Russian revolutionaries ( of all stripes ) were forced to operate underground in self - selected , secretive groups .
Different circles of revolutionary Social Democrats ( as Marxists were known as at the time ) produced short - lived newspapers that were circulated hand to hand in the factories ( generally each circle was known by the name of its newspaper ) .
On average , leading activists could expect to operate for around three months before being arrested and deported to Siberia , whereupon new leaders would have to begin the whole painful process of organisation again .
The exile grouping that Lenin was part of published Iskra ( the Spark ) .
“ What Is To Be Done ? is a summary of Iskra tactics and Iskra organisational policy in 1901 and 1902 .
Precisely a ‘ summary ’ , no more and no less ” , Lenin wrote in Twelve Years .
In 1902 , what was crucial was that the Russian workers were on the move , ultimately towards the 1905 Revolution , the prelude to 1917 .
The workers were moving beyond the “ spontaneity ” of their struggle .
Stikhiinost
Thus , Lenin explained , in one of the passages that , ripped out of context , is used to batter his name :
Hence , our task , the task of Social - Democracy , is to combat spontaneity , to divert the working - class movement from this spontaneous , trade - unionist striving to come under the wing of the bourgeoisie , and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social Democracy .
As Lih carefully explains , the English word ‘ ” spontaneity ” was a 1929 translation of Lenin ’s Russian term stikhiinost , which , Lih says , contains the meaning of the English “ spontaneity ” combined with a sense of an elemental force .
For a recent political example : the Palm Island riot in Queensland that followed the whitewash of Indigenous man Mulrunji Doomadgee ’s death was stikhiinost ; unplanned , impassioned , justified , but ultimately self - defeating .
Prior to 1903 , in Russia , it was not unknown for workers to strike , drive the police out of whole areas of a city or town , then break into the vodka stores and drunkenly let the police regain the upper hand .
It was because the workers had started to go beyond this stikhiinost that Lenin was demanding that the RDSLP seriously organise itself to lead the rebellions .
Lenin was arguing both against the danger of the RDSLP activists lowering the level of their politics to reflect the stikhiinost level of the workers and for the need of the activists to catch up with the workers whose “ spontaneous ” struggle was advancing rapidly and might leave the RSDLP behind .
An interesting example of the ignorance upon which criticisms of Lenin is based is explained by Lih. Rosa Luxemburg was enrolled by Lenin ’s Menshevik opponents to write against him .
She wrote an article in 1904 castigating his underestimation of the creative movement of Russian workers .
In evidence she wielded an Iskra article that demonstrated the Russian proletariat ’s resourcefulness , of which she said Lenin was unaware .
Little did she know that the very source that she rested her case upon was in fact written by Lenin in Iskra without a by - line .
Moreover , Lih argues , the Russian expression , trediunionizm , which Lenin criticised , cannot be understood properly if simply transcribed into the English “ trade unionism ” .
Lenin ’s target was the ideology that trade unions are all that is needed , as distinct from an independent class - based workers ’ socialist party
The classic home of this trediunionizm was England , but Lenin ’s view of British trade unionism was nuanced .
He was dead - set against trediunionizm but still admired in many ways British trade unionism , that is , the activity , organisational practices , etc. of the British unions , citing the example of the militant leader Robert Knight .
Lenin explained that every trade union secretary “ always helps the workers to carry on the economic struggle , he helps them to expose factory abuses , explains the injustice of the laws and of measures that hamper the freedom to strike and to picket ” etc .
But Lenin was staunch in distinguishing revolutionary trade union activity from trediunionizm , in one of the most famous passages in What Is to Be Done ? :
It can not be too strongly maintained that this is still not Social - Democracy , that the Social - Democrat ’s ideal should not be the trade union secretary , but the tribune of the people , who is able to react to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression , no matter where it appears , no matter what stratum or class of the people it affects ; who is able to generalise all these manifestations and produce a single picture of police violence and capitalist exploitation ; who is able to take advantage of every event , however small , in order to set forth before all his socialist convictions and his democratic demands , in order to clarify for all and everyone the world - historic significance of the struggle for the emancipation of the proletariat .
Lenin recognised the importance of economic , trade union struggle because it pitted worker against capitalist .
But the socialist movement required that and more , the struggle against tsarism , which needed a much higher level of political understanding because of its complexities .
Revoliutstionery po professii
To tie all these ideological and practical tasks together , Lenin argued , the party would need to take its underground existence seriously and organise conspiratorially to avoid being broken up .
Secrecy was to be adhered to professionally as opposed to what has been translated as “ amateurism ” or “ primativism ” .
This period of working - class upsurge , argued Lenin , required revoliutstionery po professii , skilled in the arts of underground operations .
Such people were not intellectual “ professional revolutionaries ” , as that term has been translated and interpreted , Lih says .
In English the term “ professional ” has taken on connotations of someone who earns their living somewhat above the normal lot of workers , such as a professional engineer or even a professional sportsperson .
In Russian , the noun professiya is applied to just about any kind of work requiring skills and training .
The phrase for " plumber by trade " , for example , is santekhnik po professii .
The sense of Lenin ’s revoliutsioner po professii is thus something like , “ skilled , experienced revolutionary ” .
It does n't have the slightest tang of elitism ; such a person is completely at one with the workers she or he strives to influence .
Lih ’s point is that , when understood this way , Lenin 's argument takes on a meaning quite different from the one usually assumed .
For Lenin , the revoliutsioner po professii could be workers or anyone else who could organise and lead with proper regard to secrecy , not middle - class intellectuals intervening in the working - class movement to lead it astray , which is the meaning imposed on his work by hostile readers ( and some fervent ultra- leftists ) .
Lenin ’s revoliutsioner po professii would intervene to redirect ( or divert ) the workers to go beyond their economic struggles towards the political struggle for democratic rights and from there to socialism .
The light and air of the labour movement
Lenin ’s main target in 1902 was Rabochee delo as the representative of the political trend of “ Economism ” in the Russian social democratic movement .
“ Economists ” downplayed the importance of struggling for political freedom in Russia as a requisite for building the workers ’ movement .
Lenin summarised Economism as “ infatuation with the strike movement and economic struggles ” .
Moreover , at the time in which he wrote , Economism was “ the then dominant trend ” within 19th century social democracy internationally , not just in the Russian movement .
The words ‘ ” economic ” and “ political ” held particular meaning .
In both Germany and Russia social democracy suffered from repression and had to operate illegally .
The “ political struggle ” was essentially the battle to win legality , or in Russia , to overthrow tsarism and win political freedom as a launch pad for the struggle for socialism .
The “ economic struggle ” emphasised working for such things as factory legislation as a principle .
Of course , anarchists and others who insisted on the primacy of the economic struggle did have a form of politics .
Lenin himself apologised for using the clumsy expression “ Economism ” , but did it because it was in common use .
Lih argues that without an understanding of the international socialist movement of the times , dominated as it was by the German Social Democrats , ideologically tutored by Karl Kautsky and within which Eduard Bernstein was a controversial but prominent figure , the disputes within the RSDLP cannot be comprehended .
In opposing the Economists , Lenin supported Kautsky ’s thinking , as expressed in his book , Class Struggle , which was a commentary on the German SDP ’s Erfurt Programme :
On this account , wherever the working class has endeavoured to improve its economic position it has made political demands , especially demands for a free press and the right of assemblage .
These privileges are to the proletariat the prerequisites of life ; they are the light and air of the labour movement .
Whoever attempts to deny them , no matter what his pretensions , is to be reckoned among the worst enemies of the working - class .
The struggle for the “ light and air ” of democracy is the motivating thrust of What Is to Be Done ? and without an understanding of its fundamental importance there is no understanding Lenin .
More than this , Lenin aspired to organise the RSDLP into as tight a campaigning unit as the German SDP .
In its period of underground struggle against Bismarck , the SDP had published a weekly newspaper abroad .
So effectively was it smuggled into and distributed in Germany that Bismarck himself was believed to have quipped that the SDP ’s “ postal service ” was better than the state post office .
Kautsky outlined a schema for building SDP influence which advanced the formula that social democracy is the merger of the ideology of socialism and the workers ’ movement .
This was in opposition to the trends first criticised by Marx in the Communist Manifesto , which saw socialism as a kind of benevolent missionary activity conducted from above by philanthropic intellectuals .
Kautsky envisaged circles of influence continually moving outwards from more highly politically educated and organised workers , through layers of less advanced parts of the class until the whole class was organised and led by the socialists .
For Lenin , following Kautsky , the role of the Marxists was therefore to fight against those who wished to maintain the separation of socialism from the workers ’ movement , including simplistic “ economist ” non-political trade unionism which ignored the political cause of the class .
The need to fight the separation of socialism from the workers is the meaning of the polemics against Economism in the book .
Secondary targets were the terrorists , who also ignored the necessity of merging the workers ’ movement with socialism .
Key to all this was the need to win democratic space for the revolutionaries to operate in .
Lih sums up Lenin ’s arguments , which the vast majority of the RSDLP supported :
The merger formula – ‘ Social Democracy is the merger of socialism and the worker movement ’ – pulls all Kautsky ’s various arguments together .
The expanding circle of awareness , the original and nearly fatal separation of socialism and the worker movement , the two - front polemical war against those who refuse the great Marxian synthesis , political freedom as light and air for the proletariat , the strength that comes from an inspiring final goal , the need for disciplined , modern parties of nation - wide scope , the aspiration to become a Volkspartei , the need to carry out the democratic tasks that the bourgeois is too scared to undertake , and finally , Social Democracy ’s own exalted sense of mission – all these flow from the merger narrative .
Lih quotes extensively from socialist leaders of the period , Menshevik and Bolshevik , to show the commonality of this “ merger ” argument .
This is what Lih calls the “ good news ” , world - historical mission of social democracy , to bring socialism to willing workers , and which sets the context for Lenin ’s book on how Russian social democracy can carry out this undertaking .
The Lenin of What Is to Be Done ? is the exemplary social democrat of his time .
He is fiercely arguing that the workers can and will embrace the teachings of Marxism – in fact , he is possessed by his confidence in the working class .
His polemical tone appears because he must urgently convince doubters that the workers can be won directly to social democracy , not to any watered down substitute for it , and effectively organise the party for the task .
Hence the zeal of his stern case against those who try to say the workers need to go through lower stages of political development , or are n’t ready , or should not embrace political tasks which are beyond them .
And hence the tremendous value of this magnum opus from Lars Lih .
As the wreckage of 20th century Stalinist failures is pushed aside by the forces articulating innovative socialism Lenin Rediscovered allows us to see Lenin afresh , relearn the lessons of his epic struggles and creatively apply them .
Those who meet this challenge will be the exemplary Leninists of the 21st century .
Leninism : past , present and future
How would Lenin have met these challenges ?
Perhaps the clearest guide is given in his 1907 Preface to the Collection Twelve Years , where he mused that the democratic conditions that appeared in 1905 required “ an irrevocable break with the old circle ways that had outlived their day . “
“ The circles were necessary in their day and played a positive role ” , he explained .
Indeed , under tsarism , socialism could only have developed through them , complete with their conspiratorial organisation and inherently limited internal democracy , “ nearly always based on personal friendship ” .
The circles ’ controversial , polemical tone was due to the fact that they were debating “ the most general principles and the fundamental aims of all Social - Democratic policy generally ” and “ these seemingly minor differences were actually of immense importance ” .
Subsequent history unfortunately forged “ Leninists ” who mistook this hothouse polemical atmosphere as representing the best of the tradition , not realising that Lenin himself described it as “ inherited from the past and is unsuited to our present tasks ” .
As Paul Kellogg , like Lars Lih , another “ re-contexturaliser ” of Lenin has termed it , “ Leninism :
It ’s not what you think ” .
Lenin , sharply called upon his readers “ to break with many of the circle traditions , forget and discard many of the trivial features of circle activity and circle squabbles , so as to concentrate on the tasks of Social - Democracy in the present period . ”
Leninists of various traditions are beginning to reconsider their previous dogmas and break from them .
In France , they have founded the Nouveau parti anticapitaliste ( New Anti-Capitalist Party , NPA ) , in Australia the Socialist Alliance and many are casting about for similar formations in other countries .
Lenin wanted socialists to take advantage of the “ light and air ” of democracy to organise the class struggle , not waste time in pious sectarian game playing , which has been the fate of too many 20th century Leninists .

An immigrant who lands in France or Britain knows he ’ll have to abide by the law , but he also knows he ’ll have real and tangible rights .
That ’s not how it is in Italy , where bureaucracy and corruption make it seem as if the only guarantees are prohibitions and mafia rule , under which rights are nonexistent .
The mafias let the African immigrants live and work in their territories because they make a profit off them .
The mafias exploit them , but also grant them living space in abandoned areas outside of town , and they keep the police from running too many checks or repatriating them .
The immigrants are temporarily willing to accept peanut wages , slave hours and poor living conditions .
They ’ve already handed over all they owned , risked all they had , just to get to Italy .
But they came to make a better life for themselves  and they ’re not about to let anyone take the possibility of that life away .
There are native Italians who reject mafia rule as well , but they have the means and the freedom to leave places like Rosarno , becoming migrants themselves .
The Africans can’t .
They have to stand up to the clans .
They know they have to act collectively , for it ’s their only way of protecting themselves .
Otherwise they end up getting killed , which happens sometimes even to the European immigrant workers .
It ’s a mistake to view the Rosarno rioters as criminals .
The Rosarno riots were not about attacking the law , but about gaining access to the law .
There are African criminals of course , African mafiosi , who do business with the Italian mafias .
An increasing amount of the cocaine that arrives here from South America comes via West Africa .
African criminal organizations are amassing enormous power , but the poor African workers in Italy are not their men .
The Fed ’s worries grew last summer when the chief federal district judge in Manhattan ruled in favor of Bloomberg News , setting up a showdown last month in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit .
This appellate battle — which includes a similar suit by Fox News that lost in the district court — has quickly become the New York front in a bitter , two - pronged war against the Fed .
( In Washington , legislation is pending to force the central bank to undergo an audit . )
Indeed , as the lawsuit moved to its next round , its context was expanded by way of interventions and supporting briefs .
Now , two Manhattan tribes appear to be squaring off :
On one side are the news media — among them The Associated Press , The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times , which also has a FOIA bailout suit and has agreed to be bound by the Second Circuit ruling .
On the other side are the banks — JPMorgan Chase , Citibank , Bank of America and others — which , of course , have fallen in behind the Fed .
MR .
Winkler , a slight man who favors bow ties , started his career covering the Fed for The Daily Bond Buyer decades ago .
He said Bloomberg has often pursued information by way of litigation .
In 1993 , for instance , Bloomberg successfully sued the private press clubs of Japan , called kisha clubs , which had prevented it from reporting on the Japanese economy by denying access to the corporate press releases that often came as a benefit of membership .
Today , he said , Bloomberg has 156 FOIA requests pending with the United States government .
Nevertheless , the Fed was not a kisha club , and November 2008 was not necessarily a moment to take an aggressive legal stance toward economic policy makers .
Things were still quite raw : it had been only two months since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and only two weeks since the Dow Jones industrial average , already down some 2,200 points in seven sessions , dropped nearly 700 more in the opening moments of a single day .
But Mr. Winkler had already chosen to sue , and had so informed Daniel L. Doctoroff , Bloomberg ’s president , and Peter T. Grauer , its chairman .
Then , along with the outside law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher , he sought to write a document that would mirror in its language the vast sweep of recent economic events .
Three days after the election of President Obama , his company filed a complaint that read , in part , “ The documents that Bloomberg seeks are central to understanding the government ’s response to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the Great Depression . ”
The complaint accused the Fed of failing to produce the documents and positioned Bloomberg , in a watchdog role , as “ the eyes and ears of the public . ”
It concluded that disclosure of the documents was needed so that taxpayers could be “ informed of how the Fed is safeguarding the public ’s money . ”
A conspicuously biased news article printed in the Washington Post on December 31 , 2009 is raising the eyebrows of public policy experts , bloggers , media watchdogs other news outlets alike .

Titled " Support grows for tackling nation 's debt , " the article discusses a proposal to create a government commission to examine America 's growing debt .
The new commission , according to the article , would be charged with exploring " how to rein in skyrocketing spending on Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , " but the article failed to mention other significant sources of government spending , like the $ 663 billion military budget .
The story points to growing support for such a commission among political figures , but fails to mention the 40 or so prominent organizations that oppose the plan , including the NAACP , the Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , AARP , Common Cause , the AFL - CIO , and the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) .
The article was not written by Post reporters , but was produced by a startup " news " organization called the Fiscal Times , whose byline describes it is an " independent news publication that reports on fiscal , budgetary , healthcare and international economic issues . "
But is it truly " independent " ?
We want to give a hat tip to Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) for outing the Fiscal Times as a propaganda outlet masquerading as a news service that was created and funded by Wall Street billionaire Peter G. Peterson , a former member of President Nixon 's administration who has long used his wealth to promote cuts in Social Security , Medicare and other government entitlement programs .
The Post initially failed to reveal to readers the origins and funding of the Fiscal Times , and only did so six days later , in a small correction run on January 5 .
That " correction , " however , reiterated the assertion that the Fiscal Times is " independent " and merely noted that the story should have disclosed that one of the sources quoted in the story was funded by the same funder as the writers of the story .
A Storm of Protest
The Washington Post has taken a serious hit for printing the story .
FAIR accused the Post of letting lobbyists write its stories .
Somewhat more mildly , the New York Times said the sourcing of the article was " awkward " for the Post .
The UK Guardian lamented that in publishing the Fiscal Times piece , the Post had compromised its integrity and long , proud reputation as an independent journalistic outlet .
A group of 21 policy experts from universities , law schools and policy research organizations around the country have written a letter to the Post 's ombudsman protesting the Fiscal Times article , and warning that publication of the piece " could signal the death of the daily newspaper as an independent and objective news source . "
Signatories to the letter also protested a formal " content sharing " agreement the Post has entered into with the Fiscal Times to publish more Fiscal Times pieces in its pages in the future .
Politico has questioned the Post 's partnership with Fiscal Times , and the Columbia Journalism Review also critically discussed the partnership .
Private Interests : " Becoming " the Media ?
Wealthy , private entities trying to take over news outlets and control the message is not a new idea .
Unsurprisingly , the idea may have originated with the most cunning of cigarette makers , Philip Morris ( PM ) .
In 1990 , PM held an internal meeting called " Top Secret Operation Rainmaker , " in which the company envisioned influencing public opinion and the national policy agenda by literally taking over major news outlets .
Notes from the meeting say ,
If we are to truly influence the public policy agenda and the information flow to the populace , we must be the media , we must be part of it .
The only way to do this is to own a major media outlet ...
If we are not willing to take this step , then we are not serious about really wanting to change the atmosphere .
Organizations that should be very seriously considered [ for acquisition ] include :
-- Knight Ridder
-- Zuckerman 's group
-- the Copley News Service
-- United Press International
-- or a major city daily that has access to -- and from -- all of the major wire services .
Tweaking the Strategy
PM understood that independent news media was not their friend , and that to influence the public mind and public policy , they had to control the news .
But instead of taking over established news outlets -- as PM envisioned was necessary 20 years ago -- private interests are now creating their own news outlets , and then working to get their preferred information disseminated through well - established , credible outlets , like the Washington Post .
It 's a clever idea for those who want not only to create the news , but to get people to believe it , too .
After all , to be effective , news has to be believed .
The timing is right for this strategy , too .
Cash - strapped news organizations are cutting expenses , and this makes pre-packaged " news " more attractive to them , since it saves them from having to pay their own reporters to gather news independently .
This is n't the first time special interests have leveraged the desperation of news organizations to get their way with the news , either .
PRWatch exposed the rampant use of video news releases -- videotaped " news segments " produced by public relations firms for corporations , that are marketed to news outlets and then broadcast as pre-packaged local television " news . "
The appearance of the Fiscal Times ' piece in the Washington Post , and the resulting dust - up over it , serves as a warning that printed fake news pieces are also now appearing in trusted mainstream newspapers .
Tough Times for News Consumers
This makes things even harder on news consumers .
In addition to simply trying to understand an issue , now readers must try and tease out " real " news from planted news that is likely to have a bias .
Opinions used to be clearly labeled in the " Editorial " section a newspaper , but no more -- deft PR strategies like the one exposed in the Washington Post mean that opinions now openly masquerade as " news , " and significant facts may be left out of articles to help sway public opinion .
For a trusted news source to engage in this type of behavior diminishes the credibility and value of all news media to society .
We can only hope that all the groups and individuals who are calling out the Post for publishing this type of material will result in papers reconsidering their use of biased news sources , and whether their use in fact brings value to their organizations , or shame .

WASHINGTON / DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
The embattled global boss of Toyota Motor Corp , under pressure over a series of safety recalls , has agreed to appear before U.S. lawmakers next Wednesday .
A U.S. congressional panel had invited Akio Toyoda , grandson of the founder of the world ’s No. 1 carmaker , on Thursday , while also subpoenaing internal documents Toyota had fought to keep sealed .
“ I look forward to speaking directly with Congress and the American people , ” Toyoda said in a statement , a day after he had indicated he preferred to send the automaker ’s North American chief to represent the company before the panel .
The invitation by the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee marked an escalation of the political pressure on Toyota in its largest market a month into a safety crisis that has tarnished its reputation and hurt sales .
It also cast the spotlight on Toyoda , who has at times appeared uneasy with the heightened scrutiny just seven months into his tenure in the top job at the automaker .
The House panel said it had also issued a subpoena for internal documents Toyota had fought to keep sealed as part of a legal battle with a former employee who says the automaker routinely hid evidence of safety problems .
The White House stepped into the fray when spokesman Robert Gibbs said the Obama administration hoped Toyota would do all it could to rectify “ a dangerous situation . ”
“ Everybody , I think , is rightly concerned about the recalls that have happened , ” Gibbs said .
Rep. Edolphus Towns , chairman of the oversight panel , said he had sent an invitation to Toyoda to appear .
Toyoda had told reporters on Wednesday that he would dispatch the company ’s North American chief , Yoshimi Inaba , to the briefing but had no plans to appear himself unless he was formally summoned .
The ranking Republican on the panel , Rep. Darrell Issa , had been pressing for Toyoda to appear and said he would support issuing a subpoena to compel Toyoda to testify if necessary .

In a letter sent to Toyoda , Towns , a Democrat from New York , indicated that he had also come around to the view that only an appearance by the head of Toyota could answer all of the questions surrounding the automaker ’s recalls and criticism that it ignored safety warnings .
“ There appears to be growing public confusion regarding which vehicles may be affected and how people should respond , ” Towns said .
“ In short , the public is unsure what exactly the problem is , whether it is safe to drive their cars , or what they should do about it .
To help clarify the situation , I am inviting you to testify . ”
In response to Toyoda ’s acceptance late on Thursday , Towns and Issa said in a joint statement : “ We believe his testimony will be helpful in understanding the actions Toyota is taking to ensure the safety of American drivers . ”
The House oversight hearing on Wednesday is one of two congressional inquiries into the Toyota safety crisis set for next week .
On Tuesday , the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold its own hearing .
In preparation for the hearing , the oversight panel has also asked major insurers for any information they provided to U.S. safety regulators on reports of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles .
Up to 34 crash deaths have been blamed on unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles since 2000 , according to complaints filed with U.S. regulators .
Jim Cain , an automotive industry veteran with a background in crisis communications at The Quell Group , said Toyoda had no choice but to appear when summoned .
“ There are plenty of people who can respond to the questions that Congress and investigators are going to have about what exactly happened and when , but we need to have that assurance as Americans , as consumers , as investors , as dealers from the person who is leading that company , whose name is on the building , ” Cain said .
REPUTATION AT RISK
Toyota has recalled more than 6 million vehicles in the U.S. market for problems involving the accelerator pedal becoming stuck , either by a loose floor mat or because of a glitch in the pedal assembly itself .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
A separate recall is under way to fix software controlling the brakes on the Prius hybrid .
The global number of vehicles now under recall is about 8.5 million .
Complaints about unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles have been rising for the past decade , leading some safety advocates and lawyers for crash victims to question whether the electronic throttle control system that Toyota began using widely during that time is to blame .
By issuing a subpoena for thousands of pages of internal Toyota documents , the House oversight panel injected itself into a dispute between the automaker and a former employee at its Los Angeles - area U.S. headquarters .
Dimitrios Biller , who headed a corporate legal team that defended Toyota in rollover - accident lawsuits , took some 6,000 internal documents with him when he left Toyota in 2007 , and has since sued the automaker under U.S. racketeering laws .
He has said the documents support his allegations that the company systematically hid or destroyed legal evidence that would have led to costly trials in the United States .
Toyota sought -- and won -- a ruling from a court - appointed arbitrator to keep Biller from making the documents public .
In a separate move that points toward the risk of a wider recall , NHTSA filed paperwork on Thursday confirming that it had opened an investigation into the Toyota Corolla and Matrix models .
The agency said it had received 168 complaints alleging that steering on the vehicles can “ wander and drift . ”
The preliminary review , which could affect an estimated 487,000 vehicles , cited seven complaints involving 2009 models and one for 2010 cars .
Owners allege eight crashes and 11 injuries , none fatal , according to NHTSA .
Preliminary investigations are a common step by regulators and are often closed without leading to a recall .
Analysts said the more serious threat to Toyota was not the direct financial cost of further recalls but the potential damage to a brand that has been seen as the industry standard for quality .

Toyota said it was looking into complaints about the steering systems of the Corolla .
It has said it would recall the car only if it found a safety risk .
Toyota ’s safety woes are deepening at a time when automakers worldwide are struggling to emerge from a deep decline in sales -- led by a collapse in the U.S. market -- that prompted bankruptcies and consolidation .
Toyota ’s U.S. sales dropped 16 percent in January and are expected to take a big hit in February as well .
The great folks over at SAFER Campus pointed me to the most ludicrous Sexual Assault Prevention information page ever , courtesy of the Valdosta State University police department .
Instead of providing valuable information for men and women concerning the most common form of sexual assault on a college campus — - acquaintance rape — - Georgia - based VSU has published a 13 - point victim - blaming guide that manages to shame women for climbing stairs , not gouging a dude ’s eyes out , and failing to be constantly vigilant of the serial killers who walk among us .
The worst of the worst , after the jump .
Women : Nature ’s victims .
According to Valdosta State coppers , women “ make easy targets for random acts of violence ” for three reasons : ( 1 ) they ’re dumb ; ( 2 ) they insist on walking around like dainty little ladies ; ( 3 ) they go places girls are n’t allowed .
The three main reasons women make easy targets for random acts of violence are :
* Lack of awareness ( you MUST know where you are & what ’s going on around you . )
*
Body language ( keep your head up , swing your arms , stand straight up ) *
Wrong place , wrong time ( DON’T be walking alone in an alley , or driving in a bad neighborhood at night )
One major deficit of female “ awareness ” : Awareness of that serial killer parked next to you .
Some women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping , eating , working , etc. , and just sit ( doing their checkbook , or making a list , etc. ) .
DON ’T DO THIS !
A predator could be watching you , and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in the passenger side , put a gun to your head , and tell you where to go .
AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR , LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE .
. . .
If you are parked next to a big van , enter your car from the passenger door .
A lot of serial killers attack their victims by pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get into their cars .
Better just stick on the ground floor , ladies .
First rule of multi - level buildings :
Always remember that “ stairwells are horrible places to be alone . ”
Second rule of multi - level buildings :
Always remember that elevators are horrible places to be with other people .
Ask yourself :
Do you really need to get above the lobby today ?
Always take the elevator instead of the stairs .
( Stairwells are horrible places to be alone . ) *
Do not get on an elevator if your instincts tell you that something is wrong ( Remember , bad men do n’t always look bad ) .
*
Do not stand back in the corners of the elevator , be near the front , by the doors , ready to get off .
*
If you get on the elevator on the 25th floor , and the Boogie Man gets on the 22nd , get off when he gets on .
Know your predator shooting statistics .
Stop freaking out , delicate ladies : “ it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ . ”
If the predator has a gun and you are not under his control , ALWAYS run !
* POLICE only make 4 of 10 shots when they are in range of 3 - 9 feet .
This is due to stress .
*
The predator will only hit you ( a running target ) 4 in 100 times .
And even then , it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ .
RUN !
Live in fear of all other humans .
If you do n’t , you may get yourself raped .
Women are always trying to be sympathetic : STOP IT , it may get you raped , or killed .
Ted Bundy , the serial killer , was a good looking , well - educated man , who ALWAYS played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women .
He walked with a cane , or a limp , and often asked “ for help ” into his vehicle or with his vehicle , which is when he abducted his next victim .
If you do n’t gouge his eyes out , whatever happens to you is all your fault .
Yes :
It actually says that .
If he ’s driving , find the right time , and stick your fingers in his eyes .
He must watch the road , so choose an unsuspecting time , and gouge him .
It maybe your ONLY defense .
While he is in shock , GET OUT .
( This sounds gross , but the alternative is your fault if you do not act . )
Stepping outside your car at noon on a Monday : Risky business .
BREAKDOWNS : ( avoid this by ALWAYS keeping your car in good working order ) *
If your car breaks down , you better have a cell phone to call for help , and lock your doors .
* Keep a blanket , and a pair of warm clothes and boots , and a flashlight in your car always for emergencies .
*
If you do n’t have a cell phone , shame on you .
*
If it ’s noon on a business day , you MAY want to put your hazards on and walk to safety .
If it ’s 2 a .m. and you ’re close to a populated and well lighted area , go there ASAP .
Otherwise , your best bet is to stay in your vehicle .
Do not leave shelter after sundown .
If you are walking alone in the dark ( which you should n’t be ) and you find him following / chasing you : * Try to get to a lighted area , preferably a populated area .
*
If he ’s following you , cross the street .
If he follows you , turn around and look at him .
He will know that he can now be identified and that he has lost the element of surprise .
*
If he chases you , yell for help and run ! *
Find an obstacle , such as a parked car , and run around it , like ring around the rosy .
This may sound silly , but statistical data shows that this has SAVED LIVES .
I do n’t know what this one means , but it does n’t sound good .
Never let yourself or anyone that you know be a in any type of business ( bar , store , restaurant , gas station ) .

And now , for some less sarcastic commentary :
Here is what the sexual assault policy gurus at SAFER Campus have to say about these tips :
Occupied Palestinian Territory , Gaza City , Gaza Strip — Dr. Wael Weshah walks the halls of the Shifa Hospital , explaining what working in a medical facility during the Israeli assault on Gaza last winter was like .
While Dr. Weshah is a remarkably jovial man , the hospital was a dark and tragic place during the war .
It ’s been a year since Israel invaded the Gaza Strip , which killed over 1,400 Palestinians and injured over 5,300 , the overwhelming majority of them civilians , according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights .
“ Of these , 1,600 were children , and 860 were women .
In total , 600 persons suffered permanent disability as a result of injuries sustained during the Israeli assault , and 221 people required amputation , ” a report by the center titled “ 23 Days of War , 928 Days of Closure ” states .
The Shifa Hospital could n’t handle the round - the - clock injuries rushing into the hospital , and had to transport some to Egypt for urgent medical attention .
During the war on Gaza , shortages of medicine occurred , and medicine shortages continue because of the illegal blockade of Gaza .
“ The borders [ were ] forbidden .
There was a problem , a major problem , ” said Weshah .
In the whole Gaza Strip , Weshah said , there are 3,000 doctors and 4,000 nurses .
About 1.5 million Palestinians live in Gaza .
Many medical personnel and those in training cannot leave the Gaza Strip due to the Israeli siege , preventing them from receiving up - to - date medical training .
While most of the patients that entered the hospital during Operation Cast Lead are out , according to Weshah , there was one patient who was still in the hospital as a result of the war .
Muhammed Samouni was in one of the Samouni households in the Zeitoun area of Gaza when Israel bombed his house .
The Samounis , a large family , now live largely in tents in the area where their houses stood .
The area around the Samouni household was one of the first areas that Israeli ground troops entered .
During the war on Gaza , 30 members of the Samouni clan were killed .
The attacks on their household and the killings have been widely documented , including in Richard Goldstone ’s United Nations report .
With casts still on his arm and bandages covering up wounds on his stomach , he described through a translator the conduct of Israeli soldiers who entered into his house before it was destroyed .
Through a translator , he said occupying soldiers acted like they were going to execute him , poured gasoline on him and threatened to light him on fire , and stole jewelry from his house .
He was in the Shifa Hospital because he needed more surgical work done on his arm because it was broken in so many places , and just came back to Gaza after spending two weeks in Saudi Arabia for additional medical attention .

Setting and sample
We recruited participants from 12 mainstream schools and four special schools for children with Intellectual Disability ( ID ) in the Vellore educational district , Tamilnadu , Southern India .
The schools represent the higher ( Private ICSC board schools ) , middle ( Private matriculation board schools ) ; lower socio-economic ( Public state board schools ) backgrounds and they represent the literate late childhood population in India .
Sample size estimation
We calculated sample size to identify correlation ( rho = 0.3 ) between ToM and IQ .
Keeping alpha error , beta error and a priori power at 5 % , 20 % , and 80 % respectively , the sample size needed was 84 , for a two - tailed evaluation .
As we anticipated 20 % drop out between the two points of assessment , we recruited at least 100 children in this study .
Selection criteria
We included children of 8 to 11 years of age with their caregivers if they were willing to participate in the study .
We excluded children with psychiatric morbidity , long - term physical illness , neurological deficits or disabilities , special sensory deficits , severe behavioral problems , long - term use of any medication , children who had already received prior training for ToM tasks and those unwilling to provide verbal assent or informed consent to participate in this study .
Materials
Theory of mind
The Unexpected contents Theory of Mind Task has a set of questions on the child 's description of the appearance , reality , representational change and false belief variables with one point for every correct response [ 21 ] .
We used this measure to screen the ability of the children to participate in further ToM assessment and to gain additional information on ToM.
Detailed assessment of ToM was done using the Picture Sequencing Task ( PST ) .
The choice of non-verbal illustrative PST as the tool for ToM assessment alleviated the consequences of two major confounders , general language ability and working memory .
PST measures the ToM ability by assessing false belief reasoning and general sequencing ability by employing 14 sequences , which included two practice , four false belief , four mechanical and four social script sequences .
Each sequence consists of a series of four pictures made up of black and white sketches and some sample pictures are given in Figure 1 .
Averaging the mean scores of mechanical and social script sequences provided the General Sequencing Ability .
The final score in PST is calculated by subtracting the general sequencing ability from the mean score of false belief sequences and therefore can be represented with a negative score [ 7 ] .
The PST has also been used in children to study ToM by Langdon [ 22 ] who also provided us with the measure to be used in this study .

Intelligence
The Binet - Kamat Scale of intelligence [ 23 ] is the Indian adaptation of the 1934 version of Stanford - Binet Scale of Intelligence .
Some of tests , items and materials were amended to suit Indian conditions , such as Indian coins , typically Indian pictorial scenes , vocabulary and Indian concepts .
This intelligence scale assessed the child 's skills in nine domains : language , meaningful memory , non-meaningful memory , conceptual thinking , verbal reasoning , non-verbal reasoning , numerical reasoning , visuomotor coordination and social intelligence .
Adaptive Behavior
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale ( VABS ) assesses the social competence of children with or without disabilities from birth to 19 years of age under four domains and 11 sub - domains [ 24 ] .
Psychopathology
The Strength Difficulty Questionnaire ( SDQ ) has 25 items that screen for psychological strengths and psychiatric disorders among children as well as categorize individuals with low needs ; some needs and high needs [ 25 ] .
It identifies children with conduct disorder , hyperactivity , depressive and anxiety disorders needing various interventions [ 26 ] .
Interview and assessment
APR , a qualified psychiatrist approached the children and their primary caregivers to enroll in this cross sectional study , according to the protocol approved by the hospital 's Institutional Review Board .
He obtained written informed consent from the primary care giver and verbal assent from the child before data collection .
The interview and assessment protocol during the first day of evaluation required approximately two hours to complete .
It consisted of three sections : ( i ) a face - to - face interview with open ended questions documenting the socio demographic data ( ii ) a structured assessment to screen for psychopathology using SDQ and for the ability to participate in ToM assessment using Unexpected Contents Theory of Mind task ( iii ) an in - depth ToM assessment with PST .
During the second day of evaluation , SY , an experienced psychologist independently measured the intelligence and adaptive behavior using the BKT and the VABS respectively .
Thus , we assessed 105 children of 8 – 11 years of age who satisfied the selection criteria and consented to participate in the study .
Data analysis
Preliminary checks of skewness and kurtosis and the one sample Kolmogorov Smirnoff tests verified that our data were suitable for parametric analysis .
Firstly , we analyzed the socio - demographic data , cognitive profile , adaptive behaviors and ToM details for all the participants using descriptive statistics .
Secondly , we grouped the participants into three IQ - based groups based on the conventional nomenclature [ 27 ] : below average ( IQ < 90 ) ; average ( IQ 90 – 110 ) ; and above average ( IQ > 110 ) intelligence .
We compared the groups using Chi-square tests for categorical variables and one - way ANOVA for continuous variables .
Thirdly , we analyzed the linear correlation between the ToM and various domains of general intelligence using Pearson 's correlation coefficient tests .
Finally , we also conducted the multiple linear regression analysis with ToM as the dependant variable to account for the effects of possible confounders .
All tests used two - tailed analysis and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant .
We analyzed our data using the statistical software package , SPSS 16.0 .
AMMAN ( Reuters ) - A bomb exploded near two cars carrying Israeli diplomats in Jordan on Thursday but none were hurt , their embassy said .
The blast occurred at around 5 p.m. ( 1500 GMT ) on the approach to the Allenby Bridge crossing over the Jordan river to the Israeli - occupied West Bank .
Israeli television said the incident took place 20 km ( 12 miles ) from Allenby while Jordanian security officials said it was on the outskirts of the capital Amman .
Jordan ’s close U.S. ties and 1994 peace accord with Israel are unpopular in the kingdom and there is strong support for Islamist militants in some areas .
In Amman , a Jordanian security source confirmed to Reuters that an explosive device had blown up near an Israeli car in the area , which had been cordoned off for searches .
Later Jordan ’s Information Minister Nabil al - Sharif told the state news agency an explosive device placed on a pavement of a the main road leading to the Jordan Valley detonated just as several civilian cars and two Israeli embassy vehicles drove by .
Israeli embassy spokeswoman Merav Horsandi said Jordan told the Foreign Ministry it had opened an investigation into the incident .
Jordan is one of a handful of Arab countries to have diplomatic relations with the Jewish state .
Those ties were frayed by Israel ’s crackdown in 2000 on a Palestinian uprising that erupted in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Channel
Two said the two cars had been en route from the Israeli embassy in Amman but that the ambassador , Danny Nevo , was not in either vehicle .
The occupants were “ diplomatic staff and bodyguards , ” Channel Two said , adding that the convoy had continued over Allenby and that at least one of the cars was lightly damaged .
Known to Jordanians as King Hussein Bridge , Allenby lies about midway on the 80 km ( 50 mile ) route between Amman and Jerusalem , a few kilometers ( miles ) north of the Dead Sea .
Anti-Israeli feeling has risen in recent years and many politicians from independent figures to the Islamist led opposition have repeatedly demanded the severing of relations with Israel over its treatment of Palestinians .
The incident is the first attack on an Israeli target in Jordan in several years .
Security around the embassy and house of the Israeli ambassador has been beefed up , witnesses said .
Jordan has suffered from occasional political violence in recent years , including the assassination of a U.S. diplomat in 2002 and a hotel bombings in 2005 that killed dozens of people .
The bloodiest attack against Israelis in Jordan occurred in March 1997 , when a Jordanian soldier killed seven Israeli schoolgirls at the border .
Most of Jordan ’s 6 million citizens identify as Palestinians .
Among them are 2 million listed by the United Nations as refugees , or the offspring of refugees , from the 1948 war of Israel ’s creation .
Incident follows ‘ Kick a Ginger Day ’ controversies
Ten students at a Naples , Florida , middle school have been given one - day , in - school suspensions for participating in “ Kick a Jew Day , ” in which Jewish students were targeted for assault , according to news reports in the local media .
Parents and students at North Naples Middle School told NBC channel 2 in Naples that many students — all of them Jewish — were targeted in the attacks , which took place last week .

The station obtained a letter from one parent who said his daughter was a target of the attacks .
“ Kids pretender to kick her , and later at lunch , they actually kicked her , ” the letter stated .
“ Apparently , many kids , all Jewish , were kicked .
I was furious and attempted to call the parents of the girl who initiated this hatred . ”
School officials reacted immediately to complaints from students , but some in the Jewish community say the punishment for the ten students did n’t go far enough .
“ You are talking about an incident that has anti-Jewish bias , if not anti-Semitism , ” Jewish Community Online quoted David Barkey of the Florida Anti-Defamation League .
“ You have Jewish students being singled out , harassed and assaulted . …
If the allegations are true , it is possible these students violated Florida ’s new anti-bullying law .
And , if students were physically assaulted , it could rise to the level of criminal conduct . ”
But Rabbi James Perman of Temple Shalom in North Naples said it “ seems that the school system has taken appropriate measures , ” though he noted that he had n’t “ seen anything like it in my 17 years in Naples . ”

KICK A GINGER DAY
The “ Kick a Jew Day ” incident seems to follow in the footsteps of “ Kick a Ginger Day , ” which started as a Facebook group inspired by an episode of South Park , and resulted in suspensions in school districts around the world after red- headed students were assaulted .
The Fox affiliate in Los Angeles reported Thursday that police are questioning 25 students at a Calabasas , California , middle school after seven red-haired students were allegedly assaulted .
Two dozen students at an elementary school near Toronto , Ontario , were suspended last week after taking part in “ Ginger Day , ” the Toronto Star reports .

Metro.co.uk reports that the first “ Kick a Ginger Day ” was organized for Nov. 20 of last year by a 14 - year - old Canadian girl .
The girl has reportedly apologized and renamed her Facebook group “ Universal Hug A Ginger Day . ”

Sober voices are assuring us that there just is n't a way to pass a public option in the Senate .
The White House has given up even paying lip service to it , despite the very real evidence that it is still popular with the people who are going to matter the most for Dem prospects come November , the Democratic base .
Perhaps the reality of a deal struck between the White House and hospitals means that there really can't be a White House or Senate fight for it .
The hospital lobbyists certainly seemed to think they had a deal to pre-empt any real public option .
Meanwhile , Senate leadership , understanding how mobilized the base is over it have been trying to keep it alive , sort of , by stringing us along with gung - ho statements and letter signing , but no real fight .
We 're kind over that , frankly , and are smart enough to see meaningless gestures for what they are .
Signing a letter is easy , pressuring fellow Senators , and making them vote , is what counts .
We 're going to be hearing a lot from the White House and Dem Senators that , to quote Dan Pfieffer , " the American people deserve and up or down vote " on healthcare reform .
So here 's the message to Harry Reid : " the American people deserve and up or down vote on the piece of reform they want , " the public option .
Show us whether or not it can pass the Senate in a reconciliation vote , Senator Reid .
Put it on the floor and see if it gets 50 votes .
You 'll at least get points from the base for making people go on the record .
Give us an up or down vote on the public option .
Update :
To be crystal clear , for those concerned about gumming up the works , it can be offered as an amendment to the base reconciliation bill .
It 's germane and meets budgetary requirements .
These are scandalously good , yes , scandalously .
Do you want to know why ?
Because I had one bite of one of these cookies and honestly think they ’re one of the best cookies I have ever made .
Like , top five good .
Like , I think that the homemade Oreos just got the boot because I had to make room at the top .
I hope the dozens of you who have made them can forgive me .
It took me a long time to get an oatmeal cookie recipe on this site , and the reason was that most people really like oatmeal cookies , but they have a very specific view of what they should be .
Some people like them heavily spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg , others want them buttery and nutty and still others think that if they do n’t have chocolate chips or large gobs of dried fruit , they were n’t worth the oats they were cooked with .
To add further complication , 99.9 percent of oatmeal cookies fall into one of two categories : thick and cakey or thin and lacy , and oh , how it all made my head spin .
Well , meet the new category : thick and shatter -y , and you ’ll have to make your own to believe it .
They ’re crispy , but not because they ’re hard or because they ’re thin but because they practically hollow out when they bake , leaving you with this … shell of an oatmeal cookie with rich bits of white chocolate scattered about and the tiniest flaking of sea salt on top .
Being not the biggest white chocolate fan and quite bored of every dessert coming with a fleck of expensive salt on top these days , I honestly did n’t expect anything this mind - boggling when I pulled a tray out of the oven , but I could n’t be happier to be surprised .
Now it ’s your turn .

Sometimes financial decisions that are seemingly rational on their face can precipitate mass exodus of your best engineers .
We Hired the CFO
Last week as a favor to a friend , I sat in on a board meeting of a fairly successful 3 ½ year - old startup .
Given all that could go wrong in this economy , they were doing well .
Their business had just crossed cash flow breakeven , had grown past 50 employees , just raised a substantive follow - on round of financing and had recently hired a Chief Financial Officer .
It was an impressive performance .
Then the new CFO got up to give her presentation – all kind of expected ; Sarbanes Oxley compliance , a new accounting system , beef up IT and security , Section 409A ( valuation ) compliance , etc .
Then she dropped the other shoe .
“ Do you know how much our company is spending on free sodas and snacks ? ”
And to answer her own question she presented the spreadsheet totaling it all up .
There were some experienced VC ’s in the room and I was waiting for them to “ educate ” her about startup culture .
But my jaw dropped when the board agreed that the “ free stuff ” had to go .
“ We ’re too big for that now ” was the shared opinion .
But we ’ll sell them soda “ cheap . ”
Unintended Consequences
I had lived through this same conversation four times in my career , and each time it ended as an example of unintended consequences .
No one on the board or the executive staff was trying to be stupid .
But to save $ 10,000 or so , they unintentionally launched an exodus of their best engineers .
This company had grown from the founders , who hired an early team of superstars , many now managing their own teams .
All these engineers were still heads - down , working their tails off , just as they had been doing since the first few months of the company .
Too busy working , most were oblivious to the changes that success and growth had brought to the company .
The Elves Leave Middle Earth – Sodas Are No Longer Free
One day the engineering team was clustered in the snack room looking at the soda machine .
The sign said , “ Soda now 50 cents . ”
The uproar began .
Engineers started complaining about the price of the soda .
Someone noticed that instead of the informal reimbursement system for dinners when they were working late , there was now a formal expense report system .
Some had already been irritated when “ professional ” managers had been hired over their teams with reportedly more stock than the early engineers had .
Lots of email was exchanged about “ how things were changing for the worse . ”
A few engineers went to the see the CEO .
But the damage had been done .
The most talented and senior engineers looked up from their desks and noticed the company was no longer the one they loved .
It had changed .
And not in a way they were happy with .
The best engineers quietly put the word out that they were available , and in less than month the best and the brightest began to drift away .
What Happened ?
Startups go through a metamorphosis as they become larger companies .
They go from organizations built to learn , discover and iterate , to predominately one that can execute adroitly having found product / market fit .
Humans seem to be hard - wired for numbers of social relationships .
These same numbers also define boundaries in growing an organization – get bigger than a certain size and you need a different management system .
The military has recognized this for thousands of years as they built command and control hierarchies that matched these numbers .
Wake Up Call
The engineers focused on building product never noticed when the company had grown into something different than what they first joined .
The sodas were just the wake - up call .
As startups scale into a company , founders and the board need to realize that the most important transitions are not about systems , buildings or hardware .
It ’s about the company ’s most valuable asset – its employees .
Great companies do this well .
Lessons Learned
Be careful of unintended consequences when you grow
Recognize the transition boundaries in company size
Preserve and manage an Innovation Culture

Free SMS / phone calls
SMS for the non-wifi crowd
Not too long ago , “ sending someone a short message ” entailed writing a note and sticking it on the refrigerator door – and all it cost you to send was the time to jot down a couple of sentences on a piece of scrap paper .
Nowadays , of course , no respectable note - writer would bother with pen and paper ; instead , they would send an e-mail or , better , a short phone message , using their cellphone ’s SMS feature .
SMS , of course , has a great advantage over the old system , in that you do n’t have to be next to the refrigerator door to leave your message , but it has a huge disadvantage – it costs money .
If you can cut down your SMS costs , you can probably save some money on the extra messages you send that are over the limit , if you use some of the Web services that feature messaging that I describe below .
There are other ways you can reduce the monthly bill – by a little , or by a lot , depending on your phone and your commitment to saving money .
It ’s easier to save money if your phone is a relatively newer one that has wireless Internet ( wifi ) built into it , but all of the ideas listed will work for any cellphone .
Sooner or later , cellphones die , and when they do , you want to be prepared to restore your data onto your new phone .
The local cellphone companies offer various levels of backup , such as syncing your address book with the company ’s on - line storage service .
It makes sense to sign up for a service like this – but it would make even more sense to sign up for Clickova , an on - line backup service that offers its basic services for free .
If you ’ve got a wifi connection , you can back up your phone ’s contacts , photos , and videos for free !
You sign up at the site and download a client for your phone ( supports most popular ones ) , and you can set up your backup to run automatically , now , later or every day .
And if your phone goes belly up , you can just download your contacts in CSV file , or simply resync with your new phone ( assuming it ’s the same number ) .
All completely free !
You can also do a free backup of contacts , SMS messages , phone logs and even browser bookmarks at Bloove , although getting the data back on your new phone costs money ( viewing them on the Bloove site is free ) .
Note that both these services work on regular WAP or 3G Internet connections as well , and the upload should n’t take too long – certainly less than the cellphone company charges you for the backup .
As I mentioned , the big expenses in cellphone bills are usually when you exceed your “ framework , ” the allocated number of minutes or messages your account allots you .
The “ plans ” the companies offer are supposed take care of what you need , but somehow you always end up spending more than you expected to .
And , most of the reasonably priced plans are short on SMS credits .
So how do you stretch your resources ?
By making use of resources that do n’t necessarily belong to the cellphone companies – namely wifi .
I have a feeling that if they could , the service providers would charge us for using the wifi that your phone can access – but they can’t , so any service you can access on wifi is yours for the taking .
Wifi , of course , can be found in all sorts of places , like homes , offices , coffee shops , airports and so on – places where you probably spend most of your time anyway .
If you use those networks where they are available , as opposed to your phone ’s Internet connection , you can use programs that let you send free SMS messages and even make free phone calls .
There are a number of programs that do this , but the most convenient one for messaging I have found is Nimbuzz , a free mobile program which bundles together and connects all sorts of communication tools , like Skype , ICQ , Windows Messenger , Twitter , Facebook and more .
You download a Nimbuzz client ( available for just about every phone ) and sign into your network accounts .
If you use Skype , for example , you can use Nimbuzz to call Skype users for free ( not all phones have Skype clients yet , and Nimbuzz handles much more than Skype ) .
You can also message people directly into their social networking or messenger account – and , you can send a free SMS to other Nimbuzz users .
Just choose a contact and send them a message ( they ’ll get a prompt to install Nimbuzz on their phone ) .
Unlike other on - line SMS services , Nimbuzz messages do not come out of your SMS allocation .
Nimbuzz can also be used with a 3G or WAP connection , and it has the advantage of being a cheap way to call contacts in foreign countries as well – at the cost of a local phone call .
The charm of Nimbuzz is its ability to add non-cell resources to yourarsenal , but non-wifi folk have a way to increase their SMS messageallocation , converting unused talk minutes into message minutes .
How ?
By registering at Dial2 Do , an amazing servicethat lets you do all sorts of things on your phone – with voicecommands .
You call a local number ( in the 03 area code ) and you canaccess services like listening to the weather ( just say the name ofyour location ) , send yourself reminders , listen to the news ( just say “ New York Times ” ) – and send SMS messages to anyone in your uploadedcontact list .
The service is not free ( $ 40 a year ) , but you do get 30 days free , andit runs many specials ( I recently got a year ’s worth of the fullservice in a giveaway ) .
But with Dial2 Do , you ’re almost guaranteednever to run out of messages , since each SMS takes far less than aminute to send , and you ’re limited only by the number of minutes inyour plan .
Plus , you save wear and tear on your phone ’s keypad , becauseyou send all your messages via voice .
In a case that could set the first broad judicial standards for the use of Tasers , a federal appeals court in California has ruled that the police can be held liable for using one of the devices against an unarmed person during a traffic stop .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , based in San Francisco , said the electrically disabling device constituted excessive force when used against an unarmed man who did not pose a threat , and it refused to allow a police officer immunity for its use .
In a vividly worded opinion issued by the court this week , Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw described a “ bad morning ” for Carl Bryan , a 21 - year - old Californian who drove over large stretches of Southern California to retrieve car keys mistakenly taken by a friend and ended up being Tasered by a Coronado , Calif. , policeman and breaking four teeth when he fell to the ground .
Mr. Bryan was stopped twice on his driving odyssey , once for speeding and once for not wearing his seat belt .
After the second stop , he was “ agitated , standing outside his car , yelling gibberish and hitting his thighs , clad only in his boxer shorts and tennis shoes , ” the court said .
A proposal to legalize and tax marijuana in California was approved by a key committee of the Assembly this morning , over the dire warnings of police chiefs and prosecutors .
The Public Safety Committee voted 4 - 3 to approve AB 390 by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) , who said the bill would provide tax revenue to the state and regulation of the drug .
The new law includes a requirement that users be at least 21 years old .
The measure next goes to the Health Committee , but proponents worried it would not be acted on by that panel by Friday 's deadline , which would require the proposal to be reintroduced to be heard this year by the full Assembly .
" The way it exists now is harming our youth , '' Ammiano said .
" Drug dealers do not ask for ID .
We need to regulate something that has gone chaotic , has resulted in carnage .
I understand it 's not everybody 's cup of tea . ''
Assemblyman Danny Gilmore ( R - Hanford ) , a former CHP commander , said the $ 50 tax on each ounce of marijuana sold to pay for drug education and treatment is not worth the grief that will be caused by legalization .
" We 're going to legalize marijuana , we 're going to tax it and then we 're going to educate our kids about the harm of drugs .
You 've got to be kidding me , '' Gilmore said .
" What 's next ?
Are we going to legalize methamphetamines , cocaine ? ''
The measure was opposed in testimony today by several police chiefs and law enforcement officials including Bob Cooke , former president of the California Narcotics Officers Assn. , who predicted it would lead to an increase in crime .
" The mere consideration of an attempt to trade human misery for tax dollars smacks of the cynical throwing away of countless human beings , '' Cooke told the committee .
It is estimated that the bill would generate $ 1.3 billion a year in taxes and marijuana cultivation fees .

He said in 2006 : " The Devon Loch episode was a terrible thing but I look back on it now and I can say that if it had n't happened I might never have written a book , and my books have certainly helped keep the wolf from the door . "
" The customer service was wonderful !
I called after I placed my order because I had a couple of questions on the shipping and the approval of the invitation .
The lady I talked to was very nice and answered all of my questions .
And the turnaround on getting my baby shower invitation was great .
I love Storkie and will be getting more of my cards and invitations from Storkie .
Thank you . "

" XKCD : Volume 0 " is a gamble that 's paying off for Munroe , a former NASA contractor who left to pursue stick - figure cartooning full - time .
What 's the most stupidly ambitious aspect of " XKCD : Volume 0 , " the book based on the wildly popular yet still very underground webcomic :
" We were joking that we'd fill the entire library with XKCD books , " Ohanian said on the phone from Hong Kong , a stop on his way to a conference in India .
" Those kids , by becoming literate , will one day buy more books .
So it 's a long - term investment , " he said dryly .
XKCD already had a direct line to its core audience .
Millions check into XKCD.com each month for a laugh at the latest comic , many returning several times per week .
All Munroe had to do was post an announcement saying , " There 's XKCD stuff in the store , " and fans rushed down the digital aisles on the book 's Sept. 15 release .
" He did n't need any help marketing , " Ohanian said .
" And he did n't need that much help distributing . "
Ohanian should know .
XKCD handles Reddit 's merchandise distribution .
It was only natural that XKCD go a nontraditional route for publishing .
After all , there 's no way the comic could have survived the traditional syndicated comic lifestyle , Munroe said .
The XKCD philosophy is to cater to a niche audience and then let members of that audience proliferate the comics among their friends .
" The Internet has completely changed how you can do this kind of art , " Munroe said .
" I 've read a couple of books about what it 's like to do art in the syndicate .
...
It sounds really miserable . "
Aside from frequent fan requests , there was no guarantee that XKCD readers would buy a neatly bound , dead - tree version of the black - and - white graphics .
XKCD 's audience looks uncannily like the ones that rarely pay for movies or music , downloading copyrighted content by the hundreds .
But as Cory Doctorow and Wil Wheaton have also shown , if this new generation of consumers cares about the property , they 'll pay for it .
Especially in book form .
Maybe that 's a topic to explore in future XKCD comics or in " XKCD : Volume 1 , " which Ohanian believes is on Munroe 's road map .
But for now , XKCD 's math geeks still have to solve the book 's puzzle .
In the meantime , Munroe , an engineer at heart , is constructing underwater radio - controlled robots .
No joke .

Britain's Ministry of Defence it was unaware of the markings Coded references to biblical passages are inscribed on gunsights widely used by the US and British military in Iraq and Afghanistan , it has emerged .
The markings include " 2COR4:6 " and " JN8:12 " , relating to verses in the books of II Corinthians and John .
Trijicon , the US - based manufacturer , was founded by a devout Christian , and says it runs to " Biblical standards " .
But military officials in the US and UK have expressed concern over the way the markings will be perceived .
The company had been adding the references to its sights for many years , but the issue surfaced only recently when soldiers complained to an advocacy group , an ABC News investigation found .
Raised lettering Versions of Trijicon 's Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight ( Acog ) are used by the US Special Operations Forces , the US Marine Corps and the US Army .
Many soldiers know of them and are very confused as to why they are there and what it is supposed to mean
US soldier , quoted by Military Religious Freedom Foundation Britain 's Ministry of Defence has just ordered 480 Acog sights for use on its new Sharpshooter rifles - to be used by troops in Afghanistan .
Other versions of the Acog sight are " widely in service " , the ministry says .
The inscriptions are subtle and appear in raised lettering at the end of the stock number .
John 8:12 reads : " When Jesus spoke again to the people , he said , ' I am the light of the world .
Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . "
The nod to part of the second letter of Paul to the Corinthians , found on the company 's Reflex sight , references the text : " For God , who said , ' Let light shine out of darkness , ' made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ . "
An MoD spokesman told the BBC the ministry appreciated the biblical references could cause offence and was talking to its supplier , but was " not aware at the time of purchase that these markings had any broader significance " .
' Propaganda tool '
The US Defense Department is a major customer of Trijicon's , signing deals for $ 66 m ( £ 40.8 m ) of the company 's products in 2009 alone .
The US Marine Corps told the BBC they were " concerned with how this may be perceived " and were meeting with the company to " discuss future sight procurements " .
We believe that America is great when its people are good .
This goodness has been based on biblical standards throughout our history and we will strive to follow those morals
Trijicon
The US Army said it was looking into any potential policy violation .
The issue has been thrust into the spotlight by the US Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) - an advocacy group that seeks to preserve the separation of church and state in the military .
On 14 January , the MRFF received an e-mail , purportedly from a Muslim US Army infantryman , complaining about the markings .
" Many soldiers know of them and are very confused as to why they are there and what it is supposed to mean . "
The email adds : " Everyone is worried that if they were captured in combat that the enemy would use the Bible quotes against them in captivity or some other form of propaganda . "
MRFF president Mikey Weinstein says the inscriptions could give the Taliban and other enemy forces a propaganda tool .
" I do n't have to wonder for a nanosecond how the American public would react if citations from the Koran were being inscribed onto these US armed forces gunsights instead of New Testament citations , " he said .
A Trijicon spokesman told the BBC the company " has been working to provide America 's military men and women with high quality , innovative sighting systems for the weapons they use " .
" Our effort is simple and straightforward : to help our servicemen and women win the war on terror and come home safe to their families .
" As part of our faith and our belief in service to our country , Trijicon has put scripture references on our products for more than two decades .
" As long as we have men and women in danger , we will continue to do everything we can to provide them with both state - of - the - art technology and the never - ending support and prayers of a grateful nation , " the spokesman added .
The company states on its website : " We believe that America is great when its people are good .
This goodness has been based on biblical standards throughout our history and we will strive to follow those morals . "

Aktivisten dürfen nach Gaza : " Sie haben uns umarmt und geküsst "
Nach tagelangen Protesten in Ägypten dürfen 100 Friedensaktivisten in den Gaza - Streifen - auf kurze Zeit und unter Polizeibewachung .
Ihre Berichte sind erschütternd .
GAZA taz | Die Differenzen der Teilnehmer des Gaza - Freedom - Marsches sind schließlich vergessen , als knapp hundert Aktivisten nach tagelangen Protesten doch noch von Ägypten aus in das von der Welt abgeriegelte Gaza dürfen .
Ihre Berichte erschüttern .
Ein Beispiel ist die Geschichte der Samuli - Familie , bei der 28 Mitglieder lebendig in den Trümmern ihres Hauses begraben wurden .
Die Menschen in Gaza sind durch solche Erlebnisse traumatisiert , eine psychologische Unterstützung ist jedoch kaum möglich .
45.000 Menschen stehen auf der Warteliste des Mental Health Zentrum , das Kinder mit Kriegstraumata therapiert .
Die Bilder , die die Kinder malen hätten sie erschreckt , erzählt eine Aktivistin aus Sydney : Zerfetzte Körper , aus denen Blut spritzt oder ein ein übergroßes Auge , das Tränen aus Blut weint .
Auch wenn die UNO im Gaza dafür sorgt , dass keine akute Hungersnot ausbricht , fehlt es an allem .
Einer Katastrophe gleich käme es , wenn Ägypten tatsächlich die Tunnel schließt , durch die Waren nach Gaza geschmuggelt würden .
" Jede Wasserflasche , jede Coladose , die ich getrunken habe , selbst das Toilettenpapier , das ich benutzt habe - absolut alles kommt durch die Tunnel , " erzählt eine Amerikanerin nach dem Trip .
Vielen Aktivisten , die in Gaza waren , ist der Mangel an Kinderschuhen aufgefallen .
Überall würden Kinder barfuß durch die Kälte laufen oder durch die Trümmer klettern .
Die in Kanada lebende Nancy hat Krankenhäuser in Gaza besucht .
Es gäbe zwar Medikamente berichtet sie .
Das eigentliche Problem sei aber , dass der Import von Ersatzteilen und Software für medizinische Geräte verboten sei .
Oft müsste mit lebensgefährlichen und defekten Apparaturen operiert werden .
Besonders ergreifend war der Empfang für vier Rabbis der orthodoxen Neturei - Karta - Bewegung gewesen , die der Buskonvoi irgenwo an der Straße im Sinai aufgelesen hatte .
Sie waren aus New York nach Gaza gereist , um sich im Namen des Judentums für die an den Palästinensern begangenen Verbrechen zu entschuldigen .
" Wir , und sicherlich auch die von der Hamas kontrollierte Polizei , die die ganze Zeit ein strengens Auge auf uns hatte , waren zunächst ziemlich besorgt um die Sicherheit der Rabbis " , erzählt eine amerikanische Teilnehmerin .
" Aber die Leute haben sie mit Begeisterung empfangen , haben sie umarmt und geküsst .
Die Kinder haben sich ein Vergnügen daraus gemacht , mit den Locken der Rabbis zu spielen .
Überall wo wir mit ihnen hinkamen , wurde ihnen der Ehrenplatz zugewiesen .
Es gibt wohl kaum einen besseren Beweis , dass ein zusammenleben zwischen Juden und Palästinensern möglich ist " , berichtet die Amerikanerin .
Viele Friedensaktivisten , die es nach Gaza geschafft hatten , waren erstaunt über das hohe Bildungsniveau der Menschen .
" Ich habe einem Polizisten , der mich begleitet hat gesagt , ich komme aus England und er begann englische Gedichte zu zitieren , " erzählt ein älterer Mann .
Ein Student aus New York , der seinen 22 .
Geburtstag in Gaza feierte , erzählt , die Menschen wollten lernen , Bildung sei ihre einzige Hoffnung .
Viele hätten Stipendien für amerikanische oder europäische Universitäten , aber sie könnten wegen der Blockade nicht ausreisen .
" Ich werde keine Ruhe geben , bis meine neuen Freunde genauso frei durch die Welt reisen dürfen , wie ich " , erklärt der Student .
Alle waren erstaunt über den
Mut und die Würde , die sich die Menschen bewahrt hätten .
Ein Kanadier berichtet , er hätte einer Familie , die in Trümmern lebte , gesammelte Spenden geben wollen .
Doch sie hätten konsequent abgelehnt .
Schließlich hätte er kleine Beträge an die Kinder verteilt , so wie es in der arabischen Welt beim Zuckerfest am Ende des Ramadan Tradition ist .
Die Reise der knapp hundert Teilnehmer war umstritten .
Nach tagelangen Protesten - besonders durch die 300 - köpfige Delegation aus Frankreich , die aus Protest gegen das Reiseverbot auf dem Gehweg vor der französischen Botschaft ein mit Palästinaflaggen geschmücktes Zeltlager errichteten - hatten die ägyptischen Behörden Ende Dezember plötzlich den Transit für 100 Personen für das erste Januarwochenende freigegeben .
Das Koordinierungskomitee sollte ihnen innerhalb von zwei Studen eine Namensliste vorlegen - eine Frist in der eine grundsätzliche Diskussion über das Angebot kaum möglich war .
Fast alle Delegationen lehnten die Bedingungen der Ägypter als Spaltungsmanöver ab : Denn weder Franzosen noch Araber durften mitfahren .
Politische Parolen in den Bussen waren verboten .
Trotzdem stiegen rund 100 Teilnehmer aus Eigeninitiative und unter dem Protest der Mehrheit in die Busse ein .
Auch die palästinensichen NGOs , die in Gaza das Programm des Friedensmarsches vorbereitet hatte , lehnten das ägyptische Angebot mehrheitlich ab : " Wir wollen nicht immer und immer wieder irgendwelchen Abordnungen die Hände schütteln , wie wollen nachhaltige politische Solidarität " , erklärzen sie .
Der Protest zeigt auch Wirkung in Ägypten .
Jetzt regt sich Widerstand gegen den Bau der Stahlmauer , die mehrere Meter in den Boden gesenkt wird , um den Warenverkehr durch die Tunnel zu unterbrechen .
Offiziell wird der Mauerbau mit nationalen Sicherheitsinteressen bergündet .
" Warum brauchen wir eine Mauer gegen unsere palästinensischen Brüder , wenn die Grenze zu Israel völlig ungesichert ist ? "
Fragt die liberale Wafd - Zeitung und beweist die
These mit einem Korrespondenten , der ohne kontrolliert zu werden über die isarelisch - ägyptische Grenze in die isarelische Negev - Wüste gewandert ist .
Die meisten Drogen und Waffen würden über die israelische , nicht über die palästinensische Grenze nach Ägypten geschmuggelt werden , so die Redakteure .
Auch an mehreren ägyptischen Universitäten haben Studenten gegen den Mauerbau demonstriert .
Sie werfen ihrer Regierung vor , Erfüllungsgehilfen der israelischen Blockade zu sein .
Eine Gruppe von Rechtsanwälten hat am Montag Klage gegen die Regierung eingereicht und fordert die sofortige Aussetzung der Bauarbeiten an der Stahlmauer .
In einem offenen Brief der Rechtsanwältegewerkschaft an Präsident Mubarak heißt es unter Anspielung auf Mubaraks Rolle im Oktoberkrieg 1973 : " Als Führer der Befreiung des Sinais fordern wir vom Präsidenten , den Bau des Sicherheitszaunes sofort zu unterbinden , die Grenzübergänge nach Gaza zu öffnen und dazu beizutragen , die Leiden der Palästinenser zu lindern ....
Ägypten muss auch in Zukunft die Palästinenser nicht nur in Worten , sondern auch in Taten unterstützen . "
Der Streit um den Bau der Mauer hat auch die Religiösen Autoritäten erreicht .
Der in Qatar lebende und geachtete Schaikh Qaradawi hat in einer Fatwa , einem religiösen Rechtsgutachten , die Stahmauer als haram - als Sünde - erklärt .
Die Scharia würde verbieten , Menschen auszuhungern .
Das gelte besonders für muslimische Brüder und Schwestern .
Dem folgte prompt ein Gegengutachten des Azhar - Schaikhs , Sayyid Tantawi : Jedes Land hätte das Recht auf Selbstverteidigung .
By Michael Barone - February 4 , 2010
Quick , name the most distrusted occupations .
Trial lawyers ?
Pretty skuzzy , as witness the disgraced John Edwards , kept from the vice presidency in 2004 by the electoral votes of Ohio .
Used car dealers ?
Always near the bottom of the list , as witness the universal understanding of the word " clunker . "
But over the last three months a new profession has moved smartly up the list and threatens to overtake all .
Climate scientist .
First came the Climategate e-mails made public in November that showed how top - level climate scientists distorted research , plotted to destroy data and conspired to prevent publication of dissenting views .
The British government concluded last week that the University of East Anglia 's Climate Research Unit violated the nation 's freedom of information act , although the violations occurred too long ago for prosecution .
The CRU has been a major source of data for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which for 20 years has issued alarms about supposed global warming .
The e-mails conclusively establish the intellectual dishonesty of the climate scientists at the CRU and their co-conspirators .
Recently , there have been even more shocking revelations .
The IPCC has claimed that warming will cause the Himalayan glaciers to disappear by 2035 .
It turns out that that claim was based solely on a pamphlet published by the World Wildlife Federation , based on no science at all .
The head of the IPCC was informed that a 1996 report said those glaciers could melt significantly by 2350 , not 2035 , but he let the claim stand .
As Christopher Booker writes in the Telegraph of London , " A Canadian analyst has identified more than 20 passages in the IPCC 's report which cite similarly non-peer - reviews WWF or Greenpeace reports as their authority . "
Similarly , the Times of London reports that a claim that warming could endanger " up to 40 percent " of the Amazon rainforest came from an anti-smoking activist and had no scientific basis whatever .
" The global warming movement as we have known it is dead , " writes Walter Russell Mead of the Council on Foreign Relations in The American Interest .
" The movement died from two causes : bad science and bad politics . "
Some decades hence , I suspect , people will look back and wonder why so many government , corporate and media elites were taken in by propaganda that was based on such shoddy and dishonest evidence .
And taken in to the point that they advocated devoting trillions of dollars to a cause that was based on flagrant dishonesty and dissembling .
There was some basis for concern .
If carbon dioxide emissions were the only factor affecting global climate , it is clear that increased emissions would tend to produce warmer temperatures over time .
Those temperatures could create problems that rational societies would want to address .
But carbon dioxide emissions are not the only factor affecting global climate .
Solar activity and water evaporation and countless other things do , too .
Climate scientists do not fully understand those things and how they interact .
It is rational for society to want to learn more .
Unfortunately , the cadre of climate scientists who have dominated public discussion and have controlled the IPCC have been demonstrated to be far , far less than trustworthy .
Like the theorists who invented epicycles to explain away the failure of Ptolemaic theory to account for astronomical observations , they have distorted science in the interest of something that resembles religious dogma .
The secular religion of global warming has all the elements of a religious faith : original sin ( we are polluting the planet ) , ritual ( separate your waste for recycling ) , redemption ( renounce economic growth ) and the sale of indulgences ( carbon offsets ) .
We are told that we must have faith ( all argument must end , as Al Gore likes to say ) and must persecute heretics ( global warming skeptics are like Holocaust deniers , we are told ) .
People in the grip of such a religious frenzy evidently feel justified in lying , concealing good evidence and plucking bad evidence from whatever flimsy source may be at hand .
The rest of us , and judging from polls that includes most of the American people , are free to follow a more rational path .
In his State of the Union Address , Barack Obama alluded to " the overwhelming evidence on climate change . "
But he felt obliged to add , " even if you doubt the evidence " -- an admission that the evidence is less than overwhelming .
On a par with , it seems , the claims of trial lawyers and the assurances of used car salesmen .
As we watch the battle over health reform play out against the backdrop of an H1N1 pandemic , I am reminded of many of the political lessons learned over the years ( " do n't get mad , organize " , " all politics is local " ) including the exhortations of many posters here ( " are you going to complain , or are you going to do something ? " ) to work for change , real change that you can measure and see and feel .
As it happens , my home state of Connecticut is also home to a campaign to improve ordinary people 's lives by highlighting a local legislative battle to mandate paid sick days for employers of larger companies .
This is legislation that 's come close to passing before ( it 's passed each chamber , but not in the same year ) , and this year , there 's a concerted push to get it done .
Who does n't have paid sick days ?
Among others , day care and nursing home workers , bus drivers , grocery workers and very likely your neighbors or someone you know .
And from a societal and public health perspective , coming to work sick for these folks is a great way , for example , to spread flu and other illnesses , exactly what you do n't want .
Here 's a paragraph from the Connecticut Working Families Party blog :
Why paid sick days ?
Here ’s my reason : According to a new study ( pdf ) , 8 million Americans went to work infected with swine flu .
And 7 million caught H1N1 from a sick co-worker .
And do n’t forget , 24 people in Connecticut actually died from swine flu .
There are a thousand reasons we need a basic workplace standard to allow Connecticut workers to earn paid sick days .
But like clockwork , corporate lobbyists are already trotting out the same old canard that it ’s too expensive for businesses .
( As if it ’s really profitable to make sick employees come to work . )
Here 's local coverage of a hearing this week on the topic in Hartford :
Jon Green has been the Executive Director of Connecticut Working Families since 2002 .
Working Families is a coalition of neighborhood activist , community organizations and labor unions that is united to fight for the ‘ kitchen table ’ economic issues that matter most to working class and middle class families in Connecticut , like affordable healthcare , good jobs and fair taxes .
He 's kindly consented to answer a few questions on the issue of paid sick days in terms of practicality , affordability , politics and more .
Daily Kos :
What ’s the CT Working Families Party ?
Are you a political party ?
Do you endorse candidates ?
Connecticut Working Families Party http://www.ct-workingfamilies.org/ is a independent progressive party formed by formed by union leaders and grassroots activists to fight for ' kitchen table ' economic issues like affordable healthcare , living wage jobs and progressive taxes .
We ’re deeply troubled by the growing gap between the rich and just about everyone else .
We work to hold elected officials in all parties accountable on issues of economic fairness for working and middle class families .
It ’s important to point out that Working Families is very different from typical third parties .
We operate in states that allow cross-endorsement http://www.ct-workingfamilies.org/... ( also called " fusion voting " ) which means candidates can be nominated by a major party and a minor party like ours .
For every office , from City Council up to Governor , Working Families studies the records of the candidates and endorses the ones who are most committed to fighting for our progressive values .
Then we work our butts of to help them get elected .
In 2008 in Connecticut , our top priority race was helping to elect Democrat Jim Himes in CT - 4 .
We knocked on tens of thousands of doors , talking to mostly unaffiliated suburban voters , asking people to vote for healthcare and jobs by voting on the Working Families line for Jim Himes - we delivered over 9000 votes on the Working Families ballot line to help push him over the top in an extremely tight race .
Statewide , Working Families garnered about 85,000 votes for cross-endorsed Democratic Congressional candidates .
But Election Day is just the beginning .
After Election Day , we work year - round to hold them accountable to their progressive promises on our issues .
The paid sick days campaign is our top legislative priority this year .
Working Families is now a ballot - qualified party in 6 states -- New York http://workingfamiliesparty.org/ , Connecticut http://www.ct-workingfamilies.org/ , Oregon http://www.oregonwfp.org/ , South Carolina http://www.oregonwfp.org/ , Delaware http://www.delworkingfamilies.org/ and Vermont http://www.vtworkingfamilies.org/ .
So look out for Working Families on a ballot near you .
Daily Kos :
Who has responded to your call for new legislation ?
The issue of paid sick days has been debated in the State Legislature for the past few years and has gained a fair amount of traction .
The bill has actually passed in each of legislative chamber , but not in the same year .
The majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate support the bill and have voted for it .
In the Senate , the bill has even received support from two Republican State Senators .
Some state legislators have made the bill a very high priority and have worked very hard to persuade their colleagues .
There are still some nay - sayers – most of the Republican caucus and some Democrats as well .
But we ’re optimistic that the bill will pass – hopefully this year .
I should add that we 're not alone in this fight .
This year , we 've built a broad coalition , including public health professionals , including the Connecticut State Medical Society < https://www.csms.org> and the Academy of Pediatrics < http://www.ct-aap.org> , women 's advocacy organizations including Momsrising.org < http://momsrising.org> , NARAL < http://www.pro-choicect.org> , Planned Parenthood < http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppsne> , CT Sexual Assault Crisis Services < http://www.connsacs.org> and CT Coalition Against Domestic Violence < http://www.ctcadv.org> , unions -- particularly those who represent service sector employees -- like SEIU locals 32 BJ < http://www.seiu32bj.org> and CSEA < http://www.csea-ct.com> and UFCW < http://www.ufcw371.org> , anti-poverty organizations like CT Assocation for Human Services < http://www.cahs.org> , and more , and even a handful of small business owners .
Having a broad - based coalition , including a few who are not the usual suspects , has been instrumental , not to mention gratifying .
Daily Kos :
Some might be surprised at who does n’t have paid sick days .
What kind of people in CT need this kind of legislation passed , and why ?
According to research by the National Partnership for Women and Families ( pdf ) < http://everybodybenefits.org/psd_study.pdf> , an estimated 600,000 workers in Connecticut lack paid sick days .
That includes lots of people in jobs with a high level of public interaction , people who prepare and serve our food , work as retail clerks , drive our children to school and take care of the sick and elderly as home health aids .
More than 80 % of restaurant workers lack paid sick days .
In other words , the very people who have the highest chance of spreading illnesses are generally those most likely to lack paid sick days .
But to answer the question of who needs this legislation , the answer is all of us .
Workers without paid sick days would of course by most impacted .
Especially in a tough economy like this , we do n't think people should be forced to choose between their livelihoods and their health or the health of their families .
For the rest of us , this is also a serious public health issue .
Especially in the wake of the H1N1 outbreak , it should be clear that when people have no choice but to go to work sick , it puts us all in danger .
According to research by the Institute for Women 's Policy ( pdf ) < http://www.iwpr.org/pdf/B284sickatwork.pdf> , an estimated 8 million people went to work with the H1N1 swine flu virus .
And workers without paid sick days were much more likely to do so .
As a result , 7 million people caught the virus from a sick co-worker .
And it 's not just about the swine flu .
Do you ever go out to eat and catch a ' stomach flu ' ?
According to the Center for Disease Control < http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/norovirus-factsheet.htm> , about half of the 23 million annual ' norovirus ' infections are linked to an ill food service worker .
Allowing workers to take paid sick days could really take a bite out of the skyrocketing cost of our healthcare system .
When employees ca n’t get time away from work to go to the doctor , they are less likely to get the kind of preventive care and early treatment of illnesses that we all know lowers overall healthcare costs .
Without paid sick days , people are more likely to wait until a problem gets very serious ( and very costly ) and end up in our overcrowded emergency rooms .
Daily Kos :
Does this actually have a chance to pass ?
It does .
Last year , our bill passed in the State House , but wound up deadlocked in the State Senate .
The prior year , it passed in the Senate , but was n't called for a vote in the House .
We 're building a massive grassroots campaign to make sure both houses do it this year .
If you live in Connecticut , you can ask your state legislators to support the paid sick days bill here :
http://action.workingfamiliesparty.o...
It certainly wo n't be easy : as you can imagine , our opponents , the CBIA ( Connecticut 's Chamber of Commerce ) are trotting out the same old ' bad - for - business ' canard .
It ’s fear tactic without a lot of evidence , but there are some legislators who are more motivated by fear than by facts .
Of course , if we could pass a law to stop people from ever getting sick , we surely would .
But in fact , people do get sick .
And if they face a choice between staying home and losing pay ( maybe even losing their job ) or going to work sick , more often than not people will go to work sick .
That ’s not good for anyone , including their employer .
They are less productive employees , they take longer to recover , and by spreading their illnesses to others they simply compound the productivity loss .
Serious academic analysis actually suggests that businesses save money in the long run by enacting a paid sick days policy , mostly because of reduced spread of illness at the workplace and lower turnover .
And the experience that San Francisco had after enacting a paid sick days policy in 2007 confirms this research .
According to the IWPR ( pdf ) < http://www.iwpr.org/pdf/B264_JobGrowth.pdf> job growth in San Francisco remained a strong as , or stronger than , any surrounding county .
And in the restaurant industry , job growth actually ticked up following the implementation of the paid sick days policy .
The security forces on Tuesday destroyed an illegal structure serving as a synagogue in the Givat Menachem outpost near the West Bank settlement of Nahliel .
Shortly afterwards , the Civil Administration received a report of a number of Palestinians vehicles with smashed windshields found near the village of Bitilu .
The Civil Administration launched an investigation into the incident .
West Bank Leftists videotape settler stone - throwing near Hebron Olga Goretzky Peace activists attacked by hooded settlers while documenting what they say is illegal Jewish construction in south Mount Hebron ; leftist , activist injured in altercation .
' This was a lynch attempt , ' leftist says Leftists videotape settler stone - throwing near Hebron
After the synagogue was destroyed , the holy books were handed over to the community rabbi .
The operation was completed without any unusual incidents .
The Binyamin settlers ' committee said in response that " the selective destruction of the synagogue is a continuation of the demolition of the synagogue in ( the outpost of ) Maoz Ester last week .
( Defense Minister Ehud ) Barak specializes in destruction , and the synagogue and additional structures in the Binyamin region will be rebuilt as early as today . "
Meanwhile , the security forces and Civil Administration representatives handed out demolition orders on Hill 18 , near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba .
In response , the Binyamin and Samaria settlers ' committee declared together with the Komemiut movement that the settlers would begin Tuesday to set up houses , clubs , a café and a nursery in 10 communities .
The operation would be launched in the settlement of Elon Moreh , they said .
David Ben Zion , one of the operation 's organizers , told Ynet that " where a caravan was destroyed five days ago we have placed a floor .
We will put up walls and a roof and hold a ceremony in the area this afternoon .
People slated to live in the building will enter it and it will later be connected to water and electricity supplies .
" We have said , and have been consistent about it the entire time , that a new building will be set up in the exact place where a building freeze order is issued . "
Next month 's Super Bowl broadcast , which garners an enormous TV audience , will feature an advert paid for by an anti-abortion evangelical Christian group .
A former college football star known for his outspoken beliefs will appear in the costly 30 - second spot bought by Focus on the Family , a Colorado - based ministry influential in Christian conservative politics .
Nearly 100 million Americans are expected to tune in to Super Bowl XLIV on 7 February in Miami Gardens , south Florida .
The adverts attract nearly as much attention as the game itself , with Americans watching to see how brands vie for consumers ' attention .
The Focus on the Family advert is a rare spot from an advocacy group .
The advertisement will feature Tim Tebow , former champion quarterback for the University of Florida football team , who painted Bible quotations under his eyes during games .
Focus on the Family and CBS television , the network broadcasting the game , did not disclose the cost of the advert , but media analysts say the cost of a 30 - second spot will run between $ 2.5 m and $ 2.8 m .
The advert , entitled Celebrate Family , Celebrate Life , will feature Tebow and his mother Pam , who will tell what the group describes as an inspiring story from her life .
It has not released details of the advert , but US media have speculated that she will describe a 1987 pregnancy during which she became ill on a missionary trip to the Philippines .
She ignored medical advice to have an abortion , instead giving birth to Tim .
" We 're not trying to sell the American people a car or a soft drink , " said spokesman Gary Schneeberger .
" We 're celebrating families . "
Schneeberger said the group hopes to influence couples having " struggles " in their marriage .
Tebow 's father , Bob , runs a group that leads evangelical missions in the Philippines and founded an orphanage there .
The Super Bowl airs alongside creative but often crass adverts for beer , car manufacturers and internet companies , and the network that broadcasts the game normally shies away from controversy .
In addition , advocacy groups typically lack the budget to purchase Super Bowl airtime .
Focus on the Family said the funds were provided by wealthy supporters .
" They 've vetted us , " Schneeberger said of CBS .
" They know who we are . "
Previous advocacy adverts during the Super Bowl have included anti-drug and anti-tobacco spots .
Jon Swallen , senior vice - president of research at media tracker TNS Media Intelligence , said the ad had fuelled media speculation and encouraged buzz in order to maximise publicity .
Between 95 and 100 million people tuned in last year to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers defeat the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII .
The game generated $ 213 m in advertising revenue .

A scientist at the University of East Anglia has been questioned by detectives ­investigating how controversial emails were leaked from the campus 's climate research unit .
Norfolk police have interviewed and taken a formal statement from Paul Dennis , 54 , another climate researcher who heads an adjacent laboratory .
The leaked emails from the head of the unit , Professor Phil Jones , surfaced just before the Copenhagen conference in December and caused a furore because they suggested that data which did not support theories of global warming was being deliberately withheld .
Dennis denies leaking the material .
But it is understood that his links with climate change sceptic bloggers in North America drew him to the attention of the investigating team , and have exposed rifts within the university 's environmental science faculty .
Dennis refused to sign a petition in support of Jones when the scandal broke .
He told friends he was one of several staff unwilling to put their names to the Met Office - inspired statement in support of the global warming camp , because " science is n't done by consensus " .
University sources say the head of department , Professor Jacquie Burgess , received a letter from Dennis at the height of the email uproar , calling for more open release of data .
He appears to have disapproved of the way Jones resisted FoI requests .
Dennis 's own research , which dates fluctuating temperatures in ice cores stretching back thousands of years , does not support the more catastrophic current predictions of runaway global warming .
He has a history of contact with the American bloggers who bombarded Jones 's unit with FoI requests , and were the first to receive the leaks .
The ensuing global row led to Jones standing aside from his post .
Last week he was rebuked by the Information Commissioner 's office for apparent breaches of FoI rules .
One piece of information that led police to question Dennis was the discovery of emails between him and Stephen McIntyre , who runs a sceptic blog in Toronto called Climate Audit .
Climate Audit was the first to receive an anonymous link to the leaked data .
Dennis subsequently emailed McIntyre to alert him to a University of East Anglia ( UAE ) message confirming that a leak had occurred .
The scientist also had contact with Patrick Condon , an aeronautical engineer in Morris , Illinois , who runs a similar maths - oriented sceptic blog called Air Vent , and criticises " leftists " who promote global warming theories .
A third blogger with whom Dennis has posted is Anthony Watts , a weatherman for a California radio station who is involved in a sometimes vituperative sceptic blog called Watts Up with That .
He has had a book published by the Heartland Institute , a denialist organisation which until 2006 , received funding from ExxonMobil .
All three American bloggers , McIntyre , Condon and Watts , were initially sent links to the cache of CRU leaked material , via anonymous servers , on the same day , Tuesday 17 November .
McIntyre then received a message from Dennis in Norwich , where UEA is located .
According to files obtained by police , he wrote : " Hi Steve , Yesterday we received the following email , sent to all staff in environmental sciences and the climatic research unit .
I have no idea what stuff was collected or where it was posted , but interesting nonetheless ! "
The attached message from Prof Alastair Grant , deputy head of department , said : " A large volume of files and emails from computers in ENV and CRU have been posted on to a website , apparently by climate change sceptics . "
The university 's move followed a tipoff from a Nasa climate scientist , Gavin Schmidt , in New York .
Schmidt said his own blog , called Realclimate , had been temporarily taken over by a hacker posting a link to the university 's internal emails .
Staff at the beleaguered environmental sciences department say they have been asked not to talk to the media .
But Dennis has now posted an account of his police interview at a British website run by a sceptic accountant , Andrew Montford .
He told Montford 's blog , called Bishop Hill : " They thought I might have some information on the basis that I had sent [ Condon ] a copy of a paper I had published on isotopes and climate at the southern end of the Antarctic Peninsula … and I had exchanged emails with Steve McIntyre over the leak / hack .
" Clearly they 've trawled through the UEA mail server and checked for key words …
The police left me very much with the impression that they were working on the theory that this was an outside hack and was done deliberately to disrupt Copenhagen . "
Norfolk police have discounted tabloid stories of links to Russian intelligence , despite claims this week by the former government chief scientist Sir David King .
He said only foreign intelligence agencies or US lobbyists had the resources to make the " highly sophisticated " selection of embarrassing phrases and correspondence dating back to 1996 in the leaks .
But a technical analysis by the Guardian shows the process could have been much more straightforward .
The files were all in one place on a backup server , according to UEA , and all it took to sift them was a series of simple searches using keywords such as " Yamal " [ the name of a controversial research project ] , " tree rings " , or " Phil Jones " .
This would explain why many of the published emails and documents contain such keywords .
On at least two previous occasions , in 2008 and July 2009 , data on the CRU ­servers turned out to be accidentally accessible to the probing bloggers – simply thanks to weak security .
The police have now moved on to a series of " very detailed " approaches to the overseas bloggers and members of their chat forums , asking if they had access to university passwords , and if they have any theories of their own .
" The police really do n't know what happened , " says Condon , who was emailed by investigators after Christmas .
He told the Guardian : " It seems to me more like a prank than anything else . "

An Iranian - backed Shia terror group that claims it seeks reconciliation with the Iraqi government has kidnapped a US civilian in Baghdad .
The US recently released the top leader of the group under the guise of a reconciliation program , but the release actually was related to a hostage exchange .
The Asaib al Haq , or the League of the Righteous , kidnapped Issa T. Salomi , a US civilian contractor , in Baghdad in late January .
Salomi went missing in Baghdad sometime after Jan. 23 , the US Department of Defense noted in a press release on Friday .
The League of the Righteous issued a videotape of Salomi , who is pictured in US Army digital fatigues in front of a banner that reads “ League of the Righteous , Imam Ali Regiment . ”
The League of the Righteous has demanded that the Iraqi government release all members of the League and “ bring the proper justice and the proper punishment to those members of Blackwater company that have committed unjustifiable crimes against innocent Iraqi civilians , ” according to a partial translation provided by The Associated Press .
The kidnapping of the US contractor comes just a little more than a month after the US military released Qaiz Qazali , the leader of the League of the Righteous .
Qazali was behind the kidnapping and murder of five US soldiers in Karbala in January 2007 and numerous other acts of terrorism before he was captured in March 2007 .
Qazali was released in late December 2009 , purportedly as part of a reconciliation process , which the League has suspended this week as it claims the Iraqi government will not free all of its members .
But Qazali was released at the same time that a British contractor , who had been captured by the League of the Righteous in May of 2007 , was turned over to the British .
The Shia terror group previously executed four other British contractors who had also been held hostage .
The release of Qazali and his brother Laith , who was freed in July 2009 along with more than 100 other members of the group , has angered US military and intelligence officials contacted by The Long War Journal .
At the time of Qazali ’s release , US military and intelligence officials said that the reconciliation program was an excuse to conduct a hostage exchange and warned that the group would return to terrorism .
“ The official line is the release of Qazali is about reconciliation , but in reality this was a prisoner swap , ” a military intelligence official said after Qazali ’s release in December .
Another military officer described Qazali ’s release as “ a deal signed and sealed in British and American blood , ”
The kidnapping of the US contractor is seen as evidence the League of the Righteous has no intentions of reconciling as claimed and will continue to use violence to achieve their ends .
“ We ’ve been had , ” a senior military officer told The Long War Journal .
“ Anyone who closely followed the League of the Righteous should have known this was inevitable . ”
Background on Qais Qazali
Qais Qazali was the commander of the League of the Righteous before US forces detained him and several other Shia terrorists in 2007 .
Qais commanded a large Mahdi Army faction and served as a spokesman and senior aide to Muqtada al Sadr .
The terror group , which was part of the Mahdi Army until the spring of 2008 , has received extensive financial and military support from Iran ’s Qods Force , the external division that backs Hezbollah and is tasked with supporting the Khomeinist Islamist revolution .
The League of the Righteous was directly implicated by General David Petraeus as being behind the January 2007 attack on the Provincial Joint Coordination Center in Karbala as well as other high - profile terror attacks in Iraq .
Five US soldiers were killed during the Karbala attack and subsequent kidnapping attempt .
The US soldiers were executed after US and Iraqi security forces closed in on the assault team .
The attack on the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center was a complex , sophisticated operation .
The assault team , led by tactical commander Azhar al Dulaimi , was trained in a mock - up of the center that was built in Iran .
The unit had excellent intelligence and received equipment that made them appear to be US soldiers .
Some of the members of the assault team are said to have spoken English .
The US military caught a break when it detained Laith and Qais and several other members of the network during a raid in Basrah in March 2007 .
Also detained during the raid was Ali Mussa Daqduq , a senior Hezbollah operative who was tasked by Iran to organize the Special Groups and “ rogue ” Mahdi Army cells along the lines of Lebanese Hezbollah .
Daqduq is a 24 - year veteran of Hezbollah , and he commanded both a Hezbollah special operations unit and the security detail of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah .
Azhar al Dulaimi , the leader of the January 2007 Karbala assault team , was killed in a raid in Baghdad in May 2007 .

Presentation by Nick Grace and Bill Roggio , December 2007 .
Both the Iraqi government and the US military have stated that Iran has backed various Shia terror groups inside Iraq , including elements of the Mahdi Army .
While the Iranian government has denied the charges , Iraqi and US forces have detained dozens of Iranian Qods Force officers and operatives , captured numerous Shia terrorist leaders under Iranian command , and found ample documentation as well as Iranian - made and Iranian - supplied weapons .
Since late 2006 , US and Iraqi forces have captured and killed several high - level Qods Force officers inside Iraq .
Among those captured were Mahmud Farhadi , one of the three Iranian regional commanders in the Ramazan Corps ; Ali Mussa Daqduq , a senior Lebanese Hezbollah operative ; and Qais Qazali , the leader of the Qazali Network , which is better known as the Asaib al Haq or the League of the Righteous .
Azhar al Dulaimi , one of Qazali ’s senior tactical commanders , was killed in Iraq in early 2007 .
Since mid-October 2008 , Iraqi and US forces have killed one Qods Force operative and captured 17 during raids throughout southern and central Iraq .
Qods Force , the special operations branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , has supported various Shia militias and terror groups inside Iraq , including the Mahdi Army .
Qods Force helped to build the Mahdi Army along the same lines as Lebanese Hezbollah .
Iran denies the charges , but captive Shia terrorists admit to having been recruited by Iranian agents and then transported into Iran for training .
Immediately after the fall of Saddam Hussein ’s regime , Iran established the Ramazan Corps to direct operations inside Iraq .
The US military says that Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah have helped establish , fund , train , arm , and provide operational support for Shia terror groups such as the Hezbollah Brigades and the League of the Righteous .
The US military refers to these groups along with the Iranian - backed elements of the Mahdi Army as the “ Special Groups . ”
These groups train in camps inside Iran .
US military officers believe that Iran has been ramping up its operations inside Iraq since its surrogates suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Iraqi military during the spring and summer of 2008 .
Iraqi troops went on the offensive against the Mahdi Army and other Iranian - backed terror groups in Baghdad , Basrah , and central and southern Iraq .
More than 2,000 Mahdi Army members were killed and thousands more were wounded .
The operation forced Muqtada al Sadr to agree to a cease - fire , disband the Mahdi Army , and pull the Sadrist political party out of the provincial elections .
Sadr ’s moves caused shock waves in the Mahdi Army , as some of the militia ’s leaders wished to continue the fight against US forces in Baghdad and in southern and central Iraq .
Iranian - backed Shia terror groups in Iraq
The League of the Righteous was a faction of Muqtada al Sadr ’s Mahdi Army that splintered after Sadr announced in June 2008 that he would disband the Mahdi Army and formed a small , secretive military arm to fight Coalition forces .
The new group , called the Brigade of the Promised Day , has not been linked to any attacks since its formation in the summer of 2008 .
Sadr loyalist Qais Qazali was commander of the League of the Righteous up until his capture in 2007 .
The group is now said to be under the command of Akram al Kabi , a former Sadr loyalist .
The League of the Righteous receives funding , training , weapons , and direction from the Qods Force .
The League of the Righteous conducts attacks with the deadly armor- piercing explosively formed projectiles known as EFPs , as well as with the more conventional roadside bombs .
The size of the League of the Righteous is unknown , but hundreds of members of the group were killed , captured , or fled to Iran during the Iraqi government offensive against the Mahdi Army from March to July of 2008 , according to the US military .
Sadr is looking to pull the rank and file of the League back into the fold of the Sadr political movement .
Back in late 2008 , Sadr issued a message rejecting the US - Iraqi security agreement and said he “ extends his hand to the mujahideen in the so - called Asaib but not their leaderships who have been distracted by politics and mortal life from the [ two late ]
Sadrs and the interests of Iraq and Iraqis . ”
The Promise Day Brigade , the newest of the Iranian - backed groups , was formed by anti-American Shia leader Muqtada al Sadr during the summer of 2008 after he announced he would disband the Mahdi Army and formed a small , secretive military arm to fight Coalition forces in June .
The group actively receives support from Iran , the US military told The Long War Journal .
“ According to US and Iraqi intelligence sources , the Promise Day Brigades ( PDB ) terrorist organization is an Iranian - sponsored group actively targeting US Forces in attempt to disrupt security operations and further destabilize the nationalization process in Iraq , ” Lieutenant Todd Spitler , a Press Desk Officer at Multinational Forces Iraq , said .
The Hezbollah Brigades , or Kata’ib Hezbollah , has been active in and around Baghdad since 2007 .
The terror group has increased its profile by conducting attacks against US and Iraqi forces , using the deadly explosively - formed penetrator land mines and improvised rocket - assisted mortars , which have been described as flying improvised explosive devices .
The Hezbollah Brigades has posted videos of these attacks on the Internet .
The terror group is an offshoot of the Iranian - trained Special Groups , the US military said last summer .
Hezbollah Brigades receives funding , training , logistics , guidance , and material support from the Qods Force .
Both the US military and the Iraqi military believe that the Special Groups are preparing to reinitiate fighting as their leaders and operatives are beginning to filter back into Iraq from Iran .
On Feb .
4 , 2009 , Lieutenant General Lloyd Austin , the deputy commander of Multinational Forces Iraq , said that Iran continues to arm , fund , and train the Special Groups , and that munitions traced back to Iran continue to be uncovered in Iraq .
Recent intelligence and the finds of new Iranian caches “ lead us to believe that Iranian support activity is still ongoing , ” Austin warned .
In July 2009 , General David Petraeus , the commanding officer of US Central Command , said during an interview at the World Affairs Council Global Leadership Series that Iran continues to back the Special Groups .
“ There is no question that Iran continues to fund , train , equip , and direct to varying degrees some of the groups still active in Iraq , ” Petraeus said .

Washington ( CNN ) -- President Obama will announce in Wednesday 's State of the Union address that he 's proposing to save $ 250 billion by freezing all nonsecurity federal discretionary spending for three years , according to two senior administration officials .
The proposed freeze , which could help position Obama in the political center by sharpening his credentials on fiscal discipline , would exempt the budgets of the departments of Defense , Homeland Security , and Veterans Affairs , along with some international programs .
" We are at war , and we 're going to make sure our troops are funded adequately , " one of the senior officials said .
The officials would not reveal the details of which domestic programs would be cut , as they prepare to face major pushback from liberals in the president 's own party because popular education and health spending could be on the chopping block .
The details will be officially unveiled February 1 , when the president publicly releases his next budget blueprint for fiscal year 2011 -- which starts October 1 -- and beyond .
" We 've got to make some tough decisions , " the second senior official said .
" Everybody is not going to get what they want . "
What do you want to hear in the speech ?
Under the proposal , which would need to be approved by both houses of Congress , all federal discretionary spending would be frozen at its current level of $ 447 billion per year .
Within that parameter , however , individual federal agencies would have the power to give some programs increases , while cutting money elsewhere .
Besides burnishing his fiscal discipline credentials , the move could also help the president force Republicans ' hand on whether they 're serious about meeting Obama halfway on some of his policy proposals .
Immediate Republican reaction was split , with some senior GOP aides saying the freeze is something they could support , while others said it did not go nearly far enough .
" Given Washington Democrats ' unprecedented spending binge , this is like announcing you 're going on a diet after winning a pie-eating contest , " said Michael Steel , a spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio .
" Will the budget still double the debt over five years and triple it over 10 ?
That 's the bottom line . "
The senior administration officials acknowledged that discretionary spending is only about one - sixth of the entire federal budget , and that much larger savings would come from cutting entitlement programs like Medicare , but the White House believes that cuts need to start somewhere .
" We 're not here to tell you we 've solved the deficit , " said one of the senior officials , adding that the federal government has to go through the " very same process that families " across America have had to go through in their personal budgets .
The move will also spark a major debate within the president 's own party , with senior Democrats already saying the cuts would be tough to swallow .
A senior Senate Democratic aide said it will prompt a major fight after the Bush administration " underfunded domestic programs for so long . "
" Why would we want to play into the Republicans ' hands like this ? " the senior Senate Democratic aide asked .
But it could also help Obama break ranks with an unpopular Democratic Congress .
" Do I expect this to win us a lot of kudos on Capitol Hill ?
No , " one of the senior administration officials said .

Famed cattleprod - launcher firm Taser International has diversified out of its core business in electric stun weapons .
The firm has announced that it will soon release a " family safety platform " allowing parents to monitor their children 's mobile phone use , location and driving .
The parental spy / control tech is called " Protector™ " .
It made its public debut last week at the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , but Taser has n't yet given a firm date for actual availability .
Protector is intended to present a worried / obsessive parent with a " control panel " accessible via smartphone , computer or other netted - up device .
The location of a child 's phone can be viewed , and the calls , texts or other communications it can send or receive can be controlled .
Parents can choose to allow a call or message through , block it , answer a call themselves - perhaps passing the caller on to the child subsequently - or listen in .
Rules such as " alert me when a new person contacts my child " or " always allow this person to contact my child without notifying me " can be set up .
A phone can be silenced altogether during meal times , exams or other occasions as deemed appropriate by a grumpy mum or dad .
The location feature can also be used to monitor a teenager 's driving habits , and in particular to prevent such risky activities as texting while driving .
A kid's phone can be deactivated or set to allow calls in handsfree mode only when in the child 's or the family 's car , using a bluetooth gizmo in the car to recognise the situation .
" Many kids spend more time with their mobile phone than their families , and most parents have been helpless , in the dark as to who their kids are interacting with and what kind of content their kids are exposed to every day , " says Taser CEO Rick Smith .
" PROTECTOR empowers parents , " he adds .
Though some of its features are already available in different products , Smith argues that Taser is the first to bring it all together in one product which can be used across platforms and service providers .
The company intends to offer the kit as a subscription service costing as much as $ 30 monthly , or less if fewer features are selected .
There 's a corporate website here , complete with pictures of scary , copiously - tattooed and - pierced deviants of the type your kids are likely to end up exchanging nude pictures with unless their parents buy Protector™ as soon as it comes out . ®
Kurt Westergaard has had a price on his head since 2006 Danish police have shot and wounded a man at the home of Kurt Westergaard , whose cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad sparked an international row .
Mr Westergaard scrambled into a panic room at his home in Aarhus after a man wielding an axe and a knife broke in .
Danish officials said the intruder was a 28 - year - old Somali , who they did not name , but said was linked to the radical Islamist al - Shabab militia .
The cartoon , printed in 2005 , prompted violent protests the following year .
ANALYSIS By Malcolm Brabant , BBC News
This attack will force the Danish secret service Pet to review their protection .
Mr Westergaard 's house was supposed to have been turned into a fortress , with blast proof windows , and yet a determined individual came within a whisker of killing him .
Moderate Muslims in Denmark have condemned the attack on Kurt Westergaard , but they still believe his drawing was sacrilegious .
Muslim nations are attempting to outlaw what they call the defamation of their religion .
Mr Westergaard came out of hiding last Spring , saying he wanted to defend freedom of expression .
Some independent religious scholars argue the cartoonists were wrong to offend Muslims and say the drawings made dialogue impossible .
One of 12 cartoons published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten , it depicted the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban .
In 2006 the paper apologised for the cartoons , but other European media reprinted them .
Danish embassies were then attacked by Muslims around the world and dozens killed in riots .
Mr Westergaard went in to hiding amid threats to his life , but emerged last year saying he wanted to live as normal a life as possible .
His house has been heavily fortified and is under close police protection .
Police said the man had entered Mr Westergaard 's house armed with a knife and axe and had shouted in broken English that he wanted to kill him .
Mr Westergaard ran to a specially designed panic room where he raised the alarm .
' Strong numbers ' Fritz Keldsen , deputy chief superintendent of Aarhus city police , told the BBC : " We got the alarm message from this address , yesterday evening .
And we came in strong numbers .
SOMALIA'S ISLAMIST REBELS Al - Shabab , meaning " the lads " in Somali , is on US foreign terror list Youth wing of Somalia 's Union of Islamic Courts that once held sway Re-emerged after UIC ousted by Ethiopian troops in late 2006 Accused of al - Qaeda links and trying to topple interim government Accused of Dec '09 suicide bomb on Mogadishu doctors ' graduation Blamed for 2008 stoning of 13 - year - old Somali ' gang rape victim '
What the cartoons portray Profile : Somalia 's Islamic ' lads '
" When we saw the suspect , he was moving away from the scene .
Then he attacked the police patrol .
He did that with such skill , that they had to shoot him .
" The suspect was armed with an axe and a knife , which he used against the police .
The police patrol managed to subdue him , with the use of firearms . "
Police said the suspect was shot in the knee and the shoulder , but his life was not in danger .
Mr Westergaard told Jyllands
Posten he was shocked that his five - year - old granddaughter , who was in the house at the time , had witnessed the attack .
He has now been taken to a safe location , but said defiantly that he would be back , the newspaper reported .
Jakob Scharf , who heads the Danish intelligence service Pet , said the attack was " terror related " and that the suspected assailant has close contacts to Somalia 's al - Shabab group .
He had been under surveillance for activities unrelated to Mr Westergaard , Mr Scharf said .
Islamic militants have placed a $ 1 m price on Mr Westergaard 's head .
Although he is one of 12 cartoonists whose drawings of the Prophet Muhammad were published in Jyllands - Posten , he has the highest profile , our correspondent says .

How did it come to this ?
I 've just been called an anarchist in a live radio interview by a woman who works for a company that head - hunts financial high flyers .
Why ?
Was I suggesting that we should abolish all forms of centralised authority ?
Was I calling for the overthrow of the capitalist system ?
What exactly had I done to suggest to her that I wanted to tear apart the very fabric of society ?
I had told her that I am withholding my tax until the chancellor of the exchequer acts to curb the bonus payments to investment bankers at RBS .
" What if everybody did that ? " she cried .
" We 'd have anarchy ! "
There is n't much chance of everybody doing that , given that most people 's tax is taken directly from their wages via PAYE .
However , some of us will have recently received a reminder to pay our tax online by the end of the month .
I came across mine the day after seeing RBS executive director Stephen Hester smirk as he told a commons select committee that , rather than explain to the public that he was about to pay his staff an estimated £ 1.5 bn in bonuses next month , he 'd avoid the ensuing rancour by sloping off on holiday for a long while .
Never mind that RBS posted the worst corporate losses in British financial history last year .
He 's had his empty coffers replenished with taxpayers ' money and now he 's going to fill his boots .
Watching Hester 's " let them eat cake " moment on TV , I felt both outraged and at the same time powerless .
Outraged because we 'd spent the week being softened up for painful public service cuts by both the government and opposition and powerless because I knew that neither party has the will to do anything about excessive bonus culture .
Googling RBS , I found that , as part of the loan they took from the government , the chancellor has the right to veto the bank 's bonus payments .
That loan made us all shareholders in RBS .
By rights , that veto belongs to us .
So I wrote to Alistair Darling telling him that I would be withholding my taxes on 31 January unless he used our veto to limit the RBS bonuses .
What if everybody did this ?
Perhaps some form of anarchy would ensue .
But if we are going to bring " what ifs " into the debate , then what if we lived in a society that heaped financial rewards on teachers and nurses and soldiers rather than bankers ?
What if we had a financial system that encouraged fairness rather than greed ?
Too utopian for you ?
Well how about this : what if we had a political party capable of winning power at the next election ?

This partial view of a full - circle panorama shows NASA 's Mars Phoenix Lander and the polygonal patterning of the ground at the landing area .
The image is in approximately true color .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech / University Arizona / Texas A&M University
( AP ) -- Will Phoenix rise from the dead ?
Do n't bet on it .
Despite the odds , NASA on Monday will begin a three - day effort to listen for signs of life from the Phoenix lander , presumed frozen to death near Mars ' north pole after spending five months digging into soil and ice .
" We have no expectations that Phoenix has survived the winter , but we certainly want to have a look , " said Chad Edwards , chief telecommunications engineer at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
The plan calls for the orbiting Mars Odyssey spacecraft to make regular passes over the Phoenix landing site and listen for a beep .
If the three - legged , solar - powered lander fails to phone home as expected , NASA will hail it again next month when the sun is higher on the horizon .
Phoenix landed in May 2008 and spent five months digging trenches and conducting science experiments in the arctic plains .
It confirmed the presence of ice and became the first spacecraft to touch and taste water on another planet .
It last communicated with Earth in November 2008 as sunlight waned and temperatures dipped .
The lander was not designed to withstand extreme Martian winters where temperatures average minus 195 degrees Fahrenheit , far chillier than Earth 's all - time coldest temperature - minus 129 degrees - recorded in Antarctica in 1983 .
Since seasons on Mars last twice as long as Earth's , scientists waited until Martian spring was underway in the northern latitudes to check on Phoenix , which has been blanketed in carbon dioxide frost .
In the unlikely chance the lander wakes up , it has been programmed with a " Lazarus mode " to signal that it is alive .
" It 's such a low probability , " admitted mission scientist Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis .
It 's doubtful Phoenix 's solar panels can capture enough sunlight to charge its batteries .
Even if it miraculously re-energizes itself , there 's no guarantee its science instruments and other electronics will still work , researchers say .
Phoenix was named for the mythical bird that rose from its own ashes since the mission was pieced together with hardware and instruments intended for canceled projects .
This time , though , it may prove too tough to live up to the namesake .

Remember the Creative / ZiiLabs StemCell system - on - a - chip from a while back ?
The one that spawned that Android PMP design ?
Well , the Zii project is marching on , which means new hardware , including the dual OS Trinity phone , 360 º HD webcam and more .
Advertisement
Creative and ZiiLabs are showing off a pile of Zii reference hardware to potential hardware licensors in China today , in hopes that someone will manufacture it .
The Zii phone reference design , pictured for the first time above , is the only one we can see right now , and promises full 1080 p video playback over HDMI , OpenGL 2.0 accelerated gaming , and support for both Android OS and ZiiLabs ' Plaszma software .
And that 's just the phone — ZiiLabs also has a 360 º full HD webcam , a PCI - E video coprocessor , a pocket synthesizer and , well , lots .
Advertisement
But before we get to the rest of the new stuff , a little timeline for you .
Back in January , Creative announced , with of an offshoot company called ZiiLabs , " Zii StemCell Computing . "
There were not adjectives strong enough , no superlatives super enough , no words wordy enough to describe the wonders of this StemCell computing .
Unlimited Flexibility !
Incredible Scalability !
High Energy Efficiency !
ET !
CET !
ER !
A !
But wait , what is this thing ?
The Zii StemCell processor is basically an extremely flexible system - on - a- chip , which is to say a multi-talented slab of hardware with an ARM Cortex chip at its core , intended to power all manner of multimedia devices , from PMPs to phones to settop boxes to , well , whatever .
Creative promised low power consumption , high processing power , and plenty of uses .
The platform would be licensed to hardware manufacturers , and eventually , we 'd find these Zii-powered gadgets in our possession , under familiar brands .
( But not necessarily Creative itself . )
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Then we were shown the Zii Egg — pictured above — which is an Android - powered PMP with an alternate OS called Plaszma .
This was actual hardware — that 's more like it — and it looked compelling : media playback was strong , and the device itself was hot , and most importantly for Creative , new .
But this , like anything else out of ZiiLabs , was reference hardware — unless someone picked it up for manufacture , it was strictly for developers .
Advertisement
Fast - forward to this month , and the project is finally springing some leaks .
A smartbook shows up out of nowhere .
Rumors about netbooks , which could leverage the Zii chip 's power for 1080 p video playback , real - time encoding , HD video conferencing , Flash acceleration and more , emerge .
And finally , today , an announcement .
ZiiLabs is pitching more reference designs , like the Zii Egg , to manufacturers :
The line - up of Zii Powered devices on display include a dual OS concept mobile phone which supports the Plaszma OS and Android OS , a desktop touch screen video conferencing device , a web - box , a 360° multi-view camera system , a PCI Express add - on card that instantly empowers notebooks with HD video encoding for high quality video conferencing , a pocket - sized synthesizer that can emulate the sound of some of the world 's best pianos , as well as the world 's smallest credit card - sized Blu-ray quality media player – based on the ZMS - 08 chip .
Advertisement
The headliner here is obviously the Trinity phone , which can count itself among the first wave of 1GHz Android phones , and promises serious media and 3D support .
The reference hardware , as you can see , is conservatively designed , though undeniably nice — and apparently iPhone skinny .
Advertisement
But the other Zii Wares are compelling in their own ways .
The videoconferencing system can apparently process a distortion - free 360° view in full HD .
The PCI Express add - on card will do video offload duties , a la Nvidia 's GPGPU systems .
And that little " Blu- ray quality " media player , well , I really do n't know .
All of the Zii hardware is propped up by the Plaszma - centric ZiiLife suite , which includes videoconferencing software with media sharing , educational software , and an app store .
As they are now , these gadgets will probably never see the light of day — it'll be up to hardware manufacturers to pick up the reference designs , after which they 'll undoubtedly put their own spin on each concept .
And as far as the associated software goes , it 'll most likely remain under wraps until there are actual products to use it with .
At any rate , over the next few months we can probably expect to see some of these Zii-powered gadgets show up as actual , buyable products , whatever forms they may take .
And honestly , I 'm eager to see them .

Opposition to the reappointment of Bernanke is mounting every day .
Senator Barbara Boxer Senator ( D- California ) and Russ Feingold ( D - Wisconsin ) are the latest to hop on the Dump Bernanke bandwagon .
Please consider Opposition To Bernanke Growing In Wake Of Massachusetts Vote .
Senator Barbara Boxer : " I have a lot of respect for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
When the financial crisis hit in late 2008 , he took some important steps to prevent what many economists believe could have been an even greater economic catastrophe , " said Boxer .
" However , it is time for a change -- it is time for Main Street to have a champion at the Fed .
Dr. Bernanke played a lead role in crafting the Bush administration 's economic policies , which led to the current economic crisis .
Our next Federal Reserve Chairman must represent a clean break from the failed policies of the past . "
Senator Russ Feingold : " A chief responsibility of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve is to ensure a sound financial system , " read a statement issued from the Wisconsin Democrats office .
" Under the watch of Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve permitted grossly irresponsible financial activities that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Under Chairman
Bernanke 's watch predatory mortgage lending flourished , and ' too big to fail ' financial giants were permitted to engage in activities that put our nation 's economy at risk .
And as it responds to the crisis it helped to usher in , the Federal Reserve under Chairman Bernanke 's leadership continues to resist appropriate efforts to review that response , how taxpayers ' money was being used , and whether it acted appropriately .
When the full Senate considers his nomination , I will vote against another term for Chairman Bernanke . "
Are the Votes There ?
Amidst the voter anger at Wall Street and Washington , D.C. , ABC News has learned that the Senate Democratic leadership is n't sure there are enough votes to re-confirm Ben Bernanke for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
" The American people are disgusted with the greed and recklessness of Wall Street , " Sen. Bernie Sanders , I - Vt. , said in an interview with The Associated Press last month .
" People are asking , ' Why did n't the Fed intervene at the appropriate time to stop the casino - type activities of large financial companies ? ' "
Sanders , Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , Sen. Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , and Sen. David Vitter , R - La. , have all put holds on Bernanke 's nomination , requiring 60 votes to proceed to a vote .
Roll Call reported this week that at the Senate Democratic caucus meeting on Wednesday , " according to senators , liberals spoke out against confirming Bernanke for a second term .
Those liberals tried to make the case that the White House needs to put in place fresh economic advisers to focus on ' Main Street ' issues like unemployment rather than Wall Street concerns .
Moderates were more reserved , senators said , but have similarly withheld their support for Bernanke .
Tally of Senate Vote Count
The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones have compiled a tally of senators who have declared their intentions for the confirmation vote based on interviews with the senators or their offices .
Currently , 17 senators ( 13 Democrats and 4 Republicans ) have committed to support the nomination , while 12 ( 7 Republicans , 4 Democrats and 1 Independent ) said they will vote no .
Five senators have said they are undecided in interviews , while the remainder have n’t officially commented .

" Privacy " seems like such an abstract concept .
So your privacy was violated .
Get over it .
Here 's what happened .
When Google rolled out Buzz last week they activated an unknown number of users and chose people for them to follow automatically based on who they email most frequently with .
Presumably these people had to also be on Gmail .
And the list of people you follow is public .
Therefore the list of people you email with most frequently is now public .
They are now trying to close this hole as quickly as possible .
But the damage is done , people have to realize that -- the information was already disclosed .
You can close the door after the horse gets out but that does n't get the horse back .
This never should have happened .
But now that it has , it requires a CEO - level apology and statement of contrition and an explanation of what policies he 's putting in place to be sure this never happens again .
That has not happened , and does not appear likely to .
What if it were Eric Schmidt 's privacy .
I wonder if he 'd feel differently .
I wonder if he uses Gmail , and if he does , did they reveal the list of people he emails most frequently ?
I can think of all kinds of problems that might cause , with the stock market , or the SEC , partners , wives , despots , girlfriends .
I imagine Nick Denton at Gawker would like to see that list , and that Schmidt would not want him to .
We all have those kinds of concerns .
People might get the wrong idea if they saw the list of people I email most frequently .
Or they might get the right idea .
Sometimes as I 'm entering a message into Gmail , I wonder if the ethics of Google prohibit them from reading the mail .
Sometimes I email with execs at companies that compete with Google .
I think " They 'd probably like to know this . "
I wonder if they look .
Yet Google , so far , has only said they 're sorry for the " concern " they 've caused .
That shows that they 're not owning up to the breach they caused .
They can't possibly be so stupid as to not understand what they revealed about users of Gmail .
It 's just the kind of weaselly response to a building crisis that PR pros tell you not to do , that covering up will only make it worse when people realize what 's really been going on .
But that assumes a competent and vigilant press .
That would be too much to assume in the case of Google and its coverage .
The Do n't Be Evil smokescreen was pure brilliance .
As Michael Gartenberg said on Twitter , if Microsoft had done what Google did , there would already be lawsuits .
It would be a scandal of huge proportion .
The NY Times wo n't call it a breach of trust by Google .
Instead they attribute the claim to " privacy experts . "
I raised this point , and predictably people say that the Times should n't make factual statements about companies who screw up anywhere but in editorials .
That 's ridiculous .
A fact is a fact , and belongs in reporting .
It 's a fact that Google revealed sensitive information about millions of users , and now they 're scurrying to try to cover it up .
And the press is helping them buy time .
Why ?
I have no clue , but I do n't like it .
The Il - 76 was unloaded by Thai soldiers
Thailand has seized a cargo plane refuelling in Bangkok airport , which it says was carrying weapons from North Korea to an unknown destination .
The five crew members were also detained .
Rocket - propelled grenades , missiles and other weapons were found aboard , military investigators said .
It is believed that the plane had made an emergency request to refuel .
It had taken off from the North Korean capital Pyongyang , the Thai Air Force said .
According to local media reports , four members of the crew are from Kazakhstan , and one from Belarus .
Thai officials said they had acted on a tip - off from foreign intelligence , with one official telling Reuters news agency , on condition of anonymity , that the US had supplied the information .
" It [ the plane ] came from North Korea and was heading for somewhere in South Asia , probably Pakistan , " the same official added .
Another unconfirmed report suggested Sri Lanka as the destination .
Prize export
Local media say about 40 tons of weaponry were found aboard the chartered plane , a Soviet - designed Il - 76 .
The crew are said to have requested a translator from the Russian embassy
The reported items have been moved to a Thai military facility .
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaungsuban said the crew had declared the cargo as " oil drilling equipment " , according to AFP news agency .
" But when we examined , we found it was all weaponry , " Mr Suthep , who is also in charge of national security , told reporters .
" This case will proceed carefully as there are many parties involved ...
Everything must proceed transparently . "
The UN recently increased sanctions against North Korea in a bid to cut off its arms sales as punishment for a nuclear test in May .
Arms sales are a vital export item estimated to earn the destitute state more than $ 1bn ( £ 615 m ) a year , analysts say .
The North 's biggest arm sales come from ballistic missiles , with Iran and other Middle Eastern states being customers , according to US government officials .

First , it was the color - coded scheme to stop rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez from throwing interceptions .
Then , it was a visit Tuesday from Yankees manager Joe Girardi to teach Sanchez how to slide .
What ’s next , an eating etiquette class taught by Martha Stewart ?
Sanchez , who has experienced more than a few growing pains this season , was tutored by Girardi on the art of sliding with his left knee extended during a 10 - minute session on the indoor turf at their Florham Park complex on a mat .
The Jets had been tying to get Sanchez to slide at the end of runs but he has been reluctant , in part , because it is unnatural for a right - hander to slide off his right knee .
Sanchez , who wears a brace on his left knee , tweaked the knee in Sunday ’s 17 - 6 victory over the Panthers when he was tackled by Panthers cornerback Richard Marshall .
He suffered a bone bruise and had the knee dislocated in college .
‘ ‘( Sanchez ) is too valuable and he needs to understand that we need him out there and people are going to take shots at him if he does n’t start sliding , ’’ coach Rex Ryan said .
‘‘ I really did want to make an emphasis to Mark and get the best guy that we can in the area . ’’
Ryan , who came up with the idea on Monday night , called Yankees president Randy Levine Tuesday morning and asked if he could send a sliding coach to practice .
Ryan said he was surprised to learn Girardi was in town and would stop by .
Girardi also spoke to the team .
‘‘ I ’ve never really been a slider , ’’ Sanchez said .
‘‘ In baseball , I slid head first .
It ’s something that you need to learn at this level .
Because I wear that brace on my left leg , you do n’t want to hook that leg into the ground .
It might get stuck .
‘ ‘( Girardi ) showed me how to do it with the opposite leg and hook ( the left ) leg under .
He showed me how to protect the ball and try not to fall on one side or the other or my shoulder , just absorb the blow with my butt and my legs .
I really appreciated it . ’’
Ryan called Girardi a ‘ ‘ natural ’’ and said he did a ‘ ‘ great job . ’’
• Jets S Kerry Rhodes said yesterday that Ryan told him he ’ll play in more packages tomorrow against the Bills and his benching was a ‘ ‘ learning thing . ’’
He played mainly in nickel and dime packages last week .
Rhodes also sounded like he ’s planning his exit strategy .
He ’s due a $ 2 million roster bonus in March and a $ 2.7 million base salary in 2010 .
‘‘ We got five games left , ’’ he said .
‘‘ I ’m going to play hard .

The plant supplies most of Lithuania 's electric power .
Lithuania has shut down its one and only nuclear power station in Visaginas .
The Ignalina plant , the only nuclear reactor in the Baltic states , stopped producing electricity at 2300 local time ( 2100 GMT ) .
The closure of the Soviet - era plant was a condition of Lithuania 's membership of the European Union .
The move will mean an increase in power prices for Lithuanians and more reliance on Russia for energy supplies .
Just before the shutdown , Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmoka said : " We are keeping our word to our European partners . "
' Minute risk '
The facility was opened 26 years ago , when Lithuania was still part of the former Soviet Union .
It was built to the same design as Chernobyl , which was behind the worst civil nuclear disaster in history when one of its reactors overheated in 1986 .
BBC correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse says Brussels insisted the place be closed down , and allocated around 820 m euro ( £ 731 m ) to cover part of the costs of decommissioning the plant .
But critics said that Ignalina still has another 10 to 15 years of life in it and that the risks of an accident are minute .
Aleksei Tichomirov , a resident of Visaginas and an engineer at the plant , said he was unable to understand why the energy source had to close .
" Why throw away a good thing that could still serve for years " , he said .
The plant supplied up to 80 % of Lithuania 's electric power .
Our correspondent says the shut - down will mean higher electricity bills at a time when the country 's economy is shrinking rapidly .
It will also mean that , fewer than 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union , Lithuania will once again become dependent on Moscow for much of its energy supply .

From Law Enforcement Against Prohibition Member Brad Jardis , a 10 + year veteran of the NH police force ( and probably the most courageous cop I ’ve ever known ) :
Hello everyone .
As you all know , I have been cleared for duty and will be reporting back shortly .
I have been re-reading the NH Constitution carefully so that when I return I am well versed .
I have come to a conclusion in reading the document I am sworn to defend :
It is unconstitutional for the state to take action against a sick person who decides to use Marijuana to treat a medical condition .
I will never arrest a person who possesses , uses , grows marijuana to treat a medical condition ……. and neither should any other NH LEO who intends follow his or her oath .
I wo n’t even take it from them .
Legal argument in support of my declaration ( quite simple ) :
-/-
1. Short of fellating the entire NH General Court and the Governor , political activists in this state have done everything to present FACTUAL evidence to support allowing sick people to use a natural substance to ease suffering .
I personally have begged the General Court to not make me arrest sick people .
2. Chief DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis
Young ruled in 1988 :
“ Marijuana , in its natural form , is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known .
It would be unreasonable , arbitrary , and capricious for the DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of the substance . ”
3. Fourteen other states ( and DC ) allow the sick and dying to use Marijuana as medicine to alleviate suffering .
4. Article 10 of the NH Constitution reads as follows :
Quote
[ Art. ] 10 .
[ Right of Revolution . ]
Government being instituted for the common benefit , protection , and security , of the whole community , and not for the private interest or emolument of any one man , family , or class of men ; therefore , whenever the ends of government are perverted , and public liberty manifestly endangered , and all other means of redress are ineffectual , the people may , and of right ought to reform the old , or establish a new government .
The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power , and oppression , is absurd , slavish , and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind .
5 . Government prosecuting a sick person for using a scientifically proven safe substance does not “ benefit , ” or “ protect ( … ) , ” any community .
6 . Government prosecuting a sick person for using a scientifically proven safe substance IS in - fact the emolument of a class of men : pharmaceutical companies .
This is proven by evidence of pharmaceutical companies fighting against medical Marijuana laws .
You cant grow Oxycontin in your living room , now can you ?
7 . A sick person continuing to suffer because a state law forbids them to use a scientifically proven safe therapeutic substance IS “ absurd . ”
8 . A sick person continuing to suffer because a state law forbids them to use a scientifically proven safe therapeutic substance IS “ slavish . ”
9 . A sick person continuing to suffer because a state law forbids them to use a scientifically proven safe therapeutic substance IS “ destructive of the good and happiness of mankind . ”
-/-
Conclusion : I wo n’t do it .
Ever .
Take your unconstitutional law and stuff it .
You know who I am , you know where I work , and I am not afraid of any of you .
My word , my oath , is to the people : not the tyrants who want them to suffer .
– Bradley
A new study shows that molecules cooled to have near - negligible collisional motion can still react chemically with one another .
At just a few hundred nanokelvins above absolute zero , the researchers could even change the speed of the chemical reaction by tweaking the molecules ' quantum states , paving the way for highly controlled chemistry using the tools of physics .
( A nanokelvin is one billionth of a kelvin . )
The study appears in the February 12 issue of Science , authored by scientists from two institutes affiliated with the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) : JILA , run jointly by NIST and the University of Colorado at Boulder ; and the Joint Quantum Institute , a partnership between NIST and the University of Maryland , College Park .
In 2008 a group including many of the same researchers announced the creation of a dense gas of potassium–rubidium ( KRb ) molecules at a few hundred nanokelvins .
Now that ultracold gas has been shown to decay through a heat - releasing chemical reaction as its molecules interact through the phenomenon of quantum tunneling , in which particles skip over classical barriers .
In this case the blockade is a so - called momentum barrier between two identical molecules experiencing mutual repulsion .
At ultracold temperatures , classical physical conceptions of molecules become less useful than quantum - mechanical ones , says Jun Ye , a JILA physicist and study co-author .
" They 're so cold that you can no longer think of them as a ping - pong –ball kind of object , " Ye says .
" They 're really quantum - mechanical waves . "
Those waves can overlap at relatively great distances , leading to remote interactions between the molecules .
" As soon as they feel each other 's presence , when their wave function starts to overlap , very interesting things start to happen , " Ye says .
In this case the gas molecules swap atoms to form K 2 and Rb 2 molecules , which then escape .
Shifting the starting conditions in the potassium–rubidium gas highlighted the quantum - mechanical nature of the chemical reactions .
When all the molecules were set to the same initial quantum state , the gas decayed over several seconds .
But when the molecules were prepared in different states — specifically , in a heterogeneous mix of spins — the reaction proceeded 10 to 100 times faster .
The difference is a logical extension of the Pauli exclusion principle : Identical molecules repel one another to avoid occupying the same place simultaneously .
" In order for them to approach each other , they would have to overcome this momentum barrier , " Ye says .
" Tunneling is really what is happening ; they 're tunneling through this angular - momentum barrier . "
Distinguishable molecules — those with different spins — are freer to cozy up .
Jeremy Hutson , a chemistry professor at Durham University in England who wrote an accompanying commentary for Science on the research , says that the fine - scale physical manipulation possible in the ultracold regime provides an accompanying level of chemical control .
" I think it 's the selectivity that 's remarkable under these circumstances , " Hutson says .
" You can make a change as tiny as flipping a singular nuclear spin and completely change the course of the reaction . "
Hutson says that it may soon be possible to act on a whole population of atoms or molecules at once .
" The strength of this general field , this ultracold chemistry , if you like , is that in the future it is likely to be possible to carry out chemical reactions on entire samples of molecules in a coherent and controlled way , " he says .
But now that the JILA and Joint Quantum Institute researchers have shown how readily chemistry can proceed at ultracold temperatures ,
Ye wants to figure out how to nip it in the bud to extend the lifetime of the potassium–rubidium gas , which at present begins to chemically degrade in about a second .
" The goal for us is to be able to suppress these reactions , " Ye says .
" Now that we can understand and control them , the next step is to really learn how to eliminate them . "
* Siemens says understands sensitivity of Iran trade
* Chancellor Merkel says firms will stick to sanctions
* “ Time running out ” for Iran to cooperate , she says ( Adds Siemens role in first Iranian nuclear project )
MUNICH , Germany , Jan 26 ( Reuters ) - German engineering conglomerate Siemens SIEGn.DE said on Tuesday it would reject any further orders from Iran as world powers consider imposing wider sanctions on Tehran over its disputed nuclear activity .
Germany , one of six countries seeking to persuade Iran to suspend its atomic work , is one of the biggest exporters to Iran despite three rounds of modest United Nations sanctions prompted by past Iranian evasions of U.N. nuclear monitoring .
Western nations suspect the Islamic Republic of trying to develop nuclear weapons capability , a charge Tehran denies .
It says that its uranium enrichment programme is designed solely for electricity generation , not atomic bombs .
Iran ignored a U.S. end -2009 deadline to respond to an offer from world powers of economic and political incentives in exchange for halting enrichment or face more sanctions .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday Iran was running out of time if it wanted to avoid further sanctions .
Siemens , which is Europe ’s biggest engineering conglomerate , was aware of the sensitivities attached to doing business in Iran , Chief Executive Peter Loescher said .
“ Some time ago , we reduced our business activities with customers in Iran , ” Loescher said , responding to questions at a shareholders meeting .
The Siemens board decided at the start of October not to agree to any further orders with customers in Iran , he added , noting , however , that existing orders would be fulfilled .
Loescher said there were still bids submitted by Siemens before October 2009 .
If they were not accepted , it would mean new business in Iran would end by mid-2010 .
Siemens , which makes high - tech machinery as well as domestic appliances , generates an annual 500 million euros ( $ 704.5 million ) in sales from Iran , which last year represented 0.7 percent of the firm ’s overall sales .
The United States has long pressed for greater restrictions on foreign trade and investment with Iran .
Loescher said Siemens ’s trade with Iran was exclusively civilian .
In 1974 , Siemens and French scientists started building Iran ’s first two civilian nuclear power reactors at Bushehr .
The plants were close to completion when Iran ’s Shah was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution , prompting Siemens to pull out and halting the undertaking for many years .
The Bushehr project was subsequently revived with Russian help and , after many delays , one reactor is due to be launched later this year .
“ TIME IS RUNNING OUT ”
German media have in the past reported that German authorities have investigated shipments of high technology to Iran to see if they may have violated export control laws .
One case , cited by Spiegel magazine in December , involved 16 million euros worth of turbocompressors found by customs inspectors in Hamburg that investors believe could be used in Iran ’s missile programme .
Merkel , asked how Berlin could ensure its companies did not trade with Iran , said Germany had shown that many firms had scaled back their involvement in Iran .
“ There is a long tradition of economic cooperation ( between Germany and Iran ) .
There has been a significant reduction .
But we believe it is only effective if you try to introduce international sanctions on as broad a base as possible .
“ Germany will adhere to sanctions in all sectors that are affected , ” she told a news conference with visiting Israeli President Shimon Peres .
Figures from last year show Berlin had significantly cut the value of new credit guarantees it offers firms that do business with Iran , but that German exports to the country rose in 2008 .
Merkel also warned Iran that it would have to act soon if it is to avoid a further , broader round of punitive sanctions .
“ Time is running out , ” she said .
“ The world community is ready to work on sanctions .
We have shown patience but this does n’t seem to have had any effect so the time has come for the international community to discuss sanctions , ” Merkel said .
Envoys from the United States , France , Germany , Britain , Russia and China met this month to discuss further sanctions on Iran .
But Russia and China , major trade partners of Iran , are both reluctant and want more negotiations .

I attended PLPV 2010 this past Monday in Madrid , and I think this was the best edition yet of the workshop .
I just want to run through the program a little , to give you my take on the talks , all of which were really good ( I wo n’t judge my own talk , of course , but I was happy with how it went ) .
Invited talk : Gilles Barthe .
Gilles spoke on the CertiCrypt project he has been leading for ( I believe he said ) three years now .
The goal of the project , as I understood it from his talk , is to develop computer - checked versions of correctness proofs for cryptographic protocols .
As I overheard Tim Sheard saying to Gilles aftewards , this project is really a tour de force .
I was completely blown away .
Imagine all the incredible engineering effort required to formalize your favorite meta - theorems or program verification problems in Coq ( the tool used for CertiCrypt ) , but replace your standard operational semantics with a probabilistic one , reason about observational equivalence instead of just the operational semantics , and base the whole thing on ( I am not remembering the exact name here ) probablistic relational Hoare Logic .
Get the idea ?
They have had to develop significant new formal theories here , which are richer and more complex than the ones I at least am used to thinking about — and I do n’t think those are trivial to begin with !
Also , the talk was really good , with a great balance of higher level motivation and detailed theory .
Again , really really great .
Stefan Monnier .
The creative and surprising talks just continued , as Stefan told us about how to translate a dependently typed language ( the Calculus of Constructions , to be exact ) into a language with only singleton types .
I did not quite understand the significance of this at first , but the point is that the target language of his translation enjoys a true phase - distinction : singleton types are indexed by compile - time expressions , which have no computational relevance .
In contrast , the full - spectrum dependently typed source language allows types to depend on run-time expressions .
So the interesting point was that this dependence can be eliminated in favor of dependence only on compile - time expressions .
I still have to digest this further , but it was an intriguing talk , and the technical development is very pleasing ( particularly the definition of the translation ) .
Matthew Danish .
Matthew gave a very clear and understandable talk on implementing parts of an OS in ATS , Hongwei Xi ’s dependently typed programming language .
He showed how the type system can enforce unique references to kernel data structures using linear types , and introduced a very nice ATS construct for saying that a resource is not consumed , but its type is updated ( written something like x : T >> T’ ) .
That idiom would be very nice to have in my Guru language …
Stephanie Balzer .
Stephanie ’s was the first ( but certainly not the last ) talk of the day to take the workshop into new technical territory , with relationship - based programming .
The basic idea ( as I understood it from her talk ) is to reify the dependences and connections between classes as additional entities called relationships .
So in fact , entity classes have no members referring to other entities .
All connections are embodied in relationship instances .
I am definitely still digesting this idea , but it makes a lot of sense that making dependencies explicit could help verification .
And that is exactly what Stephanie describing in this very clear and well - presented talk .
One does not need multi-object invariants in Rumer ( her language ) , because all state which could be interdependent is located in a single relationship class .
Chris Casinghino .
Chris introduced to the wonders of doubly generic programming : both datatype generic ( where programs are not parametrically polymorphic , but instead , are defined inductively on the structure of the type in question ) , and arity generic .
In fact , he showed how arity generic falls right out of the natural general formalization of datatype generic .
It is really appealing to attain this level of abstraction .
While I could n’t reproduce the technical ideas at this point without looking again at the paper , the presentation was quite clear and enjoyable .
Daniel Seidel .
Daniel also led the workshop into intriguingly new territory , by talking about free theorems ( that is , those derived by parametricity for parametrically polymorphic programs ) for functional logic programs .
This was very interesting to consider , for someone like myself who is not so familiar with the functional logic programming paradigm .
Daniel explained how nondeterministic choice — where we can have terms like “ 3 ?
4 ” meaning a value that is nondeterministically chosen to be either 3 or 4 — requires revision of the free theorems that one can derive ; essentially , the theorems need to be weakened to allow for one term having a subset of the nondeterministically computed results of the other .
With some nondeterministic features , a further restriction was required to get any free theorem at all .
A very nice talk , that fit very well with PLPV ’s goal to include a stimulating variety of topics under the banner of language - based verification .
Jan Vitek .
Jan gave an inspiring call to arms for language - based verification researchers to take up verification of real - time programs , particularly real - time Java programs .
He explained that this is an area where industry and military procurement is open to new languages and new methods ; they are willing to accept restrictions on how programs can be written ; and the demand is very great for real solutions , that compromise neither reliability , performance , nor scalability .
He presented a collection of real - time Java benchmarks , some of which use a real - time garbage collector , and others scoped memory .
The paper highlights several important properties ( e.g. , absence of uncaught exceptions , including null pointer dereference ; memory allocation rate ; etc. ) .
Stephanie Weirich also gave a brief overview of the current status of the Trellys project , which she , Tim Sheard , and I are leading up .
The goal is to design a new dependently typed programming language , which includes general recursion and very expressive polymorphism , but retains a fragment which is sound as a logic ( that is , where programs of type A ->
B can be soundly viewed as proofs of the formula A -> B ) .
The three of us , Bruno Barras , and Chris Casinghino met the day before PLPV at IMDEA Software in Madrid to hash through a bunch of technical ideas on the Trellys core language .
I ’ll have to talk about that , though , at another time , since this post is too long already .
AUSTRALIAN scientists are hoping to breed burp - less sheep in a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
The agriculture sector is the nation 's second biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions behind the energy sector , producing about 16 per cent of Australia 's total emissions , the Courier - Mail reports .
Two - thirds of that figure is produced by livestock , and 66 per cent of those emissions are released as methane from the guts of grazing livestock such as sheep and cattle .
The Sheep Co-operative Research Centre is conducting a world - first study into about 700 sheep with 20 different genetic lines – each is fed , then shepherded into a booth where scientists measure their burp outputs .
One study leader , Dr Roger Hegarty , said sheep burped large amounts of methane and there was environmental pressure to see whether that could be minimised .
" We 're looking into how to reduce emissions from sheep – all over Australia teams are testing different approaches : changing the microbes in the gut , changing their diet , or changing the genetics of the animal , " he said .
" Our sheep studies are ( primarily ) aiming to find out if there is genetic control over methane production and , if so , is that a good thing to pursue ? "
Dr Hegarty said researchers were wary not to produce other problems in their bid to reduce the animal 's carbon footprint .
" Methane is the exhaust from livestock , and – just as you can't put your hand over the exhaust pipe of a car and expect it to keep running – we 're treading carefully to reduce emissions without causing other problems .
" There really is a global effort on this – it will take a lot of hard yakka and time . "
Other study leader , Dr John Goopy of the NSW Department of Industry and Innovation , said if a 10 per cent reduction could be achieved per animal it would be a good thing .
" Once we work out how to reduce methane emissions , and if our strategies prove to be valid , we will keep gaining advantage and over time there will be larger decreases in methane emissions , " he said .
Dr Hegarty said scientists were also looking to do a similar thing with beef cattle .

Do n't neglect your handwriting - it might just be what lands you your next job , says Catherine Quinn
Remember when neat , legible writing was a prized skill ?
In a time before the digital age , when employees were valued for flowing script ?
Now employees can go weeks without scribbling anything more than a number on a Post - it note .
But that does n't mean your scrawl does n't matter anymore - writing analysis is an increasingly popular way to screen job applicants .
A swell in the popularity of handwriting analysis , or graphology , in overseas European recruitment could see the trend catch on with UK companies .
French employers in particular favour the method , with some 75 % using graphology as part of their recruitment process .
" When used correctly , graphology can give a good indication of a person 's personality structure , their abilities , ability to grow and develop , and perhaps most importantly , their integrity " says graphologist Margaret White , who uses her skills to assess job applicants for recruiters .
But while recruitment - graphology is growing in Britain - used by more than 3,000 companies to date - employers are reluctant to admit they use the technique .
Why ?
Handwriting analysis is often viewed with scepticism in Britain and companies appear to be afraid that this sentiment will discredit the professionalism of their company .
But not all employers are so coy : London banking group Butterfields publicly states that it uses graphology for recruitment .
As managing director Paul Turtle explains : " It is not used as the defining factor in the decision - making process .
However , it has been shown to add an extra dimension to the jigsaw , which has frequently been validated once an employee is in situ . "
The British Graphology Institute would certainly agree that the optimum use of graphology in recruitment is in conjunction with other methods .
" Psychometric tests are fine , but they can be manipulated , as people can change their answers depending on what they think the company wants to hear , " says a spokesperson .
" But used in conjunction with graphology you can double check that one validates the other . "
Cynics may suggest that the reason companies are reticent about revealing their use of graphology is because they use it without an applicant 's knowledge - although this would be strictly against the ethics of any professional graphologist .
" Graphology is always undertaken with the permission of the candidate " says the Graphology Institute .
" So job applicants need never fear that a sample of their handwriting has been requested for analysis without their knowledge . "
Where problems may arise , of course , is in employers conducting their own impromptu analysis of an applicant 's handwriting , based on little besides their own prejudices .
For those of us with less than perfect script , this may certainly raise concerns when applying for jobs that call for a letter " in own handwriting " .
In fact , professional graphologists agree that bad handwriting is by no means a sign of sloppy work or a lazy attitude to employment - it can frequently mean a high degree of intelligence and enthusiasm .
In any case , it seems that writing is getting better rather than worse .
" There was a significant drop in standards around 20 years ago , " says Margaret White , " but then schools reintroduced copy books into schools , so in my opinion the writing submitted by people who are aged 20 or 30 have better handwriting than previous generations .
From a graphologist 's point of view , the legibility is n't necessarily an issue - but handwriting is impossible to fake , as opposed to CVs , which tend to be increasingly ' embroidered ' , shall we say .
A person might be able to fool me for a few lines , but their true style will show pretty quickly - particularly if they 're writing about something they 're interested in . "
All this probably sounds quite tempting to time - pressed recruiters , particularly if they 've been burned in the past with an exaggerated CV , or simply a candidate who does n't fit in with the team .
" Graphology works very well as an assessment of whether a person will fit in with a company , or stick out like a sore thumb " says Margaret .
" For small companies in particular , this is cutting out a lot of risk . "
But there is also a financial reason why graphology may be used .
Compared with psychometric tests , and interviews , handwriting analysis is a great deal cheaper , and can be a cost - effective screening process to these more expensive methods .
As companies become ever more aware of the costs of recruiting , it looks likely they will be open to a number of new screening processes .
And graphology certainly looks set to remain one of the ways in which job applicants are taken on , or written off .
Getting my own handwriting assessed was a revealing process , and not only because it was the first time I had written anything of length for about three years .
Computers and a journalism career have devolved my writing into a sorry and illegible scrawl , peppered with strange interpretations of shorthand .
Graphologists , however , do not judge you on the quality of your penmanship , and Margaret White , who analysed my writing , assured me that hers is not the nicest either , and illegibility is n't necessarily a negative factor .
So how accurate was the report ?
As one revelation suggested a tendency to hide my emotions , I gracefully accepted my lack of suitability to judge , so I turned to ex-colleague Nikki Haynes for her opinion .
She was fairly impressed by the report .
" I think the analysis sums you up quite nicely , " she said .
" You were always deep into your work , but always ready and willing to help others if they needed help . "
Interestingly , the report probably described me as an employee much more accurately that it did as a friend .
Generally , the analysis painted me as ' quietly determined , thoughtful , and ambitious ' .
To check the theory I asked a close friend whether I was a ' quiet ' person .
" What ? " was the first response .
" Are you a choir person ? "
" Am I quiet ? " I asked .
This was followed by a look of unique and pained confusion .
" No . "
Similarly , the personality section of the report identified a person who ' certainly does n't enter into open conflict with others , especially authority ' , and who is ' particularly fearful of personal and public rejection ' .
With regards to the latter , anyone who works in the journo business will tell you a fear of rejection gets you about as far as the jobcentre .
And as for a reticence in confronting authority figures ?
I tested Nikki for a reaction .
I got laughter .
Although she mitigated this with the opinion I was confrontational only when necessary .
Generally speaking though , any employer who took me on expecting me not to express a contradictory opinion would be in for a nasty shock .
The ' working qualities ' aspect of the report , however , was really very accurate - particularly from someone I 'd never met .
I do react quickly to situations , am good at problem solving , and do n't really like being told what to do .
And being as there was no mention of my appalling handwriting , I thought it a highly charitable account to boot .

" The #1 CEO on the list , Steve Jobs , delivered a whopping 3,188 % industry - adjusted return ( 34 % compounded annually ) after he rejoined Apple as CEO in 1997 , when the company was in dire shape , " the report said .
" From that time until the end of September 2009 , Apples market value increased by $ 150 billion . "
The global ranking compared 1,999 CEOs that assumed their job no earlier than January 1995 and no later than December 2007 .
The executives had to be the head of a publicly traded company that was present on the Standard & Poor 's Global 1200 or its BRIC ( Brazil , Russia , India , China ) 40 list at some point since 1997 .
The criteria did exclude high - profile CEOs like Microsoft founder Bill Gates , who took the helm of his company well before 1995 .
Though he was ousted from Apple in 1985 , Jobs returned to the company he co-founded in 1996 , when his company NeXT Computer was acquired by Apple .
When asked about Jobs in November , Gates credited him with saving Apple upon his return .
The magazine also compared its list with Forbes magazine 's tally of the highest - paid CEOs , where Jobs ranked third , and Barron 's 2009 list of the 30 most respected chief executives , where Jobs also appeared .
While Jobs famously accepts a $ 1 yearly salary , he earns a great deal through stock - based compensation .
Six of the top 10 CEOs came from technology - related companies .
Following Jobs were Yun Jong - Yong of Samsung ( 2 ) , John Chambers of Cisco Systems ( 4 ) , Jeff Bezos of Amazon ( 7 ) , Margaret Whitman of Ebay ( 8 ) and Eric Schmidt of Google ( 9 ) .
Schmidt was a member of Apple 's board of directors until this summer , when a Federal Trade Commission investigation forced him to resign .
During his tenure , Schmidt accepted thousands of dollars in Apple gear , but took no pay .

Barcelona — Adobe Systems Inc. , which widely distributed the use of video and animation on the Web , clutched the opportunity at the Mobile World Congress today , Brightcove , the major online video platform , said it will be supporting Flash player 10.1 , so that online video can more easily be tweaked for mobile phones .
Adobe AIR , the cross- platform app engine that powers apps like TweetDeck , will also see improvements with the release of Flash 10.1 .
More notable than even the ability to watch YouTube and Hulu clips on your phone , though , is that Flash 10.1 will support graphic chip acceleration on systems with NVIDIA graphics cards , allowing full - screen viewing on netbooks whose processors might otherwise choke , and giving laptop and desktop users perhaps a bit more performance from low - quality clips .
Adobe AIR enables developers to deliver Web applications outside the constraints of a browser .
With support for mobile devices Adobe AIR includes specific functionality offered by mobile operating systems and devices such as multi-touch , gesture inputs , accelerometer , geolocation and screen orientation .
via “ Adobe Unveils AIR on Mobile Devices ; Readies Flash Player 10.1 for Launch “
Because Brightcove is using Flash , it says that it can offer a ton of new features to mobile video , including analytics , advertising , social sharing , and transcoding .
The availability of Flash on smartphones is a big sea change , said Jeff Whatcott , SVP of marketing at Brightcove .
The platform , which has been in beta , is already being used by major content companies , like AOL , Atlantic Records , National Geographic and The New York Times .
Adobe describes Apple as “ closed device ” and continues to offer a fig leaf , but given Apple ’s general stance on opening up new development platforms on their device , it seems a tad unlikely .
Adobe has promised betas of a mobile - ready Flash 10.1 for Windows Mobile and Palm Pre late this year , and early next year for Android , Symbian , and BlackBerry phones , as well as NVIDIA - powered netbooks .

No lawyer comes forward to defend Shazia Bashir , the servant girl murdered by her employer .
The powerful association of lawyers in Lahore , arrayed in defence of the murderer , launches death threats and prevents access to the Court .
Christian Association condemns this new form of terrorism .
Islamabad ( AsiaNews ) - Because of the threats posed by the powerful Lahore Bar Association – an umbrella organization of city lawyers - no Christian or Muslim lawyer is ready to take on the defence in the murder of 12 year - old Shazia Bashir , it was reported yesterday by The Pakistani Christian association that deals with legal assistance .
The girl , of Christian faith , died on Jan. 23 as a result of violence - even sexual – at the hands of her employer , a wealthy and powerful Muslim lawyer in Lahore .
The alleged murderess , Chaudhry Mohammad Naeem , is a former president of the Lahore High Court Bar Association .
The girl , just 12 years old , had worked as a maid in the home of Naeem in the last six months .
The Center for Legal Aid Assistance and Settlement ( CLAAS ) denounces that access to the courtroom where the court hearings were held against the accused was denied , because a group of Muslim lawyers ( pictured ) ' prevented ' entry .
The association is fighting - for free - for the rights of the poorest and marginalized groups has been threatened by thousands of lawyers - friends of the murderer - that promise to burn alive anyone who wants to represent the victim in court . "
M. Joseph Francis , director of Claas , asked members of civil society , political and religious leaders to rise up and take steps to " condemn this new form of terrorism " by lawyers who " should ensure justice . "
The Pakistani newspaper The News reported that on Feb. 4 , the police conducted the accused to the courts amid " tight security .
And , as usual , officials prevented journalists and relatives of victims to come into the hall for " security reasons " .
Shazia Bashir 's family could not access the court not once but three times , a strange fact , regarding the judiciary in Pakistan .
Police officials explain that it would " not be possible " to prevent clashes and violence , where " Shazia 's relatives and representatives of minorities to enter the courtroom . "

Gansler : Effective immediately Md. recognizes same - sex marriages performed elsewhere
UPDATE 2:50 P.M. : Maryland Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler ( D ) says effective immediately the state recognizes same - sex marriages performed elsewhere and state agencies should begin giving gay couples the rights they were awarded elsewhere .
UPDATE 10:25 a.m. : Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. ( D - Montgomery ) , who requested the opinion from Gansler , said in a brief interview that he was unsure whether there would be any immediate ramifications .
" It 's reaffirmation of what we thought , that Maryland can recognize gay marriage , " Madaleno said .
He said that changes in state policy could result from a court ruling , legislation or administrative action .
Original Post : A long - awaited opinion by Maryland Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler ( D ) out Wednesday morning concludes that the state 's highest court is likely to rule at some point that same - sex marriages performed in other states are valid in Maryland .
The policy implications of the opinion are not immediately clear , and Gansler says in a one - page summary that his conclusion " is not free from doubt . "
Gansler 's opinion concludes " that the Court of Appeals , when it ultimately rules on this question in a particular case , will likely apply the principle that a marriage that is valid in the place of celebration is valid in Maryland .
The opinion reaches this conclusion in light of the evolving state policy , reflected in anti-discrimination laws , domestic partner laws and other legislation , that respects and supports committed intimate same - sex relationships . "
Maryland law currently limits marriages performed in the state to opposite - sex couples .
I spend a lot of time using screen , whether it ’s on my main machine , or through ssh to another .
It ’s an amazing tool that really deserves more attention , but starts off rather droll .
So in that sense , customizing screen is more or less necessary .
As a shortcut to hand - editing configuration files , byobu gives you a decent screen arrangement and nicely coordinated colors , along with configuration menus , window management controls and an interface to the underlying screen program .
By default , it looks attractive ; this is the AUR conversion .
Or at least , as attractive as you can expect for a program that really only displays a couple of bars of text , against the console .
Pressing F9 under the default key settings will allow you to arrange byobu to your taste , so if you run a light - colored terminal and want a matching color scheme , you can pick one you like .
byobu also has some interesting power meters and system information that some higher - end hardware would find useful .
Most , if not all , of those are adjustable through the built - in menus , as well as some specialized windows ( built from core commands ) that will take closer peeks at your system .
Whether or not you like byobu might depend on how long you ’ve been using screen .
I had to shift my own . screenrc file out of the way before byobu would start up for me in Arch ; if you have a long series of settings you prefer , it might be more work to incorporate them into byobu than you like .
A couple of other points that you might want to consider :
The function key controls for byobu might get in the way of some of your applications .
You can adjust those to a different set of course , which I had to do almost immediately because I need the function keys for mc.
screen ’s default keyset is available as an option too .
screen is still what drives byobu , so if your version has a patch ( such as the vertical split patch ) , you ’ll have that function in byobu too .
I believe the default screen in Arch does not have that patch ; look for the AUR screen - vs package .
I ’ve used byobu under Ubuntu and Arch , and see the package in Debian and elsewhere .
If you want to get started with screen and want a jump start on prettifying it , this might be a good way to learn . 🙂
Oil demand in the OECD club has already peaked .
China accounted for 40 pc of the increase in global crude demand between 2004 and 2007 , a pattern that is expected to last for another 20 years or so as the Chinese take to the road .
Measuring the " China effect " on the world oil price is impossible , but if the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) is right in fearing a supply crunch after 2010 , this will lead to an immense Arabian windfall .
The IEA expects the Mid-East share of global oil output to rise from 30 pc today to around 38 pc by 2030 .
Great wealth has already rotated from the West , through China , to the Middle East .
Arab wealth funds have accumulated $ 1.4 trillion ( £ 880bn ) .
In a decade they may boast a lot more , and it is a fair bet that much of it will be invested in China .

Shaker Aamer was captured by Afghan villagers in 2001 Lawyers for the last recognised British resident in Guantanamo Bay can see papers they believe could help free him , the High Court has ruled .
Saudi - born Shaker Aamer , who has four British children , has been held in Guantanamo for seven years .
His lawyers say government documents contain evidence that confessions he made were obtained through torture .
But ministers are now likely to block disclosure on public interest grounds , meaning Mr Aamer faces a new battle .
His lawyers told the High Court in London on Tuesday that the government documents he was seeking included evidence that British intelligence officers were present on at least two occasions when he was tortured , but they did not assist him .
Richard Hermer QC said Mr Aamer 's legal team urgently needed to see the material , as his case was currently being reviewed by the Guantanamo detainee review task force set up by US President Barack Obama .
A decision on whether Mr Aamer is to be released is expected by mid-January .
Lord Justice Sullivan and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones rejected government arguments that Mr Aamer was not entitled to disclosure .
It is fundamental to the national interest of the United Kingdom that our intelligence and security services are able to operate without fear of having to disclose secret intelligence material
Government spokesman Lord Justice Sullivan said the matter was " clearly very urgent " .
He added : " If this information is to be of any use it has to be put in the claimant 's hands as soon as possible . "
Mr Aamer , 42 , is classed as a permanent UK resident .
He is married to a British national and was living with their four children in London .
His solicitor , Irene Nembhard , said : " It is the first ray of light for Shaker and his family .
" His family will be overjoyed and they will be expecting that at this point the British government will give their lawyers their documents to assist them in persuading the Americans to release Shaker back to the UK and to them . "
Torture claims
But in court , government lawyers made it clear a public interest immunity certificate would be issued to block disclosure on the grounds that it would be damaging to the public interest .
That will mean Mr Aamer 's legal team will have to take further court action to challenge the certificate .
At the hearing , Mr Hermer described how Mr Aamer had been detained at the US - run detention centre in Cuba since February 2002 .
Before that he was held at Bagram airport in Afghanistan , following his capture by Afghan villagers in December 2001 .
At Bagram he was subjected to torture during interrogations , the judges were told .
On one occasion this involved " having his head repeatedly banged so hard against a wall that it bounced " .
During that interrogation an MI5 officer was present , said Mr Hermer , who added that Mr Aamer had also been threatened with death during an interrogation at which an MI5 officer was present .
' Strenuous efforts '
A government spokesman said it was " disappointed " by the ruling , and that the documents were not necessary to support the US review of his case .
" We have already provided all the relevant information held on Mr Aamer by the UK to the US Review Panel , which is coordinated by the US Attorney General and which is considering his case , along with those of more than 200 others held in Guantanamo .
" We will continue to argue strongly the point of principle involved in this case - that it is fundamental to the national interest of the United Kingdom that our intelligence and security services are able to operate without fear of having to disclose secret intelligence material . "
He added that " strenuous efforts " had already been made on Mr Aamer 's behalf .
" The decision on his future is entirely one for the United States , but the US authorities know well our outstanding request for his release and our offer to see him returned to the UK . "

An offshore wind farm in the Nantucket Sound could save the New England region billions of dollars over 25 years , according to a new report .
The long - debated Cape Wind project , which would install 130 offshore wind turbines roughly five miles from the nearest shore , would be the first of its kind in the United States .
It would cover 24 square miles in the sound .
The turbines would supply about 10 percent of the 2013 power demand in Southeastern Massachusetts and about 1 percent of the total 2013 New England demand .
The project would save the New England region about $ 185 million a year , according to the report , which was prepared this month by Charles River Associates and commissioned by backers of the project .
Over 25 years , this would amount to $ 4.6 billion .
To do the analysis , Charles River used wholesale power costs , which are closely tied to retail costs paid by end customers .
The savings were estimated by calculating wholesale power costs for the region with and without the Cape Wind project in place .
The report ’s findings , however , did not dissuade the project ’s skeptics , who said that while the project may be a good financial move , there are other important considerations .
“ We would like to see them go back and do what the Fish and Wildlife Service asked and properly assess risks posed to birds , ” said Sharon Young , field director of marine issues at the Humane Society of the United States .
Ms. Young emphasized that the Humane Society was not opposed to the project , but wants to see research on Cape Wind ’s effects on waterfowl .
“ The Humane Society strongly supports the need for alternative energy , ” she said .
“ But as they say in real estate , it ’s all about location , location location . ”
In addition , Massachusetts Indian tribes have argued that the wind turbines would disturb spiritual rituals that require clear views across the sound .
Living in the Gap
The Ideal and the Reality of the Christian Right Family
By Jeremy Adam Smith
" Models of idealized family structure lie metaphorically at the heart of our politics , " writes linguist George Lakoff in his 2002 book Moral Politics .
" Our beliefs about the family exert a powerful influence over our beliefs about what kind of society we should build . "
Certainly , many Christian Right leaders would agree with him .
1
People who make it their business to track and fight the Right tend , with good reason , to focus on public , political activity , but the Christian Right sees the private home as a major arena of political struggle and a showcase for the world they want to live in .
" These homes are the source of ordered liberty , the fountain of real democracy , the seedbed of virtue , " write long - time activists Allan C. Carlson and Paul T. Mero in their new book , The Natural Family : A Manifesto .
The Natural Family attempts to distill a quarter century of " family values " organizing into a unified vision of social and political change in a bid to rejuvenate their flagging movement .
It reflects a decade of international collaborations of Religious Right organizations through the World Congress of Families , organized by Carlson 's Illinois - based think tank The Howard Center for Family , Religion , and Society .
First held in Prague in 1997 , the congresses convene right - wing organizations from around the globe " to affirm that the natural human family is established by the Creator and essential to good society " - and also to fight United Nations family planning initiatives .
As Carlson and Mero frame it , the single - family home - awash with enough sentiment to drown an entire city - might be the closest thing the Christian Right has to an actually existing utopian experiment .
Examining these ideas can reveal a great deal about the psychology of the Christian Right as well as the visionary goals its adherents pursue .
But recent research into the daily lives of evangelicals also reveals the degree to which their ideal is vulnerable to social and economic forces that all American parents must confront .
I believe Lakoff is correct to argue that the Strict Father conception of parenting - which stresses authoritarian discipline and patriarchal control - is key to understanding Christian Right politics , but his rubric might obscure the ways in which movement ideals are evolving in response to changing social conditions .
Even as Christian Right leaders are " talking Right , " as University of Virginia sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox puts it , some of the evangelicals who form the base of their movement are " walking Left " and embracing a more moderate way of political and family life .
This creates a fissure in the Christian Right that no manifesto can close .
Villages are for Liberals
The Christian Right and evangelical Christians are not one in the same - " Survey research shows that 70 percent of evangelicals do n't identify with the Religious Right , " reports Rice University sociologist Michael Lindsay2 - but conservative evangelicals have been largely responsible for developing and promoting the anti-gay , anti-feminist " family values " agenda that has powerfully shaped the culture and platform of the Republican Party .
Thus if we want to understand what the ideal Christian Right home looks like , we must turn to the truly staggering amount of childrearing advice conservative evangelical preachers and pundits dispense to followers .
( Julie Delton )
An evangelical home takes the Bible as the basis for all its rules and relations - as opposed to the empirical evidence that shapes mainstream childrearing advice .
" I do n't believe the scientific community is the best source of information on proper parenting techniques , " writes Focus on the Family founder James Dobson in The New Dare to Discipline , which has sold millions of copies since the first edition was published in 1971 .
" The best source of guidance for parents can be found in the wisdom of the Judeo - Christian ethic , which originated with the Creator and has been handed down generation by generation from the time of Christ . "
As a result of this adherence to a holy text that cannot be changed and must be obeyed , the ideal Christian Right home is a place of authoritarian hierarchy .
When University of Texas sociologists John P. Bartkowski and Christopher G. Ellison compared dozens of secular parenting books with conservative Protestant parenting
manuals , they found that a literal interpretation of the Bible 's childrearing advice contributed directly to a worship of authority in all spheres of life , including the political .
3
They also found that conservative evangelical parenting gurus disagreed with mainstream counterparts on virtually every issue .
According to their study , secular , science - based parenting advice emphasizes personality adjustment , empathy , cooperation , creativity , curiosity , egalitarian relations between parents , nonviolent discipline , and self - direction .
Conservative Protestants , on the other hand , stress a tightly hierarchical family structure and a gendered division of labor , with a breadwinning father at the top of the pyramid and children at the bottom .
" Children learn to make wise choices by having wise choices made for them , " writes syndicated columnist and talking head Betsy Hart in her 2006 book It Takes a Parent ( as opposed to a village - villages are for liberals ! ) .
Needless to say , all right - wing parenting manuals stress obedience - especially for girls and women .
This leads us to the third aspect of a Christian Right home : the subordination of women .
" Obedience is the most necessary ingredient to be required from the child , " writes Reverend Jack Hyles , late pastor of First Baptist Church of Hammond , Indiana and author of 49 books and pamphlets .
" This is especially true for a girl , for she must be obedient all her life .
The boy who is obedient to his mother and father will some day become the head of a home ; not so for the girl .
Whereas the boy is being trained to be a leader , the girl is being trained to be a follower . "
4
It 's an unashamed , old - fashioned vision of oppression updated in The Natural Family : A Manifesto .
" We do believe wholeheartedly in women 's rights , " write Carlson and Mero .
" Above all , we believe in rights that recognize women 's unique gifts of pregnancy , childbirth , and breastfeeding . "
This commitment to inequality is not merely rhetorical : Wilcox found that " evangelical Protestant husbands do an hour less housework per week than other American husbands . "
And he notes that " sociologists Jennifer Glass and Jerry Jacobs have shown that women raised in evangelical Protestant families … marry earlier , bear children earlier , and work less [ outside the home ] than other women in the United States . "
Wilcox concludes that " it is true that evangelical Protestantism - but not mainline Protestantism , Reform Judaism , and Roman Catholicism - appears to steer men ( and women ) toward gender inequality . "
5
The Christian Right has tried to shape its institutions - prefiguring plans for American society as a whole - to reflect its conception of gender roles .
Starting with the Fall 2007 semester , for example , the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Texas introduced a new major in homemaking - available only to women .
" We are moving against the tide in order to establish family and gender roles as described in God 's word for the home and family , " said Seminary President Paige Patterson .
" If we do not do something to salvage the future of the home , both our denomination and our nation will be destroyed . "
6
Born to be Bad ?
Wilcox also found that evangelical Protestantism " steers fathers in a patriarchal direction when it comes to discipline .
Drawing in part on their belief in original sin and on biblical passages that seem to promote a strict approach to discipline - ‘ He who spares the rod hates his son , but he who loves him is careful to discipline him ' ( Prov. 13:24 ) - evangelical Protestant leaders … stress the divine authority of parents and the need for parents to take a firm hand with children . "
7
And so the fourth characteristic of a Christian Right home is that children are born evil and can become good only through a Godly mixture of love and punishment .
" One does not have to teach antisocial behavior to toddlers , " writes right - wing family psychologist John Rosemond in a 2006 column , syndicated in 225 newspapers .
8
" They are by nature violent , deceitful , destructive , rebellious , and prone to sociopathic rages if they do not get their way . "
I wrote to Rosemond in an email and asked him to elaborate .
" In my estimation , " he replied , " toddlerhood is a pathological condition that demands ‘ cure , ' accomplished through a combination of powerful love and powerful discipline .
… The toddler mindset and the sociopathic mind - set are one and the same : ‘ What I want , I deserve to have ; the ends justify the means ; and no one has a right to stand in my way . '
This is a reflection of human nature . "
Rosemond invoked the DSM - IV , the diagnostic bible of mental health practitioners , to justify his views and give them the veneer of scientific authority , but later in his response he made it clear that there is only one Bible that guides his parenting advice .
" In every passage of Scripture that refers to the discipline ( disciple-ing ) of children , the central theme is leadership , " he writes .
" I am , first and foremost , a believer in and follower of Jesus , The Christ . "
Psychologists I interviewed were horrified by Rosemond 's use of the DSM - IV and his conception of children as mentally ill , which amounts to a translation of the doctrine of original sin , with its framework of damnation and salvation , into contemporary therapeutic terms .
The difference is simple : A two - year - old human being is still learning how to deal with and express her feelings , but a true sociopath has no feelings .
To treat a toddler like a sociopath is like studying snakes in order to understand koala bears - and then declaring that koala bears are cold - blooded .
In fact , contrary to Rosemond 's views , research has found that human beings exhibit empathic behavior from as early as 18 months .
For example , Nancy L. Marshall at Wellesley College found that " when toddlers saw a teddy bear suffer an ‘ accident , ' their faces showed distress and concern .
They also responded by trying to help or comfort the bear " 9 - a behavior I 've seen my three - year - old son exhibit many times .
There are literally hundreds of empirical studies that echo these results .
Based on findings like these , evolutionary psychologists like Jonathan Haidt and Marc Hauser argue that moral behavior has evolved to keep selfishness in check and has deep biological roots .
None of the findings indicate that human beings are born saints , only that the capacities for empathy and cooperation are present from the very beginning and can be cultivated - or squashed .
Rosemond 's views are , at best , one - sided .
At worst , they suggest a deep fear and hatred of children .
And among conservative evangelicals , Rosemond is hardly alone .
" Your child came into the world with an insatiable faculty for evil , " writes Pastor John MacArthur in his 2000 book , What the Bible Says About Parenting .
" Even before birth , your baby 's little heart was already programmed for sin and selfishness . "
A mark on the forehead
Is it harsh to accuse the parenting gurus of the Christian Right of fearing and hating the precious children they 've worked so hard to protect ?
It 's no harsher than the punishments they proscribe for wicked children .
Let 's say , for example , that your two - yearold insists on getting out of bed after you 've told him to stay put .
" The youngster should be placed in bed and given a speech , " writes Dobson , who launched Focus on the Family as a forum for Christian parenting and is now a major voice in the Republican Party .
" Then when [ the child 's ] feet touch the floor , give him one swat on the legs with a switch .
Put the switch where he can see it , and promise more if he gets up again . "
But Dobson seems like Dr. Spock when compared to Tennessee Pastor Michael Pearl .
" If you want a child who will integrate into the New World Order and wait his turn in line for condoms , a government funded abortion , sexually transmitted disease treatment , psychological evaluation , and a mark on the forehead , " Pearl writes in his 1994 book To Train Up a Child , " then follow the popular guidelines in education , entertainment , and discipline , but if you want a son or daughter of God , you will have to do it God 's way . "
Pearl 's interpretation of " God 's way " entails hitting disobedient children with quarter - inch plumbing supply line or PVC pipe - " chastisement instruments " he endorses as excellent expressions of the Lord 's will .
Unsurprisingly , Christian Right groups like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family actively campaign against laws intended to curb child abuse .
" The campaign to end child abuse too often abuses families , " declare the authors of The Natural Family , citing " witch hunts " against misunderstood parents who were probably only trying to protect their kids from the New World Order .
As Lakoff points out in Moral Politics , the Christian Right confuses psychologist Diana Baumrind 's influential idea of authoritative parenting - which sees discipline as supportive , not punitive , and is responsive to children 's needs and thoughts - with separate categories of permissive or neglectful parenting .
As an alternative , the Christian Right promotes authoritarian parenting , which denies choices to children and expects them to obey without question - a style that research has shown contributes to lower self - esteem , poorer social skills , and more feelings of depression .
10
Spare the Metaphor , Spoil the Rod
Evangelical homes must confront the same problems as their nonevangelical counterparts : the erosion of real wages , the rising costs of necessities like health care and education , the ubiquity of electronic media , and the declining rights of workers , to name a few .
These forces shape the homes of evangelicals just as surely as they shape the homes of other sectors of society , which explains why , for example , rates of teen sex and divorce are not significantly lower in these homes .
In fact , divorce is especially high in Bible Belt states , due at least in part to higher unemployment .
In The Natural Family , Mero and Carlson blame virtually all these fundamentally economic developments on feminism : in their view , it is the " imposition of full gender equality " - not , for example , globalization - that " destroyed family - wage systems . "
There 's no empirical evidence for this claim , but that hardly matters : Scapegoating claims like this one serve to mobilize Christian Right constituencies for its social agenda of putting heterosexual men back at the head of family and society , a strategy that has seemed to work in electing conservative politicians .
" People have personal standing in a discussion about what a good marriage is and what a bad marriage is , " Republican operative Bill Greener told journalist Brian Mann .
" They feel comfortable in that dialogue .
It 's about something they understand , a lot more than about trade policy .
"
11
The Natural Family describes a comprehensive range of public policies that flow from making the patriarchal family the basic building block of society .
In the authors ' view , families , not government , should care for the sick and the vulnerable , thereby making welfare , universal health care , and Social Security irrelevant and even anti-Christian ; mothers should take care of young children instead of federally subsidized daycare providers ( or , for that matter , fathers ) ; older children should be educated at home , not public schools ; and so on .
In this way the Christian Right philosophy of the home roughly converges with antitax , antigovernment sentiment , except when it comes to legally enforcing the movement 's vision of how families should be structured .
But for all its gains in the political realm - which have captured most of the outraged attention of the political Left - the Christian Right continues to lose the culture war .
According to Gallup polls , in 1982 , only 34 percent of Americans " believed that homosexuality was an acceptable alternative lifestyle .
" 12 Last year , 61 percent of those polled by People for the American Way supported at least civil unions for gays .
13 Families are more egalitarian than ever , with more and more men participating in housework and childcare , and with more and more mothers working .
14
These changing attitudes and practices are reflected in the rhetoric of conservative evangelicals .
In The Natural Family , for example , Carlson and Mero must make their argument for inequality within the framework of what they disingenuously call " women 's rights . "
John Rosemond must use psychological research to legitimate his fundamentally religious views on childrearing .
Even patriarchal ideologues like Dobson and MacArthur call for dads to be " more involved " and " loving " with their families , deploying rhetoric about fathers that only rarely appeared prior to World War II - and which is largely the creation of the secular , scientific culture they deplore .

Thus the changes of the past half century have altered the landscape and rules of discourse in ways that appear to be long lasting .
On my parenting blog " Daddy Dialectic , " one evangelical Christian argued against stay - at - home fatherhood : " Men should be out there doing whatever it takes to insure that mom can spend as much time as possible with her family because she is uniquely equipped by God for the role of managing the household and the kids on a daily basis . "
But another evangelical responded : " Scripture commands [ that men provide for their families ] , and leaves it at that .
It does n't specify a paycheck .
If my family needs income , and my wife is better suited to earn it , why risk my family 's stability by forcing my way into the workforce ?
" 16 My own conservative evangelical relatives openly supported my decision to become my son's primary caregiver .
In an interview for this article , Wilcox urged that we distinguish " between what elite evangelicals [ like Dobson ] say and what average people are doing . "
While elites may rail against the social and economic changes of recent decades , Wilcox told me that " your average evangelical takes all that with a grain of salt . "
That 's in part because most evangelical wives work .
" Part of that is a class issue , " Wilcox said .
" Evangelicals are more working class , than , for example , mainline Protestants , [ and ] they have less economic flexibility .
And so the reality on the ground , with gender issues , is more flexible than some might expect . "
As a result , claimed Wilcox , " many evangelicals are walking Left , talking Right . "
In other words , the more their behavior compromises with reality , the shriller the rhetoric can be .
Wilcox also found that while evangelical men were more likely to use corporal punishment and less likely to do housework , they were also much less likely to yell at children , which indicates less anger in the home , and evangelical husbands were more likely than other men to be affectionate with their families .
For his part , John Rosemond told me that he is ambivalent on corporal punishment .
" Unfortunately , the word ‘ rod ' as used in Scripture in the context of the discipline of children has been misinterpreted as a concrete object , " he told me .
" Careful Biblical exegesis will reveal that it is a metaphor for powerful , compelling leadership that is always conducted with the child 's best interests in mind . "
( Of course , evangelicals and religious fundamentalists are not accustomed to thinking about holy texts in the metaphorical way Rosemond suggests . )
This is all to say that while Christian Right ideals might seem simple and frightening , the behavior of evangelicals who form the Christian Right social base is complex .
Lakoff's Strict Father model may be useful as a way to link parenting with political beliefs , but it can also obscure the degree to which evangelicals can disagree and evolve - which does happen , though it might not seem that way to outsiders .
Certainly , no evangelical or even fundamentalist today lives as Christians did in the centuries right after Christ was crucified - no one , for example , is putting adulterers to death , as the Bible advises ( Deuteronomy 22:22 and Leviticus 20:10 ) .
Among other practical problems , that would wipe out at least half of the current crop of Republican presidential candidates .
Wilcox argued to me that the strength of the evangelical narrative is that it explains why , for example , women still do twice as much housework as men - it 's their God - given inclination .
But that can be turned around :
The evangelical narrative can't explain why some men are doing more childcare than in the past - many even claim they want to - or why gay and lesbian families continue to multiply .
Instead , the narrative simply declares some human desires as consistent with their version of biblical truth , and others as out of bounds .
Given the inadmissibility of empirical evidence , the evangelical narrative can explain only what supports the narrative - and must dismiss the rest .
This creates an unhappy gap between ideal and reality , the place in which average evangelicals must live .
And stubbornly adhering to the narrative creates another gap , between their utopian homes and the homes of everyone around them .
In the face of social change , individual homes might preserve their purity .
But in the end , they will sacrifice their ability to communicate with neighbors - or to win more political power .

You never were much for fancy galas like these .
Not even the sun setting over the bow of this 1,000 - foot military yacht is enough to take your mind away from world security .

A WOMAN in emergency accommodation at a hotel was allegedly raped and indecently assaulted by two interstate police officers investigating Victoria 's Black Saturday bushfires , a court has heard .
South Australian senior constables Damien Michael Jay Wilmott , 30 , and Steven James Westcott , 40 , have been charged over the alleged attack in March .
Wilmott faces three charges , including rape and indecent assault , and Westcott has been charged with indecent assault .
Opening a committal hearing at the Melbourne Magistrates Court yesterday , prosecutor Ray Gibson said the 20 - year - old woman had befriended the Victorian police officer who co-ordinated the interstate response and was aware that South Australian police were staying at the hotel .
Mr Gibson said that early on Wednesday , March 11 , Wilmott knocked on the door of her room and asked to be let in , but as she went to close it on him , he pushed it open .
Astronomers have spied a distant black hole in the act of creating the galaxy that will eventually become its home .
By sending a jet of gas and highly energetic particles into a neighboring galaxy , the black hole has touched off star formation at a rate 100 times the galactic average .
“ Our study suggests that supermassive black holes can trigger the formation of stars , thus ‘ building ’ their own host galaxies , " David Elbaz , lead author of a paper on the work in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics , said in a press release .
" This link could also explain why galaxies hosting larger black holes have more stars . ”
The quasar HE0450 - 2958 , located about 5 billion light - years from Earth , is powered by a supermassive black hole .
Unlike all other known quasars , this one did not appear to be surrounded by a galaxy , which had puzzled astronomers .
They thought perhaps the quasar 's surrounding galaxy was obscured by dust .
So , in the latest observations they looked in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum , in which dust shines brightly , using the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope .
But they did n't see dust , confirming the idea that the quasar really is " naked . "
Instead of a surrounding galaxy , Elbaz 's team found the black hole was blasting its neighbor with energy and matter .
That injection has caused the observed flurry of star births : 350 new suns are bursting into existence each year in the region .
Eventually , the black hole will merge with its neighbor .
The two objects are located 22,000 light - years apart and are moving towards each other at less than 125 miles per second .
In tens of millions of years , HE0450 - 2958 will finally get a home .
" This would provide a natural explanation for the missing host galaxy , " Elbaz and his co-authors wrote .

The Ontario Court of Appeal rebuked a Brampton trial judge today for suggesting it would be a form of " insanity " to jail a man for running a large - scale marijuana grow operation from his home .
By choosing instead to sentence Zeyu Song to 12 - months of house arrest , Justice Elliott Allen ignored a line of cases from the appeal court , instructing judges that conditional sentences in these cases should rarely be imposed .
At the sentencing hearing last year , Allen essentially dismissed the high court 's pronouncements as mere " utterances " and suggested it is largely up to local judges to fashion their own marijuana sentencing practices .
But in doing so , he completely upended the notion that appeal courts , in many instances , should defer to a trial judge 's findings .
" The principle of deference is not a license for the sentencing judge to defy settled jurisprudence , ignore the principles of the Criminal Code , or his or her dias as a political podium , " Justices Michael Moldaver , Janet Simmons and Robert Blair said in a decision collectively authored by " the court . "
When Song , who pleaded guilty to a charge of production of marijuana , came before the court last year to be sentenced , Allen rejected a federal prosecutor 's argument that a jail term was necessary to discourage members of the public from getting involved in the drug trade .
" What 's your basis for saying that ? " the judge pressed .
" Because nobody has been deterred .
People have been going tojail for drug offences for - for a couple of generations now and the drug - the drug plauge is worse than it ever was . "
Allen questioned why , when a form of sentencing " does n't work , " he would try doing it again and again .
" Is n't that a form of insanity ? " he asked .
The judge also noted that , in the United States - " which makes us look like we are all living in northwestern Europe by comparison " - a huge number of people are serving life sentences without parole for growing or trafficking in moderate amounts of marijuana .
Meanwhile , the chances of a Dutch teenager smoking marijuana - which is available at their local coffee shop - are substantially lower than the likelihood of an American teenager using the drug , he said .
All society is really doing by prohibiting the production and consumption of marijuana is " giving the Hell 's Angels several billion dollars worth of income every year , " said Allen , who added that if pot were not illegal , there also would n't be a problem with home invasions .
In a " breezy and colourful fashion , " the judge has made it clear that he personally has little use for a sentencing regime that seeks to deal with marijuana offences by imposing " real " jail sentences to deter people from buying and selling the drug , the appeal court said .
But while " judges are entitled to hold personal and political opinions as much as anyone else , " they are not free to permit those views to colour or frame their trial and sentencing decisions , " the court said .
As unhappy as it was with Allen 's approach to sentencing , however , the appeal panel had a practical problem .
Song had completely served his year of house arrest and , in such circumstances , the court is reluctant to send people back to jail .

Without taking away from its dim view of how the trial ended , the panel said it was " not persuaded that it would serve the interests of justice to send Mr. Song to prison at this point . "
So while the Crown effectively won its case , its appeal of Song 's sentence was dismissed .
Banks and investors are pulling out of the carbon market after the failure to make progress at Copenhagen on reaching new emissions targets after 2012 .
Carbon financiers have already begun leaving banks in London because of the lack of activity and the drop - off in investment demand .
The Guardian has been told that backers have this month pulled out of a large planned clean - energy project in the developing world because of the expected fall in emissions credits after 2012 .
Anthony Hobley , partner and global head of climate change and carbon finance at law firm Norton Rose , said : " People will gradually start to leave carbon desks , we are beginning to see that already .
We are seeing a freeze in banks ' recruitment plans for the carbon market .
It 's not clear at what point this will turn into a cull or a rout . "
Paul Kelly , chief executive of Eco­Securities , which develops clean energy projects , said that while markets had not expected a definitive post - Kyoto Protocol deal at Copenhagen , they had expected some progress .
" The lack of regulatory certainty in the post 2012 world affects the market 's view of what CERs [ carbon credits from clean energy projects ] will be worth and subsequently will constrain financing for projects .
If you had an agreement at Copenhagen with a bit more detail , people would be more willing to take risk . "
After two weeks of extenuating talks , world leaders delivered an agreement in Copenhagen that left campaigners disappointed as it failed to commit rich and poor countries to any greenhouse gas emission reductions .
Banks had been scaling back their plans to invest in carbon markets before Copenhagen .
Fewer new clean energy projects need to be financed as , because of the recession , there are fewer global emissions to offset .
The price of carbon credits has also fallen , while plans to introduce national trading schemes , particularly in the US and Australia , remain uncertain .
Two sources said that Australian bank Westpac had scaled back plans to increase its carbon desk in London .
A bank spokeswoman denied there were plans to recruit more staff in London , adding : " We have always said that we would look to grow this business organically as carbon markets develop and that remains the case . "
Carbon markets were central to the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 and obliged developed countries that exceed their targets to purchase credits from clean energy projects in the developing world .
Policymakers will meet again in Mexico in November in an attempt to revive the climate change talks .
Religion seen an ' oddity ' by ministers , Archbishop says
Government schemes de-normalised religion , Dr Williams said The Archbishop of Canterbury has accused the government of treating religious faith as an " eccentricity " practised by " oddities " .
But Rowan Williams told the Daily Telegraph ministers were wrong to think it was no longer relevant to society .
Political leaders should be more open about their beliefs , he added .
A government spokesperson said it did recognise " the important role faith plays in shaping the values of millions of people in this country " .
The spokesperson added that engagement with faith communities happens through the Faith Communities Consultative Council , which sees representatives of all the major religions being consulted on " policy questions of mutual interest " .
Part of establishing their human credentials is saying ' This is where my motivation comes from
Rowan Williams
Send us your comments Communities Secretary John Denham has also held " intensive discussions with faith leaders , and is recruiting a panel of advisers to act as a sounding board on issues of faith and public policy " .
But Dr Williams told the Telegraph : " The trouble with a lot of government initiatives about faith is that they assume it is a problem , it 's an eccentricity , it 's practised by oddities , foreigners and minorities .
He said the three main party leaders " curiously " all have a " very strong moral sense of some spiritual flavour " .
" The effect is to de-normalise faith , to intensify the perception that faith is not part of our bloodstream .
And , you know , in great swathes of the country that 's how it is . "
Pope 's invitation
He said it would not do " any harm " for political leaders to be more open about their religious beliefs .
" Part of establishing their human credentials is saying ' This is where my motivation comes from ...
I 'm in politics because this is what I believe ' .
And that includes religious conviction . "
Dr Williams also played down the Pope 's invitation for disaffected Anglicans to cross over to Rome .
The Vatican says it was responding to pleas from Anglicans unhappy about the creation of women bishops .
The proposal would allow Anglicans to convert while preserving many of their traditions and practices .
Dr Williams said : " A great many Anglo - Catholics have good reason for not being Roman Catholics .
" They do n't believe the Pope is infallible .
And that 's why they 're still pressing for a solution in Anglican terms , rather than what many of them see as a theologically rather eccentric option . "
In 2007 , former prime minister Tony Blair told the BBC that while his faith was " hugely important " to him , he avoided publicly speaking about it for fear of being labelled .
" You talk about it in our system and , frankly , people do think you 're a nutter , " he said .
The prime minister 's ex-spokesman Alastair Campbell famously warned reporters : " We do n't do God . "

Jim McCormick sells the hand - held detectors from his offices in Somerset
The director of a company which sold a bomb - detecting device to 20 countries , including Iraq , has been arrested .
ATSC 's Jim McCormick , 53 , was detained earlier in the month on suspicion of fraud by misrepresentation , Avon and Somerset police said .
He has been bailed .
A BBC investigation has alleged the ADE - 651 did not work .
Earlier , the British government announced a ban on the export of the device to Iraq and Afghanistan , where British forces are serving .
Anti -theft tag
Mr McCormick has said the device , sold from offices in Sparkford , Somerset , used special electronic cards slotted into it to detect explosives .
But a BBC Newsnight investigation reported that a computer laboratory said the card it examined contained only a tag used by shops to prevent theft .
There are concerns the detectors have failed to stop bomb attacks which have killed hundreds of people .
The ADE - 651 is in use at most checkpoints in Baghdad
The device consists of a swivelling aerial mounted to a hinge on a hand - grip .
It does not operate by battery , instead promotional material says it is powered only by the user 's static electricity .
The ADE - 651 has been sold to a range of Middle Eastern countries and as far afield as Bangkok .
The Iraqi government has spent US $ 85 m ( £ 52 m ) on the hand - held detectors , now used at most checkpoints in Baghdad .
It is understood Iraq paid about US $ 40,000 for each device .
No Western government uses them .
The BBC has learned the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has ordered an investigation into the bomb detectors , expected to report shortly .
The government ban , brought in by Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , starts next week .

Haitian Pact With The Devil : A Clarification
Pat Robertson ’s ability to use any natural disaster as the springboard for a provocative and deeply ignorant remark that expresses his own blinkered and bigoted worldview of “ morality ” is so commonplace and predictable by this point that it usually seems unworthy of noting .
His comment yesterday about Haiti having caused its own massive tragedy by making “ a pact with the devil ” falls well within this category , and ordinarily I ’d ignore it , but this response by Haitian ambassador Raymond Joseph is so perfect - direct , intelligent , filled with more history in one minute than pretty much anything you see on most news programs all evening - that it deserves as much currency as it can get .
It ’s a shame that we live in a world where something like this is both necessary and remarkable , but there you are .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Ben Bernanke ’s confirmation to a second term as U.S. Federal Reserve chairman suddenly appeared in jeopardy on Friday even after U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he would back him .
Two Senate Democrats on Friday announced they would oppose Bernanke , citing concerns about the economy that promise to be a key campaign issue and joining the growing number of senators who have vowed to vote against his appointment .
With the U.S. job market in disarray and voters angry at Wall Street , members of Congress facing mid-term elections in November have come down hard on the central bank .
Reid , late in the day , issued a qualified statement of support for Bernanke , whose current term expires on January 31 .
“ While I will vote for his confirmation , my support is not unconditional , ” Reid said .
“ The Senate will continue to demand visible and responsible results for the people we represent . ”
Democratic aides said a vote is expected on Bernanke sometime next week , though one has not yet been scheduled and it was unclear when , or if , it would be .
Noting the uncertainty of Bernanke ’s fate , one senior aide said : “ I believe there will be the votes to confirm him .
But it ’s going to be very close . ”
Critics say the Fed failed to prevent the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , and combated the meltdown in a way that favored the financial sector at the expense of ordinary citizens .
Senators Barbara Boxer and Russ Feingold brought the total of known “ no ” votes among the Democratic majority to four , while many others have said they were still on the fence .
“ Our next Federal Reserve chairman must represent a clean break from the failed policies of the past , ” Boxer said .
“ It is time for Main Street to have a champion at the Fed . ”
The shift came rather abruptly and has added a new element of uncertainty to a stock market that had already been reeling in recent days .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 fell into the red for the year - to - date on Friday , joining the Dow and Nasdaq indexes .
“ The unthinkable has become a very real possibility -- risks are rising that the Senate will unseat ” Bernanke , said Michael Feroli , economist at JP Morgan .
In - trade , an online betting platform , on Friday showed only a 68 percent chance that Bernanke will be confirmed , down from 95 percent just a few days back .
Several Republicans have already come out against Bernanke and some have moved to block his confirmation , forcing Senate leaders to secure a super - majority of 60 votes in the 100 - member chamber to move the nomination .
While Reid backed Bernanke , his deputy , Assistant Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin was still undecided , a senior party aide said .
Another member of the Senate Democratic leadership , Charles Schumer , will vote for Bernanke , an aide said .
Large U.S. banks , seen as the source of the financial crisis that punished the economy with the deepest recession since the 1930s , have come under pressure from Washington for their quick return to big profits and paying outsized bonuses after receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer aid .
The unemployment rate currently stands at 10 percent , with more than 15 million Americans out of work .

POPULAR ANGER
With mid-term elections in November , many lawmakers are loath to take any stand that appears to benefit Wall Street .
That tendency has only been sharpened since this week ’s Republican upset for the Massachusetts Senate seat that had been a Democratic stronghold for decades .
Bernanke , who was first named as chairman by former President George W. Bush , was nominated to a second term by President Barack Obama in August .
“ Democrats are nervous , ” said a senior Republican aide .
“ But I do n’t think Democrats are going to kill the president ’s nominee .
I think he will be confirmed . ”
He said if Democrats are unable to secure the 60 votes needed to clear procedural hurdles they will probably not even bring the nomination up for a vote .
A Democratic aide declined to speculate if that would be the case .
The White House said Obama remained confident the Democratic - controlled Senate would muster the votes needed to clear procedural hurdles and confirm Bernanke ’s nomination .
“ We ’re going to work our side pretty hard , and we are working with people in the business community who are going to push pretty hard , ” an Obama administration official said .
Wall Street bankers generally have a very favorable view of Bernanke , crediting him with stabilizing the financial system with creative policies like special lending facilities for disrupted credit markets and direct purchases of mortgage and Treasury bonds .
It is unclear what would happen if Bernanke , who is also serving a separate , 14 - year term on the Fed ’s board , is not confirmed by that deadline .
The law specifies that the vice chairman of the board , currently Donald Kohn , would serve in the “ absence ” of the chairman , but absence is not defined .
Some experts say it is possible the board could name Bernanke to serve as chairman on an acting basis .
Senator Christopher Dodd has said Kohn would temporarily take over chairmanship of the board if Bernanke were not confirmed in time .
“ Monetary policy in its current construct would be unaffected by a delay in Bernanke ’s confirmation unless the delay is seen as either presaging his rejection , or indicating a politicization of the Fed and excessive government involvement , ” said Tony Crescenzi , market strategist and portfolio manager at bond fund Pimco .
If for no other reason , 2009 will long be remembered as the year that , all things considered , we ’d just as soon forget .
Oh sure , there were bright spots — the nation ’s first black president rode into office on a wave of optimism , YouTube siren Susan Boyle struck a blow for homely people everywhere and pilot Chesley “ Sully ” Sullenberger bravely landed a disabled aircraft in the Hudson River , forever earning his place as the greatest hero in American history named “ Chesley . ”
But mostly 2009 turned out to be a big stinker , as “ hope ” rapidly turned to “ nope , ” sunk by a steady tide of bad news : an ongoing recession , two wars , the swine flu pandemic , Wall Street bailouts , government scandals , the spectacle of Tom DeLay dancing — the list goes on .
So rather than pointlessly shouting “ You lie ! ” and demanding to see a birth certificate from a year that could n’t tell the difference between an Appalachian Trail hike and an Argentine booty call , let us instead deflate the oversized Mylar balloon labeled “ 2009 ” and look ahead to the events we ’ll be feverishly tweeting about in the 12 months to come :
Jan. 14 : Buyers of Sarah Palin ’s 413 - page memoir “ Going Rogue ” file a class - action lawsuit after discovering that the former Alaska governor stopped writing her memoir halfway through , opting to fill the book ’s last 150 pages with moose recipes .

March 24 : Pop sensation Lady Gaga and ’ 80s hair band Kajagoogoo team up to form Gaga Googoo and score a No. 1 record with a remake of Amy Grant ’s hit song “ Baby , Baby . ”
April 5 : In an effort to reduce health care costs while simultaneously stimulating the economy , the administration proposes combining the “ Cash for clunkers ” program with the idea of government - run “ death panels ” by offering $ 5,000 to any family that agrees to pull the plug on an elderly relative .
April 28 : In what some refer to as a blatant attempt to boost flagging ratings , Jay Leno admits during his monologue that he is also sleeping with Tiger Woods .
May 9 : In a stunning coincidence , the first season of Britain ’s “ Got Animal Talent ” is won by Susan Boyle ’s mangy , unattractive cat , Pebbles .
May 31 : Intercepted intelligence transmissions demonstrate that the Iranians have yet to develop a working nuclear device as a result of “ difficulties downloading and installing the Windows Vista patch . ”
June 30 : In a development that many feel could dramatically reduce the nation ’s health care costs , Nintendo releases “ Super HomeSurgery ” for the Wii game system .
July 22 : After years spent fruitlessly trying to close California ’s $ 50 billion budget shortfall , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger instead decides to take advantage of widespread drought conditions and torches the state for the insurance money .
Aug. 16 : Nebraska Sen . Bill Nelson pulls support for the health care reform bill when his colleagues refuse to include a government subsidy for hairpiece replacement .
Aug. 28 : The “ New Moon ” - inspired vampire craze that peaked in 2009 finally recedes , replaced by a surge of interest in angst - ridden teenage gnomes .
Sept. 13 : Reality television achieves harmonic convergence when , in the midst of the live “ American Idol ” finale , Jon Gosselin and Octomom Nadia Suleyman are married onstage by Ryan Seacrest .
Simon Cowell describes the ceremony as “ trite , predictable and tedious . ”
Sept. 26 : Kanye West once again jumps onstage to interrupt the MTV Video Music Awards .
But this time , in the midst of his drunken diatribe , Kanye is himself interrupted by Taylor Swift , who grabs the microphone and says , “ Kanye , I ’m happy for you , and I ’m a let you finish , but last year ’s interruption was one of the best interruptions of all time . ”
Oct. 20 : Osama bin Laden is captured in a remote region of northern Pakistan after successful efforts to infiltrate the al - Qaida leader ’s inner circle by the nation ’s two newest undercover operatives , Tareq and Michaele Salahi .
Nov. 2 : The integrity of the American voting process is again questioned when the Supreme Court intervenes to declare that the big winner of the 2010 elections is Adam Lambert .
Nov. 17 : Middle East peace negotiators reach a breakthrough when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas agree to become Facebook friends .
Dec. 6 : Apple unveils the iUD , the world ’s first wireless birth - control device that can also hold more than 1,000 songs .
Dec. 31 : After more than a year - and - a - half of debate , Congress finally passes health care reform with genuinely bipartisan support when officials agree to tack the bill on as an amendment to “ must pass ” legislation raising Congressional salaries .

President Yoweri Museveni urged caution on his party Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has distanced himself from a bill proposing execution for some gay people .
He stressed that the MP who proposed the bill , who is a member of the ruling party , did so as an individual and was not following government policy .
Mr Museveni , who admitted coming under international pressure , said the bill was now a " foreign policy issue " and would be discussed by the cabinet .
The proposals have caused a storm of criticism across the world .
Sweden has threatened to cut aid and other countries have contacted Mr Museveni directly to put their objections .
High - level contacts
The BBC's Joshua Mmali , in the capital Kampala , says the president has been silent on the controversy since the bill was proposed in October .
But in his first public comments on the issue , Mr Museveni told a meeting of ruling party members their handling of the bill " must take into account our foreign policy interests " .
Mrs Clinton rang me .
What was she talking about ?

He said the cabinet would be talking to David Bahati about his bill and would thrash out the government 's position on it .
Homosexual acts are already punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Uganda .
Mr Bahati's private member 's bill , which had been expected to gain wide support in the ruling National Resistance Movement ( NRM ) , would raise that penalty to life in prison .
It also proposes the death penalty for a new offence of " aggravated homosexuality " - defined as when one of the participants is a minor , HIV - positive or a " serial offender " .

Recently at 80 beats we 've covered some of troubles China has had with toxins leaking into its waterways from petroleum spills and the environmental degradation caused by mining for rare Earth metals .
But in a study this week in Science , Zhang Fusuo raises another concern :
The country 's soil is on the path to being dangerously acidic .
Zhang 's team looked at the government 's research data for soil over 30 years , and also compared a survey of China 's soil conducted in the 2000s to one from the 1980s .
For nearly all soil types found in China , soil pH has dropped 0.13 to 0.80 units since the early 1980s [ ScienceNOW ]
.
When soil lowers in pH and therefore becomes more acidic , it becomes more of a haven for pests and nematodes and less of one for plants — most plants prefer the neutral range between a pH of 6 and 8 .
If the trend continues , Zhang argues that China could have trouble producing enough food for its population .
Zhang points his finger at the overuse of fertilizer ; the amount used in China has increased more than 50 percent since the early 1980s , a rapid ramp - up that he says is driving the change .
" The average pH in all of China has decreased by 0.5 unit in the last 20 years .
Left to nature , a single unit change needs hundreds of years or even over 1,000 years , but we have got this change now due to fertilizer overuse , " Zhang said [ Reuters ]
.
Acid rain can also contribute to acidity , but Zhang says the evidence points to fertilizer as the primary culprit .
ScienceNOW cites a few dissenting scientists who say that Zhang 's team 's data needs to be more site - specific , and not just taken from samples strewn across the country , to be truly vital .
But they agree with him that fertilizer use in China can and should be cut sharply .
According to Zhang , farmers overused fertilizer in a somewhat haphazard fashion over the years , hoping to increase their yields .
But what they got instead , he says , was air pollution and soil dwindling in productivity because of its pH drop .
The acidification has already lessened crop production by 30 - 50 % in some areas , Zhang says .
If the trend continues , some regions could eventually see the soil pH drop to as low as 3 .
" No crop can grow at this level of acidification , " he warns [ Nature News ]

The 13th Floor Elevators frontman will return with his first album of original songs in more than a decade .
And he 's hired Austin indie- rockers Okkervil River as his backing band
13th Floor Elevators ' Roky Erickson will return with his first album of original material in 14 years , recorded with Austin indie- rockers Okkervil River .
True Love Cast Out All Evil includes material written throughout Erickson 's life and " found sounds " from the Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane , where he spent several years in the early 1970s .
" This is not a cynical comeback record , a lukewarm update on an established legacy – these are the best songs Roky has ever written , " claims Okkervil River 's Will Sheff , who produced the album .
" This record has been the most challenging and rewarding thing I 've ever worked on , and we in Okkervil River were deeply honoured to show up decades later and help Roky carry these wonderful songs over the finish line . "
Though his music has appeared in several anthologies over the last two decades , Erickson has not released new material since 1995 's All That May Do My Rhyme , and it is half a century since the Texas songwriter 's most celebrated work , with psychedelic rockers 13th Floor Elevators .
Erickson was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1968 , leading to time in hospital , while minor skirmishes with the law resulted in further hospitalisation – including electric shock therapy .
In the decades that followed , Erickson gained legendary status , bolstered ( and weighed down ) by his reputation as an " outsider " artist .
He has been saluted by acts including REM , Primal Scream , the Jesus and Mary Chain , ZZ Top and even Kasabian .
In 2005 the singer was profiled in a documentary , You 're Gonna Miss Me , which helped a healthier Erickson to launch a small comeback , touring the US and Europe .
Okkervil River play on all of the new album , which is drawn from among 60 unreleased Erickson songs .
" [ These tracks went ] unreleased due to decades plagued by the kind of personal tragedies that would destroy someone less resilient , " Sheff said .
" There were songs written during business setbacks including the Elevators ' painful break - up , songs written by Roky while he was incarcerated at Rusk , and a great deal of songs that reminded me of the sense of optimism and romanticism that I think sustained Roky through his worst years and ultimately reunited him , a few years ago , with his son Jegar and his first wife Dana ...
The quality of the material we ended up with was exhilarating . "
True Love Cast Out All Evil will be released by Anti on 20 April .
Carroll met with Seahawks CEO
Tod Leiweke and other members of the organization earlier this week .
The two sides are close to a five - year deal worth $ 7 million a year that would make Carroll both president and head coach , sources told the Los Angeles Times .
While Carroll would receive control over football operations , sources said that Leiweke still wants to be involved in selecting a general manager to preserve some system of checks and balances .
However , Carroll would have final authority on personnel and will be heavily involved in the hiring of the new GM .
The issue is not considered a deal - breaker , sources said .
A source close to Carroll told ESPN The Magazine 's Bruce Feldman that Carroll is scheduled to meet with the Seahawks either Saturday night or Sunday .
Members of Seattle 's coaching staff , the source said , also were informed Friday afternoon that the franchise now will hire a head coach before hiring a general manager , which also is consistent with Carroll 's prior statements about considering any return to the NFL .
Carroll previously has said he 's learned at USC that running his own operation is paramount to success and it would be a priority for him to set up his own football operation if a desirable NFL position ever became available .
Carroll did not have that authority as coach of both the New York Jets and New England Patriots in the 1990s .
In a text message Friday , Carroll said , " You know I have n't responded to a NFL question in two years . "
But a league source said Carroll is trying to persuade USC offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates to join him in Seattle -- as opposed to Bates pursuing the same position with the Chicago Bears .
Ko Jong - mi can still see her mother lying on her deathbed in a shabby North Korean village .
“ I ’m sorry , ” the old woman said , her voice weak .
“ I ’m the one who brought you to this life .
Please , please forgive me . ”
Now 49 , Ko long ago forgave her mother for becoming an unwitting victim of North Korea ’s covert Homecoming Project .
Under the slogan “ Let ’s go back to the fatherland ! ” the campaign persuaded more than 93,000 ethnic Koreans and their families living in Japan to emigrate to North Korea from 1959 to 1984 .
A widow supporting her three children with work at an Osaka cardboard factory , Ko ’s mother fell prey to alleged North Korean operatives who told her about a “ heaven on Earth ” that provided free education and health benefits .
Advertisement
The recruiters , activists say , were members of the General Assn. of Korean Residents in Japan , or Chosen Soren , whose Tokyo headquarters acts as North Korea ’s unofficial embassy .
Chosen Soren has denied any connection with the program .
It was 1963 .
Ko ’s mother had heard rumors that volunteers could leave after three years if they were unhappy .
Because she knew of no returnees , she assumed that no one wanted to go back -- not that they were n’t allowed to .
Ko recalls her mother repeating , “ I never dreamed that they would never let us return . ”
Hoping for better benefits as a family with a combined five children , Ko ’s mother quickly married a Korean Japanese man and boarded the 111th Emigration Passenger Ship for North Korea .
Ko was 2 years old .
Advertisement
Ko ’s family realized their mistake even before they arrived in the North Korean port of Chongjin .
“ My mother said my 15 - year - old stepbrother could feel that something was n’t right , ” Ko recalled .
“ When he asked to be sent back to Japan , guards took him away .
Our family never had a dinner together in North Korea . ”
Five years later , Ko saw her stepbrother for the next and last time , on a family visit to the mental hospital where he ’d been taken .
“ There were dirty people with long hair kept in iron cages like in a zoo , ” she said , wiping away tears .
“ I hid behind my mother , but I could see them .
Many crawled on their hands and feet like animals .
All my life I ’ve had to live with that image . ”
Advertisement
After that , her parents changed , Ko recalled .
Her stepfather often brooded and her mother never again mentioned her stepson , who died in the asylum , still a young man .
Ko suffered her own despair .
She was often bullied at school , labeled a panjoppari , a slur meaning half - Japanese .
Classmates ripped her Japanese - made clothes , considered too colorful compared with the drab military - style garb worn by most children .
The teacher lashed out at Ko , telling the class that her mind had been polluted in Japan .
Advertisement
“ Homecoming members were the lowest rung of the ladder .
We were like untouchables , ” Ko said , a reference to the lowest members of the caste system .
At age 10 , she obsessed about killing herself .
“ But I decided that I could n’t do that to my mother , ” she said .
Kim Il
Sung ’s communist government came to view many of the newcomers as potential spies , banishing them to concentration camps .
They extorted money and goods from the prisoners ’ families in Japan and elsewhere to keep the immigrants alive and support the dictatorship .
The Ko family was banished to the border town of Sinuiju , across the Yalu River from the Chinese city of Dandong .
Ko ’s stepfather worked his way up to a managerial position in a machinery factory .
Advertisement
Her parents sought ways to raise
Ko ’s social standing and finally secured the 14 - year - old a spot on the pingpong team at a local school .
She excelled at sports and competed nationally .
“ I knew if I worked hard , I was equal to the others , ” she said .
“ It changed my life . ”
Ko entered a university and eventually became a professor there .
She married and had two children .
But life remained oppressive .
Her parents aged prematurely ; her stepfather was arrested and interrogated .
Advertisement
Finally ,
Ko received the order from officials that convinced her that she had to flee North Korea : to secretly dispose of the bodies of neighbors who died during the 1990s famine .
“ I was dumping these bodies into the river at night and thinking , ‘ What is this country doing to us ?
I could end up like this one day . ’ ”
By the end of World War II , 2 million ethnic Koreans lived in Japan -- from intellectuals and migrant workers who went voluntarily to those forcibly delivered there by the Imperial Japanese government during its rule over Korea .
Facing discrimination , many wanted to return home in the years that followed , but after the partition of Korea , they felt their allegiances divided .
Chosen Soren propaganda books and posters circulated in Japan suggested that North Korea was their true homeland , describing it as “ a place where laughs and songs flow like a poem through joyful labor and happy life . ”
Advertisement
But Ko eventually came to see North Korea as the big lie .
Instead of the utopia her mother sought , all she knew was misery and famine .
Her life was spiraling downward .
Her mother died in the early 1990s and her stepfather years later -- to the end both yearning for their lives back in Japan .
Then Ko’s husband died and she soon lost her university job , banished to perform common labor in a nearby village .
“ I was back to zero despite my parents ’ sacrifices , ” she said .
Advertisement
A decade ago , after Ko and her children were caught trying to defect , she was beaten so severely that she still remains on disability , unable to work .
In 2005 , a second defection attempt succeeded , landing Ko and her children in Osaka .
She was finally a free woman -- four decades after her family boarded their ship to the so - called promised land .
Her children are flourishing in Japan .
Her son works as a deliveryman and her daughter is studying to become a doctor .
A slight woman with mournful eyes , Ko has worked to create a new life .
She learned to speak Japanese and has made new friends .
But she constantly rubs her neck and shoulders , soothing the dull pain that is the legacy of the beatings .
Advertisement
“ The North Koreans broke my body , ” she said .
“ But they could not reach my soul . ”
In 2007 , Ko was approached by human rights activists here who wanted to sue Chosen Soren for allegedly conspiring to send tens of thousands to North Korea .
They wanted Ko to be their plaintiff .
“ The defectors are so traumatized they are afraid to speak out , ” said Fumiaki Yamada , an Osaka University economics professor and member of the Society to Help Returnees to North Korea .
“ We needed someone to step forward . ”
Ko knew that family members who remained in North Korea could face retaliation .
Yet after months of anguish , she became the first North Korean defector living in Japan to file suit against Chosen Soren .
Advertisement
When she signed the papers , she thought of her mother .
“ She lived her entire life in regret , ” she said .
“ I do n’t want any more regrets . ”
In November , a district judge in Osaka dismissed her case against Chosen Soren over a statute of limitations issue , ruling that she had been back in Japan too long to file a valid claim .
Recently , Ko went to the group ’s Tokyo offices and banged on the door .
“ You have to apologize , ” she demanded , “ for what you have done to us . ”
Chosen Soren officials declined to discuss the issue in detail .
“ We had nothing to do with that , ” an officer said of the Homecoming Project .
Advertisement
Ko ’s lawyers have appealed the judge ’s decision .
She also is pursuing ways to sue North Korea in international court .
Although Ko’s mother has been dead for nearly two decades , Ko recalls their final talk and that heartbreaking apology .
“ Mother , I have to thank you , ” a teary - eyed Ko recalled insisting .
“ You were always there for me .
You helped me . ”
But her mother refused to forgive herself .

“ No , ” she said , “ I helped ruin you . ”

I had n’t actually been paying much attention to the Russian : Belarus dispute over oil supplies .
After the annual debacles that we are used to over natural gas supplies that flow from Russia to Western Europe through Ukraine , and which seem somewhat quiescent at the moment , I had failed to grasp how much Western supplies of oil from Russia flow through Belarus .
But as is pointed out in Foreign Policy , the flow is significant , and this is a more far - reaching conflict than I grasped .
As a brief review :
In 2001 , Belarus unilaterally canceled a contract that mandated the sharing of these revenues , leading to substantial losses for Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft and the Russian state budget .
Now , Transneft is demanding that Belarus pay full import duties for the portion of Russian oil that it resells on the European market , a demand that could cost Belarus as much as $ 5 billion per year .
The Belarusian government argues that the Russia - Belarus customs union obviates the need for Minsk to pay duty on imports from Russia .
Although deliveries through the Druzhba pipeline have not , as of mid-January , been cut off , the prospect that Transneft ( whose chairman is Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin , a close confidant of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ) will turn off the taps to force compliance from Minsk is clearly one that has European leaders worried because the European Union imports about a third of its oil from Russia , mostly via Belarus .
Already , the prospect of supply disruptions has driven U.S. crude oil prices to a 15 - month high , presumably to Moscow 's delight .
Well , as my post on Wednesday showed , I am not convinced that this conflict had a lot to do with the rise in oil prices ( which actually dropped a little today , on their overall march upwards ) .
But that does not lessen the longer - term impact of what is going on .
It is , as it was with the Ukraine dispute , to with control , with Russia seeking to control fuel distribution in these countries , and through supply controls also influence the directions in which the country moves .
Russia is now warning that it will reduce oil flows to Belarus even further and wants the duty on the roughly 290,000 bd that is refined in Belarus and then exported to the West .
At the moment the refineries in Belarus have a relatively short reserve ( between a few days and a week , reportedly - depending on source ) and the current contracts have expired .
Germany and Poland are believed to be hit hardest once Russia halts shipments through the Druzhba pipeline .
Germany depends on Russian crude for about 15 percent of its total consumption , and Poland buys from Russia to meet 75 percent of its market demands .
Minsk has threatened to raise the transit fee for its European customers more than tenfold , from 3.9 dollars to 45 dollars per metric ton , should Moscow not agree to its conditions , RIA Novostinews agency quoted an unidentified expert close to the talks as saying .
At the moment the talks appear to be stalled .
However they are not limited to the transit of oil .
There is also a dispute over the transmission of electric power .
Belarus acts as a transit country for power both to Kalingrad and to the countries of the Baltic .
It has assumed somewhat greater urgency with the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania .
The plant closed on December 31 , and there are fears of greater dependence on Russia for future power .
Russian complacency about the situation is not , I suspect , exactly helpful .
“ It is inevitable that Russia is going to become a bigger supplier of energy to Europe and particularly to the Baltic countries .
Ultimately there comes a point where you have to let the old days go , ” Chris Weafer , chief strategist on Moscow ’s Uralsib bank , told New Europe on 5 January , adding that the Baltics , which sorely need energy supplies , should adopt a pragmatic approach and rely on their eastern neighbor and forget the legacy of the Soviet Union .
As long as Russia continues to try and build a modern and diversified economy with greater global integration , then it needs the goodwill of the West just as much as the West needs Russia ’s energy .
Bids for construction of a new plant are due to be submitted by the end of this month , with the hope of getting the new plant on line by 2018 .
( Kalingrad is hoping to have its own reactor in about the same time frame ) .
In the interim the Baltic states are going to be dependent , not only on Russia for their electricity and oil , but also on satisfactory conditions to allow the transit of both through Belarus on their way .
Meanwhile , over in Ukraine , there is an election underway , with initial voting to take place on Sunday .
It is perhaps for that reason that there have been no major gas disruptions so far this year .
Anger with the current administration is giving a bit of a boost to a third candidate , so perhaps it is in Russia ’s best interests to retain a low profile at this point .
In fact Russia is claiming credit for keeping the UK supplied with gas as supplies from Norway dropped due to bad weather at some of the production sites .
However Russia is also being nice to Turkey as insurance just in case it will still need to do some bypassing around Ukraine to supply Western Europe after the election is over .
Not that conditions in Ukraine itself have been unaffected .
There are some 175 towns and villages that are reported to be still without power , due to the bad weather .
This is a decided improvement from the 1,598 who lost power in the Dec 29th storm .
At least they are more used to the cold .
Those in Florida who are n’t , and plugged in too many heaters , are also causing power outages down there .
Within days of taking office in January 2009 , President Barack Obama issued executive orders that repudiated key elements of the Bush administration 's abusive approach to fighting terrorism .
By changing course in such a swift and high - profile way , President Obama appeared to signal a new and reformed counterterrorism policy , one consistent with basic US values and with international law .
But in the months that followed this promising start , the administration chose to retain a number of the previous administration 's most problematic policies , albeit in modified form .
Past abuses at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , and elsewhere had greatly damaged the United States ' moral standing and served as a rallying cry for terrorists around the world .
Rather than protecting national security , these crimes hindered international cooperation in combating terrorism , helped terrorist recruitment , and undermined the goal of reducing anti-American militancy .
One of the difficult challenges facing the new administration when it took office was how to deal with the legacy of these abuses , including , specifically , the question of what to do about the approximately 240 prisoners in military custody at Guantanamo Bay .
Human Rights
Watch issued a comprehensive set of recommendations to President Obama in November 2008 that laid out the steps we thought his administration should take to combat terrorism and respect human rights .
Now , one year into the president 's tenure , Human Rights Watch reviews his administration 's advances , analyzes its missteps , and urges more meaningful and extensive reforms .
One key recommendation is for the Obama administration to reconsider its decision to detain some terrorism suspects indefinitely without charge .
A traditional tool of repressive governments , the practice of long - term administrative detention bypasses basic due process rights found in criminal proceedings , and is inconsistent with US legal traditions and constitutional values .
Leading Accomplishments
Ending Secret Prisons
On January 22 , 2009 , his second full day in office , President Obama issued an executive order on interrogation policy that ended the Central Intelligence Agency 's secret detention program .
The CIA 's prisons , which are thought to have held some 100 detainees since 2002 , were the site of some of the Bush administration 's most egregious human rights violations , including waterboarding and other forms of torture .
CIA Director Leon Panetta announced that the president 's order had been implemented in an April 9 , 2009 memorandum to CIA staff that stated : " The CIA no longer operates detention facilities or black sites and has proposed a plan to decommission the remaining sites . "
In August , in another move to end the use of secret detention , the Department of Defense implemented a new policy requiring US military forces to notify the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) of the identity of all detainees within two weeks of their capture .
Under the previous rules , a detainee 's identity could be withheld until he was transferred to a long - term military detention facility .
Implementing the Ban on Torture and Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
Another provision in the January 2009 executive order on interrogation policy prohibited the CIA from using the coercive interrogation techniques authorized by the Bush administration and required it to abide by the same interrogation standards as the US military .
The order also set up an interagency task force to assess whether the interrogation practices authorized by the Army Field Manual ( FM 2 - 22.3 on Human Intelligence Collector Operations ) are adequate to acquire needed intelligence and to advise whether the CIA should be provided additional guidance .
In August 2009 , the task force concluded that the practices employed by the military were sufficient .
In his April 9 memo to CIA staff , CIA Director Panetta reported that the agency was in compliance with the president 's order , explaining that " the CIA does not employ any of the enhanced interrogation techniques that were authorized by the Department of Justice from 2002 to 2009 . "
The memo also stated that CIA officers " He will continue to conduct debriefings using a dialogue style of questioning that is fully consistent with the interrogation approaches authorized and listed in the Army Field Manual . "
Repudiating Past Authorizations for Torture
The January 22 executive order on interrogation also revoked past presidential directives and other orders and regulations that authorized the abusive treatment of detainees , and repudiated all Justice Department memos relating to interrogation that were issued between September 11 , 2001 , and January 20 , 2009 .
Pledging to Move the 9/11 Trial to Federal Court
In November 2009 , Attorney General Eric Holder announced that five defendants accused of planning the September 11 attacks would be transferred to the Southern District of New York for trial in federal court .
The five men- who were initially held in CIA custody and who have been held since 2006 in military detention at Guantanamo - were facing pending charges before a military commission .
Holder 's announcement underscores the importance of the 9/11 trial to America 's reputation in the fight against terrorism .
By moving this historic trial to federal court - and out of the ad hoc , chaotic , and discredited military commissions - the administration has taken a crucial step toward ensuring that the trial 's results will be recognized as legitimate both domestically and internationally .
Human Rights
Watch is disappointed , however , with Holder 's commitment to seeking the death penalty against the five defendants in the case .
Missteps , Missed Opportunities , and Incomplete Reforms
Maintaining the War Paradigm as a Justification for Holding Suspected Terrorists Indefinitely without Charge
One of the most potentially far - reaching Obama administration positions was first revealed in a brief that the Justice Department filed in the Guantanamo litigation in March 2009 .
In response to a federal court order seeking a definition of the term " enemy combatant , " the Justice Department claimed the authority to pick people up anywhere in the world on the grounds of support for or association with al Qaeda or the Taliban , and to hold them indefinitely without charge in military detention .
While formally discarding the phrase " enemy combatant , " the Justice Department adopted the previous administration 's position that the United States was at war with al Qaeda and the Taliban , effectively seeking to justify the detention of persons linked to those groups until the war is over .
The only substantive difference from the Bush administration 's prior litigating position was that if the person 's connection to al Qaeda or the Taliban was limited to support , that support had to be " substantial . "
In subsequent court filings and other communications , the administration has reiterated these views .
Human Rights
Watch strongly urges the administration to reject the paradigm of an ill - defined and open - ended war as a justification for holding people indefinitely without charge .
Closing Guantanamo by Establishing a System of Indefinite Detention in the United States
On January 22 , 2009 , President Obama announced plans to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility by January 2010 .
He also established a task force to review the status of the roughly 240 men then held at Guantanamo to determine if they should be transferred , released , prosecuted , or handled in some other way .
In a speech at the US National Archives in May 2009 , President Obama specifically indicated that his administration might continue to hold some number of detainees indefinitely without charge .
In describing the population held at Guantanamo , he outlined five categories of detainees , including a set of persons " who can not be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people . "
He said his administration would work with Congress to develop a legal framework setting out the rules and procedures for the " prolonged " detention of such persons .
While Obama did not state categorically that there were detainees who fit into this fifth category , his administration has since made clear that when Guantanamo closes it will transfer some number of prisoners to the United States for continued , indefinite detention .
The administration did pull back from the idea of proposing legislation to govern such detentions , though it may yet issue an executive order that outlines evidentiary rules and standards , review procedures , and other relevant issues .
It has been clear for several months that the administration will not meet its one - year deadline for closing Guantanamo .
But much worse than the delay in closing the facility is the manner in which the facility seems likely to close .
Effectively bringing Guantanamo to the United States - or , specifically , to the correctional facility in Thomson , Illinois , which the administration has announced plans to purchase - will do little to address the violations of fundamental rights of the men held there .
Human Rights
Watch urges the Obama administration to prosecute the remaining detainees at Guantanamo or appropriately repatriate or resettle them elsewhere .
To simply move detainees to US soil while continuing to hold them indefinitely without charge would eviscerate the meaning of closing Guantanamo .
Reviving the Unfair Military Commissions
On the day he took office , President Obama directed military prosecutors to seek a 120 - day suspension of military commission proceedings , the deeply flawed prosecutions that have taken place at Guantanamo over the past several years .
The president 's subsequent executive order on Guantanamo stopped military commission proceedings during the pendency of the detainees ' status review process .
In May , however , President Obama announced plans to resurrect the military commissions system , while asserting that detainees would be tried in federal courts wherever feasible .
The administration subsequently worked with Congress to draft legislation amending the commissions ' rules , known as the Military Commissions Act of 2009 ( MCA ) .
The new law made a number of improvements to the Bush - era military commissions system , creating , among other changes , important restrictions on the use of hearsay and coerced evidence .
Yet military commissions remain vastly inferior to the federal courts as a forum for trying terrorism cases .
Notably , military commission judges lack the independence necessary to protect their rulings from the taint of executive pressure .
The commissions ' convening authority , a political appointee , wields enormous power to bring charges or drop them , approve plea bargains , and reduce or waive sentences .
And despite the new changes , the MCA provides defendants with substandard procedural protections , and continues to authorize charges that have not previously been considered war crimes , raising ex post facto concerns .
As a tool for fighting terrorism , the military commissions are especially flawed .
A military institution , they encourage terrorism suspects to glorify themselves as warriors engaged in a legitimate fight .
Civilian prosecutions , by contrast , treat terrorism suspects as criminals , denying them the propaganda value of combatant status .
Compared to its predecessor , the Obama administration has made progress in reasserting the primacy of the federal civilian courts for the prosecution of terrorism suspects .
Soon after taking office , the administration returned Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri to the custody of federal criminal justice authorities , charging him with conspiracy and material support of terrorism .
A Qatari citizen and US resident who had been held in military custody as an " enemy combatant " since 2003 , al - Marri pled guilty to conspiracy to provide material support to al Qaeda and was sentenced to more than eight years in prison .
In May 2009 , the Obama administration also transferred Ahmed Ghailani , a Tanzanian who was held for several years in secret CIA detention , from Guantanamo to federal criminal proceedings in the Southern District of New York .
And the planned transfer of the 9/11 case , discussed above , should take place in early 2010 .
Yet other cases have remained in military commissions .
In November 2009 , Attorney General Holder announced that five detainees previously charged in commissions would be charged again under the revised rules .
Among the defendants was Omar Khadr , a former child soldier who was 15 years old at the time of his alleged crime .
Human Rights
Watch urges the Obama administration to discontinue its reliance on the military commission system and prosecute all detainees implicated in crimes in federal civilian court .
Returning and Resettling Detainees Held at Guantanamo
The administration has faced serious obstacles to reducing the prisoner population at Guantanamo .
A full year into President Obama 's tenure , 198 detainees remain in custody there , down from 242 when he took office .
The pace of transfers out of Guantanamo has been no faster under Obama than it was during the last years of President Bush .
The Guantanamo Detainee Review Task Force , mandated to examine each detainee 's case , has yet to complete its review .
In December , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that the task force 's preliminary assessment concluded that 116 detainees were eligible for release , but thus far , only 43 men have actually left the detention facility .
( An additional prisoner has died . )
Among the most daunting obstacles to shrinking the prisoner population has been Congress 's refusal to allow detainees to be resettled in the United States .
When President Obama took office , an estimated 50 to 60 of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo could not be returned to their home countries because of the risk of torture or abuse .
Included in this group were 17 Uighurs from China who had long been cleared for release but who no third country would take .
The administration had hoped to resettle some of the Uighurs in Virginia , where a vibrant local Uighur community was willing to provide housing , language training , and other assistance .
However , the administration failed to secure congressional support for the plan , and Congress subsequently passed legislation blocking the transfer of any detainee from Guantanamo to the United States for purposes other than prosecution .
The administration 's inability to resettle detainees in the United States has hindered its efforts to convince other countries to do so .
To date , eight countries have accepted 19 non-citizen detainees for resettlement , far fewer than the number for whom resettlement is needed .
Another important stumbling block to closing Guantanamo has been the number of detainees from Yemen .
When Obama took office , about 100 Yemeni detainees remained at Guantanamo , the largest national group by far .
The US has been reluctant to send detainees back to Yemen because of al Qaeda 's robust presence in the country .
With the alleged Yemen connection to the Christmas day bombing plot , plans to carry out returns from Guantanamo to Yemen became politically untenable .
In early January , the Obama administration announced that detainees would no longer be sent home to Yemen , including the approximately 40 Yemenis who had been cleared for return last year in a painstaking review process .
In effect , Yemenis at Guantanamo are being punished because of a plot carried out without their participation or knowledge .
Human Rights
Watch urges the Obama administration to charge the Yemenis it has credible evidence against and work with Yemen on a plan for safely returning or resettling the rest .
The Obama administration should also intensify negotiations with other countries to resettle the remaining Uighurs and other detainees who cannot return to their home countries .
Denying Basic Rights to Prisoners at Bagram
The Obama administration has been slow to acknowledge the rights of the approximately 700 prisoners held in military custody at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
In July , the Defense Department announced new status review procedures for detainees held at Bagram , procedures that are modeled on the Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRTs ) previously used at Guantanamo .
The new procedures , which provide greater procedural rights than the previous system in use at Bagram , still suffer from the flaws of the CSRTs .
Notably , the " personal representative " assigned to the detainee is not a lawyer and does not have a confidential attorney - client relationship with the detainee ; the fact - finder lacks independence ; the detainee has no ability to see the classified information used against him , and there is little possibility for the detainee to call witnesses on his behalf .
Yet detainees in Afghanistan , regardless of whether they are under the physical control of the Afghan or US government , are entitled to both international human rights and Afghan domestic legal protections , which include the right to counsel and the right to challenge the legal and factual basis for the detention before an independent and impartial fact - finder .
In habeas litigation currently in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit , the Justice Department has reasserted the Bush administration position that prisoners held at Bagram - even those arrested in other countries and brought to Afghanistan - have no right to challenge their detention in US court .
Rejecting a district court ruling in April that found that detainees brought to Bagram from outside of Afghanistan have the same right to court review as detainees at Guantanamo , the Justice Department argues that because Bagram , unlike Guantanamo , is located in a traditional theatre of war , the courts should have no jurisdiction over detainees held there .
Human Rights
Watch recognizes that Afghanistan is war zone , but believes that petitioners in the Bagram litigation - who are terrorism suspects flown to Afghanistan from non-war zones such as Thailand and Dubai - cannot simply be detained without charge and without access to any court .
Human Rights
Watch urges the Obama administration to reconsider its position in the Bagram litigation , and to stop indefinitely detaining terrorism suspects without charge .
We also urge the administration to grant basic due process rights - such as the right to be informed of the specific reasons for arrest , to have access to a lawyer , and to challenge the detention before an Afghan court - to other detainees held by the US at Bagram , including persons apprehended in Afghanistan .
Accounting for Past Abuses
The American people deserve a full and public accounting of the scale of post - 9/11 abuses , why and how they occurred , and who was responsible for authorizing and facilitating them .
In order to deter serious human rights violations such as torture and enforced disappearance from occurring again , officials implicated in these crimes should be investigated and prosecuted .
Both a commission of inquiry and criminal prosecutions are needed to repudiate these serious abuses , restore US moral authority , and satisfy the demands of justice .
The Obama administration has shown little enthusiasm for either of these steps .
President Obama has repeatedly expressed a reluctance to " look backwards " at the crimes of the previous administration .
He has specifically ruled out prosecuting CIA agents who committed abuses that the Justice Department advised were lawful , even though torture is a serious crime under both US and international law .
In August , Attorney General Holder announced that he was appointing a special prosecutor to a carry out a preliminary review of alleged CIA abuses .
The review is focusing on so - called " unauthorized " interrogation techniques : practices that went beyond what was allowed under legal advice provided by the Justice Department at the time .
It seems unlikely to look up the chain of command to the senior - level officials who planned , ordered , and condoned abuses .
Human Rights
Watch urges President Obama to work with Congress to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate , document , and publicly report on post - 9/11 counterterrorism - related abuses .
We also believe that the Department of Justice should initiate a full - scale criminal investigation into senior - level responsibility for the abusive interrogation practices by the US government since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Ensuring that Prisoners Are Not Rendered to Torture
The January 22 executive order on interrogations established a special task force mandated , among other things , to review prisoner transfer policies to ensure that suspects are not rendered ( transferred ) to countries where they face a serious risk of torture .
In August 2009 , the task force issued its policy recommendations relating to transfers .
It counseled US authorities to continue carrying out detainee transfers based on " diplomatic assurances , " non-binding promises from the receiving country that detainees will be treated humanely .
The task force advised that the State Department should be involved in evaluating assurances , and that some type of monitoring mechanism to ensure private access to transferred persons should be used .
Human Rights
Watch has found diplomatic assurances against torture and other ill - treatment to be unreliable .
We urge the administration to reconsider its position and to mandate that detainees not be transferred based on diplomatic assurances to countries where they face a real risk of torture or other serious abuse .
In every instance , including transfers from Guantanamo , detainees facing transfer should be granted access to a fair review mechanism in which to raise potential concerns about abuse .
Asserting an Overbroad Understanding of the State Secrets Privilege
The Obama administration has taken an indefensible position on the " state secrets " privilege .
In a series of court cases , the Obama administration has invoked an overly broad understanding of the scope of the privilege , claiming that even meritorious litigation should be summarily dismissed if it might lead to the revelation of classified information .
The administration has also failed to support pending reform legislation , known as the State Secrets Protection Act , which would provide clear and sensible procedures for courts to prevent government misuse of the privilege .
The first indication of the Obama administration 's views came in February 2009 in the case of Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan , Inc .
In urging a federal appeals court to uphold the dismissal of a lawsuit involving CIA flights that brought suspects to be tortured , a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged that the administration was taking " exactly " the same position as the Bush administration .
In subsequent cases , despite issuing new guidelines in September that purported to limit the use of the privilege , the Justice Department has continued to assert an overly broad position .
It called for full court review of an appellate panel 's ruling in the plaintiffs ' favor in the Jeppesen case , and , at oral argument before the full appellate court in December , it pressed the court to dismiss the case .
Human Rights
Watch urges the Obama administration to opt for a narrower approach to the state secrets privilege : to invoke it only to protect national security - not to prevent the release of information that the government might find embarrassing - and only when genuinely necessary .
Ensuring Transparency and Abolishing Unreasonable Barriers to Declassification
Despite a few missteps , the Obama administration has made important progress in ensuring transparency though the release of official documents and other government materials .
In April , the Justice Department declassified four Bush - era memos on so - called enhanced interrogation techniques .
The memos provided the legal framework for the CIA 's use of waterboarding and other abusive interrogation techniques that violate domestic and international law .
They demonstrate the falsity of the Bush administration 's repeated protestations that the United States did not engage in torture .
In August , similarly , the Justice Department released a 2004 report from the CIA inspector general 's office that details a range of CIA abuses that constitute torture under US and international law .
It describes how CIA operatives subjected prisoners held in secret detention to mock executions , brandished a gun and an electric drill before one detainee , and threatened to kill another prisoner 's children .
In December , President Obama issued an executive order on classifying and declassifying national security information , which , for the first time , establishes that no records may remain classified indefinitely .
Significantly , the order eliminates the veto authority that the Bush administration granted intelligence agencies regarding declassification , and establishes a streamlined process for declassification through a National Declassification Center .
While its actual impact remains to be seen , the order is clearly a positive step toward improving public access to matters of societal concern and ensuring that government agencies do not have unfettered power to restrict the disclosure of embarrassing information .
Yet the Obama administration 's record on transparency is not unblemished .
In May , the administration blocked the court - ordered release of photographs of detainee abuse that occurred from 2001 to 2005 , claiming that the photos ' publication would endanger US troops .
At the administration 's request , Congress later rewrote the Freedom of Information Act to grant the Defense Department the authority to withhold specific photographs from release .
In addition , the Justice Department has yet to release a report from its Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) that examines possible ethics violations by the attorneys who drafted the Bush - era " torture memos . "
The release of the report , a draft of which was originally completed in December 2008 , has been repeatedly delayed , despite the attorney general 's assurances to Congress that it would be made available by the end of November 2009 .
Human Rights
Watch urges the Obama administration to continue to release previously suppressed or classified documents detailing abuses against persons in US custody , or setting out the decision - making process behind such abuses .
The first thing I noticed about lua was how absurdly fast the runtime built .
I ’m used to a language runtime taking a few minutes at least , and as long as hours ( haskell ) .
An install via ports , including downloading the source and installing dependencies took less than a minute on my 2 - year - old laptop .
One of lua ’s stated design goals is compactness , and they ’re not kidding .
The cost is that there are features that I would consider relatively basic that are not included .
For example , despite having a pretty good functional foundation with built - in “ lists ” and first - class functions , it does n’t provide any way to do map / collect or filter / select out of the box .
Pretty simple to make , but one of my guidelines is to try to avoid pushing a language in a direction it does n’t want to go .
So my implementation ended up going in a relatively imperative direction .
Once I accepted that , it was a very smooth ride .
Everything felt pretty familiar .
But for all that , I ’m left feeling a bit like I ’ve missed some key elements of a subtle and elegant language .
This is perhaps the price I pay for my deliberate superficiality ; Lua is on my list to go back and look at more deeply .
More notes :
Lua has a unique (? ) fundamental data structure called a table .
It will behave like a list , or an array , or a hash , or all three at once !
I did n’t really make use of it except as an array , but it ’s intriguing .
1 - based array indices .
Bah !
I ’m sure the Pascal people are happy .
I know it ’s used as the scripting language for several packages out there ( Lightroom , World of Warcraft ) and it seems very well - suited to that .
It ’s tiny , and skill - scalable — simple for beginners to get started in , but with room to grow for advanced users .

War veterans looks to clear their name with the U.S. military , who suspect the four men of committing a crime for which they were framed
The Bureau of Meteorology says figures showing Australia has experienced its hottest decade since records began in 1910 are clear evidence of climate change .
The Bureau 's annual report has found the average temperature over the past 10 years was 0.48 degrees Celsius above average .
Climatologist David Jones says each decade since the 1940s has been warmer than the previous one .
And he has warned that this year is set to be even hotter , with temperatures likely to be between 0.5 and 1 degrees above average .
" There 's no doubt about global warming , the planet 's been warming now for most of the last century , " he said .
" Occasionally it takes a breather , during La Nina events for example .
" But we 're getting these increasingly warm temperatures - not just for Australia but globally - and climate change , global warming is clearly continuing .
" We 're in the latter stages of an El Nino event in the Pacific Ocean and what that means for Australian and global temperatures is that 2010 is likely to be another very warm year - perhaps even the warmest on record . "
Record heatwaves
2009 was Australia 's second - warmest year on record , with the annual mean temperature 0.90C above average .
Dr Jones says the results have been partly driven by three record - breaking heatwaves .
Temperatures soared in southern Australia during late January and early February , contributing to the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria .
A winter heatwave over most of the inland resulted in the warmest August on record , while another heatwave in November across central and south - east Australia saw a record eight consecutive days of maximum temperatures in Adelaide .
" These broke records by large margins over large areas .
Very , very extreme events , " Dr Jones said .
" To get one of them in a year would have been unusual .
To get three is just really quite remarkable . "
Dr Jones says overall temperatures in the south - east were above average .
" It turns out the Murray - Darling Basin , South Australia and New South Wales all recorded their warmest years on record , " he said .
" But of course if you look at absolute temperatures some very notable numbers appeared .
" We saw a 48.8C during February in Victoria on Black Saturday and also some very high temperatures in South Australia and WA [ Western Australia ] with many numbers close to 49 , 48 degrees . "
Dr Jones says some areas of the country are being affected more than others .
" What we are finding for Australia is that the inland areas are warming most quickly as the planet heats up , " he said .
" So areas such as western New South Wales , northern South Australia and so on are tending to warm about twice as fast as some of the coastal regions . "
Rainfall and drought
The overall Australian mean rainfall total for 2009 ( based on preliminary data ) was 453 millimetres , slightly below the long - term average .
Dry conditions continued in the south - east and south - west of the country .
There were several short - term floods in eastern parts - most notably in May when record rain fell in parts of Queensland and New South Wales .
The year ended with further flooding in parts of New South Wales and Queensland .
Dr Jones says there appears to be no correlation between the higher temperatures and rainfall .
" This is n't natural variability .
In the past when we had droughts we tend to have warm temperatures and vice versa , " he said .
" Australia as a whole has been getting warmer for about 50 - 60 years and it 's actually been tending to get wetter .
" You see this paradox - the country , particularly in the north , it 's getting wetter but is also warming up . "

Final Thoughts
In a recent TweakTown Poll you chose solid state drives as the second most exciting type of product that has hit the market .
There is no doubt that SSDs have gained a lot of market share with enthusiasts and even mainstream notebook users , and 2010 is going to be a big year for the technology .
As SSDs continue to gain popularity , the questions about how to properly set them up have become more frequent .
To make matters worse , there have been so many sources of bad information published on the web .
Even worse , a few companies have sold software that " Enables up to 50 times extra performance from your SSD " .
When tested , the software actually slowed down disk performance .
Today we are going to cut through all of the hype and discuss proven methods that will allow you to get the most out of your high performance desktop or notebook .
We have a lot to cover today , so let 's get started .
We have reviewed a lot of solid state drives over the last two years and more are already on the way for 2010 .
In this section we are going to talk about some of the specific controllers that are found in modern SSDs and a few that will be ready in the near future .
There are a couple of buzz words that you should become familiar with before we get started on the controllers .
TRIM Command : Windows 7 is the first mainstream operating system that supports TRIM .
TRIM allows the OS to pass this deleted file information down to the SSD controller , which otherwise would not know it could trash those blocks .
At this time RAID controllers are not able to pass the TRIM command down to individual drives .
Garbage Collection : GC refers to automatically reclaiming space left occupied by deleted files .
Unlike TRIM , GC is run on the solid state drive and does n't need special commands from the operating system .
When using drives in RAID arrays , you will need automatic garbage collection to keep your drives performance from becoming smothered .
Intel X25 - M - Intel 's mainstream solid state drive is considered the fastest on the market at this time .
The second generation product usually referred to as Gen 2 or " The Silver One " , added support for Window 7's TRIM command in single disk configurations .
The down side to Intel 's current SSD lineup is their capacity .
At this time you can only purchase second generation drives in either 80 or 160 GB capacities .
The 80 GB model can be easily found for 280 USD or less , but many notebook users are not comfortable only having 80 GB of space .
This is n't much of an issue with desktops since multiple drives are possible .
The 160 GB drive costs around 530 USD and is out of the reach of most enthusiasts .
Indilinx Barefoot - Every manufacturer of Barefoot controlled drives has released TRIM enabled firmware .
A few of the models were sold with firmware that made updating on the drives impossible without sending them back to the manufacturer , but those drives should already be off of the shelves .
Updating firmware on newer models is similar to flashing the firmware on a motherboard and Indilinx as well as their partners manufacturing the drives have done a fairly good job of keeping end users in the loop as to what is in development and getting the new updates in users hands .
Barefoot controlled drives are best used in single drive form , but we are starting to see GC enabled on more products other than those from OCZ .
These drives offer a great price vs. performance vs. capacity ratio .
The majority of the consumer class drives released today use Indilinx Barefoot controllers .
Indilinx Barefoot ECO -
To date only G.Skill has released a drive that uses the new ECO revision of the Barefoot controller , the Falcon II .
The ECO is able to use new , smaller 3Xnm flash memory that is cheaper to manufacturer .
Since the cost to build is lower , the G.Skill Falcon II costs less than most other Barefoot drives when you can find them in stock .
These drives are in high demand due to their lower cost and finding one is a bit of a challenge .
Indilinx Jetstream - Indlinx 's upcoming SATA 6G controllers are currently set to be released late Q1 or early Q2 2010 .
Jetstream will offer SATA 6G capability , but other than that we do n't have many details .
SandForce 1200 / 1500 - SandForce will have a pair of new controllers on the market as early as February 2010 .
We have already tested two 1500 enterprise models , the RunCore Pro IV and OCZ Vertex 2 Pro. Both drives are amazingly fast , but they will also be expensive due to their 16 channel controller .
The SandForce 1200 uses an 8 channel controller , four more than Indilinx 's Barefoot and should be very fast also .
Both the 1200 and 1500 are based on SATA 3G technologies , but the controller is fast enough to " fill " in the difference .
Please read the SandForce article we 'll be publishing within the next few days that covers all aspects of the 1200 and 1500 .
Marvell - Another upcoming controller comes from Marvell .
We have already saw benchmarks that leaked when SATA 6G motherboards were launched .
No word on pricing or how well it competes with other drives since the only benchmarks leaked were synthetic .
Still , 300 + MB/s HD
Tach screenshots on a 30 GB drive puts out a powerful message .
To even get to those kind of numbers , you first much have SATA 6G .
The Crucial RealSSD C300 is set to release in March and uses the Marvell SATA 6G controller .
If you are starting off with a new , fresh drive then you can skip this step all together .
To get a used SSD back to a new state , you need to use software that cleans the drive .
There are several pieces of software that do this and the practice has been used for many years .
One of the more common is called AS Clean and you can find it here
To get the best user experience possible , you will want to run Windows 7 for your operating system .
Windows 7 is the only Microsoft consumer operating system to support TRIM and in my opinion is a quantum leap ahead of Vista .
A nice feature with Windows 7 is its ability to detect solid state drives when being installed .
To make everything nice and easy , build your computer but only install the SSD that is going to run your OS .
Before you break out that OS DVD , go ahead and setup your BIOS .
While you 're there , set the SATA II ports to AHCI and verify that your SSD is installed on the lowest numbered SATA port .
Some motherboards will show it as Port 0 and others will have it as Port 1 .
When you install Win 7 it will ask you to create a partition .
You are cleared to do so since the OS will automatically align the sectors on the drive , something that needed to be done manually on XP .
After your partition has been made , finish with the operating system install but do n't load any drivers for the motherboards SATA ports just yet . :
Intel has recently released a new driver that allows Windows 7's TRIM instructions to be passed through the Southbridge .
The new driver is labeled " Rapid Storage Technology 9.6 " and it can be found here .
These drivers are also able to pass TRIM commands to RAID 0 and RAID 1 arrays .
My early testing with the new RST 9.6 driver shows that the drive is much faster than the Microsoft Windows 7 AHCI driver whilst also being just as stable .
Testing has also shown a significant performance increase in many real world tests with a significant boost in the 4 K range .
At this time there are some issues with drivers .
Assuming you are running an Intel chipset since that is what all of the cool kids are doing these days , you do not want to install the Intel SATA drivers or Matrix Storage Manager .
Microsoft has the only driver that can pass TRIM commands through the SATA ports to the drive .
The Microsoft driver does not work with all SATA controllers , but the Intel ICH SATA driver from Microsoft does .
This driver is built into Windows 7 so you are already running the right driver .
In time Intel will update their drivers , but we really have no idea when .
At this point you are clear to install the rest of your drivers .
Do n't forget the Intel Chipset driver ; it does n't overwrite the SATA drivers .
Luckily for us Windows 7 detects the presence of SSDs on installation and makes a couple of tweaks right from the start .
After that you can choose to do things the easy way and get a nice performance boost while being safe , or you can go balls to the wall and get " overclocker " level performance .
Let 's start out with the basics .
With all the advice online for SSD hard drives , it can take hours of research and fiddling to properly setup your SSD drive .
Now , with this little app you can tweak Windows 2K / XP / Vista & 7 including x64 in just seconds . -
Supports Vista & 7 UACLet 's you Tweak the following : Windows Indexing ServiceSystem RestoreWindows DefragUse Large System CacheNTFS Memory UsageDisable 8.3 FilenamesDisable Date StampingDisable Boot TracingWindows PrefetcherWindows Vista SuperfetchDownload and more information here I really like SSD Tweak Utility because it allows us to make the most common tweaks very quickly .
Let 's have a look at the software .
The main page is filled with your most common settings .
Some of the Windows services can't be controlled with a simple checkbox in the software , but SSD Tweak Utility has an area where you can click on Defrag and System Restore .
Once clicked the software will take you to where you need to be to turn those services off .
The Advanced Settings area in the software is where you will find some of the uncommon tweaks .
Here you can decide if you would like to disable these features easily with just one click each .
Some of the more advanced steps can allow you to reach very impressive performance levels , but come with a penalty of some sort .
A good example is the second one on the list , Power Plan Settings .
On a desktop you do n't have to worry about battery life , but change your power plan on a notebook and you could see your battery life cut to less than half of what you are normally accustomed to .
Let 's start the advanced stuff by making everything easier to get to .
Microsoft made a handy little piece of code in Windows 7 that makes getting to all of your settings much easier ; it is called God Mode .
Copy the following text :
Make a new folder on your desktop , then paste the text so it names your folder the above .
Click somewhere else so the folder accepts the name .
Your icon will change and your folder will become a button that will get you into the settings easier .
You should now be able to get to almost all , if not all of the settings inside Windows 7 through this location .
Windows Vista and Windows 7 both allow you to fine tune your power options .
I do n't recommend running a notebook on the High Performance setting , but for desktop users looking to get the most out of their new SSD , it is a must .
Once you have changed your setting to High Performance , go into the options under Hard Disk and select NEVER turn the drives off .
This will allow your SSDs garbage collection to run even when you are logged off of the system .
You can gain a nice performance boost by checking both of these boxes , but you also run the risk of losing data if power is lost while the computer is operating .
Having Windows 7 index your platter based drives gives you a boost in search performance , but since SSDs have such low access time , the feature is not needed to have speedy searches .
If you are performing tweaks at this level then you should already know how to get to such places as Services and the Registry .
To keep the pretenders at bay , we will not go into great detail about how to get to these areas .
Platter drives need to be defragmented around once a week , but solid state drives keep files organized in house .
Windows 7 should automatically disable this feature when it detected your SSD , but you should verify that the service is not running .
You can find this setting in the Services area .
If you are not using your machine for system critical applications and can afford to " lose it all " in the blink of an eye , you can disable System Restore to gain both performance and drive capacity .
Superfetch is designed to cache files used often , but with the low access times of SSDs this option can be disabled .
You may find that slower SSDs will actually benefit with this option enabled after a few weeks of use .
Feel free to enable this feature if you find your system starting to run slower .
You can find this setting in the Services area .
Prefetch loads pieces of program files into RAM and is one of the new tricks Microsoft has used to make Windows 7 seem faster to users .
By disabling this feature you will free up system RAM and allow your SSD to run like it was meant to .
Getting to Prefetch requires experience with Regedit.exe .
Once you are in the register follow this path : Find Enable Prefetcher , right click on the right pane then choose modify .
Change the value from 3 to 0 , hit OK .
Once completed and you have backed out of the registry , you must restart your PC for the changes to take effect .
Modern solid state drives breathe new life into aging computers and allow systems built from top shelf components to run even faster than what was once thought impossible .
The slowest part of any computer is the storage subsystem and that is true with the fastest solid state drives .
By raising the performance of your weakest link , you allow all other parts of your system to run at their highest potential .
Enthusiasts for years have run expensive RAID arrays using enterprise SCSI and later SAS hard drives to achieve a high level of performance .
Today you can spend as little as 200 USD to bring home a 64GB Indilinx Barefoot solid state drive that is easily matching the same level of " smoothness " as what was once only found while running enterprise class hardware on the desktop .
Microsoft has done a very good job tuning Windows 7 for the performance profile of SSDs , but as is always the case with Microsoft , it is possible to make things even better .
The tweaks we have shown you today will allow you to build upon what Microsoft has achieved and take the performance to the next level .
With any advanced system level tweaks , always keep in mind the trade that you are about to make when enable or disabling a function .
These features were built into the operating system for a reason and most users should keep many of the options at their default state .
That said , if you are looking to pull every last drop of performance out of your system , then take it slow and have fun tweaking !
( CNN ) --
Hers is the book title that 's been heard around the single women 's world .
It 's made 30 - and 40 - somethings gasp , stomp their feet in defiance and mutter , " How could she ? "
Lori Gottlieb 's " Marry Him : The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough , " which first appeared a couple years ago as an essay in the Atlantic , has touched a nerve .
A big one , it seems .
It 's fired up bloggers and set off a barrage of e-mail exchanges shared by women .
But the 43 - year - old author , a single mother by choice , feels a bit misunderstood by those who say they are outraged .
" The firestorm is with women who literally say on their blogs , ' I have n't read the book and have no desire to , but here 's what I think about it , ' " Gottlieb said .
" You 're reviewing a book you 've never seen , but you hate it ? "
CNN reached out to Gottlieb to talk about the hubbub surrounding her best - selling new book , why the word " settling " should n't give women hives and when impersonating Austin Powers on a date becomes a problem .
Here is an excerpt from that interview .
CNN : What is it , in your mind , about the book and its message that got some women so worked up ?
Gottlieb : I think it comes from the title .
The title is used to really get women to think about what settling means .
There 's a survey in the book where men and women are asked , " If you got 80 percent of everything you wanted -- of your ideal traits in a mate or partner -- would you be happy ? "
The majority of women said , " No , that 's settling , " and the majority of men said , " Eighty percent ?
I 'd be thrilled ; that 's a catch . "
So the question is :
Is getting less than everything we want truly settling ?
And more important , semantics aside :
Is getting anything less than everything we want going to make us less happy ?
The answer is no , and it probably will make you more happy .
CNN : What about the term " Mr. Good Enough " ?
Gottlieb : We 're all Mr. or Ms. Good Enough , until you fall in love with the person who sees you and recognizes you as the right person for them .
In our culture , good enough is not good enough .
They think that it means lowering your expectations and lowering your standards .
There 's a difference between lowering your expectations and lowering your standards .
Lowering your expectations is saying , " be realistic . "
If you just put us all in a dating lineup , we 're not going to get perfect ratings from the world at large .
We should lower our expectations in the sense of , we have to realize nobody is perfect .
If you have unrealistic expectations , it 's going to be hard to find a real human being who can meet them .
But lowering our standards ?
No .
CNN : What is it about women , based on the survey you mentioned , that makes us think getting only 80 percent of what we want is settling ?
Gottlieb :
It has to do with this idea that we should have it all .
We misinterpret what that means .
Nobody said having it all was finding perfection .
Nobody really has it all , but I think having what will make you happy is probably a much better way to approach life -- not just dating , but life .
In fact , in the research it shows that people who have this have - it - all attitude are depressed .
CNN : What can women learn from men when it comes to how they approach dating ?
Gottlieb :
There are a lot of picky men out there , so this is n't about all men and all women , but I did talk to hundreds of men and women , single and married , for this book , in addition to the researchers and scientists .
Talking to men was eye - opening .
Men and women were asked , if they [ had ] any deal - breakers for going on a second date , what would those be ?
And men named three .
If she 's cute enough ... warm and kind ... and interesting enough to talk to , she gets a second date .
Men are not going , " Am I going to marry her ? "
Men are like , " Do I want to spend another two hours with her ? "
CNN : How did women respond ?
Gottlieb : Women named 300 things that would be deal - breakers for a second date .
We 're talking a second date , another two hours with the person .
And they were things like , " You know , we were having a really good time , but then he did this Austin Powers impression , and it just so turned me off .
I can't get that out of my head . "
Well , if she goes on a second date with him , and he starts doing Austin Powers impressions , then dump Mr. Austin Powers guy .
Do n't go on that third date .
Absolutely not .
Who wants that ?
That 's annoying .
But the thing is , there 's no correlation between the guy who 's the nervous first dater ... and the guy who 's going to be the great life partner that you 're going to fall in love with .
The smooth , charming guy who sweeps you off your feet on that first date , there 's not saying he 's going to be a better life partner than the other guy .
CNN : Why do women do this ?
Gottlieb : Women are really good story - tellers , and they want to know how the story 's going to end .
And so they want to know pretty early on , on that first date , is this going to lead anywhere ?
Is this a guy who I could see myself in a relationship with ?
And if Austin Powers is n't on their mental checklist of what their guy is supposed to be like , they 're out of there .
CNN : What have you been guilty of doing ?
Gottlieb : Well , I 'll tell you [ laughing ] , the guy that I ended up dating in the book is a guy who I would n't have even e-mailed on Match.com because he was 5 - foot - 6 .
Now , I 'm 5 - foot - 1 and change , but I always liked guys who were like 5 - foot - 9 or 6 feet , and I just thought , " I 'm not going to be attracted to a guy who 's 5 - foot - 6 .
Why waste our time ? "
And then he said his profession was real estate , and I thought , " I 'm a writer .
I need someone creative . "
And then he was wearing a bow tie in the picture , and I was like , " What kind of dork wears a bow tie ? "
But I really liked what he wrote .
I liked his overall vibe .
So I ended up e-mailing him , which I never would have done pre-book , by the way .
I finally realized that clearly , what I was doing was n't working .
CNN : And , how was he ?
Gottlieb :
That 's the guy who became my boyfriend [ in the book ] .
And the bow tie thing ended up being an adorable story about him and his grandfather that made me like him even more .
And the first time I saw him , I thought he was so cute .
And the real estate thing , it turns out that he had gone to architecture school , and he designed and renovated buildings and was extremely creative , way more creative than I am .
We make these assumptions about people , these snap assumptions , and they 're often wrong .
So we 're preventing ourselves from actually seeing who we might fall in love with .
CNN : What did you learn to help yourself in writing this book ?
Gottlieb : I do n't want to give away the ending of the book , but it allowed me to realize that there are lots of different kinds of people I could fall in love with .
...
I 've been kind of sabotaging myself , intellectualizing myself out of meeting people .
I 've made it so much harder for myself than it ever has to be .
There are qualities about all of us that make us less than appealing .
...
A lot of us have trouble differentiating between the overall appeal versus the specific things that may not be so appealing .
Do n't stop looking for Mr. Right , but look for the right Mr. Right .
Look for the Mr. Right who 's actually going to make you happy versus the guy who fits some fantasy that you have in your head .
CNN : How can we avoid being frustrated by the men our age who only seem interested in women who are younger ?
Gottlieb :
The men who want to date a 38 - year - old are going to be very different from the men who want to date a 31 - year - old .
And that does n't mean that I 'm horrible and anti-feminist because I said that .
I did n't make up the rules of how the world works .
I think [ the rules ] suck , actually , but the fact is , this is how it works , and here 's why .
When you talk to men , they 're saying , " I do n't want to date the 31 - year - old because I 'm looking for the Victoria Secret model . "
There are some like that , but most men say , " Look , I want to have a family , and I want to get married , and if I have a choice of going on a blind date -- I do n't know anything about these women yet -- with a woman who 's cute , smart , funny , interesting , has all those qualities and is fertile or somebody who is maybe not going to be fertile ...
I 'm going to go on the blind date with the woman who is 31 . "
That does n't make these guys horrible people .
If the situation was reversed , I would pick the fertile person , too .
CNN : Do you feel optimistic that Mr. Right is out there for you ?
Gottlieb : I think I 'm a lot closer to finding him now than I was doing what I was doing before .
The whole point of my showing warts and all , and grimness and all , of what it 's like the older you get is not to depress people but to say be aware .
...
It gets harder .
So if you figure out what 's important when you 're 30 versus it not sinking in until you 're 40 , you 're going to have a much easier time finding someone much closer to your ideal .
It does n't mean there 's anything wrong with these guys [ who may be divorced , have kids or carry disappointments from previous relationships ] , but it means that it 's going to look different .
Time Magazine has an interesting profile of Magnus Carlsen , the youngest chess player to achieve a number one world ranking :
Genius can appear anywhere , but the origins of Carlsen 's talent are particularly mysterious .
He hails from Norway -- a " small , poxy chess nation with almost no history of success , " as the English grand master Nigel Short sniffily describes it -- and unlike many chess prodigies who are full - time players by age 12 , Carlsen stayed in school until last year .
His father Henrik , a soft - spoken engineer , says he has spent more time urging his young son to complete his schoolwork than to play chess .
Even now , Henrik will interrupt Carlsen 's chess studies to drag him out for a family hike or museum trip .
" I still have to pinch my arm , " Henrik says .
" This certainly is not what we had in mind for Magnus . "
Even pro chess players -- a population inured to demonstrations of extraordinary intellect -- have been electrified by Carlsen 's rise .
A grand master at 13 ( the third youngest in history ) and a conqueror of top players at 15 , he is often referred to as the Mozart of chess for the seeming ease of his mastery .
In September , he announced a coaching contract with Garry Kasparov , arguably the greatest player of all time , who quit chess in 2005 to pursue a political career in Russia .
" Before he is done , " Kasparov says , " Carlsen will have changed our ancient game considerably . "
One of the fascinating elements of Carlsen 's talent is that he 's learned the game by playing computer chess , matching his wits against advanced algorithms .
The end result is a prodigy who 's amassed an unprecedented amount of deliberate practice at an early age , as he's able to play multiple games on the same machine at the same time .
Computers , in other words , have accelerated the pace of his chess education .
The article then discusses Carlsen 's semi-mystical chess " intuition , " which allows the youngster to " feel for where to place the pieces " :
According to Kasparov , Carlsen has a knack for sensing the potential energy in each move , even if its ultimate effect is too far away for anyone -- even a computer -- to calculate .
In the grand - master commentary room , where chess 's clerisy gather to analyze play , the experts did not even consider several of Carlsen 's moves during his game with Kramnik until they saw them and realized they were perfect .
" It 's hard to explain , " Carlsen says .
" Sometimes a move just feels right . "
At first glance , there is something surprising about a teenager weaned on chess software extolling the wonders of intuition .
It 's as if we expect Carlsen to act like his software , to be as explicit in his strategic decisions as Deep Blue , the IBM supercomputer .
But that misses the real purpose of practice and the real genius of the human brain .
When we practice properly - and this means engaging in deliberate practice - we are n't just accumulating factual knowledge .
Instead , we 're embedding our experience into our unconscious , so that even insanely complicated calculations - and Carlsen can regularly plan twenty chess moves in advance - become mostly automatic .
This is a truism of expertise .
Although we tend to think of experts as being weighted down by information , their intelligence dependent on a vast set of facts , experts are actually profoundly intuitive .
When experts evaluate a situation , they do n't systematically compare all the available options or consciously analyze the relevant information .
Carlsen , for instance , does n't compute the probabilities of winning if he moves his rook to the left rather than the right .
Instead , experts naturally depend on the emotions generated by their experience .
Their prediction errors - all those mistakes they made in the past - have been translated into useful knowledge , which allows them to tap into a set of accurate feelings they can't begin to explain .
Neils Bohr said it best : an expert is " a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field . "
From the perspective of the brain , Bohr was absolutely right .
And this is why we should n't be surprised that a chess prodigy raised on chess computer programs would be even more intuitive than traditional grandmasters .
The software allows him to play more chess , which allows him to make more mistakes , which allows him to accumulate experience at a prodigious pace .
Have I mentioned that Eric Barker is awesome ?
Many of you should be reading his blog .
Yesterday he brought us this account , with the source paper here :
Edlund and Korn [ 2002 ] ( EK ) proposed that prostitutes are well paid and that the wage premium reflects foregone marriage market opportunities .
However , studies of street prostitution in the U.S. have revealed only modest wages and considerable risks of disease and violence , casting doubt on EK ’s premise of an unexplained wage premium .
In this paper , we present evidence from high - end prostitution , the so called escort market , a market that is , if not entirely safe , notably safer than street prostitution .
Analyzing wage information on more than 40,000 escorts in the U.S. and Canada collected from a web site , we find strong support for EK .
First , escorts in the sample earn high wages , on average $ 280 / hour .
Second , while looks decline monotonically with age , wages follow a hump - shaped pattern , with a peak in the 26 - 30 age bracket , which coincides with the most intensive marriage ages for women in the U.S.
Third , the age - wage profile is significantly flatter , and prices are lower ( 5 % ) , despite slightly better escort characteristics , in cities that rank high in terms of conferences , suggesting that servicing men in transit is associated with less stigma .
Fourth , this hump in the age - wage profile is absent among escorts for whom the marriage market penalty is lower or absent : escorts who do not provide sex and transsexuals .
Excellent , but I do find some problems in that account .
As for the fourth point , who ever said : " Do n't worry ma , she 's a sweet girl , she 's only serviced the conference trade ! " ?
Maybe , in " crossroads " cities , sexual mores are looser in some other way , as a greater supply of the free product than you will find in Topeka .
As for the third point , ca n't it simply mean that conference men ( even assuming that is indeed the relevant characteristic of the city ) get really drunk and do n't care much about the age of the woman ?
On the second point , is n't that " hump - shaped pattern " probably driven by demand rather than supply ?
If you wish to claim it is driven by supply , you need to postulate that women in the 26 - 30 bracket are mainly competing against each other , rather than say 20 - 25 year - olds .
Is that true ?

Republican Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia did n't appreciate ' the kind of rhetoric and lecturing that occurred in the State of the Union . ' | John Shinkle / POLITICO
Cantor rejects Obama 's ' lecturing '
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor says he hopes President Barack Obama will avoid during a visit Friday to a House GOP retreat in Baltimore “ the kind of rhetoric and lecturing that occurred in the State of the Union . ”
Obama told Republicans in his address Wednesday night that “ saying ‘ no ’ to everything may be good short - term politics , but it ’s not leadership ” and that they share in “ the responsibility to govern . ”
Stepping up his own efforts at bipartisanship , he said he plans “ monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership . ”

Cantor , the No. 2
House GOP leader , said he “ appreciated his offer ” but said Obama has made calls for bipartisanship before .
“ There are words and promises , and there is delivery , ” Cantor , 46 , said at his Capitol Hill office in an interview for a POLITICO video series , “ Inside Obama ’s Washington . ”
“ There ’s not been much action put behind those words over the last year .
I ’m hoping when he comes to our retreat that we ’ll hear a different President Obama and , frankly , a willingness to say , ‘ OK , I understand my agenda may not be what the majority of this country wants .
Let ’s work together . ’ ”
Republicans unanimously opposed last year ’s stimulus bill , which Cantor argues has “ failed miserably ” at job creation .
Now , he says House Republicans will oppose the new jobs bill Obama endorsed in Wednesday night ’s speech .
“ We ’ve already seen his method and the majority ’s method of trying to generate jobs — that ’s the stimulus bill that was passed last year , ” Cantor said .
“ Now we know the total is exceeding $ 800 billion .
Now the proposal is yet again another $ 150 billion before we start to think about a freeze .
But $ 150 billion spent on more government programs ? ... Come on .
There is a government that can help , and the government can also hurt . ”
Cantor claimed that the administration “ has demonstrated an arrogance in ignoring public opinion . ”
“ I felt like he was admonishing Congress and certainly lecturing Republicans , ” Cantor said , “ accusing us of being an obstructionist party , when what it is we ’re about is trying to focus on the issue , which is control the spending and let ’s go about creating an environment for jobs .
... [ The ] president says he ’s going to be open to discussion .
We ’re all about going and participating with him . ”
Cantor said congressional Democratic leaders are no better .
“ When they came back to Washington [ after the Massachusetts Senate loss ] , there were a lot of cries publicly , ‘ Oh , we need to work together , ’ ” he said .
“ Not one call from any Democratic leader .
Not one visit by any Democratic leader in the House to any of the Republican leaders . ”
Continuing his critique of the speech , Cantor said : “ There was a lot of blame game last night , and I ’m the first one to say there ’s a lot of blame to go around .
We can all accept some of it .
But , as we ’ve seen over the last several months , the people in this country are very dissatisfied with the direction that this administration is taking this country .
And what we heard last night ... was :
‘ We ’re going to continue with this agenda .
In fact , we ’re going to double - down on health care . ’ ”
Cantor said that while hosting Obama , Republicans will “ remind him again :
We ’re not voting ‘ no ’ for political expediency — we ’ve got our principles , and we ’re going to stand up and defend those . ”
In small meetings , according to Cantor , Obama is “ an affable person ” and “ somebody who is engaging , who has a clear , I think , ability to engage in intellectual discussion — there ’s no doubt about that . ”
“ But my difficulty is in the disconnect with what he is proposing with what ’s going on out there , ” Cantor said .
Cantor criticized Obama for last year ’s “ outsourcing of the legislative activity from the White House to Nancy Pelosi here in this House , ” which he said has resulted in “ a bill shift and an agenda shift way to the left and outside the mainstream of this country . ”
The plan by House Democratic leaders to engineer a series of symbolic votes taking banks and Wall Street to task “ smells a lot like politics — not governing , and not leadership , ” he said .
“ If they want , as the president did last night , to continue to vilify business , to continue to vilify banks , then that will be their course , ” Cantor added .
“ But it is inconsistent to say , ‘ We want to help small businesses .
We want to help them access credit .
And , oh , by the way , we ’re going to tax the banks . ’
I mean , it just does n’t make sense .

The kind of rhetoric and lecturing that occurred in the State of the Union last night did n’t provide that leadership and instead veered towards politics . ”
House Republicans would need to gain 40 seats in November ’s midterm elections to regain the majority — an outcome that looks like a long shot , but less impossible with each passing day .
Cantor , a founder of House Republican “ Young Guns ” ( members under 45 ) , has been working hard to recruit candidates and said “ chances are pretty darn good that we ’re going to net 40 seats - plus . ”
“ I say that because the agenda from this administration does n’t seem to be changing , ” he said .
“ The president doubled - or tripled - down on some of that last night .
And that ’s where the voters ’ ire came out in the elections we saw in Massachusetts , Virginia and New Jersey . ”
Asked the first action his caucus would take if it regained the majority , Cantor replied , “ I think that we ’re going to have to talk about jobs . ”
“ We could stand up and make sure that money is not being spent the way that it is being spent now , ” he said .
“ We can also then work to make sure that some of the health care issues that we want to see carried through are done .
Certainly , we ’ll have a much bigger seat at the table with this White House .
“ We would use that seat at the table to try and bring the discussion back towards the middle , back towards focusing on small businesses , saying we ’re not going to raise any taxes in times of unemployment , saying that we ’re going — you know what , we ’re going to bring these trade bills up because it means 250,000 jobs .
‘ C’mon , Mr. President .
You said you want to do everything we can to create jobs .
We ’ll do that .’ ...
We have the ability to bring the agenda forward in the House when we reclaim the majority .
I think the public would be there watching and listening , and yes , I think the president will listen . ”
Cantor said Republicans “ have learned the lessons of the mistakes that we had made while in the majority in this House [ until after the election of 2006 ] and are committed to fiscal discipline ” and “ a zero - tolerance on any unethical behavior . ”
“ I think we are ready and will be ready to govern , ” he said .
“ The public is in desperate need of a check and balance on this one - party rule in this town . ”
Crew got inspiration from space shuttle moments

SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : February 4 , 2010
From seeing the space shuttle ride piggyback on a 747 as a little boy to witnessing a launch for the first time , the Endeavour astronauts cherish special memories of the past as they get ready to soar Sunday morning .
Mission specialist Bob Behnken , who grew up near St. Louis , remembers the day he saw one of the space shuttles being transported across the country atop the modified Boeing 747 carrier jet .

" As a boy , my father actually drove me to Illinois to see the space shuttle riding on top of a 747 parked on a ramp at Scott Air Force Base , " Behnken recalls .
" We had a long telephoto lens that allowed us to take a nice picture and that photo is still in the family room at my parents ' house . "
" So from a boy to now , I 've known the space shuttle program .
It 's something that I grew up with and got to participate in . "
Flight engineer Steve Robinson became an astronaut 15 years ago and has flown flown on three missions so far .
But before going on his first voyage , he took in the spectator 's view of a shuttle blastoff .
" The first time I ever saw a shuttle launch was after I became an astronaut so I thought it would be probably be wise to go and watch what I 'd signed up to do and my goodness , it was almost shockingly different from what you see on TV .
I 'll never forget hearing and feeling the cracking .
The sound is almost too big for the air to handle and the light is almost too bright for your eyes to comprehend and you see this 20 - story building - sized thing leap off the ground and go shooting off into the sky .
It 's just something I did n't really expect , I guess .
And then when you 're on the inside and all that happens , there 's a whole other set of feelings and emotions and excitement , " he said .
Another part of the job is spacewalking , and Robinson has logged three excursions in his career .
" Also remember going outside for the first time and looking at the Earth with nothing between my eyeballs and the Earth except a little bit of plexiglass on the helmet .
That was just a gift .
It was just a blessing to be able to be there and see what I was seeing and no amount of description could ever convey to you what that experience was really like . "
Robinson had worked in aerodynamics at NASA 's Ames Research Center during development of the space shuttles .
Almost a quarter - century later , he was performing a spacewalk outside Discovery to remove a protruding tile gap - filler from the orbiter 's heat shield during the initial flight after the Columbia accident .

" I got to ride the space station robot arm all the way down underneath the shuttle and watch the sun come up over the horizon of the shuttle 's belly , this gentle curve of the shuttle 's belly .
As a scientist I had worked on the aerodynamic shaping of that very same belly , years and years ago , and it was a real special experience to be able to see that right up close with my own eyes . "
What 's more , Robinson had the good fortune in 1998 to fly in orbit alongside legendary astronaut John Glenn .
" Well , flying with John Glenn was almost surreal because he was a childhood hero of mine and when you 're a kid and somebody is sort of this iconic hero , you do n't really think they 're real .
You want to be just like that , so launching in Discovery on STS - 95 , he was sitting next to me and that was almost surreal .
But as it turns out , he 's a fantastic aviator , a gentleman like you 've never met and has been a friend and mentor to me ever since so that was a great experience . "
For commander George Zamka , a stark moment for him was seeing Atlantis launch in 2000 from aboard the weather reconnaissance plane buzzing around the Kennedy Space Center .
" I was with the chief of the astronaut office as he was doing the weather check for the launch of STS - 101 , and I got to watch the shuttle launch from a predawn morning .
It was dark below and to me it looked kind of like a road flare just very slowly ascending and then it broke into the light of the dawn and it was just a spectacular sight .
I could see the different colors of the plume as it went up and then I could see the solid rocket boosters tumble as they 're re-entering the atmosphere and they were strobing bits of sunlight as the sunlight caught them at different angles and that was a tremendous view , " Zamka said .

He would launch aboard Discovery in 2007 as the pilot , helping fly the mission that delivered the Harmony module to the International Space Station .
" I remember my own first ascent , how violent that was and feeling the G's through my chest and what it was like to be part of that experience .
I remember looking at the space station for the first time .
It was similar to me looking at an aircraft carrier when I was going to go land on it when I was going through flight training .
It looked very small at the time , and I thought , ' Oh , my goodness , how are we going to connect to this .
How are we going to do this trick ? ' but I remember how wonderful that was . "
Endeavour 's rookie pilot Terry Virts , poised to fly in space for the first time Sunday morning , recalls that April morning in 1981 when Columbia made the maiden voyage of the space shuttle program .
" I remember sitting on the couch watching the shuttle launch and I remember that I was anxious and I was ready for the space shuttle launch because it had been years since we had flown an American vehicle , " Virts said .
Years later , Virts got to see a shuttle heading into space from the window of his military aircraft .
" I remember one day in 1991 , I was a second lieutenant flying F - 16s out of McDill Air Force Base over the Gulf of Mexico out of Florida and we were doing an air - to - air engagement and I looked off to the east and I saw this big huge plume of smoke .
I could n't believe it and I called ‘ knock it off . '
We stopped the flight that we were in and we just looked to the east for a few minutes and watched the shuttle go up and I was amazed that hundreds of miles away I could see this from my F - 16 .
That was a really cool moment . "
The astronauts are poised to make new memories during their upcoming two - week mission that will bring the Tranquility module and cupola to the International Space Station .
The module serves a utility room for the orbiting complex , housing large refrigerator - sized racks of equipment such as the oxygen generation and air scrubbing systems , water recycling gear , the toilet and hygiene compartment , and exercise machines .
The racks are positioned throughout the station at present .
The seven - windowed cupola will become the control post for operating the station 's Canadian - made robotic arm , affording panoramic views for the astronauts .

This week ’s Video Look Book subjects are students and friends Andrea Osojnik and Meredith Cunningham .
Andrea studies prosthetics and “ gelatin works ” while Meredith studies print media and fashion .
The day we spotted them , Andrea wore a $ 16 thrift - store coat , a scarf her friend knit for her , and leather pants she says she wears every day because they ’re warm .
“ I guess I kind of look like an Amish person , ” she mused .
Meredith calls Andrea ’s androgynous look “ hot . ” See Meredith ’s tremendous pair of glasses in the video .
First , THE HYPE …
If you missed it , last week DC Comics announced a bunch of projects for 2010 .
Simultaneously , DC had the propaganda machine turned up to 11 as they had other media lined up to cover each project .
Here is a quick recap with links :
Now , THE GRIPE … with the official news out of the way it ’s time to share some of my opinions .
I apologize in advance for my negativity .
Normally I try to be upbeat and positive here at ONCE UPON A GEEK , but some of these projects get under my skin .
Do n’t get me wrong , I still love comics .
I ’m just becoming increasingly more selective as time goes on .
EARTH ONE : I wo n’t be buying them .
I do n’t mind stories being told about iconic characters using the “ classic ” trappings ( i.e. Lois , Daily Planet , Jimmy Olsen , Alfred , Commissioner Gordon , etc ) as was done with All - Star Superman , but to go out of your way to create a new independent continuity is bothersome to this old school fan .
I understand the hope is to allow new fans to get in on the ground floor .
Perhaps that will work , but I feel its just DC ’s attempt to create a new , separate universe similar to Marvel ’s Ultimate line .
Maybe I ’m in the minority , but I ’ve always felt the clock is ticking on the Ultimate universe anyway .
It ’s just a matter of time until all the series are canceled and it becomes a memory ( i.e. Marvel ’s New Universe , Marvel ’s M2 , Marvel ’s 2009 , etc ) .
On a positive note , I will say that I find DC ’s efforts to publish original graphic novels rather than monthly comics very interesting .
This is a HUGE change for DC .
Maybe they see the future coming and are trying to make a new model work for them .
Good idea to try this now .
Finally , given that Johns and JMS are writing the stories , they will probably be very good .
I just refuse to get sucked into a separate continuity ; I spend enough money on the current continuity .
It also makes me wonder how the Superman titles in the prime DC universe will hold up without Johns involvement .

BATMAN : RETURN OF BRUCE WAYNE : I wo n’t be buying this .
Bruce Wayne is time traveling his way back to the present ?
Did n’t Captain America just do the same thing ?
Seems poor planning for DC to announce this series after Marvel already plowed this road so recently with Cap .
I ’m sure the story will be different and interesting , but it ’s just too much of a coincidence for fans to ignore .
Also , given how much of a promotional push DC gave Dick Grayson as the new Batman and the reorganized Bat - family , it seems unfair for Bruce to come back so soon .
Poor Dick Grayson , always a Bride ’s Maid …

THE RISE OF ARSENAL and THE FALL OF GREEN ARROW : I ’m considering picking these up .
While I ’m not thrilled with all the inconsistencies in Justice League : Cry for Justice ( do n’t get me started on Firestorm in that book ) , these aftermath books sound good .
Also , J.T. Krul is GREAT !
I ’ve enjoyed everything I ’ve read of his ( all Titans related ) .
I dropped Green Arrow back when Judd Winick was writing it .
I ’ve been looking for a good reason to come back to the character .
This just might be it .

LEGACIES , HISTORY OF THE DC UNIVERSE , and WHO ’S WHO : I ’m DEFINITELY in for a new Who ’s Who !
Without Who ’s
Who all these years , I ’ve been devouring the Secret Files comics and the DC Encyclopedia ( both editions ) .
I about flipped when I heard a new Who ’s Who was coming !
Hooray !
I ’m on the fence about Legacies .
I ’ll probably give it three issues to see if it grabs me .
There is n’t enough information about The History of the DC Universe book to make an informed decision yet .

WONDER WOMAN #600 : Good for her and good for her fans !
Way to go Wonder Woman .
You deserve a numbering that ’s up there with Action Comics and Detective Comics .
With all that said , I do have to admit I ’m impressed with DC Comics PR folks right now .
They are doing an impressive job getting the word out on their new books .
So now that I ’ve mouthed off … what do you all think of these upcoming projects ?
According to USA Today , most Americans support the federal government 's move to place body scanners in the nation 's airports .
I 'm always skeptical of polls since polling is a very inexact science and depends on the phrasing of the questions .
Perhaps the results would have been different if the poll had asked these questions :
The government cannot protect you .
It is not interested in protecting you .
Schemes like body scanners are not designed to make you safer .
They are designed to make you feel safer and to convince you that the government is doing something .
The National Weather Service has issued a tornado warning for the South Los Angeles , Long Beach and Whittier areas as a powerful new storm moves ashore .
The warning is expected to be in place for at least 45 minutes .
Radar shows heavy rain falling in Long Beach , with the storm moving in at 35 mph to the northeast .
There were also reports of thunder and lightning across the region .
Forecasters said the storm was capable of producing a tornado , but there was no evidence at this time that any tornadoes have developed on land .
[ Updated at 1:03 p.m. : The tornado warning was extended to Orange County .
In Seal Beach , officials were urging people to get off the beach .
In San Pedro , the Los Angeles Fire Department reported major street flooding in areas near the harbor and ocean .
In East Long Beach , flood waters rose above some streets and were filling the grass areas in front of some homes .
There were reports of power outages , though exactly how widespread they were is not clear .
The Orange County Sheriff 's Department is checking a report that a car driving on Pacific Coast Highway might have been damaged by the storm , but officials have not confirmed this .
Huntington Beach lifeguards said no waterspouts -- or offshore tornadoes -- have been spotted .
The beaches were mostly empty while waves surged , lightning struck and wind reached gusts of 52 miles per hour , said Huntington Beach Marine Safety Lt. Mike Beuerlein .
Newport Beach was seeing wind gusts of over 72 miles per hour and has closed jetties due to high surf , but has seen no tornadoes or waterspouts , said Jennifer Schulz of the Newport Beach Fire Dept . ]
Piers along the Southern California coast were being closed today as huge waves surged onto beaches and harbors with a rainstorm that is expected to bring wind , thunder and lightning .
Ventura police closed the city 's nearly 2,000 - foot wooden pier this morning as a precaution ; no damage was reported .
But huge waves crashed near beachfront homes .
" We 're expecting some pretty big surf , " said Sgt. Jack Richards .

Trickle : A Userland Bandwidth Shaper for Unix - like Systems Marius A. Eriksen1
Google , Inc .
mae@google.com
Abstract
As with any finite resource , it is often necessary to apply policies to the shared usage of network resources .
Existing solutions typically implement this by employing traffic management in edge routers .
However , users of smaller networks regularly find themselves in need of nothing more than ad - hoc rate limiting .
Such networks are typically unmanaged , with no network administrator (s ) to manage complicated traffic management schemes .
Trickle bridges this gap by providing a simple and portable solution to rate limit the TCP connections of a given process or group of processes .
Trickle takes advantage of the Unix dynamic loader 's preloading functionality to interposition itself in front of the BSD socket API provided by the system 's libc .
Running entirely in user space , shapes network traffic by delaying and truncating socket I / Os without requiring administrator privileges .
Instances of Trickle can cooperate , even across networks allowing for the specification of global rate limiting policies .
Due to the prevalence of BSD sockets and dynamic loaders , Trickle enjoys the benefit of portability accross a multitude of Unix - like platforms .
1 Introduction Bandwidth shaping is traditionally employed monolithically as part of network infrastructure or in the local operating system kernel which works well for providing traffic management to large networks .
Such solutions typically require dedicated administration and privileged access levels to network routers or the local operating system .
Unmanaged network environments without any set bandwidth usage policies ( for example home and small office networks ) typically do not necessitate mandatory traffic management .
More likely , the need for bandwidth shaping is largely ad - hoc , to be employed when and where it is needed .
For example , bulk transfers may adversely impact an interactive session and the two should receive differentiated services , or
bulk transfers may need to be prioritized .
Furthermore , such users may not have administrative access to their operating system (s ) or network infrastructure in order to apply traditional bandwidth shaping techniques .
Some operating systems provide the ability to shape traffic of local origin ( these are usually extensions to the router functionality provided by the OS ) .
This functionality is usually embedded directly in the network stack and resides in the operating system kernel .
Network traffic is not associated with the local processes responsible for generating the traffic .
Rather , other criteria such as IP , TCP or UDP protocols and destination IP addresses are used in classifying network traffic for shaping .
These policies are typically global to the host ( thus applying to all users on it ) .
Since these policies are mandatory and global , it is the task of the system administrator to manage the traffic policies .
These are the many burdens that become evident if one would like to employ bandwidth shaping in an ad - hoc manner .
While there have been a few attempts to add voluntary bandwidth shaping capabilities to the aforementioned in - kernel shapers [ 25 ] , there is still a lack of a viable implementation and there is no use of collaboration between multiple hosts .
These solutions are also non-portable and there is a lack of any standard application or user interfaces .
We would like to be able to empower any unprivileged user to employ rate limiting on a case - by - case basis , without the need for special kernel support .
Trickle addresses precisely this scenario : Voluntary ad - hoc rate limiting without the use of a network wide policy .
Trickle is a portable solution to rate limiting and it runs entirely in user space .
Instances of Trickle may collaborate with each other to enforce a network wide rate limiting policy , or they may run independently .
Trickle only works properly with applications utilizing the BSD socket layer with TCP connections .
We do not feel this is a serious restriction : Recent measurements attribute TCP to be responsible for over 90 % of the volume of traffic in one major provider 's backbone [ 16 ] .
The majority of non-TCP traffic is DNS ( UDP ) - which is rarely desirable to shape anyway .
We strive to maintain a few sensible design criteria for Trickle : Semantic transparency : Trickle should never change the behavior or correctness of the process it is shaping ( Other than the data transfer rates ) .
Portability : Trickle should be extraordinarily portable , working with any Unix - like operating system that has shared library and preloading support .
Simplicity : No need for excessively expressive policies that confuse users .
Do n't add features that will be used by only 1 in 20 users .
No setup cost , a user should be able to immediately make use of Trickle after examining just the command line options ( and there should be very few command line options ) .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows : Section 2 describes the linking and preloading features of modern Unix - like systems .
Section 3 provides a high - level overview of Trickle .
Section 4 discusses the details of Trickle 's scheduler .
In section 5 we discuss related work .
Finally , section 9 concludes .
2 Linking and ( Pre ) Loading Dynamic linking and loading have been widely used in Unix - like environments for more than a decade .
Dynamic linking and loading allow an application to refer to an external symbol which does not need to be resolved to an address in memory until the runtime of the particular binary .
The canonical use of this capability has been to implement shared libraries .
Shared libraries allow an operating system to share one copy of commonly used code among any number of processes .
We refer to resolving these references to external objects as link editing , and to unresolved external symbols simply as external symbols .
After compilation , at link time , the linker specifies a list of libraries that are needed to resolve all external symbols .
This list is then embedded in the final executable file .
At load time ( before program execution ) , the link editor maps the specified libraries into memory and resolves all external symbols .
The existence of any unresolved symbols at this stage results in a run time error .
To load load its middleware into memory , Trickle uses a feature of link editors in Unix - like systems called preloading .
Preloading allows the user to specify a list of shared objects that are to be loaded together the shared libraries .
The link editor will first try to resolve symbols to the preload objects ( in order ) , thus selectively bypassing symbols provided by the shared libraries specified by the program .
Trickle uses preloading to provide an alternative version of the BSD socket API , and thus socket calls are now handled by Trickle .
This feature has been used chiefly for program and systems diagnostics ; for example , to match malloc to free calls , one would provide an alternative of these functions via a preload library that has the additional matching functionality .
In practice , this feature is used by listing the libraries to preload in an environment variable .
Preloading does not work for set -UID or set - GID binaries for security reasons :
A user could perform privilege elevation or arbitrary code execution by specifying a preload object that defines some functionality that is known to be used by the target application .
We are interested in interpositioning Trickle in between the shaped process and the socket implementation provided by the system .
Another way to look at it , is that Trickle acts as a proxy between the two .
We need some way to call the procedures Trickle is proxying .
The link editor provides this functionality through an API that allows a program to load an arbitrary shared object to resolve any symbol contained therein .
The API is very simple : Given a string representation of the symbol to resolve , a pointer to the location of that symbol is returned .
A common use of this feature is to provide plug - in functionality wherein plugins are shared objects and may be loaded and unloaded dynamically .
Figure 1 illustrates Trickle 's interpositioning .
3 How Trickle Works
We describe a generic rate limiting scheme defining a black - box scheduler .
We then look at the practical aspects of how Trickle interpositions its middleware in order to intercept socket calls .
Finally we discuss how multiple instances of Trickle collaborate to limit their aggregate bandwidth usage .
3.1 A Simple Rate Limiting Scheme A process utilizing BSD sockets may perform its own rate limiting .
For upstream limiting , the application can do this by simply limiting the rate of data that is written to a socket .
Similarly , for downstream limiting , an application may limit the rate of data it reads from a socket .
However , the reason why this works is not immediately obvious .
When the application neglects to read some data from a socket , its socket receive buffers fill up .
This in turn will cause the receiving TCP to advertise a smaller receiver window ( rwnd ) , creating back pressure on the underlying TCP connection thus limiting its data flow .
Eventually this ``trickle - down '' effect achieves end - to - end rate limiting .
Depending on buffering in all layers of the network stack , this effect may take some time to propagate .
More detail regarding the interaction between this scheme and TCP is provided in section 4 .
While this scheme is practical , two issues would hinder widespread employment .
Firstly , the scheme outlined is deceptively simple .
As we will see in section 4 , there are many details which make shaping at this level of abstraction complicated .
The second issue is that there are no standard protocols or APIs for multiple processes to collaborate .
We also argue that employing bandwidth shaping inside of an application breaks abstraction layers .
It is really the task of the operating system to apply policies to bandwidth usage , and it should not need to be a feature of the application .
Even if libraries were developed to assist application developers , employing rate limiting in this manner would still put considerable burden on the developers and it should not be expected that every developer would even support it .
The socket API provided by the OS provides certain functionality , and it should be the freedom of the application to use it unchanged , and not have to rely on semantics at the lower levels of abstraction in order to limit bandwidth usage .
There are also exceptions to these arguments .
For example , certain protocols may benefit from application level semantics to perform shaping .
Another example is that some applications may be able to instruct the sending party to limit its rate of outbound traffic [ 9 ] which is clearly preferable over relying on TCP semantics to perform traffic shaping .
Trickle provides a bandwidth shaping service without the need to modify applications .
Trickle augments the operating system by interpositioning its middleware in front of the libc socket interface .
From there , Trickle applies rate limiting to any dynamically linked binary that uses the BSD socket layer .
By providing a standard command line utility , Trickle provides a simple and consistent user interface to specify rate limiting parameters .
Communicating with the trickle daemon , allows all instances of Trickle to participate in collaborative rate limiting , even across hosts .
In addition to allowing portability , this approach offers several advantages .
There is no need for extending the kernel nor configuring such extensions ; any user may use and configure Trickle any way she wants , making it ideal for ad - hoc rate limiting .
There are also a number of advantages to this approach from the developer 's point of view .
Furthermore , being entirely contained in userland has made Trickle inherently easier to develop .
It is easier to perform experiments and the software is easier to maintain and will be understood by a wider audience .
The primary disadvantage to using this approach is that all usage of Trickle is voluntary - that is , one cannot enforce rate limiting by policy ( though some operating systems provide a mechanism for administrators to enforce preload libraries , there are still ways to get around its interpositioning ) .
For its intended usage , this is not a big drawback as ad - hoc bandwidth shaping implies users do so voluntarily .
Secondly and with smaller impact , Trickle cannot work with statically linked binaries .
3.2 The Mechanics of Library Interpositioning Figure 1 : libtrickle .so is preloaded in the application 's address space , calls to recv ( ) and send ( ) are handled by libtrickle .
so and passed down to libc .
With very rare exceptions , network software for Unix - like systems uses the socket abstraction provided by the operating system .
In reality , the socket abstraction is entirely contained in the system call layer with corresponding libc shimsA small software component used to provide an interface to another software component ( a trivial ``adapter ' ' ) .
Thus , with the use of the link editor 's preload functionality , we interposition the Trickle middleware at a convenient level of abstraction and we do so entirely in user space .
Using preload objects , we replace the BSD socket abstraction layer provided by libc .
However , to successfully interposition the Trickle middleware , we must be able to call the original version of the very interface we have replaced .
To resolve this issue , we need to take advantage of the second feature of the link editor we discussed :
We simply explicitly resolve the libc shims and call them as needed .
This is done by opening the actual object file that contains libc , and using the link - editor API to resolve the symbols needed .
The location of the libc shared object is discovered in the configuration / compilation cycle , but could just as easily be discovered dynamically at run time .
Figure 1 attempts to illustrate the mechanics of the interpositioning of the Trickle middleware .
In practice , preload objects are specified by the environment variable LD_PRELOAD .
Trickle 's command line utility , trickle , sets this environment variable to the object that contains Trickle 's middleware .
Additionally , it passes any parameters specified by the user in other environment variables in a well defined namespace .
These parameters may include upstream or downstream rates to apply , as well as whether or not this instance of Trickle should collaborate with other instances of Trickle .
3.3 The Life of a Socket New sockets are created with either the socket ( ) or accept ( ) interfaces .
An old socket is aliased with calls to dup ( ) or dup2 ( ) .
Any new or duplicated socket is marked by Trickle by keeping an internal table indexing every such socket .
File descriptors that are not marked are ignored by Trickle , and relevant calls specifying these as the file descriptor argument are simply passed through to the libc shims without any processing .
Note that it is also possible for an application to perform file descriptor passing :
An application may send an arbitrary file descriptor to another over local inter process communication ( IPC ) , and the receiving application may use that file descriptor as any other .
File descriptor passing is currently not detected by Trickle .
When a socket is closed , it is unmarked by Trickle .
We say that any marked socket is tracked by Trickle .
Two categories of socket operations are most pertinent to Trickle : Socket I/O and socket I /O multiplexing .
In the following discussion we assume that we possess a black box .
This black box has as its input a unique socket identifier ( e.g. file descriptor number ) and the direction and length of the I/O operation to be performed on the socket .
A priority for every socket may also be specified as a means to indicate the wish for differentiated service levels between them .
The black box outputs a recommendation to either delay the I/O , to truncate the length of the I/O , or a combination of the two .
We refer to this black box as the Trickle scheduler and it discussed in detail in a later section .
The operation of Trickle , then , is quite simple : Given a socket I/O operation , Trickle simply consults the scheduler and delays the operation by the time specified , and when that delay has elapsed , it reads or writes at most the number of bytes specified by the scheduler .
If the socket is marked non-blocking , the scheduler will specify the length of I/O that is immediately allowable .
Trickle will perform this ( possibly truncated ) I/O and return immediately , as to not block and violate the semantics of non-blocking sockets .
Note that BSD socket semantics allow socket I/O operations to return short counts - that is , an operation is not required to complete in its entirety and it is up to the caller to ensure all data is sent ( for example by looping or multiplexing over a calls to send ( ) and recv ( ) ) .
In practice , this means that the Trickle middleware is also allowed to return short I/O counts for socket I/O operations without affecting the semantics of the socket abstraction .
This is an essential property of the BSD socket abstraction that we use in Trickle .
Multiplexing I/O operations , namely calls to select ( ) and poll ( )
Modern operating systems have introduced new and more efficient interfaces for multiplexing .
These are discussed in section 6 are more complex .
The purpose of the I/O multiplexing interface is to , given a set of file descriptors and conditions to watch for each , notify the caller when any condition is satisfied ( e.g. file descriptor is ready for reading ) .
One or more of these file descriptors may be tracked by Trickle , so it is pertinent for Trickle to wrap these interfaces as well .
Specifically , select ( ) and poll ( ) are wrapped , these may additionally wait for a timeout event ( which is satisfied as soon as the specified timeout value has elapsed ) .
To simplify the discussion around how Trickle handles multiplexing I/O , we abstract away the particular interface used and assume that we deal only with a set of file descriptors , one or more of which may be tracked by trickle .
Also specified is a global timeout .
For every file descriptor that is in the set and tracked by Trickle , the scheduler is invoked to see if the file descriptor would be capable of I /O immediately .
If it is not , it is removed from the set and added to a holding set .
The scheduler also returns the amount of time needed for the file descriptor to become capable of I /O , the holding time .
The scheduler calculates this on the basis of previously observed I /O rates on that socket .
Trickle now recalculates the timeout to use for the multiplexing call :
This is the minimum of the set of holding times and the global timeout .
Trickle then proceeds to invoke the multiplexing call with the new set of file descriptors ( that is , the original set minus the holding set ) and the new timeout .
If the call returns because a given condition has been satisfied , Trickle returns control to the caller .
If it returns due to a timeout imposed by Trickle , the process is repeated , with the global timeout reduced by the time elapsed since the original invocation of the multiplexing call ( wrapper ) .
In practice , a shortcut is taken here , where only file descriptors from the holding set are examined , and rolled in if ready .
The process is repeated until any user specified condition is satisfied by the underlying multiplexing call .
3.4 Collaboration
We have detailed how Trickle works with a set of sockets in a single process , though more often than not it is highly practical to apply global rate limits to a set of processes that perform network I /O .
These processes do not necessarily reside a single host ; it is often useful to apply them on every process that contributes to the network traffic passing through a particular gateway router , or to use a global limit to control the utilization of the local area network .
It may also be desirable to apply individual rate limiting policies for processes or classes of processes .
Trickle solves this by running a daemon , trickled which coordinates among multiple instances of Trickle .
The user specifies to trickled the global rate limitations which apply across all instances of Trickle .
That is , the aggregate I/O rates over all processes shaped by Trickle may not exceed the global rates .
Furthermore , the user can specify a priority per instance or type of instance ( e.g. interactive applications ) , allowing her to provide differentiated network services to the various client applications .
By default , trickled listens on a BSD domain socket and accepts connections from instances of Trickle running on the local host .
These instances then request a bandwidth allocation from trickled .
The bandwidth allocation is computed using the same black box scheduler described previously .
It is used in a slightly different mode where the scheduler simply outputs the current rate the entity is assigned .
These rate allocations may change frequently , and so the instances of Trickle get updated allocations with some preset regularity .
It is worth noting that there is a simple denial of service attack should a rogue user exist on the system .
This user could simply create as many fake Trickle instances as necessary and , without actually doing any socket I /O , report data transfers to trickled .
Of course , such a user could , though using more resources to do so , also consume as much network resources as possible , in effect achieving the same result by exploiting TCP fairness .
The same model of collaboration is applied across several hosts .
Instead of listening on a Unix domain socket , trickled listens on a TCP socket , and can thus schedule network resource usage across any number of hosts .
In this scenario , rate allocation updates may start to consume a lot of local network resources , so care must be taken when setting the frequency at which updates are sent .
4 I/O Scheduling With Rate Restrictions
The problem of rate limiting in Trickle can be generalized to the following abstraction : Given a number of entities capable of transmitting or receiving data , a global rate limit must be enforced .
Furthermore , entities may have different priorities relative to each other as to differentiate their relative service levels .
In Trickle , we use this abstraction twice :
In a shaped process , a socket is represented as an entity with priority 1 .
In trickled every collaborating process is represented by an entity ( the collaborating processes may even reside on different hosts ) and every entity is assigned a priority according to a user specified policy .
When an entity is ready to perform some I/O , it must consult the scheduler .
The scheduler may then advise the entity to delay its request , to partially complete the request ( i.e. truncate the I / O operation ) , or a combination of the two .
In this capacity , the scheduler is global and coordinates the I/O allocation over all entities .
In another mode , the scheduler simply outputs the current global rate allocation for the requesting entity .
After an entity has performed an I/O operation , it notifies the Trickle scheduler with the direction ( sent or received ) and length of the I/O .
Trickle then updates a bandwidth statistics structure associated with that entity and direction of data .
This structure stores the average data throughput rate for the entire lifetime of that entity as well as a windowed average over a fixed number of bytes .
Also , an aggregate statistic covering all entities is updated .
Before an entity performs I/O , it consults the Trickle scheduler to see how much delay it must apply and how much data it is allowed to send or receive after the delay has elapsed .
Let us assume for the moment that the scheduler need only decide for how long to delay the requested I /O operation .
4.1 Distribution and allocation Every entity has an assigned number of points inversely proportional to that entity 's priority .
The global rate limit is divided by the total number of points over all entities , and this is the rate allotment per point .
If every entity performed I/O with a rate equal to its number of points multiplied by the per point allotment , the total rate over all entities would be at the rate limit and every entity would perform I/O at a rate proportional to their assigned priority .
Since Trickle is performing bandwidth shaping , most often the entities has the ability to exceed the transfer rates that they are assigned by the scheduler .
The entities only very seldomly behave in any predictable manner :
Their data transfer rates may be bursty , they may have consistent transfer rates lower than their alloted rates , or they might be idle .
At the same time , the scheduler needs to make sure that the entities in aggregate may transfer data at a rate capped only by the total rate limit :
Trickle should never hinder its client applications from fully utilizing the bandwidth allocated to them .
Statistics structures as well as limits are kept independently per-direction and thus Trickle is fully asymmetric .
Furthermore , it is worthy to note that Trickle makes scheduling decisions based on a windowed average .
Dealing with instantaneous bursts is discussed later .
4.2 Scheduling Trickle uses a simple but effective algorithm to schedule I /O requests .
It is a global scheduler that preserves every requirement outlines above .
We maintain a total , which is initialized with the total number of points alloted over all entities .
We also maintain a per-point allotment which is initially calculated as outlined above .
An entity consumes bandwidth less than its allotment if its measured ( windowed average ) consumption is less than its number of points multiplied by the per-point allotment .
For every entity that consumes bandwidth less than its allotment , we subtract from , and then add the difference between 's actual consumption and it's alloted consumption to a free pool , .
After iterating over the entities , the value of the free pool is redistributed amongst the remaining entities .
In practice , this is done by inflating the per-point allotment : .
This process is then repeated until there are either no remaining entities that have more allotment than their consumption or all remaining entities have more allotment than their consumption .
This is the stable state .
We call the final allotment of each entity after this process the adjusted allotment .
After the adjustment process , if the entity being scheduled is currently consuming bandwidth at a rate less than its adjusted allotment , Trickle allows the operation to proceed immediately .
If not , it requests the entity to delay the operation by the time it would take to send the requested number of bytes at the adjusted rate .
Figure 2 : Measuring a windowed - average bandwidth consumption of two bulk transfers with differentiated service .
Trickle was configured with a global limit of 10 kB / s. Figure 2 shows bandwidth consumption at the receiving end of two bulk transfers shaped collaboratively by Trickle , one having a lower priority .
The aggregate bandwidth consumption ( i.e. the sum of the two ) is also shown .
Trickle was configured with a global receive limit of 10 kB / s .
The lower priority transfer has an average transfer rate of 3,984 bytes / second with a standard deviation of 180 bytes / second .
The higher priority transfer averages at 5,952 bytes / sec with a standard deviation of 455 bytes / second .
Figure 3 : Measuring a windowed - average bandwidth consumption at the receiving end , this plot shows the effects of smoothing in Trickle .
4.3 Smoothing Figure 4 : When dealing with large I/O operations , smoothing helps amortize bandwidth consumption .
This naïve approach of delaying I / O operations tends to result in very bursty network behavior since we are blocking an I / O of any length for some time , and then letting it complete in full .
As expected , this behavior is especially prevalent when operations are large .
In the short term , burstiness may even result in over shaping as network conditions are changing , and the scheduler might have been able allocate more I/O to the stream in question .
Figure 4 shows the extremity of this effect , where operations are large and rate limiting very aggressive .
The length of an I/ O may also be unpredictable , especially in applications with network traffic driven by user input ( e.g. interactive login sessions or games ) .
Such applications are naturally bursty and it would be advantageous for Trickle to dampen these bursts .
Note that even if Trickle considered instantaneous bandwidth consumption in addition to the windowed average as netbrake [ 5 ] does , bursty behavior would still be present in many applications .
When shaping is based on both instantaneous and average bandwidths , it is the hope that the buffers underneath the application layer will provide dampening .
For I / Os ( keep in mind that applications are allowed to make arbitrarily large I /O requests to the socket layer ) with lengths approaching and exceeding the bandwidth delay product , buffering provides little dampening .
Thus , we introduce techniques to smooth these bursts .
The techniques we introduce are generic and apply equally to both instantaneous and TCP burstiness .
Our technique makes use of two parameters to normalize traffic transmitted or received by the socket layer .
In the following discussion , we use the variable to indicate the value of a point after scheduling , is the number of points allocated to the entity in question and refers to the ( original ) length of the I/O being scheduled .
We first introduce a time smoothing parameter .
We set the delay imposed on a socket to the minimum of the time smoothing parameter and the delay requested ( by the process outlined in the previous subsection ) .
If the time smoothing delay is the smaller of the two , the length is truncated so that the entity meets its adjusted rate allotment .
This is called the adjusted length : .
The purpose of the time smoothing parameter is to introduce a certain continuity in the data transfer .
We must be able to handle the case where the adjusted length is 0 .
That is , the time smoothing parameter is too small to send even one byte .
To mitigate this situation , we introduce a length smoothing parameter .
When the adjusted length is 0 , we simply set the length to the length smoothing parameter , and adjust the delay accordingly : .
The effect of smoothing is illustrated in figure 3 .
Here , Iperf [ 27 ] , a network measurement tool , was run for 60 seconds .
The source node was rate limited with Trickle , which was configured to rate limit at 80 KB/s .
The thin line indicates the resulting Iperf behavior without any smoothing applied .
The thick line applies a time smoothing parameter of 500 ms .
The transfer rates shown are instantaneous with a sampling rate once per second .
In practice , the scheduler deployed as follows :
In a single Trickle instance , the entities are sockets , all with priority 1 and the global limit is either user specified or by trickled .
trickled again uses the same scheduler :
Here the entities are the instances of Trickle , and the global limit is specified by the user .
Note that in this case , the scheduler does not need to apply delay or smoothing , it simply needs to report back to each instance of Trickle what its allotment is at that point in time .
4.4 Streams vs. Packets
One big difference between Trickle and in - kernel rate limiters is that Trickle only has access to much higher levels of the OSI layers .
The only context available to Trickle are BSD sockets , while in - kernel rate limiters typically schedule discrete packets and reside in or around the network layer .
Trickle can only provide bandwidth shaping by delaying and truncating I/O on a socket ( e.g. TCP / IP stream ) , and must rely on the underlying semantics in order to be effective .
Furthermore , Trickle is affected by local buffering in every OSI [ 24 ] layer , and this effectively reduces the best reaction time Trickle can provide .
Together , these conditions severely reduces the granularity at which Trickle can operate .
Since in - kernel rate limiters reside so low in the network stack , they may exercise complete control of the actual outgoing date rates .
These rate limiters typically provide ingress rate limiting by a technique called ``policing '' .
Policing amounts to simply dropping matching incoming packets even though there is no real local contention that would otherwise prevent them from being delivered .
Note that policing is a different strategy for shaping incoming traffic .
When a policing router drops a packet , it creates congestion in the view of the sending TCP as it will need to retransmit the lost packet ( s ) .
When detecting congestion , the sending TCP will reduce its congestion window , effectively throttling its rate of transmission .
After shrinking its congestion window , the sending TCP has to expand its congestion window again by the slow start and congestion avoidance strategies .
Trickle 's approach avoids artificial congestion by shrinking the advertised TCP receiver window ( rwnd ) , causing the sending TCP to artificially limit the amount of data it can send .
One advantage of this technique is that policing makes TCP more volatile in a somewhat subtle way .
In its steady - state , TCP is self - clocking , that is , it tries to inject a packet into the network for every packet that leaves the network .
Thus , as networks get more congested , router queues fill up and round trip times ( RTTs ) increase , and thus the sending TCP slows its transmission rate .
When policing , packets are dropped indiscriminately , and TCP has no chance to avoid the congestion by observing increasing RTTs .
This results in a more volatile TCP state as the sending TCP will have to enter fast retransmit / recovery mode more frequently .
4.5 The Interactions of Delay , Smoothing and TCP To recapitulate , Trickle shapes network traffic by delaying and truncating I/O requests according to a few simple parameters .
Trickle attempts to reduce burstiness by smoothing , which in effect introduces some time and length normalization for the emitted I /O operations .
We now explore how our shaping techniques interact with TCP .
For ingress traffic , this should result in a less volatile rwnd in the receiving TCP since the utilization of socket receive buffers have smaller variance .
Smoothing is also beneficial for the transmitting TCP .
Because the data flow from the application layer is less bursty , the TCP does not have to deal with long idle times which may reduce responsiveness :
It is standard practice to reduce the congestion window ( cwnd ) and perform slow start upon TCP idleness beyond one retransmission timeout ( RTO ) [ 20 ] .
Smoothing may also be used for adapting to interactive network protocols .
For example , a smaller time smoothing parameter should cause data to be sent in a more continuous and consistent manner , whereas the lack of smoothing would likely cause awkward pauses in user interactions .
Another tradeoff made when smoothing is that you are likely to loose some accuracy because of timing .
When using timers in userland , the value used is the floor of the actual timeout you will get , and thus when sleeping on a timer just once for some I/O , the inaccuracy is amortized over the entirety of that I/O .
However , smoothing is likely to break this I / O up into many smaller I / Os , and the timer inaccuracies may be more pronounced .
The ultimate compromise here would be to use the effects of buffering whenever you can , and to use smoothing whenever you have to .
This is left for future work .
5 Related Work
There are a number of generic rate limiting software solutions and one is included in nearly every major open source operating system .
These operate in a mostly traditional manner ( defining discrete packet queues and applying policies on these queues ) .
What differentiates these utilities are what operating system (s ) they run on and how expressive their policies are .
Examples are AltQ [ 14 ] , Netnice [ 21 ] , Dummynet [ 23 ] and Netfilter [ 26 ] .
Several network client and server applications incorporate rate limiting as a feature .
For example , OpenSSH [ 8 ] 's has the ability to rate limit scp file transfers .
rsync [ 9 ] too , features rate limiting .
Both use a simple scheme that sleeps whenever the average or instantaneous bandwidth rates go beyond their threshold (s ) .
rsync has the additional advantage that they may control the sender as well ( their protocol is proprietary ) and so bandwidth is shaped at the sender , which is easier and more sensible .
There are a few modules for Apache [ 1 ] which incorporate more advanced bandwidth shaping .
These modules are typically application layer shapers : they exploit additional context within Apache and the HTTP protocol .
For example , such modules could have the ability to perform rate limiting by particular cookies , or on CPU intensive CGI scripts .
Many peer - to - peer applications also offer traffic shaping .
Again , here there is great opportunity to use application level knowledge to apply policies for shaping [ 2,4 ] .
Netbrake [ 5 ] is another bandwidth shaper that uses shared library preloading .
The author of Netbrake notes that Netbrake is intended to simply be a hack , and that it is not mature software .
[ 5 ]
Like Trickle , it delays I / Os on sockets .
Netbrake does not have the ability to coordinate bandwidth allocation amongst several instances .
Netbrake calculates aggregate bandwidth usage for all sockets in a process , and shapes only according to this :
That is , if a given socket I/O causes the global rate to exceed the specified limit , that socket is penalized with a delay as for bandwidth consumption to converge to the limit , and there no equivalent to the smoothing in Trickle .
Thus , Netbrake does not retain a sense of ``fairness '' among sockets : One ``overzealous '' socket could cause delays in other sockets performing I /O at lower rates .
This does not retain the TCP fairness semantics ( nor does it attempt to ) , and could cause uneven application performance , one example being an application that uses different streams for control and data .
Netbrake also does not distinguish between the two directions of data ; incoming data will add to the same observed rate as outgoing data .
Netbrake is not semantically transparent ( nor does it aim to be ) ; it does not handle non-blocking I/O nor
I/O multiplexing ( select ( ) , poll ( ) , etc. ) nor
, , etc. ) nor socket aliasing ( dup ( ) , etc. ) .
Trickle provides semantic transparency and the ability to provide fairness or managed differentiated bandwidth usage to different sockets or applications .
Trickle also allows applications to cooperate as to retain ( a ) global bandwidth limit(s ) .
6 Future Work Trickle does not have much control over how the lower layers of the network stack behave .
A future area of exploration is to dynamically adjust any relevant socket options .
Especially interesting is to adjust the socket send and receive buffers as to lessen the reaction time of Trickle 's actions .
Another area of future work is dynamic adjustment of smoothing settings , parameterized by various observed network characteristics and usage patterns ( e.g. interactive , bulk transfers ) of a particular socket .
There also exists a need for Trickle to employ more expressive and dynamic policies , for example adding the ability to shape by remote host or by protocol .
There are a few new and disparate interfaces for dealing with socket I /O multiplexing .
In the BSD operating systems , there is the kqueue [ 18 ] event notification layer , Solaris has / dev/ poll [ 13 ] and Linux epoll [ 19 ] .
Trickle stands to gain from supporting these interfaces as they are becoming more pervasive .
By using a system call filter such as Systrace [ 22 ] or Ostia [ 17 ] , Trickle could address its two highest impact issues .
By using such a system call filter , Trickle could interposition itself in the system call layer , while still running entirely in userland , hence gaining the ability to work with statically linked binaries .
Furthermore , these tools provide the means to actually enforce the usage of Trickle , thus enforcing bandwidth policies .
In order to do collaborative rate limiting when joining a new network , a user would have to manually find which host ( if any ) is running trickled .
Trickle would thus benefit from some sort of service discovery protocol akin to DHCP [ 15 ] .
Using Zeroconf [ 12 ] technologies could potentially prove beneficial .

9 Summary and Conclusion Trickle provides a practical and portable solution to ad - hoc rate limiting which runs entirely in userland .
It has been shown to work extremely well in practice , and none of its inherent limitations seem to be a problem for its target set of users .
Since the time Trickle was released in March , 2003 , it has enjoyed a steady user base .
It is widely used , especially by home users in need of ad - hoc rate limiting .
Trickle has also been used in research .
Trickle works by interpositioning its middleware at the BSD socket abstraction layer which it can do this entirely in userland by preloading itself using the link editor present in Unix - like systems .
Trickle has been reported to work on a wide variety of Unix - like operating systems including OpenBSD [ 7 ] , NetBSD [ 6 ] , FreeBSD [ 3 ] , Linux [ 10 ] and Sun Solaris [ 11 ] , and is by its very nature also architecture agnostic .
At the socket layer the number of ways an operation can be manipulated is limited .
Furthermore , we gain no access to lower layers in the network stack at which rate limiters typically reside , and so we have to rely on the semantics of TCP to cause reductions in bandwidth consumption .
We developed several techniques including smoothing that help normalize the behavior observed in the lower network layers and avoids bursty throughput .
There are many venues to explore in the future development of Trickle , and we believe it will remain a very useful utility for ad - hoc rate limiting .
Furthermore , we expect that this is the typical usage case for rate limiting by end users requiring occasional service differentiation .

Pepper spray , rocks or rubber slugs are good tools for scaring bears from park picnic areas .
But the best way to get rid of black bears is to not invite them over to begin with .
Trying out various techniques on bears in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California , wildlife managers report some success in using obnoxious maneuvers , such as deploying sling shots and throwing rocks , to keep black bears from seeking people , food and garbage .
But the approach was less successful with bears that already had a taste for the forbidden foodstuff , the study published in the January Journal of Wildlife Management shows .
Establishing which techniques and circumstances will thwart food - seeking bears is valuable , but such techniques should be tried only after making trash and food inaccessible , says Rachel Mazur , who led the study while she was a wildlife biologist at the Kings Canyon park .
Bear - proof containers should be available and the public needs to be educated on using them , she says .
Thanks to conservation efforts , better management and shifts in hunting activities , the number of black bears has climbed in the last hundred years , says ecologist Jon Beckmann with the Wildlife Conservation Society .
So has the number of people , especially in the public lands of the American West .
This means more bear - human interactions .
Like parents experimenting with spanking versus time - out , Mazur and her team spent three years methodically trying “ aversive conditioning ” techniques on black bears .
Aversive conditioning associates a negative stimulus with unwanted behavior , in this case coming near humans , human food or human developments .
Negative stimulants included chasing , pepper spray and lofting projectiles of different intensity : rocks , slingshots and rubber slugs .
The team tried the conditioning techniques a total of 1,050 times on more than 150 bears .
( While being as methodical as possible , concerns about the safety of park visitors dictated using chasing and rock - throwing more than the other methods ) .
Of all the interactions , 729 involved 36 bears identifiable to the researchers as food - conditioned ; that is , animals that had already bitten the apple and were after more .
The remaining 321 interactions were with bears naïve to delicacies of human food and garbage .
During the study , bears were hazed from campgrounds , roadsides , picnic areas , natural areas and employee housing .
Chasing and rubber slugs worked best to scare off wild bears , and bears experiencing these treatments along with pepper spray stayed away the longest .
Rubber slugs worked best to get food - conditioned bears out of an area .
Such approaches can be useful to keep a bear away until food or garbage can be put away , or to get a female to stash her cubs in a tree instead of bringing the youngsters to the picnic , says Mazur .
But Mazur would rather not have to use these techniques at all .
“ This is n’t what we want , ” she says .
“ Our goal is to keep wildlife wild . ”
Beckmann concurs that aversive conditioning techniques can work , but “ these are Band - Aid approaches , ” he says .
“ It is much better to stop these conflicts before they occur . ”
Once a bear has a taste for people food , they can be extremely persistent , says Mazur .
Eleven of the 36 food - conditioned bears were involved in 90 percent of the hazing events , the researchers found .
Only one of these 11 bears completely stopped entering developed areas ; four changed their behavior but still had to be hazed every year .
The remaining six were so persistent and potentially dangerous that they were killed or relocated .
One of these six bears was a cub .
He did n’t learn to love human food from his mother , who was food - conditioned herself but gave it up while raising her kid .
But the cub was frequently near park visitors who approached and fed the animal .
“ The real issue is food availability , ” says Beckmann .
It is very difficult to get 100 percent enforcement on the human end of this interaction , he notes .
It may take only one home where a grill is left outside or garbage left exposed , or one energy bar in a camper ’s pack , to tempt a bear , he says .
The study should inform wildlife managers , but anyone who comes across a bear should make their presence known and then get out , says Beckmann .
“ You can say something like , ‘ Hi bear , ’ and then back away slowly while maintaining eye contact . ”

‘ We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get millions back for Americans ’
President Barack Obama “ is being failed by his economic team ” and should replace Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and White House economic policy director Larry Summers , says US House Rep. Peter DeFazio .
The prominent member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus told MSNBC’s The Ed Show that he and other House members are growing increasingly frustrated by a White House economic policy that focuses on maintaining the financial stability of Wall Street firms while largely overlooking Main Street concerns .

“ I think there is a growing consensus in the [ Democratic ] caucus [ that ] we need a new economic team that cares more about jobs , Main Street and the American people than it does about Wall Street and huge bonuses , ” DeFazio ( D - OR ) told host Ed Schultz .
DeFazio suggested that the government “ reclaim the unspent funds … reclaim some of the funds that are being paid back , which will not be paid back in full , and we use it to put people back to work rebuilding America ’s infrastructure .
“ We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get millions back for Americans , ” DeFazio said .
DeFazio criticized Geithner for not being forthcoming about where TARP bailout money went , saying that the treasury secretary was “ absolutely not ” coming clean about how the government used $ 700 billion of taxpayers ’ money to rescue ailing Wall Street firms .
A news analysis at CBS published yesterday says that the US Treasury “ gave away the farm ” when it bailed out insurance giant AIG , pointing out that , in normal bankruptcy cases , creditors would receive only a fraction of the money they lent the bankrupt company .
But because AIG did not declare bankruptcy and was bailed out by TARP instead , taxpayers ended up being on the hook for 100 percent of the insurer ’s debts .

Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs was AIG ’s largest creditor , and many observers argue it was Goldman ’s involvement in the bailout that resulted in AIG creditors receiving all the money owed them .
DeFazio has a long track record of liberal populism .
During the Bush administration era , he voted against Republican - sponsored tax cuts and funding measures for the Iraq war .
The following video was broadcast on MSNBC’s The Ed Show , and uploaded to the Web by the FireDogLake blog .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Here ’s some advice stemming from the unusual case of a man who had spider hairs stuck in his cornea :
Be sure to cover your eyes when hanging around with your pet tarantula .
Ophthalmologists at St. James ’s University Hospital in Leeds , England , used high magnification lenses to find out what made the man ’s eye red , watery and light - sensitive , according to a study reported in the British medical journal The Lancet on Thursday .
They discovered hair - like projections stuck in the man ’s cornea .
It was a light bulb moment for the patient , who remembered that three weeks earlier he had been cleaning a stubborn stain on the glass tank of his pet , a Chilean Rose tarantula .
“ He sensed movement in the terrarium .
He turned his head and found that the tarantula , which was in close proximity , had released ‘ a mist of hairs ’ which hit his eyes and face , ” the doctors wrote .
They said the man ’s condition was rare .
The authors noted that the Chilean Rose tarantula releases the barbed hair on the back of its body to defend against predators .
“ We suggest that tarantula keepers be advised to routinely wear eye protection when handling these animals , ” the doctors said .
but double that figure as you 'll need at least two to get things going
Now that HSTi's Wireless Media Stick is official , we decided to drop by its CES booth to see what the deal was .
Essentially , these Canadian sticks are WiFi dongles covering 802.11a/b/g/n , but the magic lies in their ability to let your computers appear as one USB mass storage device for devices like gaming consoles , digital frames and hi- fi stereos .
You start off by plugging a stick into a PC , install the software ( installer pre-loaded on the stick ) , and once connected to the wireless router you choose which folders to share ( which is pretty easy , as we saw ) .
You can do the same with more computers but each will require its own stick .
From there onwards , plug in another stick into a device that accepts USB mass storage devices , and you 'll be able to wirelessly access all the shared files on the network as if they are on one thumb drive .
Pretty sweet , huh ?
And yes , this thing does in fact do exactly what Infinitec 's IUM claims to do .
For now , HSTi only promises smooth 720 p video streaming and Windows - only compatibility , but a future firmware upgrade should make things even more groovy .
You can grab one starting January 15th for $ 119.99 each -- sooner and cheaper than the IUM , .
Still , it does n't hurt as much if you think of it as a thumb drive of up to one terabyte ( and two in the near future ) . :
Whoops !
We 've just been told that only one stick is necessary -- use the stick to run the configuration wizard on the PCs , then plug it into a media device for use .
Add this to the United State ’s Senate failure to even address the cap and trade issue , and it appears that carbon trading is losing the financial and political luster it once had .
Now Australia ’s ETS scheme is delayed in their senate with little hope of revival .
This says it pretty well at ABC News :
Senate kills off emissions trade laws
The Associated Press says :
Australia ’s Parliament defeats global warming bill
Australia ’s Parliament defeated legislation to set up a greenhouse gas emissions trading system on Wednesday , throwing a central plank of the government ’s plans to combat global warming into disarray .
…
The 41-33 vote followed a tumultuous debate in which the conservative main opposition party at first agreed to support a version of the government ’s bill , then dramatically dumped its leader and switched sides after bitter divisions erupted within the party .
From the Australian :
KEVIN
Rudd has lost his bid to deliver an emissions trading scheme in Australia before talks in Copenhagen but won an early election trigger after the Senate formally rejected the laws again today .
Just two Liberal senators broke ranks with a clear mandate among Coalition MPs to delay an ETS and voted with Labor on an emissions trading scheme Deputy Senate leader Eric Abetz declared : “ The CPRS is dead .
And no amount of CPR can revive it ”
Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt writes :
Rudd ’s great tax on everything is defeated How close was that bullet ?
A mad new tax is voted down , thanks only to Tony Abbott ’s one - vote win over Malcolm Turnbull yesterday …
Maybe it had something to do with this :
“ We have heard from the Independent Pricing Regulator in NSW just yesterday that this ETS would add 30 per cent to the people of NSW ’s power bills …
And as Bolt points out to WUWT a couple of days ago , Climategate figured in as well :
Rudd ’s belief that man is heating the world is based almost entirely on the reports of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
But thousands of emails uncovered in this month ’s Climategate scandal show that the scientists most responsible for those reports did not just doctor data , destroy awkward evidence , and censor sceptical scientists .
They also show some of them privately admitting that the world seems not to be heating as they ( and Rudd ) predicted .
“ Where the heck is global warming ? ” raged Kevin Trenberth , an IPCC lead author , to another Climategate scientist : “ The fact is that we ca n’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can ’t . ”

The campaign will continue in Scotland and Northern Ireland
Following a four year , people powered campaign , the libel laws in England & Wales have been reformed .
Cassino Online Brasil The Defamation Act 2013 received Royal Assent on 25th April 2013 and came into force on 1st January 2014 .
However , the Libel Reform Campaign continues .
Very few of the new provisions have been extended to Scotland , and none in Northern Ireland .
This has left British citizens in those nations with fewer free speech protections than their neighbours in England & Wales .
Worse , since most publishers operate throughout the UK , the jurisdictions with unreformed law could to chill free speech everywhere in the United Kingdom , and the Defamation Act 2013 could be undermined .

There 's a new Chevy Camaro , but with Pontiac dead , aftermarket shops are stepping into the Atlanta - bound - truck - trailer - filled - with - beer - sized breach , designing their own conversion kits for a new Trans Am .
One shop 's conveniently left theirs staged outside for a GMInsideNews forumite to photograph .

This mulletgasm - of - a- conversion kit 's got a Firebird - like snout as well as a custom rear end shrouded by canvas .
There 's also a big ol ' hood bulge which looks like it 's been built for a bigger - than - standard engine .
Can someone say LS9 ?

While we 've seen a few conversions so far — including the Bandit Trans Am and Lingenfelter T/ A concept , the Trans Am conversion kit the GMI reader looks to have spotted appears to be either the Gearhead Performance or ASC kit — both of which we 'd last heard were still in concept rendering stages .

We think it 's more likely to be the ASC - built kit judging by where it was spotted — in suburban Detroit .
Although if it was spotted in Farmington Hills , as the thread seems to indicate , we 've no idea why the ASC kit would be so far away from their home in Warren .
Whatever , maybe it was just easier to get the spy photos taken there .

WASHINGTON 
When experts on power grid reliability asked themselves recently how a cleaner energy future would look , seven of eight regional councils imagined how their systems would work with 10 percent wind power .
Only one , representing the southeastern United States , chose a radically different option : doubling nuclear power capacity .
Thirty years after the American nuclear industry abandoned scores of half - built plants because of soaring costs and operating problems like the Three Mile Island accident , skepticism persists over whether the technology is worth investing in .
Yet the pendulum may be swinging back .
The 104 plants now running have sharply raised their output , emboldening utilities across the country to make a case for building new ones .
Mrs Clinton said she would not serve a full eight years if President Barack Obama is re-elected in 2012 .

My scan of the letter itself , of the envelope it came in , the photos and the newspaper ( some of it ; the David Bowie parts ) .
Letters of Note blog finds and links it ( December 2 , 2009 ) starting all the rest of the attention .
I found out the letter had been put on that blog from getting e-mail from Dean Murray at Rex Features , in London , asking for a photo of me when I was 14 , and for permission to use the scan .
I mailed the packet to Holly , who was staying in the U.K. with James and Julie Daniel and their young son Adam .
James and Holly made an appointment to take the packet to Dean Murray , so the contents could be professionally photographed and scanned for posterity .
( My $ 80 scanner is not all that great , though my images are linked elsewhere on this page . )
Dean Murray wrote later :
It was a pleasure meeting your daughter Holly , she was great and livened up what is actually a quiet office here .
It 's amazing how much she looks like you when you were 14 ! :)
That first photo is the very summer I got the David Bowie letter , after my cousin Debbie ( at the right ) gave the promo albums she did n't want to our cousin Nada ( third in the photo ) who gave her rejects to me .
The one who does n't look like my cousin ( Max Rasamimanana , of Madagascar ) had nothing to do with it .
He was working at Ghost Ranch when we went to 4 - H camp and we invited him home .
He was a student at Wooster , working at Ghost Ranch for the summer .
January 6 , 2010 , at the Santa Fe Unschooling Symposium , I showed Carl and Kathryn Fettroll my whole packet , which Holly had just brought back from England , and which I was going to use for Show and Tell on Friday night .
Carl noted , from the letter , that Friday would be David Bowie 's birthday .
December 8 , very early morning , when I needed to make breakfast for symposium attendees , I got an e-mail from Dean Murray with links to three online article ( which I looked at briefly ) and scans of two newspaper articles ( which I looked at later that day ) .

Forget magazine clippings and newspaper headlines .
If you really want to put your finger on the pulse of American culture , just flip through an edition of the Joy of Cooking .
The ubiquity of the Joy of Cooking is staggering .
More than 18 million copies have sold since the Great Depression — when a Midwestern widow named Irma Rombauer published her recipes and anecdotes in the hope of lifting America 's spirits .
And while the lemonade concoctions and tuna casserole recipes were delicious , the real secret of the cookbook 's success is n't that it soothed stomachs ; it 's that it catered to hearts and minds .
The Artist of Life
Irma Rombauer 's young life was uniquely charmed .
She was born in 1877 to wealthy German immigrants and spent her teenage years shuttling between her hometown of St. Louis and the elegant port city of Bremen , Germany .
After enjoying a brief tryst with novelist Booth Tarkington , Irma settled down and married an attorney , with whom she raised two children .
Although never employed , she thought of herself as an " artist of life , "  a renaissance woman who aspired to live vibrantly and suck the marrow out of every moment .
When the stock market crashed in 1929 , Irma 's spirit was put to the test .
Her husband , who 'd long suffered from depression , committed suicide .
But instead of wallowing in grief , the 54 - year - old widow found meaning in a project — writing a cookbook she titled The Joy of Cooking : A Collection of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat .
Once completed in 1931 , she spent half her savings to publish the book locally in St. Louis .
Friends and acquaintances tested the recipes , and the feedback was encouraging , so she began pitching it to major publishers .
Five years later , in 1936 , Bobbs - Merrill finally took a chance on it and agreed to distribute the Joy of Cooking nationwide .
The truth is that Irma had never been a great chef , but she was an excellent hostess .
She could whip up a party at a moment 's notice and keep all of her guests entertained .
By infusing the Joy of Cooking 's text with that same wit and conviviality , Irma set her cookbook apart .
From the first page , she skipped the kitchen basics in favor of extolling the virtues of cocktails : " They loosen tongues and unbutton the reserves of the socially diffident .
Serve them by all means , preferably in the living room , and the sooner the better . " 
Irma 's German heritage also deeply influenced early editions of the book .
The first Joy includes recipes for dishes such as blitzkuchen and linzer tortes and even a few rousing quotes from Goethe .
Irma also exhibited an endearing frankness with her readers .
Unlike any other cookbook narrator at the time , Irma admitted to her lack of expertise and joked about not having time to cook .
In one section , she wrote , " The German recipe reads , " ˜stir for one hour , ' but of course , no high - gear American has time for that . " 
Simply stated , Irma Rombauer knew her audience .
Joy and Depression
Other than maybe The Grapes of Wrath , no book grasped the hardships of the Great Depression better than the Joy of Cooking .
Irma understood that American housewives were struggling to put food on the table , and she addressed those challenges head on .
Many entries began with the tag " Inexpensive and good . " 
There was even an appendix on making the most of leftovers , including stale bread , bones , coffee grounds , and pickle vinegar .
Along with these tidbits , Irma also included the food preferences of celebrities and monarchs .
" Is there anything better than good coffee cake ? "  she wrote .
" I am told that the former king of Spain " ˜dunks . ' " 
These asides bore little culinary relevance , but they made readers believe they shared something in common with royalty and celebrities .
Follow this recipe , Irma hinted , and you 're making the same sponge cake that Queen Mary once made for King George V when he was under the weather .
As the country marched off to WWII , the Joy of Cooking adapted to the times .
Irma 's 1943 edition was the first major cookbook to address the issue of rationing .
Once again , she treated cutbacks as opportunities for innovation , creating recipes such as Butterless , Eggless , Milkless Cake .
She even gave soybeans top billing , featuring them as a prime substitute for meat .
A Family Tradition
By 1951 , Irma was in her seventies , so her daughter , Marion Becker , took over the bulk of her work .
In some ways , Marion was even more of a visionary than her mother , and many of her choices for the 1951 Joy of Cooking helped transform it into the classic it is today .
For example , to illustrate techniques and ingredients , Marion added 150 line drawings .
She could have chosen trendy photographs , but her decision to use simple , helpful sketches ensured that the book would feel timeless .
By contrast , the technicolor cakes and sweaty roast turkeys of 1950's Betty Crocker 's Picture Cookbook now feel dated .
Marion also introduced a simple lowercase font for the logo .
At the time , this was an understated choice ; today , it 's an icon of cookery .
Like her mother , Marion also drew inspiration from the national mood .
When the next edition of Joy was commissioned in 1963 , the carefree consumer atmosphere of postwar America was over .
Doctors no longer plugged cigarettes on TV , and books such as Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring dominated the shelves .
To address growing consumer awareness , Marion cut some of Irma 's digressions to make way for more relevant information .
She included a massive section titled " Know Your Ingredients , "  containing charts , diagrams , and exhaustive explanations on everything from the best way to beat eggs to how yeast works .
The goal was to help readers understand not just the hows of cooking , but the whys , as well .
Marion also wanted Americans to eat healthier , so she added nutritional advice to the pages of Joy .
Plagued by undiagnosed food allergies as a child , she understood the link between ingredients and wellness years before people started talking about " organic farming "  and " health food . " 
Although the book still contained plenty of recipes for condensed - soup casseroles , 1963 's Joy suggested using fresh , seasonal fruits and vegetables instead of canned or frozen produce .
In an era of Wonder Bread , Marion Becker pushed for whole grains .
Marion produced her last revision in 1975 with the help of her husband , John , and son , Ethan .
The work was a monumental tome , containing more than 4,500 recipes and 1,000 illustrations .
Thanks to its encyclopedic size , this edition became the resource not only for grandmothers searching for German chocolate cake recipes , but also for their hippie grandchildren looking for tips on granola .
Presciently , the book warned readers against overusing microwaves , which were embraced by most major cookbooks at the time .
( Off the record , Marion actually wrote to Ralph Nader that she believed microwaves were zapping the nutritional value from food . )
The 1975 Joy was considered so authoritative that it remained in print for more than 20 years .
Today 's Tastes
In 1997 , Scribner Books hired a team of chefs to write a completely new Joy .
Critics slammed the edition for being sterile and lacking any sense of playfulness .
In 2006 , the publisher made amends .
Ethan Becker and his wife , Susan , were put in charge of the 75th anniversary edition , creating a new version that combined Marion Becker 's conscientiousness with her mother 's sense of fun .
Instead of catering to weight - loss fads ( the authors thank heaven that low - carb diets are no longer in vogue ) , the latest Joy stresses moderation and balance .
The classic , gut - busting German cakes are still there , but they share space with homemade energy bars .
Marion would be pleased to see that ethnic cooking is represented on a level that reflects our culture , with recipes for hummus , cream cheese balls , and salsa on neighboring pages .
Meanwhile , her mother would be happy that cocktails are back , along with old , quirky recipes , such as Lemonade for 100 People .
And the tidbits are classically Irma .
For example : " The Romans , who were passionate about snails , grew them on ranches where they were fed special foods like bay leaves , wine , and spicy soups as pre-seasoning . " 
But to really grasp the spirit of the Joy of Cooking , one needs only to look at the index of the latest edition , which begins with a Samuel Johnson quote .
It reads , " Knowledge is of two kinds .
We know a subject ourselves , or we know where we can find information on it . " 
Irma would be proud .

Editor 's note : Hamid Dabashi is the author of " Iran : A People Interrupted . "
He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York .
( CNN ) --
The Ahmadinejad government responded to the courageous anti-government protests throughout Iran in December by cranking up its propaganda machine to stage pro-government rallies .
But that tactic wo n't work .
The transparently staged events are the surest sign of the regime 's insecurity and its awareness that it must manufacture the illusion of legitimacy .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , abusing the financial resources that belong to Iranian people , put together the spectacle on December 30 , calling it a " spontaneous " show of support for the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic .
Some people who saw this clumsily engineered carnival might be led to believe that Ahmadinejad 's government , and by extension the Islamic Republic that he represents , is widely popular -- and that the Green Movement demanding civil liberties represents a small minority of Iranians .
It does not .
Soon after the Islamic revolution of 1977 - 1979 in Iran , my colleague Peter Chelkowski and I began collecting an extensive archive of visual materials -- ranging from posters , graffiti , murals , elementary school textbooks , billboards , and even stamps , banknotes and chewing gum wrappers -- that were effectively used to turn a multifaceted cosmopolitan revolution into an exclusively " Islamic " one .
It took us more than a decade to collect our archive and publish " Staging a Revolution : The Art of Persuasion in the Islamic Republic , " in which we demonstrated how the custodians of the Islamic Republic went to excruciating lengths to make sure Iranians spent their days under an avalanche of visual propaganda .
What the custodians of the Islamic Republic did on December 30 was nothing new .
It was yet another page from an old and tiresome book that , after 30 years , has lost all effectiveness .
On that day , people at public schools and governmental ministries were told they had the day off .
Free buses stood by to take the employees and their families to the rally .
Minutes after these official instructions were issued , copies were published on the Internet .
Food and drink were freely provided for the participants .
Non-governmental agencies and private companies were told they would lose lucrative governmental contracts if they did not dispatch their employees and their families to the rally .
Even school exams scheduled for the following Thursday were canceled or postponed so that students would not have to worry about homework as they rehearsed the chanting of " Death to Moussavi ! "
The " Moussavi " in the chant was Mir Hossein Moussavi , the leading opposition candidate in the last presidential election and a standard - bearer of the Green Movement .
Religious seminaries from around the country and families of the Basiji and Pasdaran militia were mobilized .
Preachers and national television alike encouraged people to take part in the rally .
They were told that Moussavi 's supporters had insulted the sacred memory marked by December 's religious holiday of Ashura and they had to come out to restore it .
Meanwhile , squares for the rally 's venues were carefully selected and locations for TV cameras were judiciously chosen to magnify the size of the crowd .
Crude editing techniques generated the impression of a massive turnout .
Music and bombastic newscasters worked to manufacture an exciting and dramatic event .
Given the clumsiness of the spectacle , one can only think that Green sympathizers were working for national television to make sure viewers understood the footage was bogus .
But these attempts are useless .
My generation of Iranians remembers only too well how as schoolchildren in the late 1950s and early 1960s , we were told to report to school at the crack of dawn when the late Shah of Iran came to our hometowns .
We were hurriedly taken by bus to the airport to wave the little flags our teachers had just handed us and cheer his motorcade .
We would show the whole world how much we loved him and how happy we were to welcome him to our city .
In less than two decades , my generation of students were out in the streets as adults shouting " Death to the Shah ! "
A few months later , the Shah died in Egypt in ignominy .
The difference between now and then is the miracle of the Internet .
Within minutes of the national television broadcast , the Internet was flooded with blogs comparing the spontaneous rallies of the Green Movement with the staged rally in reaction to it .
Bloggers created a comparative chart :
In one , the security forces beat people up , push them down from bridges over highways , shoot with live ammunition , throw tear gas ; in the other , the same forces greet demonstrators warmly , provide them with buses , free food and drink , and redirect the traffic for their convenience .
In one , people are run over and killed by armored trucks ; in the other , people pretend they are ready to die for their leader .
In one , reporters go to jail if they cover the rallies ; in the other , they are promoted and given bonuses .
In one , millions are called thousands ; in the other , just the opposite .
None of this is to suggest that Ahmadinejad and his clerical godfathers have no popular support .
They do .
People 's livelihoods and paychecks depend on cooperating with such sinister carnivals .
The louder such rallies scream , the more the world can see how dangerously aware the custodians of the Islamic Republic are of their illegitimacy .

The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function .
Dr Albert A Bartlett
Dr Albert A Bartlett , Professor Emeritus in Nuclear Physics at Colorado University , Boulder USA is an unlikely doomsayer , yet his words of mathematical wisdom , spelled out in measured , avuncular tones to his students , prophesy disaster for the human race .
I have seen his lecture on You Tube where it is billed as “ The most IMPORTANT video you ’ll ever see . ”
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY.
I recommend it , not only for it ’s lucid explanation of the effects of exponentiality but also as an example of how a patient man should talk to idiots ( the rest of us , I ’m afraid ) .
It has had over a million views but I doubt if another ten million views will have any effect on how we behave ; there are simply too many of us now .
Do the maths and you will see why .
If there are six billion of us alive now and one million have seen the video , then 5.999 billion have not seen it .
Besides , viewing is one thing , changing human behaviour is another .
We do n’t have a good track record when it comes to learning from our mistakes and there is a reason for this , as you will see .
Dr Bartlett explains the exponential function like this :
Imagine a flask which contains two bacteria which reproduce themselves every minute .
After one minute there will be four bacteria , after two minutes there will be eight bacteria , after three minutes , sixteen bacteria and so on .
After fifty - nine minutes there will be millions of bacteria but that ’s OK because the flask is still only half full .
After all , bacteria are quite tiny and it ’s a big flask , half empty .
Now Dr Bartlett asks us , ‘ How long before the flask is full ? ’
We mathematical dummies ponder a bit and count our fingers , so he gives us the answer , ‘ One minute ! ’
We feel a bit embarrassed ; it ’s so obvious !
The Doctor makes the suggestion that these are very clever , industrious bacteria ( you see where he is going , do n’t you ?
There ’s an analogy coming up ) .
They discover that there are three more flasks that they can use , three times the space they started with .
Phew , that was lucky !
But then our optimism takes a slap in the face .
Notice how I have identified us with the bacteria ; most empathetic of me .
‘ How long before the first extra flask is filled ? ’
Pause .
‘ One minute ! ’
‘ And the next two flasks ? ’
Pause .
‘ One more minute ! ’
With that , the human race is condemned by the inevitability and unconquerable truth of mathematics to a future of misery , distress and an unimaginable death rate .
Here is how it applies to the human race on earth .
It ’s not just humans , of course .
The maths applies to anything that increases at a percentage rate , which means all life since the year dot .
There are two closely linked restraints on everlasting exponential growth and they are running out of the means to increase ( fuel , food , space ) and death .
To be really effective death should occur before you have reproduced , but any death reduces the numbers and slows down the rate of increase .
So what are the aspects of the human species that are subject to exponential growth ?
You at the back ?
Yes , population .
Most of human activity is concerned with reproduction ; we ca n’t seem to stop doing it .
We do n’t want to stop doing it .
We are very good at it .
About 10,000 years ago , our numbers could be counted in thousands and while our numbers were constrained by disease , limited food supplies and high child and parent mortality , then population growth was slow .
It has only begun to increase rapidly in the last 2500 years and has rocketed in the last two centuries .
Reasons : reduced child mortality , control of infectious disease , abundant food and clever use of space e.g. cities .
It ’s worth reminding yourself of that flask of bacteria at this point .
When things double they increase by the whole amount of what went before .
The time this takes to happen is called the doubling time ( easy , this maths is n’t it ? ) .
A simple way of working out the doubling time is to divide the rate of increase into 70 .
For example , a rate of increase of 7 % per annum will give a doubling time of 10 years ( 70/7 =10 ) .
That ’s a nice interest rate on your savings but if it is applied to oil and gas , say , it would mean that you had to discover and exploit , every ten years , as much oil and gas as has ever been discovered before .
Of course , in the real world , it ’s more complicated and I can already hear you say , “ renewables , nuclear fission , energy efficiency , sustainable economies . ”
OK , they ’ll slow things down a bit but , big , big but , if demand continues to increase at all there will be a doubling time and you will have to find as many resources in that time as ever were there before , and then again , and again , and again .
Here is a real time , real world fact .
World population is now , give or take a few hundred million , 6 billion .
A growth rate of 1 % gives a doubling time of around 70 years ( 70/1 =70 ) .
That is a world population of 12 billion in 2080 .
In fact , the growth rate is about 1.2 % which makes it less than 60 years to reach 12 billion .
The usual argument at this point is that nations that are more prosperous have lower birth rates and that , as the world becomes more prosperous , birth rates in general will fall and population will stabilise .
Sounds good , does n’t it ?
Until you realise that there is a Catch 22 .
It ’s this : in order to reduce human population growth to a zero rate of increase you have to increase the prosperity of everyone , or at least most of the world , up to current levels of prosperity in , say , Italy , which has a low birth rate .
To do this you need the same level of resources that Italy uses spread across all nations of the earth .
There are not enough resources to do this , and meanwhile the world population is growing anyway and using even more resources , without getting prosperous enough for the birth rate to stabilise .
You need to have a growth in resource availability and use which is fast enough to overtake population growth .
Remember , any growth rate is exponential and results in a doubling time .
It ’s a fact that all economies assume growth as a birthright and generally a ‘ good thing ’ .
Think of the panic and gloom that occurs when we experience a recession and the joy that comes with a period of growth !
Let ’s do the maths again .
UK economy is expected to grow by around 1.8 % in 2010 and everybody say this is n’t very good .
Growth in India and China is huge by comparison .
It varies both in its effect on demand for resources and in its fluctuation , but generally , economic growth is a positive figure .
So let ’s look at an average 2 % growth in the world economy .
The doubling time is 70/2 = 35 years .
Yes , at that rate the world economy will be twice as big in 2045 .
Will it be using twice the resources ?
Probably not .
For one thing , not all wealth demands physical resources directly .
I mean , look at banking .
For another , we will probably find less resource depleting ways of doing things .
What we wo n’t do , however , is use less resources .
There will still be a doubling time , even if it is delayed by our ingenuity or luck .
Remember , doubling time means using as much again as everything that has gone before .
Let ’s be generous and say that the doubling time is increased to 70 years .
This means that by 2080 , when the world population is 12 billion ( double what it is now ) the world economy will be four times as big as it is now and using twice the resources that it does now .
In 2008 , total worldwide energy consumption was 474 exajoules ( 5×1020 J ) with 80 to 90 percent derived from the combustion of fossil fuels .
An exajoule is a million terawatts and a terawatt is a trillion joules .
To put it in perspective , it ’s the equivalent energy of 8 million of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima .
So by 2080 the world economies will need the annual energy equivalent of 16 million atomic bombs and , ha ha , most of that produced from renewable resources or else we all melt from global warming .
Now , what do you suppose the world energy demands were in , say 1710 ?
You do n’t know ?
Well , neither do I , but if you slide down the exponential curve you will see that it was not many atom bombs ’ worth compared with today .
Nevertheless , economic growth had started its inexorable path towards world resource depletion , driving population growth , and drawing on the fossil fuels for energy .
But if you had been a member of the Royal Society , say Sir Isaac Newton , who was its President then , you would have laughed at the idea that in 300 years time we would be in this precarious situation .
It would be another 100 years until Thomas Malthus published his Essay on the Principle of Population .
He was so right in his deductions that it ’s worth quoting him here .
‘ The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man .
Population , when unchecked , increases in a geometrical ratio .
Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio .
A slight acquaintance with numbers will show the immensity of the first power in comparison with the second . ’[ i ]
Back to the flask of bacteria .
If only one bacteria ( nicknamed Malthus ) was aware of the problem , then it might suggest that the flask was filling up , or rather , that the rate at which it was filling up was increasing and that there was a problem .
No other bacteria would believe this because at 50 minutes into the hour ( the flask is full on the hour ) the place would look pretty well empty .
We are probably just entering the last , 59th , minute now , and we do n’t have any more flasks .
We are kidding ourselves that the earth is still only half full ; it might well be , but that wo n’t stop it filling up in the next minute !
There is only one earth and the moon is too far away and anyway , even if it was a fertile planet of chicken nuggets and cola it would all be used up in the 61st minute , would n’t it ?
In his video lecture , Dr Bartlett gives us a list of the things that contribute towards population growth .
I noted them down so that I could share them with you and fill you with fear for the future .
They are : procreation , motherhood , large families , immigration , medicine , public health , sanitation , peace , law and order , scientific agriculture , accident prevention , clean air and ignorance of population growth .
We love them all , do n’t we ?
With the possible exception of large families , if you happen to live next door to one of them !
He gives a second list of the things that contribute to lessening population growth .
They are : abstention , contraception , abortion , small families , non-immigration , disease , war , murder , violence , famine , accidents and pollution .
With the possible exception of contraception we generally do n’t like these things and try to avoid them , unless we are doing them for our own selfish ends of course .
These likes and dislikes are pretty well ingrained into us .
In fact , the likes are what have brought us to the place we are now , the edge of the abyss .
I do n’t think we shall stop doing the things we like to do voluntarily .
Hope and ignorance will see to that .
I may be wrong in all this and so may Malthus and Dr Bartlett .
But then the maths would have to be wrong , would n’t it ?
y = nx. Disprove !

[ i ] Malthus T.R. 1798 .
An Essay on the Principle of Population .
Chapter 1 , p13 in Oxford World Classics reprint .
OK , so those of us who have " known " the online personality known as " Jim Treacher " over the years are all surely sharing a good smirk at the news that he was randomly run over by a Diplomatic Security SUV just weeks after he arrived to Washington , D.C. to work for Tucker Carlson 's Daily Caller .
I mean , Treacher ( real name : Sean Medlock ) is a funny guy , and –minus the whole broken knee and surgery thing !
–it 's kind of funny .
In a painful way .
But , not unlike the ridiculous do n't - bring - a - gun - to - a - snowball - fight story from December , just look at what happens when the irresistible force of interested - party journalism meets up against the immovable object of what passes for local policing and government culture :
An agent in the vehicle , Mike McGuinn , did not identify himself to Medlock at the scene , or apologize for running him down .
Indeed , Washington , D.C. , police drove to a local emergency room to serve Medlock with a jaywalking citation as he lay prostrate in a hospital bed , while a man who identified himself as " special agent " stood by watching and taking notes . [… ]
Medlock says he was walking within the bounds of the crosswalk , toward a blinking white signal , when a government SUV suddenly turned left and plowed into him , knocking him to the ground . [… ]
Curiously , the [ jaywalking ] ticket says that Medlock was struck at an intersection four blocks from where the accident actually took place .
And it claims that Medlock was walking diagonally across the intersection at the time .
In one of his strikingly short conversations with the Daily Caller , agent Mike McGuinn acknowledged that Medlock was not jaywalking at all , but walking " outside the crosswalk when the incident occurred . " [… ]
Calls to the State Department were met with evasion and indifference .
Spokeswoman Grace
Moe first asked a Daily Caller reporter where the publication 's offices were located before taking a message .
A second DSS spokeswoman , Sarah Rosetti , requested that questions be submitted in writing .
When she responded in an e-mail , Rosetti claimed that " a jogger collided with one of the U.S. Department of State , Diplomatic Security Service 's official vehicles " – as if Medlock , who does not jog , had somehow attacked the SUV .
" At all times , Diplomatic Security acted responsibly and appropriately and displayed due diligence in caring for the injured , " Rosetti continued .
Seriously , how many dumb government lies are packed into those six paragraphs ?
And what happens when they run over pedestrians in Anacostia ?
UPDATE : Lefty watchdog site Media Matters for America criticizes my write - up :
interestingly , Welch ignores the fact that the original claim — that the Secret Service had clipped Treacher in a " hit - and - run " – turned out to be completely false .
Welch bemoans the ( government ) " lies " being told about the accident , but he ignores perhaps the biggest two of all .
It 's true , in my hierarchy of Lies , I am indeed more concerned with government law enforcement agents who slap accident victims with jaywalking tickets in the hospital for intersections they were n't in , then make shit up about " jogging " and " act[ing ] responsibly and appropriately , " all the while behaving imperious and irritated , than I am with initial confusion / hyperbole from some who just got RUN OVER BY AN SUV .
I think that makes me … uh , conservative ?
Very confusing times .
Michael Vaughan has criticised the behaviour of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson even though suggestions of malpractice by the England bowlers were officially thrown out by the International Cricket Council today .
The ICC , the match referee Roshan Mahanama and the umpires Tony Hill and Daryl Harper all closed the book on the matter yesterday following yesterday 's announcement that South Africa had " raised concerns " about the condition of the ball .
Vaughan , however , speaking before the ICC announcement , sounded considerably more riled than the South Africans when he said : " England have been caught and we have to hold our hands up .
They were thinking they were smart but they 've been very silly .
" Stuart Broad stood on the ball , and then Jimmy Anderson collected the ball , whether it was the next over or the over after , and started playing around the area where Broad had created the scuff marks . "
Vaughan , who is in South Africa commentating on the series for BBC's Test Match Special , added : " They were just trying to get the ball to reverse swing .
It looks quite bad on the TV screens .
I 'm quite disappointed because I do n't like to see that sort of action in a game .
It does n't look good .
What would we say if it was Pakistan ? "
The Great Ball Tampering
Row appeared to have crashed into the side of Table Mountain after South Africa failed to formalise their grievances and get an official report to the match referee before the start of play today .
Sky , understandably , have been less animated than the local TV station .
Nasser Hussain , Vaughan 's predecessor as captain , said : " We 've all been there .
We 're not whiter than white .
Where you see the ball and think would it be nice to get nails into that , get it reverse - swinging .
But you 've just got to leave it alone because if the opposition see you going like that to the ball they get very fidgety . "
Another former England skipper , Mike Atherton , and one with what might be called a keen interest in ball - tampering , suggested picking at the seam has " gone on since time immemorial " and urged South Africa to take their complaints to match officials if they have serious concerns .
Atherton , who is still remembered for the " dirt in the pocket " story when he captained England against South Africa at Lord 's in 1994 , said : " They 're serious allegations .
They must put up or shut up rather than put it out in the wider domain that they 've got concerns over the ball . "
It was around that time , in the early 1990s , that ball - tampering became one of the most emotive issues in the game .
It was fuelled , largely , by Pakistan 's infamous tour of England in 1992 .
Imran Khan , who retired earlier that year , had admitted that he used bottle tops to scratch the surface of the ball and in that summer 18 years ago fingers were pointed at Pakistan 's fast bowlers Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram because of their sensational and often unplayable deliveries .
Ball - tampering stories , as Atherton suggests , are as old as the game itself .
Most of the former players here yesterday just could not understand what all the fuss was about .
But one former England player – and a current county cricketer – said last night : " I do n't know why players do it .
You just can't get away with cheating any more .
They should have more sense .
You just can't do that sort of thing , not with all the TV cameras around . "

Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has become perhaps the most prominent symbol for everything that is wrong with the U.S. financial system , but most Americans cannot even begin to explain what they do or how they have made tens of billions of dollars from the economic collapse of America .
The truth is that what Goldman Sachs did was fairly simple , and there may not have even been anything “ illegal ” about it ( although they are now being investigated by the SEC among others ) .
The following is how Goldman Sachs made tens of billions of dollars from the economic collapse of America in four easy steps … .
Step 1 : Sell mortgage - related securities that are absolute junk to trusting clients at vastly overinflated prices .
Step 2 : Bet against those same mortgage - related securities and make massive bets against the U.S. housing market so that your firm will make massive profits when the U.S. economy collapses .
Step 3 : Have ex-Goldman executives in key positions of power in the U.S. government so that bailout money can be funneled to entities such as AIG that Goldman has made these bets with so that they can get paid after they win their bets .
Step 4 : Collect the profits – Goldman Sachs is having their “ most successful year ” and will end up reporting approximately $ 50 billion in revenue for 2009 .
So is it right for the biggest fish on Wall Street to make tens of billions of dollars by betting that the U.S. housing market will collapse ?
You see , when you are talking about a financial giant the size of Goldman Sachs , the line between “ betting that something will happen ” and “ making something happen ” gets blurred very quickly .
Not that Goldman Sachs was the only one betting against the housing market .
According to the New York Times , firms like Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley also created mortgage - related securities and then bet that they would fail …..
Goldman was not the only firm that peddled these complex securities — known as synthetic collateralized debt obligations , or C.D.O. ’s — and then made financial bets against them , called selling short in Wall Street parlance .
Others that created similar securities and then bet they would fail , according to Wall Street traders , include Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley , as well as smaller firms like Tricadia Inc .
But certainly Goldman Sachs was the most prominent financial player involved in this type of activity .
In fact , without mentioning specifics , Goldman has even admitted publicly to wrongdoing .
On November 17th , 2008 Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein even issued a public apology ….
“ We participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret . ”
But complicated financial transactions are something that most Americans simply do not understand , so the public outrage towards Goldman Sachs and others has been somewhat limited .
But that does not change the very serious nature of the activities that Goldman was involved in ….
“ The simultaneous selling of securities to customers and shorting them because they believed they were going to default is the most cynical use of credit information that I have ever seen , ” Sylvain Raynes , an expert in structured finance at R & R Consulting in New York , recently told The New York Times .
“ When you buy protection against an event that you have a hand in causing , you are buying fire insurance on someone else ’s house and then committing arson . ”
But the sad thing is that many Americans do not even understand what Goldman Sachs is .
Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 and has forged a reputation as one of the elite financial institutions in the entire world .
They only hire “ the best and the brightest ” and Ivy League graduates flock to the firm .
Of the five major investment banks that dominated Wall Street before the crash , only Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have survived .
Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns were severely damaged by the crash and ended up being purchased by retail banks and Lehman Brothers ended up folding .
There are persistent rumors that Goldman played a major role in the collapse of Bear Stearns and that ex-Goldman CEO Hank Paulson could have done much more to bail out Lehman Brothers , but perhaps nobody will ever know the full truth .
All we do know is that at the end of the crash several of Goldman ’s competitors were destroyed and Goldman found itself in a more dominant position than ever .
The truth is that Goldman is a financial shark and they do not apologize for it .
An article in Rolling Stone recently put it this way ….
The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it ’s everywhere .
The world ’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity , relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money .
So how did Goldman Sachs prosper so greatly in an environment that destroyed their competitors ?
The following is an extended breakdown of just how Goldman Sachs was able to reap tens of billions of dollars in profits from the collapse of the U.S. housing market ….
Step 1 : Sell mortgage - related securities that are absolute junk to trusting clients at vastly overinflated prices .
In late 2006 , Goldman Sachs made some fundamental changes in the way that they were approaching the U.S. housing market .
According to a McClatchy report , Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said that the firm decided at that time to reduce its mortgage risks by selling off subprime mortgage - related securities and by purchasing credit - default swaps to hedge against a serious downturn in the U.S. housing market .
The key moment came in December 2006 .
After “ 10 straight days of losses ” in Goldman ’s mortgage business , Chief Financial Officer David Viniar called a meeting of key Goldman personnel .
Vanity Fair described the results of that meeting this way ….
After a now famous meeting in David Viniar ’s office on December 14 , 2006 , Goldman ’s traders began to protect the firm against further declines in the market .
Just as you can short the S&P 500 , the traders took short positions in an index that tracked the price of mortgage - backed securities .
They also either sold assets they owned to others at losses or dramatically marked down the price on their own books .
In the aftermath of the crisis , criticism erupted that Goldman had continued to sell mortgage - backed securities to its clients while betting against those very securities for its own account .
Clearly , in the simplest terms possible , this is true : while Goldman was never the biggest underwriter of C.D.O. ’s ( collateralized debt obligations — Wall Street ’s vehicle of choice for mortgage - backed securities ) , the firm did remain in the top five until the summer of 2007 , when the market crashed to a halt .
So Goldman Sachs proceeded to sell approxmiately $ 39 billion of its own mortgage securities in 2006 and 2007 and they sold at least $ 17 billion more mortgage securities for others , but they never told the buyers of those securities that Goldman was secretly betting that a significant drop in U.S. housing prices would send the value of those mortgage securities plummeting .
These sales and the massive clandestine wagers placed by Goldman enabled the firm to pass most of its potential losses on to others prior to the collapse of the U.S. housing market .
But many of the investors who got the short end of the stick were not pleased .
When they discovered that what Goldman had promoted as triple - A rated investments were actually a bunch of garbage , many of them were absolutely furious .
“ The Securities and Exchange Commission should be very interested in any financial company that secretly decides a financial product is a loser and then goes out and actively markets that product or very similar products to unsuspecting customers without disclosing its true opinion , ” said Boston University economics professor Laurence Kotlikoff .
“ This is fraud and should be prosecuted . ”
One of the victims of this fraud was the state of Mississippi… .
Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood , whose state has lost $ 5 million of the $ 6 million it invested in Goldman ’s subprime mortgage - backed bonds in 2006 , said the state ’s funds are likely to lose “ hundreds of millions of dollars ” on those and similar bonds .
Another one of the victims of this fraud was California ’s retirement system for public employees … .
California ’s huge public employees ’ retirement system , known as CALPERS , purchased $ 64.4 million in subprime mortgage - backed bonds from Goldman on March 1 , 2007 .
While that represented a tiny percentage of the fund ’s holdings , in July CALPERS listed the bonds ’ value at $ 16.6 million , a drop of nearly 75 percent , according to documents obtained through a state public records request .
So who is left holding the bag in cases such as these ?
The taxpayers .
And that is just fine with Goldman Sachs .
Just as long as they keep raking in huge profits .
Vanity Fair was even more blunt regarding this injustice … .
“ Goldman ’s management team was almost flawless in its execution .
But how many people needed government help because of the things Goldman sold them ? ”
The truth is that a lot of people needed help because of the things Goldman sold them , but up until now Goldman has completely gotten away with it .
Step 2 : Bet against those same mortgage - related securities and make massive bets against the U.S. housing market so that your firm will make massive profits when the U.S. economy collapses .
Not only did Goldman sell mortgage - related securities that were absolute junk to investors at vastly overinflated prices , they also placed massive bets that the U.S. housing market would absolutely collapse .
The New York Times recently described how Goldman used a new index known as the ABX to make many of these bets ….
A handful of investors and Wall Street traders , however , anticipated the crisis .
In 2006 , Wall Street had introduced a new index , called the ABX , that became a way to invest in the direction of mortgage securities .
The index allowed traders to bet on or against pools of mortgages with different risk characteristics , just as stock indexes enable traders to bet on whether the overall stock market , or technology stocks or bank stocks , will go up or down .
Goldman , among others on Wall Street , has said since the collapse that it made big money by using the ABX to bet against the housing market .
Worried about a housing bubble , top Goldman executives decided in December 2006 to change the firm ’s overall stance on the mortgage market , from positive to negative , though it did not disclose that publicly .
These bets would only make money for Goldman Sachs if the U.S. housing market declined .
So if the biggest giant on Wall Street has a huge financial incentive to see the U.S. housing market fail , what do you think the odds are that they are going to do anything to support it ?
Step 3 : Have ex-Goldman executives in key positions of power in the U.S. government so that bailout money can be funneled to entities such as AIG that Goldman has made these bets with so that they could get paid .
For years , Goldman Sachs has encouraged executives to serve in U.S. government positions .
Now they are world famous for the amount of influence their former employees have over government policy .
For example , according to the New York Times , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ( also a former Goldman CEO ) spoke with the current CEO of Goldman Sachs about two dozen times during the week of the bailout , although Paulson says that he obtained an “ ethics waiver ” before doing so .
So does an “ ethics waiver ” make everything okay ?
But the sad thing is that is not an isolated example .
It turns out that Goldman benefited greatly from a number of decisions made by their former CEO while he was Treasury Secretary … .
* Goldman greatly benefited when Paulson elected not to save rival Lehman Brothers from collapse .
Paulson certainly stepped in to help Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG , but apparently had no problem with letting Lehman Brothers fall apart .
* Under Paulson ’s direction , Goldman ended up receiving bailout money ( which they may or may not have needed ) from the U.S. government and has since paid back much of that money with interest .
So why did n’t Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers get the bailout funds that they needed ?
* Goldman greatly benefitted when Paulson organized a massive rescue of American International Group while in constant telephone contact with Goldman CEO Blankfein .
AIG ultimately ended up using $ 12.9 billion taxpayer dollars to pay off every single penny that it owed to Goldman .
But it is not just Paulson who has had significant influence in Washington .
On October 16th , Adam Storch , a Goldman Sachs vice president , was named managing executive of the SEC ’s enforcement division .
What do you think the odds are that he will crack down hard on Goldman ?
In addition , former Goldman Sachs lobbyist Mark Patterson is the chief of staff for current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
In fact , ex-Goldman employees are seemingly everywhere .
According to Vanity Fair , at one G - 7 meeting an anonymous source identified at least 24 out of 32 finance officials in attendance as ex-Goldman employees .
The influence of Goldman Sachs even reaches to the White House .
Goldman was Barack Obama ’s number one campaign donor , and its employees gave $ 981,000 to his campaign .
If you do n’t think that kind of money does not buy influence then you are delusional .
Goldman used some of that powerful influence to get the U.S. government to bail out AIG so that AIG could pay off the bets that Goldman had made with them .
In a recent article , Vanity Fair described part of what went down … .
After the government bailout of A.I.G. , in order to end the collateral calls on the insurance giant , the New York Federal Reserve — whose chairman at the time was former Goldman chairman Steve Friedman — decided to purchase a slew of the securities that A.I.G. had insured , including $ 14 billion of those on which Goldman had purchased insurance .
The government — meaning taxpayers — did so at full price , although according to a recent Bloomberg story , there had been negotiations with A.I.G. to do so at a 40 percent discount .
Goldman says that the New York Fed broached the topic of a discount only once .
The firm ’s response : a flat no .
While no one will ever know what would have happened had A.I.G. gone under , the essence of what did happen is perfectly clear .
As a recent report by the Office of the Special Inspector General for tarpput it , the decision to pay full price “ effectively transferred tens of billions of dollars of cash from the Government to A.I.G. ’s counterparties . ”
Or to put it another way : because Goldman felt it was owed its billions by A.I.G. , the firm took it from taxpayers instead .
So what about all of the thousands of small businesses that are failing and what about the millions of Americans that are losing their jobs and homes ?
Do they get bailouts ?
Of course not .
But the U.S. government definitely made sure that AIG and Goldman were taken care of .
Step 4 : Collect the profits – Goldman Sachs is having their “ most successful year ” and will end up reporting approximately $ 50 billion in revenue for 2009 .
Goldman Sachs ranks # 1 in annual net income when compared with 86 peers in the investment services sector .
They are on course for their best year ever .
Yes , they are having a really good “ crisis ” .
Goldman Sachs is on course to surpass $ 50 billion in revenue in 2009 and to pay its employees more than $ 20 billion in year - end bonuses .
20 billion just in bonuses ?
That would mean that the average bonus for all Goldman employees would be over $ 700,000 .
No wonder everyone wants to work for them .
It ’s good to be on the winning side .
So just how are they making so much money ?
In their recent article , Vanity Fair described it this way ….
But because so many of Goldman ’s competitors were gone or disabled , spreads — the difference between the price at which you sell and buy a variety of securities — were wider than they had been in years , meaning that Goldman could practically mint money .
By acting at the moment it did , with Lehman out and Merrill Lynch down for the count , the government enabled this situation .
The other reason for Goldman ’s profits is that the government has flooded the system with money , not just the money it used to rescue the financial system but hundreds of billions more in stimulus , in support of the housing market , and in the Federal Reserve ’s purchases of securities .
But all of this success has not come without controversy .
In fact , Goldman executives are very much aware of the growing backlash against the firm .
Senior officials at Goldman Sachs have reportedly loaded up on firearms and are now equipped to defend themselves if there is a “ populist uprising ” against the bank .
In addition , Goldman Sachs employees are now not allowed to gather in groups of 12 or more outside the office .
The firm very much discouraged “ holiday parties ” as they most definitely did not want to be seen as celebrating the downfall of the U.S. economy .
But the truth is that Goldman Sachs won because so many others lost .
In his very revealing article on Goldman Sachs in Rolling Stone , Matt Taibbi described how Goldman keeps making money from the bursting of these economic bubbles ….
They achieve this using the same playbook over and over again .
The formula is relatively simple : Goldman positions itself in the middle of a speculative bubble , selling investments they know are crap .
Then they hoover up vast sums from the middle and lower floors of society with the aid of a crippled and corrupt state that allows it to rewrite the rules in exchange for the relative pennies the bank throws at political patronage .
Finally , when it all goes bust , leaving millions of ordinary citizens broke and starving , they begin the entire process over again , riding in to rescue us all by lending us back our own money at interest , selling themselves as men above greed , just a bunch of really smart guys keeping the wheels greased .
They ’ve been pulling this same stunt over and over since the 1920s — and now they ’re preparing to do it again , creating what may be the biggest and most audacious bubble yet .
The truth is that in this latest economic collapse there were millions of losers and just a few winners .
Goldman Sachs was one of those winners .
So will they lose next time ?
Not likely .
In their recent article , Vanity Fair quoted an anonymous source in the financial industry as saying the following ….
“ Are they the Yankees ?
No , the Yankees actually lose !
Goldman never loses . ”

ANOTHER UPDATE :
Anton Troianovski of the Wall Street Journal followed up with the Plattsburgh police on this , and was told that the volunteer actually damaged his tire on a broken bottle .
I asked Hoffman campaign manager Dan Tripp about this –he said he had no comment because the campaign had not heard this yet .
“ There are reports that they ’re bringing in the troops and they ’re bringing in ACORN , ” said Hoffman .
“ I think the Democrats are doing anything they possibly can to steal this election away from the 23rd district . ”
Then he backtracked by saying the police were still investigating .
But not before he blamed the dreaded ACORN and evil Democrats for slashing his tires and stealing the election .
UPDATE : Now I 'm hearing it's a Hoffman precinct worker whose tires were slashed ( see Update # 2 ) .
If so , I owe Ali a retraction .

I wonder if his ambitions include his very own police record .
Dec. 18 , 2009 – Autism disorders increased by 57 % in just four years , the CDC today reported .
By the end of 2006 , one in 110 U.S. kids had an autism disorder diagnosed by age 8 : one in 70 boys and one in 315 girls , reflecting a nearly fivefold higher risk for males .
The new CDC estimate of autism prevalence , obtained from analysis of child evaluation records in 11 states , is virtually identical to autism numbers reported for 2007 from a huge telephone survey reported last October .
Are today 's kids really more likely to have autism , or are doctors and parents just getting better at recognizing this family of developmental disorders ?
" At this point it is hard to say how much is a true increase and how much is improved identification , " CDC behavioral health scientist Catherine Rice , PhD , said at a news conference .
Rice is the lead author of the CDC report .
Rice admits that no single factor or simple explanation can account for the increase .
And advocates for autism research say the size and rapidity of the increase can't be explained away .
" Two decades ago we were looking at a prevalence of one in 5,000 children .
Now we 're looking at one in 100 .
That really is a staggering increase , " Geraldine Dawson , PhD , chief science officer of advocacy group Autism Speaks , tells WebMD .
Dawson said the new numbers justify a huge increase in federal spending on research and treatment .
" The question is what will it take for the federal government to begin to respond to this crisis , " Dawson says .
" President Obama during the election campaign made a promise that there would be a billion dollars spent every year on finding the causes of autism .
We feel that this kind of data coming from a CDC study really requires that level of response . "
Rice expressed similar concern .
" The CDC considers autism spectrum disorders to be a significant public health issue , " she said .
" This report underscores the need for a coordinated and strong response to improve lives of people with ASDs . "

– Monty Python ’s The Meaning of Life Part VII : Death
>
In his column today , Floyd Norris asks “ Can the world be made safe for the return of securitizations ? ”
To a degree , that is the wrong question .
While some people have become focused on securitization , what we should really be looking at is the step prior in the process — the actual underwriting standards of the mortgage loans that were bundled and resold .
It was the abdication of lending standards by the “ lend - to - sell - to securitizers ” business model that caused so much of the trouble ( yes , there were subsequent errors , but they came after the lending standard failures ) .
Were the the dinner guests in the Monty Python film killed by whipping ingredients in a food processor until they were creamy smooth ?
That is a similar question to the issue of securitization — the primary problem was not the process , but rather , the ingriedients that went into the process .
The securitization process simply amplified the poisonous underwriting , and fed it to the world .
Canned Salmon — Garbage In , Garbage Out .
The way to fix securitization is to fix lending in general — develop standards , enforce them , educate borrowers , halt predatory lending .
Back to Norris :
“ Can the world be made safe for the return of securitizations ?
That is a question of great importance to those like John C. Dugan , the comptroller of the currency , who say they believe that the banking system on its own is unlikely to have the ability to provide enough credit to sustain an economic recovery in the United States .
“ We need a vibrant , credible securitization market to help fund the real economy going forward , ” Mr. Dugan said this week .
He was preaching to the choir — a meeting of the American Securitization Forum — but it is an opinion widely held in financial markets .
It is possible to question that thesis .
Securitization grew as a way for banks to get around capital rules , not because of any profound desire by investors for such assets or any real unwillingness by banks to make the loans .
But since it was more expensive to hold capital against the risk if the loans were not securitized , they were securitized .
That also opened the market to new players , who neither wanted to , nor could amass , the capital to hold onto loans . ”
It was n’t that the non -bank lenders could not amass the capitasl — that was n’t their business model .
Instead , their inventory was cash , and the greater they turned over their inventory , the more profits they made .
That is , until they went bankrupt .
As of the most recent count by mortgage imploder , ~ of these lenders have gone belly up
Norris concludes :
“ There are several essential elements to any fix .
The underlying loans have to be of better quality .
The investors have to believe that is the case and that they are being compensated for risks that were much higher than they previously believed .
Another 30 percent collapse in home prices is unlikely , but it will be a while before anyone ’s models deem such a thing impossible . ”
That seems about right . . .

As hundreds die worldwide from record cold temperatures , scientists worry about global warming
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , January 13 , 2010
As hundreds of people die worldwide as a result of record low temperatures in the midst of a savage winter , scientists are preparing for a conference in which they will discuss measures to use geoengineering to block out the sun .
“ The summit of climate scientists , to be held in California in March , will examine drastic techniques for slowing climate change that are controversial and have been described as “ geo-piracy , ” reports the Telegraph .
“ Most techniques focus on ways of reducing the sun ’s rays by blocking them using mirrors orbiting in space or by spraying sulphur compounds into the high atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from earth . ”
Another proposal involves sending spaceships into the upper atmosphere to spray seawater into the sky and reflect sunlight back into space , an idea that would seem more at home in the context of some bizarre alien invasion movie .
“ Most of the talk about these geo - engineering techniques say they should be saved until we get to an emergency situation .
Well , the people of the Arctic might say they are in an emergency situation now , ” said conference organizer Mike MacCracken .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In actual fact , a recent expedition to an East Antarctic ice shelf showed “ no sign of higher temperatures despite fears of a thaw linked to global warming ” .
In addition , Arctic sea ice expanded over an area bigger than the size of Germany during the year of 2008 , a 30 per cent increase , after global warming alarmists had claimed that it would be “ ice - free ” for the first time ever .
With areas all over the planet experiencing record snowfall and plunging temperatures , some scientists are warning that we are now entering into a mini ice age , with 30 years of global cooling predicted .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Governments are already geoengineering the planet in the form of cloud seeding and similar techniques to both cause and prevent rainfall .
Many would argue that the upper atmosphere is already being seeded with chemical compounds in the form of chemtrails , which differ from normal contrails emitted by airplanes as they hang in the air for hours and produce criss - cross patterns .
A 2008 KSLA news investigation found that a substance that fell to earth from a high altitude chemtrail contained high levels of Barium ( 6.8 ppm ) and Lead ( 8.2 ppm ) as well as trace amounts of other chemicals including arsenic , chromium , cadmium , selenium and silver .
Of these , all but one are metals , some are toxic while several are rarely or never found in nature .
The newscast focuses on Barium , which its research shows is a “ hallmark of chemtrails . ”
KSLA found Barium levels in its samples at 6.8 ppm or “ more than six times the toxic level set by the EPA . ”
KSLA also asked Mark Ryan , Director of the Poison Control Center , about the effects of Barium on the human body .
Ryan commented that “ short term exposure can lead to anything from stomach to chest pains and that long term exposure causes blood pressure problems . ”
The Poison Control Center further reported that long - term exposure , as with any harmful substance , would contribute to weakening the immune system , which many speculate is the purpose of such man-made chemical trails .
As we have previously highlighted , a prominent supporter of geoengineering proposals is none other than White House science czar John P. Holdren , a key Obama advisor who infamously co-authored a book in which he called for a “ planetary regime ” to enforce draconian population control measures such as forced abortion , infanticide and mandatory sterilization .
In April last year , Holdren revealed that high - level talks had already taken place to explore the possibility of “ geoengineering ” the environment by “ shooting pollution particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun ’s rays ” .
“ It ’s got to be looked at , ” Holdren was quoted as saying , “ We do n’t have the luxury of taking any approach off the table . ”
The AP also reported that Holdren said he had raised the concept in administration discussions .
Letting modern day eugenicists like Holdren mess with the planet would be like handing Dr. Josef Mengele control of the health care system .
Holdren has proven himself to be a barbarian and a control freak , promoting a brand of bloodthirsty eugenics even more depraved than anything Hitler proposed in his drive for a super race .
Allowing scientists who have been completely exposed as agenda - promoting quacks by the Climategate scandal to experiment with the environment on a mass scale in the name of stopping the increasingly debunked premise of man-made global warming is absolute lunacy and should be stopped at all costs .

Jon Gosselin is in immediate financial trouble now that his divorce from Kate Gosselin is final ... because he got nailed with huge child support payments and has no real way of paying ... sources tell TMZ .
We 've learned under the arbitrator 's award , Jon must make huge child support payments -- we 're told 5 figures a month .
And here 's the problem .
TLC has now shut down Jon 's ability to take outside jobs .
The irony -- he did himself in .
We 've also learned Jon was charged every penny of the $ 235,000 that he withdrew from their joint account .
That amount was deducted from his piece of the settlement .
As for Jon 's claim that Kate should be docked for money she withdrew ... we 've learned Jon struck out .
The arbitrator determined every penny she withdrew was for the benefit of the kids .
Under the terms of the divorce decree , Kate has primary custody and Jon gets visitation -- both Jon and Kate agreed to that in advance .
And , they agreed , neither party would get spousal support .
Score a big one for Mark Momjian , Kate 's lawyer .
Editor 's note :
To commemorate the seventieth anniversary of New York 's beloved Murray 's Cheese , our Tam Ngo visited the cheese shop to make mozzarella with the pros .
— The Mgmt .
Making mozzarella at home is ridiculously easy , especially if you 've got Kevlar hands .
Mozzarella is a pasta - filata style of cheese which involves hand - stretching hot curds into pliable strands .
Like pulling bread dough , the point is to manipulate it just enough to improve elasticity , but not so much as to toughen the thing .
At Murray 's Mozzarella Making class at Murray 's Cheese in New York , I learned that my desk job makes me ill - equipped to endure blazing hot baths of cheese .
These pampered hands turn a furious pink at any temperature above tepid .
As Taylor Cocalis , our instructor , praised the moisturizing virtues of whey , I cursed my milk - scabied fingers and the lactic acid that aggrieved them .
( A tip for those with similarly tender digits : a triple layer of Latex gloves . )
Raw hands aside , the class was a raging success .
Taylor moved us through instruction with such efficiency , I managed to make two pounds of mozzarella before the night was over .
( I am still eating through the bounty . )
Be sure to check out Murray 's website for their budding roster of hands - on courses .

More must be done to tackle the growing threat of extremist violence in Yemen , Gordon Brown has said .
Speaking on BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show , the prime minister said Britain was working with the US to strengthen counter - terrorism operations there .
His remarks follow last month 's alleged attempt to blow up a plane over Detroit by a man suspected of being trained by a Yemen - based al - Qaeda offshoot .
He spoke as the US and UK shut their embassies in Yemen .
The Foreign Office said the British embassy had closed " for security reasons " .
The US embassy cited " ongoing threats " by an al - Qaeda offshoot and urged US citizens in Yemen to be vigilant and aware of security .
It comes a day after top US soldier Gen David Petraeus visited the country to pledge US support for its fight with al - Qaeda .
Since the alleged bomb attempt on Christmas Day , Downing Street and the White House have been looking at ways to increase counter - terrorism co-operation , Downing Street said .
YEMEN FACTS
Population : 23.6 million ( UN , 2009 )
Capital : Sanaa
Major language : Arabic
Major religion : Islam
Oil exports : $ 1.5bn/24.5 m barrels ( Jan - Oct 2009 )
Income per capita : US $ 950 ( World Bank , 2008 )
Obama blames al - Qaeda Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Suspect ' not radicalised in UK ' PM calls Yemen summit Somalia 's Islamist rivalry Send us your comments
In a statement , Downing Street highlighted a number of joint efforts that were already in place , including a counter - terrorism police unit in Yemen and support for its coastguard operation .
Gordon Brown stressed more was still needed .
" Yemen has been recognised , like Somalia , to be one of the areas where ... we 've got to do more , " he said .
" So it 's strengthening counter - terrorism co-operation , it 's working harder on the intelligence efforts .
" And of course it 's ... how we can prevent the perversion of a good religion , Islam , by a group of people who will stop at nothing in a murderous ideology that tries to create a caliphate , tries to create the sense that everybody is an enemy except those people who believe in a particular version of Islam . "
The Downing Street statement set out Mr Brown 's other intentions : • Have the evolving threat from Yemen and Somalia placed on the agenda for the EU General Affairs Council in January • Push for stronger action on Yemen from the Financial Action Task Force , an intergovernmental body set up to combat terrorist financing • Discuss further the UK's response to the suspected bomb plot at a special meeting of the National Security , International Relations and Development committee ( NSID ) Earlier , there was confusion over whether counter - terrorism operations outlined in Downing Street 's press statement were new .
It prompted shadow home secretary Chris Grayling to accuse the prime minister of " spin " and playing politics with terrorism .
Following the alleged bomb attack , Yemen said it had the will and ability to deal with al - Qaeda , but needed the West to provide more training , military equipment and transport .
Gen Petraeus , who is responsible for US Middle East and Central Asian operations , has said the US would more than double counter - terror aid to Yemen this year .
During his visit , he met Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh to discuss the militant threat .
Yemeni officials said they had sent more troops to fight al - Qaeda militants in the provinces of Abyan , Baida and Shabwa .
On Saturday , US President Obama for the first time publicly accused an offshoot of al - Qaeda , based in Yemen , over the alleged airline plot by Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab .

In Staraya Poltavka someone Igor Boldenkov lives and creates miniature copies of weapons .
Have a look at the fruits of his hobby .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House is reviewing a plan that would require the Justice Department and FBI to consult with the intelligence community before deciding whether to inform terrorism suspects arrested in the United States that they have the right to remain silent and to consult with an attorney , according to the Washington Post .
Senior administration officials said the proposed change in policy is the result of a review ordered by President Barack Obama , the paper reported in its Saturday edition .
It follows a controversy over the handling of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a Nigerian accused of trying to blow up a plane headed to Detroit on Christmas Day and who was read his so - called “ Miranda ” legal rights 10 hours after his arrest .
“ We are analyzing lessons learned ( in the case ) with the goal of ensuring full information from across the government is available to law enforcement personnel on the ground as they conduct interrogations and make decisions on how to handle terrorist suspects , ” the paper quoted a senior administration official as saying .
“ The final decision about Miranda and other law enforcement decisions will continue to lie with the FBI and the Justice Department , ” added the official , who requested anonymity because the new procedures have not yet been approved .
Republicans have criticized the Obama administration for not consulting with intelligence agencies before FBI agents read Abdulmutallab his rights .
They say the decision cost the United States valuable intelligence .
Let me start with the bottom line and then tell you how I got there : I ca n’t agree with President Obama ’s decision to escalate in Afghanistan .
I ’d prefer a minimalist approach , working with tribal leaders the way we did to overthrow the Taliban regime in the first place .
Given our need for nation - building at home right now , I am ready to live with a little less security and a little - less - perfect Afghanistan .
I recognize that there are legitimate arguments on the other side .
At a lunch on Tuesday for opinion writers , the president lucidly argued that opting for a surge now to help Afghans rebuild their army and state into something decent  to win the allegiance of the Afghan people  offered the only hope of creating an “ inflection point , ” a game changer , to bring long - term stability to that region .
May it be so .
What makes me wary about this plan is how many moving parts there are 
Afghans , Pakistanis and NATO allies all have to behave forever differently for this to work .
But here is the broader context in which I assess all this :
My own foreign policy thinking since 9/11 has been based on four pillars :
1. The Warren Buffett principle : Everything I ’ve ever gotten in life is largely due to the fact that I was born in this country , America , at this time with these opportunities for its citizens .
It is the primary obligation of our generation to turn over a similar America to our kids .
2 . Many big bad things happen in the world without America , but not a lot of big good things .
If we become weak and enfeebled by economic decline and debt , as we slowly are , America may not be able to play its historic stabilizing role in the world .
If you did n’t like a world of too - strong - America , you will really not like a world of too - weak - America  where China , Russia and Iran set more of the rules .
Global Special Variables
There are quite a few variables that are global in the fullest sense -- they mean the same thing in every package .
If you want a private copy of one of them , you must localize it in the current block .
Variable Contents Mnemonic
$ _ The default input and pattern - searching space .
The following pairs are equivalent : while ( <> ) {... # equivalent only in while !
while ( $ _ =< > ) {... /^Subject :/
$ _ =~ /^Subject :/ y/a-z/ A-Z/
$ _ =~ y/a-z / A- Z/ chop
chop ( $_ ) underline is understood to be underlying certain undertakings
$ .
The current input line number of the last filehandle that was read .
Rember that only an explicit close on the filehandle resets the line number .
many programs use .
to mean the current line number
$/ The input record separator , newline by default .
$/ may be set to a value longer than one character in order to match a multi-character delimiter .
If $ / is undefined , no record separator is matched , and < FILEHANDLE > will read everything to the end of the current file .
/ is used to delimit line boundries when quoting poetry .
Or , if you prefer , think of mad slashers cutting things to ribbons .
$ \ The output record separator for the print operator .
You set $\ instead of adding
at the end of the print .
$ , The output field separator for the print operator .
What is printed when there is a , in your print statement
$ " This is similar to $ , except that it applies to array values interpolated into a double - quoted string ( or similar interpreted string ) .
Default is space .
Obvious , I think
$# The output format for numbers display via the print operator # is the number sign
$ $ The process number of the Perl running this script Same as shells
$ ?
The status returned by the last pipe close , backtick ( `` ) command or system operator .
Note that this is the status word returned by the wait ( ) system call , so the exit value of the subprocess is actually ( $? >>*). $? & 255 gives which signal , if any , the process died from , and whether there was a core dump .
Similar to sh and ksh
$* Set to 1 to do multi- line matching within a string , 0 to tell Perl that it can assume that strings contain a single line , for the purpose of optimizing pattern matches .
Default is 0 * matches multiple things
$ 0 Contains the name of the file containing the Perl script being executed .
Depending on your OS , it may or may not include the full pathname .
Same as sh and ksh
$ [ The index of the first element in an array , and of the first character in a substring .
[ begins subscripts
$ ]
The first part of the string printed out when you say perl - v .
It can be used to determine at the beginning of a script whether the Perl interpreter executing the script is in the right range of versions .
If used in a numeric context , $ ] returns version + patchlevel /1000 .
Is this version of Perl in the " rightbracket " ?
$ ; The subscript separator for multi-dimensional array emulation .
If you refer to an associative array element as : $ foo{$a , $b, $c}
it really means :
$ foo{join ( $ ; , $ a , $ b , $ c ) }
but do n't put
@foo{$a , $b, $c}
which means
( $ foo{$a} , $foo{$b} , $foo{$c} ) Comma ( the syntactic subscript separator ) is a semi-semicolon .
Yeah , it 's pretty lame , but $ , is already taken for something more important .
$ !
If used in a numeric context , yields the current value of errno , with all the usual caveats .
( This means that you should n't depend on the value of $ ! to be anything in particular unless you 've gotten a specific error return indicating a system error . )
If used in a string context , yields the corresponding sysem error string .
What just went bang ?
Andy Martin Calls Mark Kirk " De Facto Pedophile " In New Ad
By Marcus Gilmer in News on Jan 6 , 2010 3:45 PM
Photo via by claiming his opponent - U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk - was gay , is at it again , this time attacking Kirk for covering up pedophilia in the United States Congress .
The minute - long ad began airing on local radio today .
So how did Kirk - and Dennis Hastert - cover up pedophilia ?
By not stopping Mark Foley 's infamous affairs with underaged staffers .
Martin hits a new nadir when , in the ad , he makes clear that , " Kirk is not a pedophile , " but then feels compelled to add that since Kirk helped to " cover up " Foley 's trysts , that makes Kirk " a de facto pedophile . "
No. Really .
He says that .
Listen to the ad below :
So once again , Martin is playing with fire .
Accusations of a cover-up ?
Well , that 's one thing .
But playing the " pedophile " card - right after the accusations of homosexuality ?
Damn .
Martin only digs his hole deeper by the " he 's not but he is " trick , a loophole by which he still manages to drop what he calls a " bunker buster . "
It 's still a long road to February 2 .
Nearly two years after Moe ( and everyone else ) criticized Lori Gottlieb 's advice to just settle for Mr. Maybe , Gottlieb came back .
And so did her critics , and some evidence showing why exactly her advice is crap .
Advertisement
Gottlieb 's bullshit starts from one basic premise : nothing is as terrible as ending up without a husband .
Despite being single herself , she knows that no married woman could possibly be as genuinely unfulfilled and unhappy as a single woman .
Also , she 's certain that the reason she ended up single is that she was too picky ( read : shallow ) about the men she deemed not - right - for - her in her twenties , with whom she could have been better off — if not , you know , happy — so she now believes that the road to something akin to non-misery runs straight through the guy you do n't think you really want to go out with .

Moe 's response was :
In fact , that 's a good rule of thumb , if you constantly find yourself dating dudes for whom you think you are too good , that is probably the personality flaw that is keeping you from the perfect Mr. Right type characters you think you deserve .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
In this , I think we all agree .
If " settling " means finding a little maturity , dating guys because they are interesting people and treat you with respect and with whom you have things in common instead of dating guys because your mom hates them or they are taller than you , that 's a good start .
If you define it as " settling " because he is 5 ' 6 " rather than 5 ' 9 " , then you 're the one with the problem .
The bigger issue , for me , is the idea that almost any husband is better than no husband .
Julia Baird has the same problem .
But it 's a leap of illogic to suggest that the answer is for women to settle for humdrum marriages with men you tolerate so you can have a father for your children .
How insulting for men : imagine going to a boyfriend 's house and seeing Marry Her : The Case for Settling for Ms. Good Enough on his shelves .

It 's unfair to you , and it 's unfair to the man in question — who , in all likelihood , could find someone who actually , you know , loves him — and it does nothing but set both of you up for disappointment .
If a husband is the goal , they 're not hard to find or , if the divorce rate is anything to go by , to lose .
And as anyone who has been in a long - term unhappy relationship knows damn well , it is often just as easy to be lonely in a relationship as lonely without one .
Want some examples of how this works in practice ?
James Delingpole has a whole host of them in his article The Secret Lives Of Married Men , in which he purports to reveal the essential truths of maleness : namely , that married guys all cheat ( or desperately want to ) , lie and think their wives are more their mothers than their partners !
It makes marriage sound wicked awesome .
For example :
" I think most men see their wives as authority figures that they have to rebel against .
Sometimes I 'll nip outside for a sneaky fag , not because I 'm a smoker , but because of how much my wife hates it .

Paging Dr. Freud !
Somebody 's got unresolved mommy issues , and he 's not alone .
There 's also this fabulous dad :
" And it 's not that I do n't love my kids ; I adore them more than anything .
It 's just that I like them to see me at my best , when I 'm doing fun stuff with them , rather than worn down with tedious ferrying duties : recorder concerts , ballet classes , that kind of thing . "

You know , the shit his mother did for him !
What a bitch she must have been .
Oh , and then there are the guys who hide their financial situation from their wives , since it's not of their wives ' business what they do with " their " dough .
" I 'm not sure when I 'm going to finally clear my debts , but till then , what the wife does n't know is n't going to hurt her , is it ? "

Oh , the ladies and their math skills !
And other guys figure their wives are only in it for the wallet and the sperm - donor anyway ( paging Lori Gottlieb ! ) , so they 're off the hook as long as they 've given her what she wants .
And if the thought of a guy treating you as a mother - figure against whom he ought to rebel , or keeping you in the dark about your mutual financial situation does n't get your ovaries a- tingling , we can always get to the cheaters , the wankers and the whoremongers .
They look at internet porn , fearing you 'll be offended and scold them likes their mothers did ; they dream about boning other hot ladies and know that , since you 're not that interested in sex , you have no idea how hard it is to be monogamous ; they cheat and tell themselves that , since you must know , it 's a " tacit arrangement " ; and they engage in risky sexual behavior and claim that what happens in Vegas , stays in Vegas because everyone knows STIs never follow you anywhere .
It 's a great read , really .

What 's the commonality between these guys , other than their massive Oedipal issues , their inability to view their wives and partners as intellectual and emotional equals and preference to lie ?
Not a one of them talks about how in love they are , how connected they are : it 's all about the drudgery , the children , the house , the Marriage ( as though its another child they just need to keep alive and get off to college ) .
In fact , they 're all describing the relationships Gottlieb lauds in her writing as better than being alone .
Tara Parker - Pope , writing for the New York Times , has a slightly different perspective : she focuses on relationships where husbands and wives have unequal economic status that tilts in favor of the wives or totally equality .
Guess what ?
Those marriages tend to last longer .
Today , the statistics show that typically , the more economic independence and education a woman gains , the more likely she is to stay married .
And in states where fewer wives have paid jobs , divorce rates tend to be higher , according to a 2009 report from the Center for American Progress .

The other thing statistics show is that women who have economic independence and education tend to get married later .
In fact , it 's almost like these women do n't settle ... and then they are less likely to get divorced .
Hmm .
Take this example :
" Women no longer need to marry up educationally or economically , so they are more likely to pick men who support a more egalitarian relationship , " said Stephanie Coontz , director of research and education for the Council on Contemporary Families and author of Marriage , A History : How Love Conquered Marriage .
She pointed to herself as an example .
" In my marriage , I have more education and , because he 's retired , more income , " she said .
" I picked him not because I needed a meal ticket , but because I liked the fact that he respected me and had no problem sharing the responsibilities of daily life with me .
More and more women now are able to make those choices . "
Advertisement
I 'd rather be 40 and married to someone like Coontz 's husband than in my peak fertility ignoring any of Dilingpole 's friends ' myriad lies to keep my relationship intact .
In fact , that 's the exact choice I 've made , and , believe me , it 's not one that I regret .
So , settle if you must , so as not to end up like Lori Gottlieb : 42 , embittered and still single with a kid .
Just do n't be too surprised if you end up 42 , embittered and divorced with a kid and an ex you can't stand .
At least you 'll know you settled .

( Newser ) – Saying the US and Europe “ have no moral authority ” to control the aid going to Haiti , Somali pirates say they plan to donate booty from their hijackings to the relief effort .
The pirates have taken in more than $ 150 million in the past 2 years , by one estimate , and now aim to redistribute some while thumbing their noses at the Western powers .
“ They are the ones pirating mankind for many years , ” a spokespirate tells Agencia Matriz del Sur .

Adrian Sutil has given a frank assessment of the newest track on the F1 calendar , telling the Times of India the circuit was safe but “ boring ” :
Abu Dhabi was one of the most perfect circuits I have driven on , and the most boring as well .
It was just straight and really , really boring .
But I probably cannot say anything bad about it for it ’s safe , like what all modern circuits should be .
Adrian Sutil
He added that most drivers wanted more dangerous and challenging circuits :
The majority of the drivers feel this way .
Of course there are a few who like the way it is , safe .
There will always be different opinions about it but most of them would say there can be some changes in the circuits .
Everyone loves driving because there is thrill in it .
If it was not dangerous , maybe so many drivers would not be doing it .
Maybe there are certain risks in it but if you do n’t take those risks , it would get boring .
Circuits are getting too safe and driving is not so nice anymore .
Personally speaking , I ’m just not getting that thrill .
There is a wall in the corner and you have got to take it easy or you would ram into it .
Formula
One is dangerously fast and is all about speed .
That ’s why it ’s interesting and we should keep it like that .
Adrian Sutil
Sutil urged the team working on the circuit for the 2011 Indian Grand Prix to listen to the drivers and put in more fast corners .
But F1 car designers , such as Sam Michael and Paddy Lowe , have been arguing for something different : more overtaking opportunities on circuits , which tends to mean long straights bookended by slow hairpins .
The Indian F1 track designed by Hermann Tilke and revealed last November looks consistent with most recent new F1 designs , with lots of slow corners .
I think F1 needs variety – slow , twisty tracks like Monaco and Hungary , high - speeds courses like Monza and Spa , and ‘ overtaking optimised ’ tracks like Bahrain .
A calendar of identikit tracks each with a prescribed combination of long straights , slow bends and the occasional token fast corner , would not be very exciting .
But I also wonder if some of Sutil ’s rivals think F1 is quite dangerous enough with him around , particularly Kimi R?�? �ikk ?�? �nen , Jarno Trulli and Nick Heidfeld who all tangled with him last year .

It amuses me darkly to see the reaction of the so - called “ civilized world ” turn from schadenfreude at the plight of the Chinese , to denial and worry , to full - blown panic in the past month , as the Coronavirus spreads unchecked to our own communities now .
However I ca n’t help but see similarities in these reactions to the ones we have to the climate apocalypse , albeit at something like 3 orders of magnitude faster pace .
Like the climate catastrophe , nations not yet affected have been assuming nothing bad will come out of the Coronavirus and that business as usual should continue .
Any steps of preparation were sporadic and isolated , from a few “ doomers ” , often ridiculed by the smug people who assumed this epidemic would simply fizzle out like the Ebola , or SARS .
They do n’t realize , of course , that those diseases might have only fizzled out due to an immediate and good response .
But it ’s on our nature to label any successful attempt to prevent the worse as an “ over - reaction ” to something that “ would n’t have been a big deal ” .
Frustratingly I see this daily in how many companies perceive investment in their IT departments as an overall loss .
The calls of “ climate panic ” of climate deniers map very well to the denials and conspiracies created by people when Coronavirus first appeared on the scene .
It is for this reason that Europe and US have completely squandered all the time and lesson bought by the Chinese response .
And by the time the effects of the pandemic were felt in the western cities , it was way to late to mount an effective response , and the cost of that response is likewise orders of magnitude what it could have been had measures been taken early enough .
Likewise , by the time the real effects of the climate catastrophe start being felt in an undeniable manner , it will be way too late to salvage it .
The cost to the existing sociopolitical systems will be prohibitive and thus nothing significant will be effected .
The people in power assume that they will be spared the worst of a catastrophe , but as Coronavirus spreads indiscriminately and the old plutocrats realize their money cannot shield them , so will the collapse of modern civilization from climate catastrophe make their power vanish into thin air as their private security forces realize who has the power in an apocalyptic situation .
The worst thing in my opinion is that we cannot even use this epidemic as an effective wake - up experience because of the timescale of the climate .
To mount an solid response to the global warming , we should have started 30 years ago , but like Coronavirus , we simply squandered out rime into business as usual because “ it has n’t happened yet ” .
In the scale of climate Catastrophe I speculate we are at the phase Coronavirus was two weeks ago .
Some isolated nations have felt the brutal effects , but they were either not significant enough , or those nations themselves could somehow be blamed for it .
By the time the climate catastrophe finally manages to panic as many people as Coronavirus has today ( 5 - 10 years I expect ) , it will be too late to do much about it .

Omar Rodriguez - Lopez , the sonic wizard behind art - rock band The Mars Volta , is a guitar god to be feared .
But indie film should watch its back , too .
On Thursday , his directorial debut , The Sentimental Engine Slayer , premieres at the International Film Festival in Rotterdam , Netherlands .
" I never intended to do anything with this film besides go through the process , learn from it and then move on to the next , " Rodriguez - Lopez , 34 , told Wired.com in an e-mail interview .
" Now that I 'm dealing with the reality that it is getting invited to these festivals , and that the film is no longer ' mine , ' I am nervous as all hell ! "
( Read Wired.com 's full Q&A , " Omar Rodriguez - Lopez 's Sentimental Education , " which includes the director 's list of must - see movies . )
Like much of Rodriguez - Lopez 's musical work , The Sentimental Engine Slayer is a semi-autobiographical coming - of - age story steeped in the drugs and drama of a youth spent swimming upstream in desolate El Paso , Texas .
Rodriguez - Lopez did n't just direct the movie – he stars in it , playing the lead role of Barlam , a young man running with hustlers , whores and drug addicts .
Still , the movie is a much quieter affair than The Mars Volta 's epic , electrifying musical mash of punk , funk and rock .
( Check out the clip above . )
Working both sides of the camera 's lens made Rodriguez - Lopez 's Sentimental education easier , not harder .
" What at first seemed like a distraction from my duties as a filmmaker quickly became my ally in realizing the film , " said Rodriguez - Lopez , whose previous films , 2001's A Manual Dexterity and 2003's Letters From Dystopia , have yet to be released .
" This sink - or - swim situation forced me to overcome my fears and actually enjoy living the film in such a profound way with the other actors . "
Living in profundity has become harder since Rodriguez - Lopez and singer Cedric Bixler - Zavala , the guitarist 's childhood friend and artistic compatriot , first tore eardrums and brains apart with The Mars Volta 's deafening 2001 concept album , De-Loused in the Comatorium .
That release was a shattering follow - up to Relationship of Command , the 2000 classic from Rodriguez - Lopez and Bixler - Zavala 's former group , At the Drive - In .
Together , the records ' cerebral noise heralded the return of epic concept rock for the digital age .
But during our still - young century , technology has increasingly freed and enslaved us , argues Rodriguez - Lopez .
The dizzying result has been a new strain of apathy that threatens to sever our social bonds .
" I 'm repulsed and attracted to technology 's double - edged sword , " Rodriguez - Lopez said .
" What in one way is bringing us all together like never before is also separating us in so many different ways .
" We are losing myth , " he added , " which , as Carl Jung , Octavio Paz and so many others say , is the very thread of what holds a society , and all its wonders , together .
And we 're trading it in for an exclusively scientific , corporate and globalized culture of convenience .
As Jello Biafra predicted , ' Give me convenience or give me death ! ' is our new American slogan . "
That convenient laziness extends to Rodriguez - Lopez 's chief instrument , the guitar .
Whether it has shown up in The Mars Volta or Rodriguez - Lopez 's solo work , side projects and cinematic efforts , his playing has placed him among rock royalty like Jimi Hendrix , Carlos Santana and Jimmy Page .
Sadly , Rodriguez - Lopez is n't sure the guitar will survive our densely interconnected but socially estranged digital age .
" As one of my little brother 's friends once asked me , ' Why play guitar when Guitar Hero is easier and so much fun ? ' "
Rodriguez - Lopez said .
" How many times have we seen people at a table together , but each alone on their iPhones or BlackBerries ?
I guess , in the end , we are together in our solitude . "

On Sunday , January 17th , Sebastian Pinera defeated Eduardo Frei , the candidate of the governing coalition ( Concertacion ) , becoming the first candidate from the right wing to win Chile ’s presidency since 1958 .
Although Pinera campaigned as a moderate , his coalition ( Alliance for Chile ) includes former supporters of the Pinochet dictatorship — the National Renewal Party and the very conservative Independent Democratic Union .
The majority of Pinera ’s members of Parliament come from the IDU , two of his top campaign advisers held posts in the dictatorship and a third is a former Pinochet minister .
Pinera is a billionaire – the 3rd wealthiest person in Chile – and is principal shareholder in LAN airlines and owner of Chilevision television .
His investments also include stakes in Chile ’s national champion soccer team and an upscale Santiago hospital .
Already concerns have been voiced about conflicts of interest , and he will clearly be a pro-big business president .
The election is being hailed by some as a shift to the right – and clearly the policies of the Pinera government will represent that .
At a news conference called by leaders of the Juntos Podemos Mas coalition , Guillermo Teillier , one of the newly elected Communist members of Parliament , said , “ This is indisputably bad news for Chile and for Latin America … and will not bring more democracy , equality , or social justice . ”
However , even a cursory look reveals that Pinera ’s victory was not due to a rightward shift in Chileans ’ politics – starting with the fact that in the first round , the three center - left candidates ’ combined vote totaled 56 % , and the outgoing president , socialist Michelle Bachelet has an 80 % approval rating .
So what did happen ?
First , Pinera campaigned as a moderate , and pledged to expand the Concertacion ’s health - care and jobs programs for the middle class and poor .
He also vowed to help small businesses and boost investment in state - owned Codelco , the world ’s largest copper producer .
He has pledged to respect human rights and disavows any support for the anti-democratic legacy of the Pinochet years .
Two , the widespread dissatisfaction with the Concertacion was at least partly due to its pro-corporate , privatization ( neoliberal ) growth model .
The deal that was worked out in the transition from the dictatorship explicitly excluded the left and relied on powersharing with the right .
Despite being one of the wealthier countries of Latin America , Chile has the widest gulf between rich and poor , which has sharpened given the private control of water , pensions , unemployment compensation , health care and education .
Numerous corruption scandals in the government and concerns about crime were also big issues for voters .
Another obvious factor that allowed Pinera to win was that the opposition was split , and included a new and unknown quantity in the candidacy of Marco Enriquez Ominami , who campaigned as an independent alternative to the traditional left , and appealed to younger voters .
During the run-off campaign , Ominami was slow to support Frei , and when he finally did so , he asked his supporters to vote for “ the one who was president before , ” and only referred to Frei by name when talking about candidates “ of the past , ” in which category he included Pinera .
Finally , Chile ’s electoral system was rigged during the dictatorship to favor the right .
Election districts were wildly gerrymandered to protect right - wing representation , and the system was set up to prevent participation by small party candidates , and those aligned with social movements .
And over the 20 years of the Concertacion ’s rule , alienation from politics , especially electoral politics , had grown .
The victory in the first round election ( December 13 ) of three leading Communists , who did an end run around the restrictive electoral system by putting forward a combined list with Concertacion candidates in a number of Congressional districts , goes against the notion of a shift to the right .
In the initial news conference press statement , Teiller declared that their focus will be the 12 point program put forth by the left and accepted by Frei during the campaign , which calls for a new Constitution , the nationalization of water , greater attention to and resources for health care and education , halting privatization , increasing labor and democratic rights , including for Chile ’s indigenous peoples , and the protection and retention of the profits from Chile ’s resources and especially its copper industry .
“ The main thing , ” said Teiller , “ will be to continue to fight for workers ’ rights . ”
Another major concern is the “ truth and justice process , ” which includes allowing the many cases involving Pinochet - era human rights abuses still in the court system to be resolved .
Teiller underscored the importance of the December election results , calling these “ partial victories in the struggle against exclusion , ” and which will allow it to “ continue to struggle against exclusion and for democratic reforms , now both from within the Parliament as well as through the mobilization of the people . ”
The government missed its deadline to respond to European allegations arising from the Phorm controversy that UK internet users are not protected against commercial wiretapping .
The European Commission last year set a deadline of 29 December for Whitehall to reply to its reasoned legal opinion that UK privacy laws are not up to agreed standards .
Officials in Brussels wanted an undertaking that the online privacy regime will be tightened .
When that deadline passed the government had not responded , increasing the likelihood of a costly court case at the European Court of Justice , with the possibility of heavy fines to be paid by UK taxpayers if judges find in favour of the Commission .
The Home Office , which is handling the issue , declined to comment on having the missed deadline to respond to the Commission 's final warning .
" We are continuing to engage with the Commission on this issue , " a spokeswoman said .
The Home Office has responsibility for the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) , the main UK law BT and Phorm 's secret trials exposed deficiencies in , according to the Commission .
When it issued its final warning in October , Brussels said parts of RIPA - allowing those intercepting communications for commercial purposes to assume consent if they have " reasonable grounds for believing " it is given - infringe European law .
Under the European ePrivacy Directive , the UK has agreed consent must be " freely given specific and informed indication of a person 's wishes " .
The Commission also said RIPA 's requirement that for sanctions to be applied wiretapping must be " intentional " has no basis under the Directive .
The lack of a UK regulator to hear complaints about commercial interception , despite a requirement under the ePrivacy Directive , also concerned the Commission .
The Information Commissioner 's Office , which supervises implementation of many parts of the Directive , declined to investigate BT 's secret Phorm trials .
A spokeswoman for the Commission said if and when the government does respond , an official analysis is likely to take several weeks .
The matter will then be passed to Commissioners to decide whether to take the UK to court to force a change in the law .
Separately , it was announced on Monday that a director has quit Phorm .
Stefan Allesch - Taylor , a private equity executive , joined only just over a year ago following a boardroom split .
In the wake of the furore over its secret trials , which were revealed by The Register , the firm has abandoned the UK market .
It conducted a trial with Korea Telecom last and has been rumoured to be hiring in Brazil , but has not made any further announcements on commercial progress . ®
Since they 've taken unto themselves almost every other right available to human beings , especially those that are essential to our democratic society and way of life , it 's time to come out of the boardroom and openly address the proposition :
Why deprive Corporations of their constitutional right to marry ?
Under the privacy , due process and equal protection guarantees of the United States Constitution , corporations deserve the right to marry .
We all know the feeble arguments against this proposition and the parade of horribles inevitably trotted out by anti-corporate fundamentalists to scare us away from honest , rational consideration of the facts .
Top Ten Reasons to Ban Corporate Marriage
It would destroy the definition of marriage approved by the vast majority of United States voters and radically alter what human history has understood marriage to be .
It would be an outrageous decision of activist Supreme Court judges who ignore the will of the people .**
It would lead to our children being taught in public schools that " corporations are people just like you and me " and that " corporate marriage " is the same as traditional marriage .
It would undermine marriage as an essential institution of society .
While death , divorce , or other circumstances may prevent the ideal , the best situation for a child is to be raised by at least two consenting corporations .
State law may require teachers to instruct children as young as kindergarteners about how corporations are equal to ( or often more equal than ) natural persons .
If corporate marriage is allowed , TEACHERS COULD BE REQUIRED to teach young children there is no difference between individual ( natural ) persons and " legal entities " ( aka " un-natural " persons ) like corporations .
Can you imagine where that might lead ?
What 's next , film strips during school assembly indoctrinating our impressionable children with the propoganda that there is nothing wrong with a few important " natural " people using their ownership and managment positions in business corporations to excercise undue economic power and political influence to make sure their interests prevail over the intersts of the vast majority of other people ?
( How a race of men and women ( and their heirs ) , by dint of their corporate ownership and control , came to be so exalted above the rest , and distinguished like some new species , is worth inquiring into , and whether they are the means of happiness or of misery to mankind . )
While we freely acknowledge that corporations may be entitled to their rights to perpetual existence , limited civil and criminal liability and preferential tax treatment , they do not have the right to redefine marriage for everyone else .
If corporate activists want to legalize corporate marriage ( and give corporations full rights of American citizenship ) , they should put it on the ballot .
Instead , they have gone behind the backs of voters and convinced activist judges on the US Supreme Court to redefine marriage for the rest of society .
That is the wrong approach .
This proposition obliterates a distinction for which truly natural and religious reasons can be assigned .
It removes the previous distinction between natural " persons " and un-natural " persons " , it erases the line between " people " and " things " and by such obliteration grants to a select , exhalted few , rights , riches and powers above all others .
Allowing corporate " persons " to marry is by definition " un-natural " and an abomination against God and Nature .
We 've all heard these arguments before .
We 've seen through them and seen them for what they truly are , bigoted , narrow - minded attacks by people who irrationally hate corporations and feel " threatened " by how corporations have already changed our country .
It 's time to stop the charade .
If not now , when ?
If not when , why not ?
The Citizens United v FEC ruling by the US Supreme Court will be the start of a bright new day for America and the world .
It 's time to turn our faces toward that new day and start marching .

While I am present on Facebook as Tobold Stoutfoot , I was n't actually using Facebook all that much up to about a week ago .
Then I read somebody claiming that the future of gaming was Facebook apps , some of which already have millions of players , and I decided to see for myself what the fuzz was about .
I tried out several different Facebook games , and quickly realized certain commonalities .
These games all work along the same simple lines :1) Gameplay is extremely simple , and does not require a whole lot of tactical or strategic thought .
Basically you click on something , and you get a reward .
The next reward is never more than a few clicks away .
And it is very obvious what to do to get the next reward , so your chance of failure is small .
Facebook games are simple Skinner boxes .2 ) All these apps have some important elements based on real time .
As you are rewarded for a few simple clicks , the game basically needs to stop you from doing those simple clicks for hours repeatedly and rise to the top too fast .
Real time elements are the answer to that , in different forms .
Either your click starts a process for which you can gather the reward only hours later , or you have a maximum number of activity you can do before your pool of energy / stamina / whatever runs out , and you need to wait hours for it to refill .
In consequence you are encouraged to play Facebook games in short spurts , not taking more than a few minutes , but to come back every day , or even several times per day .
3 ) With the real time elements braking you out , it is likely that you feel an urge to advance faster than the game will let you .
But , lo and behold , the Facebook app also offers a way out from that dilemma : Microtransactions .
You can buy yourself more clicks , leading to more rewards per time unit .
Or you can even buy the rewards themselves , for cash .
I begin to see why some people are so rabidly opposed to microtransactions , because with Facebook apps you really see just the worst kind of them .
For those who do n't want to spend money on game advantages directly , there are also lots of indirect ways :
The game company has commercial partners , who will give you whatever reward points the game uses in exchange for you signing up for something like ring - tones , or at least for agreeing to be bombarded with advertising .
4 ) Facebook apps are using the power of social networks .
If you and your friends are playing the same game , you can help each other , even if you are n't online at the same time .
There is always some mechanism which allows you to recruit your friends , and get some in - game advantage from that .
The further you advance in the game , the more often you will actually * need * friends to do certain things .
The Facebook app will also encourage you to plaster your " wall " with announcements of your progress , and even offer your friends rewards if they click on those announcements to join the game .
And that is it , the general principle of Facebook games .
The purpose is rather obvious :
Get people hooked with easy rewards , then block them from gaining those rewards as fast as they want , make them pay you money directly or via another company , and encourage them to invite all their friends to participate .
It is an extremely effective way to make money with games , because much of the game is in the interaction of the players with his friends , and does n't cost the game company anything to produce .
My apologies to those of you who have me as friend of Facebook , and who had to endure a lot of Facebook spam being caused by me trying out the various functionalities of different Facebook games !
Now we could just judge this to be an elaborate scam , and be done with it .
But I 'm not in the business of judging games , I 'm in the business of analyzing them .
While I find these Facebook apps to be somewhat distasteful , I do recognize that they " work " .
Which makes me think that instead of using the working part to squeeze out the maximum amount of money from players , and entice them to get their friends hooked as well , for a minimum amount of game actually delivered , we could use the same principles to make good games even better .
One thing these Facebook games do really well is to allow players to cooperate even if they are not online at the same time .
That is an element which is often missing in MMORPGs .
The requirement to be online at the same time , and in some cases the additional requirement to stay online together for consecutive blocks of hours , is a strong limitation to classic MMORPGs .
Even communication in - game between friends and guild - mates is often quite limited , which is why pretty much every guild in every game has a website * outside * the game .
MMORPGs could learn a lot here from Facebook apps : Guilds could have cooperative in - game projects to which every guild member can contribute at his own pace and timing .
MMORPGs could be integrated with social network websites , where your character info would always automatically be up to date , and you 'd automatically be part of the social group representing your guild .
Guild forums and raid calendars could be part of that social network group functionality , and be accessible both from inside the game and from outside , via a browser or even via a smart phone .
In short , Facebook apps are using some quite powerful social engineering tools .
And just like most tools , they can be used for different purposes , good or bad .
Just like a hammer can be used for bashing somebody 's head in , or for something constructive , these social engineering tools can be used for fleecing suckers on Facebook , or to create the next generation of MMORPGs .
I am a rich person .
By the end of this article , you might conclude that you are a rich person too .
I ’ve long since wondered what I should do with the awkwardness that I feel knowing that I am rich in the presence of those with whom I minister .
A little about my context :
My wife and I live in Alotau ( city ) , Milne Bay Province , Papua New Guinea ( country ) .
I live a double life .
To many of you , I ’m the financial guy who blogs about the topic of money and the Bible .
However , what you do n’t see is that I spend most of my day sitting with , talking to , studying with , and getting to know the world ’s poor .
Most of my closest PNG friends make under $ 1,000 USD per year .
There is a huge gulf .
I am a rich man in the midst of the poor .
These pictures are taken at the house of one of the people I interviewed .
What Do The Poor Have To Say About The Rich ?
After church one Sunday , I asked some folks from church if they would n’t mind coming to my house to help me work on a project .
The instructions were blissfully unclear and everyone willingly agreed .
They also do n’t know that I live a double life .
Only a couple in the group had ever even heard of the Internet and none of them knew I was doing any writing on the topic of Bible and money .
I invited some fellow church members to my house for lunch .
John , Siggy , Ponifasio , Lorraine , Rizpha , Susan , and Joel are good representatives of the standard of living in and around Alotau .
I fed them some sandwiches so everyone would be in good spirits , and I told them what we were going to talk about – money .
I stated the obvious .
“ I know , and you know I ’m rich ” .
In terms of the world , you would be called ‘ the world ’s poor ’ . ”
I pleaded with them to be completely honest with me – do n’t sugar coat what you want to say – tell me what the world ’s poor have to say about their lives , the rich , and the gospel .
Question # 1 : What must a person accumulate or have to be considered rich ?
The folks in Milne Bay are shy people .
Furthermore , they are n’t given to asking or responding to direct questions .
My question stunned them into silence .
They knew we were about to step onto thin ice .
We were going to talk directly about the topic of wealth and poverty .
For a full 45 seconds everyone avoided eye contact and no one spoke .
I decided I needed to find a backdoor to get access to the information I was seeking .
I went around the room person by person and asked them the question , “ Are you rich ? ”
All , understandably , said no – if I was speaking about material things .
But , there was still one person I did n’t ask the question to – myself .
Question # 2 : What about me ?
Am I rich ?
Almost instantaneously their faces were plastered with sly smirks .
The smirk said it all – of course you are rich .
Shortly thereafter , everyone verbally affirmed their non-verbal expression by saying yes , I am rich .
Question # 3 : So what makes me rich ?
What do I have that makes you think I am rich ?
Interestingly , the first answer was my skin color – I am a Caucasian .
Then they gave some details about what you must possess or have to be categorized as rich :
A job
Car
Shop for food any time you want
House with lights , a house made of materials not taken from the bush
No worries about tomorrow ’s needs
Have pride [ with pride she meant confidence ] and happiness
Have knowledge
Question # 4 : If you could choose to be rich or poor , which would you choose ?
The answers were split 50/50 .
Those who would rather be poor said that even if they had more they might not be satisfied .
They feel like life is easier without many items and they thought ultimately they would be happier with less .
Those who would rather be rich said they wanted the freedom to move around as necessary , they would n’t need to worry about the future , they would have what they need for school fees .
Money would offer them security .
Question # 5 : What does it take to be rich ?
How does one become rich ?
Time , effort , and hard work in the garden
A good family background so good lessons could be passed on from generation to generation
Education
Exposure to the rich – the opportunity to work with or for a rich person
Question # 6 : How do most people feel about rich New Guineans ?
Jealous .
They do n’t think they can do it ( become rich ) and they believe that person must know something that they do not know .
Editor ’s note :
In many third world countries , there is a type of thinking called “ limited goods ” .
Money would be viewed like a pie .
If you take too much money , ( too big of a piece of pie ) I wo n’t be able to get as much .
Compare that to the North American mindset that money is unlimited ; my ability to earn and produce income does not necessarily take away from your ability to earn a living .
Questions # 7 : What are the advantages of being the world ’s poor ?
No fear of robbery
Freedom of time
No worrying about your property
You can live at peace
Do n’t have to worry – you can rest good and you do n’t have to think so much .
The rich have so much on their minds .
Question # 8 : What are the disadvantages of being the world ’s poor ?
Cannot travel – especially cannot see the other places in the world
Cannot get a good education
Lack of money for things like school fess and food
City life is hard because you do n’t get paid enough to manage the needs of your family
Cannot meet needs – what to eat the next day and clothing
Poor health services
Question # 9 : How much of their income do most people spend on food ?
Everything
All of it
99.8 %
Question # 10 : Earlier someone mentioned needs and luxury .
What things would you say are luxuries ?
There was that smart little smirk again .
Everyone tried inconspicuously glancing around my house as if to say , “ look around ” .
TV
Vehicle
Stove
Fridge
Electricity
Clean water
watches
rings
expensive cell phones
Things in the house – toilet and running water
Good house ( defined as having an iron roof )
Air conditioning in the office
House full of food
Cupboards
Tables
Kids ’ education
Question # 11 : For a moment , think specifically about Milne Bay .
What are the best things the rich could be doing with their money to help the world ’s poor ?
Help with school fees
Build a university
Better school teaching and materials
Training and courses for vocational skills
Health services that includes training doctors
Programs to address social issues like drinking .
Rehabilitation .
Sports programs .
Counseling .
The poor think negatively about themselves and look down on themselves .
Sponsor a missionary
Question # 12 : How much should the rich give to the poor ?
Enough
What their hearts are willing to give
Whatever they are satisfied to give .
As they know their giving makes a difference , they might be satisfied to give more .
Question # 13 : If God blesses people who work hard , why are so many hard working people in PNG poor ?
Because of the culture issue .
When someone works , all other family members feed off them .
The working class pays for everyone else and all income is drained by the poor .
Lots of family members live in the same house .
People are expected to help family and so they cannot accumulate any savings .

With that question , I ended the interview .
The next day several people told me how much they loved the interview .
They enjoyed exploring some of these topics and especially felt a sense of relief knowing that the dust was settled and it was all out in the open – I ’m a rich person living in the midst of the poor .
Perhaps in the future I will share some of my responses and reflections , but for now I ’m interested in knowing what you thought about these answers .
What answer stood out to you or challenged you the most ?
Supporters of the expansion say that having more doctors will improve care , by getting doctors to urban and rural areas where they are needed , by shifting care to primary and family practice physicians rather than expensive specialists , and by reducing long waits for people to see a doctor and get the care they need .
But skeptics say that although many parts of the country do need more primary care , American doctors tend to congregate in affluent , urban and suburban areas that already have a generous supply .
They say that doctors create demand for their own services , and that nurse practitioners and physician assistants could fill gaps in medical care at a lower cost .
“ When you add more physicians to an area , they just add more services , and their salaries do n’t go down anywhere near in proportion to the increased supply , ” said Dr. David Goodman , professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and a practicing physician who has studied work force issues for 20 years .
“ More care may not be better , but it certainly is paid for , ” Dr. Goodman said .
Many of the developing medical schools are well aware of such arguments , and are billing themselves as different from traditional medical schools , more focused on serving primary care needs in immigrant and disadvantaged communities .
Administrators say that they expect that approach to be buttressed by a shift in state and federal reimbursements from specialists to primary care doctors .
Riverside County , an inland area with a diverse population including immigrants and Native Americans that has expanded rapidly , has a deficit of about 3,000 physicians , according to Dr. G. Richard Olds , founding dean of the University of California , Riverside School of Medicine .
Riverside has applied for licensing , the first step toward becoming a medical school , and hopes to admit its first four - year class in 2012 , and to have 400 students by 2016 , a typical size for the new crop of schools .
Dr. Olds said his educational focus , building on his background as a tropical disease specialist , would be on prevention and “ wellness . ”
The staggering scope of Haiti 's nightmare came into sharper focus Monday as authorities estimated that 200,000 are dead and 1.5 million homeless in the quake - ravaged heart of this tragic land , where injured survivors still died in the streets , doctors pleaded for help and looters slashed at one another in the rubble .
The world pledged more money , food , medicine and police .
Some 2,000 U.S. Marines steamed into nearby waters .
And ex-President Bill Clinton , a special U.N. envoy , flew in to offer support .
Six days after the earthquake struck , search teams continued to pull buried survivors from the ruins .
But hour by hour , the unmet needs of hundreds of thousands of people grew .
Overwhelmed surgeons appealed for anesthetics , scalpels , saws for cutting off crushed limbs .
Uncounted hundreds of survivors sought to cram onto buses headed out of town .
In downtown streets , others begged for basics .
" Have we been abandoned ?
Where is the food ? " shouted one man , Jean Michel Jeantet .
The U.N. World Food Program said it expected to boost operations from feeding 67,000 people on Sunday to 97,000 on Monday .
But it needs 100 million prepared meals over the next 30 days , and it appealed for more government donations .
" I know that aid cannot come soon enough , " U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said in New York after returning from Haiti .
" Unplug the bottlenecks , " he urged .
Priorities at airport
In one step to reassure frustrated aid groups , the U.S. military agreed to give aid deliveries priority over military flights at the now - U.S. - run airport here , the WFP announced in Rome .
The Americans ' handling of civilian flights had angered some humanitarian officials .
Looting and violence flared again Monday as hundreds clambered over the broken walls of shops to grab anything they could - including toothpaste , now valuable for lining nostrils against the stench of Port - au - Prince 's dead .
Police fired into the air as young men fought over rum and beer with broken bottles and machetes .
Hard - pressed medical teams sometimes had to take time away from quake victims to deal with gunshot wounds , said Loris de Filippi of Doctors Without Borders .
In the Montrissant neighborhood , Red Cross doctors working in shipping containers and saying they " cannot cope " lost 50 patients over two days , said International Red Cross spokesman Simon Schorno .
Amid the debris and the smoke of bodies being burned , dozens of international rescue teams dug on in search of buried survivors .
And on Monday afternoon , about 140 hours after the quake , they pulled two Haitian women alive from a collapsed university building .
At a destroyed downtown bank , another team saved a trapped employee .
Many more dead
The latest casualty report , from the European Commission citing Haitian government figures , doubled previous estimates of the dead from the magnitude - 7.0 quake , to approximately 200,000 , with about 70,000 bodies recovered and trucked off to mass graves .
If accurate , that would make Haiti 's catastrophe about as deadly as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , which killed an estimated 230,000 people in a dozen countries .
European Commission analysts estimate 250,000 were injured and 1.5 million were made homeless .
Masses are living under plastic sheets in makeshift camps and in dust - covered automobiles .
Others have taken to the road seeking out relatives in the safer countryside .
On the capital 's southern edge , thousands of people struggled to get onto brightly painted " tap - tap " buses heading out of town .
" We 've got no more food and no more house , so leaving is the only thing to do , " said Livena Livel , 22 , fleeing with her 1 - year - old daughter and six other relatives to her father 's house in Les Cayes , near Haiti 's western tip .
" At least over there we can farm for food , " she said .
She said she was spending her last cash on the " insanely expensive " bus fare , jacked up to the equivalent of $ 7.70 , three days ' pay for most Haitians , because gasoline prices had doubled .
Water a concern
Getting clean water into people 's hands was still a dire concern .
" People can survive a few days without food but we must try to avoid major outbreaks of waterborne disease , " said Brian Feagans , a spokesman for the aid group CARE .
Clinton , accompanied by his daughter Chelsea , pitched in , helping unload cases of bottled water from their plane to a U.N. truck .
There also remained a " huge demand for lifesaving surgery for those who suffered terrible injuries , " Doctors Without Borders reported .
Late - night hosts have talked about late - night more than anything else this week , so it only makes sense that Jay Leno had Jimmy Kimmel on his show last night for the “ 10 at 10 ” segment .
Bad idea Jay .
After asking Kimmel a few boring questions and getting equally boring answers , Leno asked him to describe the best prank he ever pulled .
Kimmel answered : “ I told a guy that five years from now , I ’m going to give you my show .
Then when the five years came , I took it back almost instantly . ”
Yikes !
Leno reacted with as much embarrassment as his cold heart would allow and moved quickly to the next question , which Kimmel answered with the next dig .
Go ahead , try to make it to the end without cringing .

A 14 - year - old boy in the tribal region of Bajaur , in north - west Pakistan , says he was detained by Taliban forces who tried to turn him into a suicide bomber .
The boy is now in army hands .
He provided a detailed account to BBC correspondent Orla Guerin .
His story cannot be independently verified .
The boy says he was beaten until he agreed to become a suicide bomber
There were five people who came after me from a place in Bajaur .
They tricked me .
They told me they were going to behead my father .
I went with them but my father was n't there .
They tied me up .
They said : ' You have two choices .
We will behead you , or you will become a suicide bomber . '
I refused .
There were two more guys of my age .
They were also training to be suicide bombers .
If we refused they would tie our hands behind our backs , blindfold us and start beating us .
They brainwashed us and told us we would go to heaven .
They said ' there will be honey and juice and God will appear in front of you .
You will have a beautiful house in Heaven ' .
We used to ask them to let us out to pray .
They would reply ' you are already on your way to heaven .
You do n't need to pray . '
They beat me hard for five days .
I was n't given any food .
While they were beating me I agreed to become a suicide bomber .
They separated me from the other boys .
Mosque mission
They took me to a dark room and started giving me pills .
I was handed over to Maulvi Fakir [ the Bajaur Taliban commander ] .
After all this preparation they said I was to go and do the job in a mosque .
Before the Taliban came we used to enjoy freedom .
We used to play , and go to our schools
' Haunting ' Taliban problem
It was an ordinary mosque but the cleric there used to talk against the Taliban , and they declared him their enemy .
They told me the cleric was a non-believer , a non-Muslim .
They took off my shirt and put the jacket on my shoulders .
There were two hooks on my chest .
They told me that when you go there you say ' Allahu Akbar ' [ God is Great ] and then you pull apart these two hooks .
Then they took me there , showed me the mosque and went off .
I was drugged and I could n't feel anything .
I only came to my senses when I arrived in the mosque .
I saw the peaceful kind face of the cleric , and I saw the mosque was full of holy books .
I saw the people praying .
And I thought , they are all Muslims .
How can I do this ?
I decided not to and I came out .
I sat under a tree outside the mosque and waited for prayers to be over .
After that I made my way back to the Taliban .
Then they called me ' a son of a bitch ' and asked why I had come back without doing it .
I told them I could not do it because they were carrying out body searches of all the people entering the mosque .
They took off my vest and handed me over to Maulvi Fakir .
They tied me up but I told them to give me another chance and I would do it .
They trusted me .
I was roaming around with them for a couple of days .
I got to the road , found transport and came home .
They followed me to my house .
They wanted to know if I was still there or had run somewhere else .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement The Taliban had beaten me so harshly my back was scarred .
When my parents saw that my mother started to cry , and told me not to go back to them .
My father asked them why they were after his son .
One day he took his weapon and went after them .
But they wanted to kill him so he came back home and closed the door .
Before the Taliban came we used to enjoy freedom .
We used to play , and go to our schools .
There were no restrictions on us .
Morning and evening we used to play games , and sit and chat with friends .
We used to listen to music on our mobile phones .
They banned that .
They stopped us doing anything .
They stopped us playing cricket and going to school .
We felt like prisoners .
I want to join the army because they are the defenders of the land .
They are fighting for the right cause .
I want to fight against the Taliban .
I have no other intention except to defend my country .
The Taliban should be eliminated .
I want to tell the Taliban that they are cruel , and what they did to me was unjust .
I can't kill innocent Muslims .
I am not afraid of them .
I am only afraid of God .
I am answerable only to Him .

Toward the end of my appearance on the Bill Moyers show I dredged up a quote from FDR but could n’t remember his exact words .
So now ’s my chance to revise and extend my remarks .
The quote is a famous one from a speech he gave shortly before the 1936 election .
Here ’s what he actually said :
We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace — business and financial monopoly , speculation , reckless banking , class antagonism , sectionalism , war profiteering .
They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs .
We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob .
Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today .
They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred .
The point of quoting FDR was simple : I think Barack Obama could use a little more of his attitude .
There are times when you need to be conciliatory —
I think healthcare reform is such a case , for example — but there are times when you need to let people know whose side you ’re on .
When it comes to financial regulatory reform , Obama needs to let us know whose side he ’s on .
Even if he picks some battles he does n’t win , drawing a line in the sand would , at a minimum , change the terms of the conversation and make future reform a little bit easier — and it probably would n’t do any harm to the current efforts .
So : more spine , please , Mr. President .

Grand Staircase Group Tour : 6 Day Journeys
Few are aware sediments a mile + deep have been removed from above the rim of Grand Canyon ( only a global flood can explain such erosion ) .
The layers are picked up in “ The Grand Staircase ” which includes Bryce and Zion National Parks , with remnants found near Grand Canyon .
Bryce is at the top of the Staircase where massive flooding left spires and arches in the multi-colored limestone .
Zion consists of towering sandstone cliffs , as seen at Angel ’s Landing and the Great White Throne , and deep slot canyons , adorned in cream , pink and red hues .
So add time Bryce & Zion to our Rim & Raft trip and you have one of the best , life - changing , Christian vacations outside of Israel !

It is my great honor to be part of a Tuesday , Feb 2 press conference to announce the formation of The American Prayer Hour .
( Press released posted below . )
Why am I doing this ?
Because the secretive group " The Family " and / or " C - Street " organizations of the far loony Right is the sponsor of the current annual Prayer Breakfast .
" The Family " are closely associated with the American and Ugandan evangelical " Christians " who have been trying to impose the death penalty on gay men and women .
This is my chance as a straight , fifty - seven year old practicing Christian , father of three and grandfather of three to step up and show my solidarity with my gay brothers and sisters .
It 's also a chance to try and begin to restore the reputation of Christianity that has for far too long been violated by the Religious Right .
And since in years past ( in the 1970s and 80s ) my family and I played such a leading role in the formation of the Religious Right this is the least I can do to try and correct the horrible hate and polarization we ( my late father Francis Schaeffer and I ) personally helped set in motion ...
Please read our press release below and do all you can to help us pry a national prayer event from the grip of the half - crazed C - Street gang .
It is a scandal that so many " respectable " religious groups from the Right to the Left of the religion spectrum have allowed their good names to be linked to the Family and their nefarious " Reconstructionist " ambitions for America and the world that seeks to impose " biblical law " on our pluralistic society ...
Multi-City Prayer Hour Offers Alternative to the National Prayer Breakfast Whose Leaders Have Apparent Ties to Uganda 's Draconian Anti-Homosexuality Bill 1/20/2010
What : On Tuesday , February 2 , 2010 key religious leaders will hold a press conference to announce the formation of The American Prayer Hour , a multi-city event on Thursday , February 4 , 2010 , with key events in Washington , DC , Dallas , Chicago and Berkeley .
The American Prayer Hour events will affirm inclusive values and call on all nations , including Uganda , to decriminalize the lives of gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people .
The American Prayer Hour provides an alternative to the National Prayer Breakfast , which is sponsored by The Family ( aka The Fellowship ) , a group with disturbing ties to those spearheading Uganda 's oppressive Anti-Homosexuality Bill .
When : Tuesday , February 2 , 2010 - 10:30 a.m. ( EST )
Where : The National Press Club ( Washington , DC ) Murrow Room 529 14th St. NW , 13th Floor - Washington , DC 20045 Who : Bishop Gene Robinson , the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church

If passed , the new law would unleash a vicious campaign of persecution against LGBT citizens .
Bahati and President Museveni are members of The Family and are among their " key men " in Africa .
The Family hosts the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington .
The American Prayer Hour will show that such cruelty and extremism does not represent most people of faith .

The streets have fewer bodies now but the morgue is overwhelmed , and funeral parlors — those that have not collapsed — have more bodies than they can possibly embalm .
The wooden coffins seen in the first few days after the earthquake , lashed to trucks and station wagons , have also become harder to find .
In the narrow streets behind the national cemetery where most of them are built , carpenters said they lacked wood and electricity to make more .
“ They bury you like a dog , ” said Pegles Fleurigine , 51 , in an alleyway where he has built coffins for more than a decade .
“ They do n’t bury you in caskets . ”

Wood chips hung in his wide mustache .
Thin and tall , with a white mask on his forehead , he stood next to a blue and silver coffin , lacquered like a souped - up Cadillac .
“ The people this belongs to , they are trying to get money so they can come and get it , ” he said .
An even starker contrast between death as it was and death post - earthquake could be seen through a fallen wall leading into the national cemetery a few blocks away .
Far into the distance , there were above - ground crypts freshly painted powder blue , with elaborate crosses and poetic names like Famille Leonon Maxi .
Up close , there was a hole with the teeth marks of a backhoe and a half - dozen decaying bodies dumped and left .
Some were too swollen to be recognizable , but at one point on Sunday , a young girl in a white flowered dress stared at a dead young man .
He had the frame of an athlete , and he wore designer jeans with a wide stylish belt .
Sharpleshall Street is a tiny road in north London that is barely visible on the map .
Its name plates are either painted over or obscured by trees , and spotting number 11a is difficult because it is hidden down a small alley .
But in the evening , at least , the entrance to the 10,000 sq ft former dairy and recording studio is illuminated with fairy lights .
Above the door is a sign made with crazy lettering , reminiscent of the word sculptures of the American artist , Jack Pierson , which reads “ Museum of Everything ” .

What , it may be asked , of the verification theory of meaning ?
This phrase has established itself so firmly as a catchword of empiricism that we should be very unscientific indeed not to look beneath it for a possible key to the problem of meaning and the associated problems .
The verification theory of meaning , which has been conspicuous in the literature from Peirce onward , is that the meaning of a statement it the method of empirically confirming or infirming it .
An analytic statement is that limiting case which is confirmed no matter what .
... we can as well pass over the question of meanings as entities and move straight to sameness of meaning , or synonymy .
Then what the verification theory says is that statements arc synonymous if and only if they are alike in point of method of empirical confirmation or infirmation .
This is an account of cognitive synonymy not of linguistic forms generally , but of statements .
However , from the concept of synonymy of statements we could derive the concept of synonymy for other linguistic forms , by considerations some - what similar to those at the end of Section III .
Assuming the notion of " word , " indeed , we could explain any two forms as synonymous when the putting of the one form for an occurrence of the other in any statement ( apart from occurrences within " words " ) yields a synonymous statement .
Finally , given the concept of synonymy thus for linguistic forms generally , we could define analyticity in terms of synonymy and logical truth as in Section I .
For that matter , we could define analyticity more simply in terms of just synonymy of statements together with logical truth ; it is not necessary to appeal to synonymy of linguistic forms other than statements .
For a statement may be described as analytic simply when it is synonymous with a logically true statement .
So , if the verification theory can be accepted as an adequate account of statement synonymy , the notion of analyticity is saved after all .
However , let us reflect .
Statement synonymy is said to be likeness of method of empirical confirmation or infirmation .
just what are these methods which are to be compared for likeness ?
What , in other words , is the nature of the relationship between a statement and the experiences which contribute to or detract from its confirmation ?
The most naive view of the relationship is that it is one of direct report .
This is radical reduction .
Every meaningful statement is held to be translatable into a statement ( true or false ) about immediate experience .
Radical reductionism , in one form or another , well antedates the verification theory of meaning explicitly so - called .
Thus Locke and Hume held that every idea must either originate directly in sense experience or else be compounded of ideas thus originating ; and taking a hint from Tooke we might rephrase this doctrine in semantical jargon by saying that a term , to be significant at all , must be either a name of a sense datum or a compound of such names or an abbreviation of such a compound .
So stated , the doctrine remains ambiguous as between sense data as sensory events and sense data as sensory qualities ; and it remains vague as to the admissible ways of compounding .
Moreover , the doctrine is unnecessarily and intolerably restrictive in the term - by - term critique which it imposes .
More reasonably , and without yet exceeding the limits of what I have called radical reductionism , we may take full statements as our significant units - thus demanding that our statements as wholes be translatable into sense - datum language , but not that they be translatable term by term .
This emendation would unquestionably have been welcome to Locke and Hume and Tooke , but historically it had to await two intermediate developments .
One of these developments was the increasing emphasis on verification or confirmation , which came with the explicitly so - called verification theory of meaning .
The objects of verification or confirmation being statements , this emphasis gave the statement an ascendancy over the word or term as unit of significant discourse .
The other development , consequent upon the first , was Russell 's discovery of the concept of incomplete symbols defined in use .
Radical reductionism , conceived now with statements as units , sets itself the task of specifying a sense - datum language and showing how to translate the rest of significant discourse , statement by statement , into it .
Carnap embarked on this project in the Aufbau .
The language which Carnap adopted as his starting point was not a sense - datum language in the narrowest conceivable sense , for it included also the notations of logic , up through higher set theory .
In effect it included the whole language of pure mathematics .
The ontology implicit in it ( i.e. , the range of values of its variables ) embraced not only sensory events but classes , classes of classes , and so on .
Empiricists there are who would boggle at such prodigality .
Carnap 's starting point is very parsimonious , however , in its extralogical or sensory part .
In a series of constructions in which he exploits the resources of modern logic with much ingenuity , he succeeds in defining a wide array of important .
additional sensory concepts which , but for his constructions , one would not have dreamed were definable on so slender a basis .
Carnap was the first empiricist who , not content with asserting the reducibility of science to terms of immediate experience , took serious steps toward carrying out the reduction .
Even supposing Carnap 's starting point satisfactory , his constructions were , as he himself stressed , only a fragment of the full program .
The construction of even the simplest statements about the physical world was left in a sketchy state .
Carnap 's suggestions on this subject were , despite their sketchiness , very suggestive .
He explained spatio - temporal point - instants as quadruples of real numbers and envisaged assignment of sense qualities to point - instants according to certain canons .
Roughly summarised , the plan was that qualities should be assigned to point - instants in such a way as to achieve the laziest world compatible with our experience .
The principle of least action was to be our guide in constructing a world from experience .
Carnap did not seem to recognise , however , that his treatment of physical objects fell short of reduction not merely through sketchiness , but in principle .
Statements of the form Quality q is at point - instant .r ; y ; z ; e were , according to his canons , to be apportioned truth values in such a way as to maximise and minimise certain over - all features , and with growth of experience the truth values were to be progressively revised in the same spirit .
I think this is a good schematisation ( deliberately oversimplified , to be sure ) of what science really does ; but it provides no indication , not even the sketchiest , of how a statement of the form Quality q is at x ; y ; z ; t could ever be translated into Carnap 's initial language of sense data and logic .
The connective ' is at ' remains an added undefined connective ; the canons counsel us in its use but not in its elimination .
Carnap seems to have appreciated this point afterward ; for in his later writings he abandoned all notion of the translatability of statements about the physical world into statements about immediate experience .
Reductionism in its radical form has long since ceased to figure in Carnap 's philosophy .
But the dogma of reductionism has , in a subtler and more tenuous form , continued to influence the thought of empiricists .
The notion lingers that to each statement , or each synthetic statement , there is associated a unique range of possible sensory events such that the occurrence of any of them would add to the likelihood of truth of the statement , and that there is associated also another unique range of possible sensory events whose occurrence would detract from that likelihood .
This notion is of course implicit in the verification theory of meaning .
The dogma of reductionism survives in the supposition that each statement , taken in isolation from its fellows , can admit of confirmation or infirmation at all .
My counter - suggestion , issuing essentially from Carnap 's doctrine of the physical world in the Aufbau , is that our statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually but only as a corporate body .
The dogma of reductionism , even in its attenuated fort -n , is intimately connected with the other dogma : that there is a cleavage between the analytic and the synthetic .
We have found ourselves led , indeed , from the latter problem to the former through the verification theory of meaning .
More directly , the one dogma clearly supports the other in this way : as long as it is taken to be significant in general to speak of the confirmation and infirmation of a statement , it seems significant to speak also of a limiting kind of statement which is vacuously confirmed , ipso facto , come what may ; and such a statement is analytic .
The two dogmas are , indeed , at root identical .
We lately reflected that in general the truth of statements does obviously depend both upon language and upon extra-linguistic fact ; and we noted that this obvious circumstance carries in its train , not logically but all too naturally , a feeling that the truth of a statement is somehow analysable into a linguistic component and a factual component .
The factual component must , if we are empiricists , boil down to a range of confirmatory experiences .
In the extreme case where the linguistic component is all that matters , a true statement is analytic .
But I hope we are now impressed with how stubbornly the distinction between analytic and synthetic has resisted any straightforward drawing .
I am impressed also , apart from prefabricated examples of black and white balls in an urn , with how baffling the problem has always been of arriving at any explicit theory of the empirical confirmation of a synthetic statement .
My present suggestion is that it is nonsense , and the root of much nonsense , to speak of a linguistic component and a factual component in the truth of any individual statement .
Taken collectively , science has its double dependence upon language and experience ; but this duality is not significantly traceable into the statements of science taken one by one .
Russell 's concept of definition in use was , as remarked , an advance over the impossible term - by - term empiricism of Locke and Hume .
The statement , rather than the term , came with Russell to be recognised as the unit accountable to an empiricist critique .
But what I am now urging is that even in taking the statement as unit we have drawn our grid too finely .
The unit of empirical significance is the whole of science .
Empiricism Without the Dogmas
The totality of our so - called knowledge or beliefs , from the most casual matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of atomic physics or even of pure mathematics and logic , is a man-made fabric which impinges on experience only along the edges .
Or , to change the figure , total science is like a field of force whose boundary conditions are experience .
A conflict with experience at the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field .
Truth values have to be redistributed over some of our statements .
Re-evaluation of some statements entails re-evaluation of others , because of their logical interconnections - the logical laws being in turn simply certain further statements of the system , certain further elements of the field .
Having re-evaluated one statement we must re-evaluate some others , whether they be statements logically connected with the first or whether they be the statements of logical connections themselves .
But the total field is so undetermined by its boundary conditions , experience , that there is much latitude of choice as to what statements to re-evaluate in the light of any single contrary experience .
No particular experiences are linked with any particular statements in the interior of the field , except indirectly through considerations of equilibrium affecting the field as a whole .
If this view is right , it is misleading to speak of the empirical content of an individual statement - especially if it be a statement at all remote from the experiential periphery of the field .
Furthermore it becomes folly to seek a boundary between synthetic statements , which hold contingently on experience , and analytic statements which hold come what may .
Any statement can be held true come what may , if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system .
Even a statement very close to the periphery can be held true in the face of recalcitrant experience by pleading hallucination or by amending certain statements of the kind called logical laws .
Conversely , by the same token , no statement is immune to revision .
Revision even of the logical law of the excluded middle has been proposed as a means of simplifying quantum mechanics ; and what difference is there in principle between such a shift and the shift whereby Kepler superseded Ptolemy , or Einstein , Newton , or Darwin Aristotle ?
For vividness I have been speaking in terms of varying distances from a sensory periphery .
Let me try now to clarify this notion without metaphor .
Certain statements , though about physical objects and not sense experience , seem peculiarly germane to sense experience and in a selective way : some statements to some experiences , others to others .
Such statements , especially germane to particular experiences , I picture as near the periphery .
But in this relation of " germaneness " I envisage nothing more than a loose association reflecting the relative likelihood , in practice , of our choosing one statement rather than another for revision in the event of recalcitrant experience .
For example , we can imagine recalcitrant experiences to which we would surely be inclined to accommodate our system by re-evaluating just the statement that there are brick houses on Elm Street , together with related statements on the same topic .
We can imagine other recalcitrant experiences to which we would be inclined to accommodate our system by re-evaluating just the statement that there are no centaurs , along with kindred statements .
A recalcitrant experience can , I have already urged , be accommodated by any of various alternative re-evaluations in various alternative quarters of the total system ; but , in the cases which we are now imagining , our natural tendency to disturb the total system as little as possible would lead us to focus our revisions upon these specific statements concerning brick houses or centaurs .
These statements are felt , therefore , to have a sharper empirical reference than highly theoretical statements of physics or logic or ontology .
The latter statements may be thought of as relatively centrally located within the total network , meaning merely that little preferential connection with any particular sense data obtrudes itself .
As an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool , ultimately , for predicting future experience in the light of past experience .
Physical objects are conceptually imported , into the situation as convenient intermediaries - not by definition in terms of experience , but simply as irreducible posits comparable , epistemologically , to the gods of Homer .
Let me interject that for my part I do , qua lay physicist , believe in physical objects and not in Homer 's gods ; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise .
But in point of epistemological footing the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind .
Both sorts of entities enter our conception only as cultural posits .
The myth of physical objects is epistemologically superior to most in that it has proved more efficacious than other myths as a device for working a manageable structure into the flux of experience .
Imagine , for the sake of analogy , that we are given the rational numbers .
We develop an algebraic theory for reasoning about them , but we find it inconveniently complex , because certain functions such as square root lack values for some arguments .
Then it is discovered that the rules of our algebra can be much simplified by conceptually augmenting our ontology with some mythical entities , to be called irrational numbers .
All we continue to be really interested in , first and last , are rational numbers ; but we find that we can commonly get from one law about rational numbers to another much more quickly and simply by pretending that the irrational numbers are there too .
I think this a fair account of the introduction of irrational numbers and other extensions of the number system .
The fact that the mythical status of irrational numbers eventually gave way to the Dedekind - Russell version of them as certain infinite classes of ratios is irrelevant to my analogy .
That version is impossible anyway as long as reality is limited to the rational numbers and not extended to classes of them .
Now I suggest that experience is analogous to the rational numbers and that the physical objects , in analogy to the irrational numbers , are posits which serve merely to simplify our treatment of experience .
The physical objects are no more reducible to experience than the .irrational numbers to rational numbers , but their incorporation into the theory enables us to get more easily from one statement about experience to another .
The salient differences between the positing of physical objects and the positing of irrational numbers are , I think , just two .
First , the factor of simplification is more overwhelming in the case of physical objects than in the numerical case .
Second , the positing of physical objects is far more archaic , being indeed coeval , I expect , with language itself .
For language is social and so depends for its development upon intersubjective reference .
Positing does not stop with macroscopic physical objects .
Objects at the atomic level and beyond are posited to make the laws of macroscopic objects , and ultimately the laws of experience , simpler and more manageable ; and we need not expect or demand full definition of atomic and subatomic entities in terms of macroscopic ones , any more than definition of macroscopic things in terms of sense data .
Science
Is a continuation of common sense , and it continues the common - sense expedient of swelling ontology to simplify theory .
Physical objects , small and large , are not the only posits .
Forces are another example ; and indeed we are told nowadays that the boundary between energy and matter is obsolete .
Moreover , the abstract entities which are the substance of mathematics - ultimately classes and classes of classes and so on up - are another posit in the same spirit .
Epistemologically these are myths on the same footing with physical objects and gods , neither better nor worse except for differences in the degree to which they expedite our dealings with sense experiences .
The over - all algebra of rational and irrational numbers is underdetermined by the algebra of rational numbers , but is smoother and more convenient ; and it includes the algebra of rational numbers as a jagged or gerrymandered part .
Total science , mathematical and natural and human , is similarly but more extremely underdetermined by experience .
The edge of the system must be kept squared with experience ; the rest , with all its elaborate myths or fictions , has as its objective the simplicity of laws .
Ontological questions , under this view , are on a par with questions of natural science .
Consider the question whether to countenance classes as entities .
This , as I have argued elsewhere , is the question whether to quantify with respect to variables which take classes as values .
Now Carnap has maintained " that this is a question not of matters of fact but of choosing a convenient language form , a convenient conceptual scheme or framework for science .
With this I agree , but only on the proviso that the same be conceded regarding scientific hypotheses generally .
Carnap has recognised that he is able to preserve a double standard for ontological questions and scientific hypotheses only by assuming an absolute distinction between the analytic and the synthetic ; and I need not say again that this is a distinction which I reject .
Some issues do , I grant , seem more a question of convenient conceptual scheme and others more a question of brute fact .
The issue over there being classes seems more a question of convenient conceptual scheme ; the issue over there being centaurs , or brick houses on Elm Street , seems more a question of fact .
But I have been urging that this difference is only one of degree , and that it turns upon our vaguely pragmatic inclination to adjust one strand of the fabric of science rather than another in accommodation - some particular recalcitrant experience .
Conservatism figures in such choices , and so does the quest for simplicity .
Carnap , Lewis , and others take a pragmatic stand on the question of choosing between language forms , scientific frameworks ; but their pragmatism leaves off at the imagined boundary between the analytic and the synthetic .
In repudiating such a boundary I espouse a more thorough pragmatism .
Each man is given a scientific heritage plus a continuing barrage of sensory stimulation ; and the considerations which guide him in warping his scientific heritage to fit his continuing sensory promptings are , where rational , pragmatic .

Bill Gates on the iPad : Hey , Apple , You ’re Doing It Wrong
“ The PC took computing out of the back office and into everyone ’s office .
The Tablet takes cutting - edge PC technology and makes it available wherever you want it , which is why I ’m already using a Tablet as my everyday computer .
It ’s a PC that is virtually without limits–and within five years I predict it will be the most popular form of PC sold in America . ” — Bill Gates , Nov. 11 , 2001
Microsoft ( MSFT ) Chairman Bill Gates has long been an evangelist for tablet PCs , but he ’s not impressed by Apple ’s ( AAPL ) new variation on the device , the iPad .
In an interview with BNET , Gates–who evidently finds the iPad neither magical nor revolutionary –diplomatically dismissed it .
“ You know , I ’m a big believer in touch and digital reading , but I still think that some mixture of voice , the pen and a real keyboard–in other words a netbook –will be the mainstream on that , ” Gates said .
“ So , it ’s not like I sit there and feel the same way I did with iPhone where I say , ‘ Oh my God , Microsoft did n’t aim high enough . ’
It ’s a nice reader , but there ’s nothing on the iPad I look at and say , ‘ Oh , I wish Microsoft had done it . ' ”
Not yet , you do n’t .
Keep in mind that Gates said essentially the same thing about the iPod in 2004 , only to launch the Zune two years later .
“ There ’s nothing that the iPod does that I say , ‘ Oh , wow , I do n’t think we can do that , ' ” he said .
“ There ’s often , early in the new market , a few products that help get the category to critical mass .
In the long run , people are going to buy what gives them the right price , performance , and capabilities .
And does everybody want to have exactly the same thing ?
Probably not . ”

Just five years after Ukraine 's Orange Revolution , which saw hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians mobilize peacefully to reject electoral fraud and embrace open democracy and a Westward path for their country , the country appears poised to shift back into Russia 's waiting arms .
In a shock to many in the West , the front - runner in Sunday 's presidential election is Viktor Yanukovych , whose alleged rigging of the tense 2004 presidential polls triggered three weeks of street protests in Kiev 's central Maidan square that brought an unprecedented third round of voting that elected current President Viktor Yushchenko .
Mr. Yushchenko , the leader of the 2004 " Orange Revolution " who pried open a historic window on the West and tried to drag his former Soviet nation through it , is in trouble , running at a dismal 3 percent support in most opinion polls .
His former political ally , the fiery populist Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , is faring a bit better .
With an estimated 15 percent backing , she seems set to win second place on Sunday and go forward to a decisive second round that would be slated for Feb .
7 .
But most experts agree that Ms. Tymoshenko , a talented and flexible politician , has since made her peace with the Kremlin and , if elected , would be unlikely to press ahead with key elements of Mr. Yushchenko's agenda that deeply angered Moscow , such as joining NATO and evicting the Russian navy from its Black Sea base at the Crimean port of Sevastopol .
An opinion survey published by a Russian agency this week suggested dark horse candidate Sergei Tigipko , a wealthy businessman who has spent $ 11 million to build his image , might possibly edge out Tymoshenko for the coveted second place slot on Sunday .
But , like other front runners , Mr. Tigipko has stated no views that might cause offence in Moscow .
In fact , the Kremlin appears so pleased with the geopolitical turn of events in Ukraine that it announced this week it will immediately send an ambassador to Kiev , even though the post has remained vacant since last summer and President Dmitry Medvedev vowed not to fill it as long as Yushchenko remained in office .
" Russia has not offered any support to any candidate in the Ukrainian elections , but we do see that all the likely winners are people who take a more realistic view of cooperation with Russia [ than Yushchenko ] , " says Andrei Klimov , deputy chair of the Russian State Duma 's international affairs committee .
" I am quite certain that after these elections , Russian - Ukrainian relations will improve markedly , " he says .
Wedged between Europe 's eastern doorstep and Russia 's backyard , Ukraine – if it does indeed shift eastward – could add ballast to Moscow 's tussles with Europe over energy , politics , and security issues such as NATO expansion .
Ukrainians : Yushchenko squandered historic opportunity
Many Ukrainians blame Yushchenko for squandering the historic opportunity created by the Orange Revolution .
Yushchenko rapidly fell out with his main ally , Tymoshenko , whom he fired as prime minister within months of their joint victory .
By last year , after Tymoshenko had clawed her way back into the premier 's job through parliamentary action , the squabbling between the two had virtually paralyzed the government .
" Most Ukrainians remember the Orange Revolution with warmth as a moment of solidarity , enthusiasm , and genuine democracy , " says Viktor Nebozhenko , director of Ukrainian Barometer , an independent Kiev think tank .
" But there is a widespread perception that politicians only used it as an instrument to gain power , and then forgot all the promises they made during those days . "
Critics say Yushchenko pushed pro-Western and Ukrainian nationalist ideas too forcefully for a country where opinion surveys show about two - thirds of the population oppose joining NATO and about 1 in 3 people is a native speaker of Russian .
" Yushchenko did not behave like the president of the whole people , but as if he were the leader of one part of the population acting to suppress the other part , " says Mikhail Pogrebinsky , director of the independent Center for Political and Conflict Studies in Kiev .
" By the end of his term he looked more like a nationalist and a Russophobe than a democrat , and that was not going to help him in a such a diverse country , where polls show only about 10 percent of the population support extreme nationalist ideas . "
A hoped - for influx of foreign investment following the Orange Revolution never materialized , and when the global financial crisis hit last year it sent Ukraine 's economy plummeting by 15 percent and slashed the value of its currency , the hryvna , by half .
Did Russia outmaneuver Yushchenko ?
Moscow , stung by Kiev 's westward turn under Yushchenko , soon dropped its earlier system of energy subsidies and demanded that Ukraine start paying global market prices for Russian gas and oil .
In a series of bitter " gas wars , " including pipeline shutdowns that sometimes left downstream European customers of Russian energy shivering , Moscow compelled Kiev to accept the new terms
Some Ukrainian experts ruefully admit that in the gas wars , and other geopolitical battles , the Russians outmaneuvered Yushchenko , leaving Ukraine looking to Europeans like a capricious and unreliable partner rather than a victim of Kremlin strong - arming .
" When Russia talks to the West , they have the diplomatic , political , and other kinds of influence to move things their way , " says Vira Nanivska , director of the City Institute , an independent political research center in Lviv .
" Ukraine is like a baby compared to Russia in these matters .
Our big achievement over these years is that Ukraine is still on the map . "
Still , lasting positive changes
But Ms. Nanivska says Ukraine 's open and competitive democracy , consolidated in the Orange Revolution , is a " solid historical fact " unlikely to be undone even if Ukraine takes a pro-Russian turn .
" You would not be seeing the possibility of the opposition returning to power if we did not have a fully functioning democracy , " she says .
" Today in Ukraine there is absolutely no fear of the ruling party , whoever they may be , and this is what the Orange Revolution gave us . "
But there are concerns that Ukraine could be destabilized following Sunday 's voting , especially if the results are close .
One worrisome opinion survey released last week by the independent Ukrainian Sociological Service in Kiev found that 57 percent of Ukrainians think the election will be rigged .
All sides have accused each other of preparing to falsify the vote tallies and threaten , if that happens , to summon their supporters into the streets to replay the Orange Revolution .
" There is a lot of suspicion out there , and some real possibilities for falsification , " says Alexander Chernenko , chairman of the Committee of Ukrainian Voters , a grass - roots monitoring group .
" So we must hope for a clear result , and one that is open and transparent , or we might again face attempts to change the decision in the streets , " he says .
Another dark episode that is , rightly or wrongly , associated with Mr. Yanukovych is the still unsolved dioxin poisoning of his main competitor Yushchenko early in the 2004 campaign , which has left the Ukrainian leader 's face blotched and disfigured to this day .

A good showing was put in by all !
This was a really fun contest !
So …. should we do it again next year ?
Maybe a little earlier so we do n’t have to worry about being bearded over a major holiday ?
Wichita , Kansas ( CNN / In Session ) -- Jury selection begins this week in the murder trial of a man who admits he fatally shot Dr. George Tiller , one of four abortion providers in the country who performed late - term abortions .
But if defendant Scott Roeder has his way , abortion also will be on trial when testimony begins .
Roeder , 51 , has never denied shooting Tiller .
In statements to the news media and in pretrial memos , he has asserted that he was justified under the theory that he was trying to save the lives of unborn children when he gunned down Tiller at Sunday church services on May 31 , 2009 .
Tiller , who had been performing late - term abortions in his Wichita clinic since 1973 , was serving as an usher at Reformation Lutheran Church when Roeder , by his own admission , shot him in the head .
Read the criminal complaint
Sedgwick County prosecutors are fighting to keep the issue of abortion out of the trial , and even the presiding judge has said he does not want the case to become a venue for a debate on the legality of abortion .
But Judge Warren Wilbert has not made a final ruling on what role , if any , the abortion issue will play in the trial .
Jury selection was delayed Monday when prosecutors filed additional motions asking the judge to keep tight reins on Roeder 's planned defense .
" The state urges this court to exclude any irrelevant evidence of abortion , the defendant 's views on abortion , and the character of Dr. Tiller , " prosecutors wrote in their court papers .
With Roeder 's beliefs expected to be the focal point of the defense case , the trial could become the next forum in the fierce debate over one of the nation 's most emotionally charged and divisive issues .
But prosecutors said in their court papers that the defense theory is legally flawed .
" Case law is clear , both in Kansas and nationwide , that the circumstances of this murder do not justify an imperfect self - defense instruction , " they argued in their court papers .
Security is expected to be tighter than usual at the courthouse when proceedings begin Wednesday with jury selection , and officials are uncertain whether demonstrators will gather for the trial .
Some groups , including Wichita - based Operation Rescue , have distanced themselves from violence as a means of protest .
Throughout his controversial career , Tiller was among the most enduring targets of the anti-abortion movement , withstanding several legal challenges and numerous death threats , including one in 1993 in which he was shot in the arms .
His death sent shock waves through both factions in the abortion debate , with most from the anti-abortion movement rushing to condemn Roeder 's actions .
Roeder faces life in prison if convicted of first - degree murder in Tiller 's death .
He also is charged with two counts of aggravated assault for allegedly pointing his gun at two other ushers as he fled the church .
In several media interviews after his arrest , Roeder expressed no remorse over shooting Tiller , claiming it was necessary to prevent the doctor from carrying out controversial late - term abortions at the Women 's Health Care Services clinic .
" Defending innocent life , that is what prompted me , " he told The Associated Press in a November 10 telephone interview .
He also spoke of his intention to raise a so - called " necessity defense , " a stance that put him at odds with his public defenders , who told the media that such a defense did not exist under Kansas law .
Judge Warren Wilbert has twice denied Roeder 's request on the grounds that it is not applicable under Kansas law , which considers abortions legal .
The most recent request came on Friday .
Wilbert warned Friday that he did not want his courtroom to become the setting for a full - blown debate on abortion .
He did , however , indicate that he would consider giving jurors the option of convicting Roeder of voluntary manslaughter , which is defined as " an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force " under Kansas statute .
His comments opened the door for Roeder 's lawyers to try to present evidence to support his belief that he had no other option than to kill the doctor .
It is a door prosecutors want to keep closed .
" Taken to its logical extreme , this line of thinking would allow anyone to commit premeditated murder , but only be guilty of manslaughter , simply because the victim holds a different set of moral and political beliefs than the attacker , prosecutors wrote in court papers filed Monday .
The prosecutor 's latest legal motions were prompted by the judge 's comments from the bench on Friday .
" This will not become a trial of the abortion issue , and there are not going to be witnesses who will testify [ to ] graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and revisit and argue all the legally insufficient discussions and debates over the harm caused , " Wilbert said .
" It will be limited to Mr. Roeder 's beliefs , and how he came to form those beliefs . "
Wilbert added that he would remain " open- minded " to a self - defense theory .
The judge 's remarks surprised observers on both sides of the abortion debate , while raising the possibility of significantly less prison time .
Sentencing guidelines for voluntary manslaughter range from 55 months to 247 months , depending on the crime and the defendant 's criminal history .
" ( The ) perplexing decision is effectively backdoor permission for admitted killer Scott Roeder to use a ' justifiable homicide ' defense that is both unjustifiable and unconscionable , " said Katherine Spillar , executive vice president of Feminist Majority Foundation .
" Allowing an argument that this cold blooded , premeditated murder could be voluntary manslaughter will embolden anti-abortion extremists and could result in ' open season ' on doctors across the country , " Spillar added .
Prosecutors contend the so - called " imperfect defense " theory does n't apply to Roeder 's case because of evidence the crime was planned in a logical fashion .
" Kansas courts have consistently held that an imperfect self - defense instruction is improper in situations where there is substantial evidence of premeditation , such as choosing in advance the time and manner of the killing , " the court papers stated .
" Because evidence of premeditation shows reasoning , premeditation and imperfect self - defense are mutually exclusive theories , " prosecutors concluded .
One of Roeder 's supporters expressed disappointment that the judge had rejected the necessity defense , but remained hopeful that the issue of the legality of abortion would have its day in court .
" I am grateful for this evidence that the judge 's heart is not fully closed , " said David Leach , an Iowa - based anti-abortion activist and friend of Roeder 's , who wrote his pro se briefs on the necessity defense .
" I think pro-deathers are right to worry that death may lose . "

A few weeks ago , when News Corp ’s ( s nws ) digital chief , Jon Miller , fired MySpace CEO Owen Van Natta and replaced him with Co-presidents Mike Jones and Jason Hirschhorn , I decided it was time to write the social networking site ’s epitaph .
The recent exodus of executives and technical talent has only bolstered my belief that MySpace is nothing more than a carcass of its former self .
In fact , it ’s been rotting away for the past few years , as these charts illustrate .
The first graphic shows the comparison between Facebook and MySpace .
The Johnny–come - lately controls 74 percent of the social networking market , according to data collected by Zscalar .
And the gap between Facebook and its rivals is only widening .
Data from the Nielsen Company illustrates how over the past three years , Facebook has crushed the competition .
Not only are people spending more and more time on Facebook — about 6.5 hours a month , on average , as of December 2009 — its number of users now tops 400 million .
And that usage is coming at the expense of its rivals .
During December , 67 percent of social media users visited the site .
The important thing to note in this graphic : the steady decline in the number of U.S. visitors to MySpace over the past three years .
comScore ’s data only bolsters that argument , though it shows a slight bump in December 2009 traffic .
But that seems like a dead - cat bounce .
At this point I think it ’s safe to say that there is a higher chance of me winning an Academy Award than the MySpace co-presidents ( and their boss , Jon Miller ) being able to execute a successful turnaround of the social network .

Is Facebook Video Chat the Future of Social Media ?
The U.S. military already has plans in the works to grow its fleet of Predators and Reapers , the long - loitering , armed surveillance drones that have become a defining feature of the air war over Central Asia and the Middle East .
Now , according to a draft version of the Pentagon 's new master strategy plan , the military wants to dramatically up the number of " orbits , " or air patrols , of the unmanned aircraft .
Courtesy of Inside Defense ( subscription only ) , we 've taken an early look at a “ pre-decisional ” copy of the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review , due for release on Monday .
According to that draft , the Department of Defense is " is on track " to field and sustain 50 drone orbits by Fiscal Year 2013 .
What 's more , the Pentagon " will continue to expand the force to at least 65 orbits by FY 15 . "
Just to give a sense of how significant this is , some context .
On a visit to an " undisclosed location " in Southwest Asia last year , Noah got the inside scoop on current Predator and Reaper operations :
The Air Force , he reported , has a total of 39 orbits in the Central Command region .
And those orbits include the CIA ’s controversial drone operations over Pakistan , which are technically compartmentalized from – but overlap with – the military ’s efforts in Afghanistan .
( “ There are 39 orbits , that ’s it .
No wink , wink , ” a military officer memorably told Noah . )
The Fiscal Year 2010 budget calls for funding to field and sustain a 50 - drone orbit by 2013 .
But the addition of another 15 orbits by 2015 wo n't be the end of it .
According to the draft QDR , the Pentagon is also " exploring ways to enhance the effectiveness of its fleet of ISR aircraft by developing innovative sensor technologies , support infrastructures and operating concepts . "
A separate portion of the draft QDR looks at another future role for drones :
As long - range bombers .
In a passage devoted to expanding long - range strike options , the document notes that the Navy 's effort to develop a carrier - capable drone " offers the potential to greatly increase the range of strike aircraft operating from the Navy 's carrier fleet . "
As part of an earlier scrub of the defense budget , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates canceled a new Air Force stealth bomber that was originally scheduled to enter service in 2018 .
But as we 've noted here before , an Air Force research professor has floated the idea of replacing strategic bombers with a future drone , possibly based on the Navy ’s X - 47B , a drone the Navy began funding a few years ago .

The company that runs speed cameras on Arizona 's highways is behind a petition designed to change the way violators are served with tickets so more of them get paid , The Associated Press has learned .
The petition , filed with the Arizona Supreme Court on Jan. 8 , does not mention the company � Scottsdale - based Redflex � or Quarles & Brady , the law firm Redflex paid to write the document .
It only mentions John Wintersteen , a retired police chief for Paradise Valley , as the petitioner and is written under his name in the first person .
In response to a telephone call inquiring about the petition , Wintersteen told the AP that he supported changing a rule so violators could be served through first - class mail rather than in person , so he agreed to work with Redflex on the document .
Redflex officials and a spokeswoman for Quarles & Brady did not immediately return phone calls on Friday seeking comment .
Wintersteen said he was invited to a lunch with employees of Redflex and its biggest competitor , Scottsdale - based American Traffic Solutions , in late December .
He said he mostly talked with them about public education and the photo - enforcement program .
He said he has long been friends with many people at both companies , whom he met during his 13 years as police chief in Paradise Valley , a wealthy suburb of Phoenix .
At the end of the lunch , Wintersteen said Redflex employee Cristine Weekes handed him the petition , which had blank spaces for the name , address and phone number of the petitioner .
" She said , Take a look at this .
What do you think ? ' "
Wintersteen said .
" I looked at it that evening and in the morning said , Yeah I 'd be really interested in doing this . ' "
Wintersteen said he then looked over a couple drafts of the petition with Quarles & Brady , and asked them to make a few minor changes before he signed it .
He said he offered to file it himself , but the firm did it .
Weekes did not return a call seeking comment .
Wintersteen said he is n't getting any money for his efforts .
He said he simply believes photo - enforcement cameras save lives .
" I 'm doing it because as a retiree , I 'm now free to speak up more about these things and free to put energy and time into things that are going to make the community safer , " he said .
The Arizona Department of Public Safety introduced the cameras in September 2008 and slowly added more until all 76 were up and running by January 2009 .
Supporters said the cameras slow down drivers , reduce accidents , and free up law - enforcement officers for serious criminals , while opponents argue that they are intrusive and are more about making money than safety .
The mobile and fixed cameras snap the photos of speeders going 11 mph or over the speed limit , and violators get tickets in the mail .
The current rule requires people to be served in person with a ticket if they do n't pay .
The proposed change would allow violators to be considered served by mail .
Gov. Jan Brewer said Friday she wants to let the state 's contract for the cameras expire later this year and have the program go away , unless voters authorize it .
Brewer budget director John Arnold said Friday that the governor 's position on the program is that " she does n't like it . "
Rodrigo Rosenberg lived alone in an apartment in Guatemala City 's trendy Districto 14 , a refuge for diplomats and heirs to 19th - century fortunes .
Miserable and divorced , the balding 47 - year - old lawyer was estranged from his children , who lived in Mexico with his ex-wife .
Rosenberg 's bodyguard was the closest thing to a roommate , his abandoned bicycle on the terrace the closest thing to exercise .
On 10 May last year , he left his home at 8 am .
Security cameras would later show him mounting a bicycle and ­riding away , alone , on a two - lane , tree - lined street .
The morning traffic was minimal as the assassins moved in .
More camera footage shows a souped - up Mazda shadowing Rosenberg .
The killing is over in seconds .
The Mazda speeds away , and Rosenberg bleeds to death on the street .
The Harvard - educated lawyer had been shot three times in the head .
The killing was horribly typical of Guatemala City , rated the third most dangerous city in the world , where an estimated 98 % of murders are never solved .
According to a 2007 UN report by human rights scholar Philip Alston : " Guatemala is a good place to kill . "
But at the end of Rosenberg 's funeral the following day , Luis Mendizábal , a close friend , handed out a video to mourners .
It was a filmed statement by Rosenberg made just four days earlier .
The video , a simple amateur recording , showed Rosenberg behind a desk in a plain blue blazer and tie .
But his ­message sent reverberations through the country 's political landscape .
" If you are listening to this , " said the dead man , " it 's because I was murdered by President Alvaro Colom , with the help of [ the president 's private secretary ]
Gustavo Alejos and [ businessman ] Gregorio Valdez . "
Rosenberg 's video also alleged corruption at the highest levels of BanRural , a government - run co-operative bank .
" The last thing I wanted was to deliver this message , knowing that if you 're watching it , it 's because I 'm dead , because this wo n't make my children any better .
But I hope Guatemala will be better .
I hope my death helps get the country started down a new path .
Guatemalans , the time has come . "
Within hours of the funeral , the 17 - minute video had been uploaded to a Guatemalan newspaper website and YouTube .
Within Guatemala it went viral , and crashed servers .
Hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide watched the chillingly calm lawyer ­predicting his own death , and ­apparently naming his murderer .
As technicians struggled to amp up the available bandwith , politicians surged into action .
With corruption endemic in Guatemala , the murder of Rosenberg became a rallying cry for conservative opponents of the progressive Colom administration .
Frustration at widespread immunity for criminals boiled over into public demonstrations , where tens of thousands of upper- class , anti-government protesters donned white shirts in a symbolic statement against dirty politics as they clamoured for the president to resign .
Meanwhile supporters of President Colom , who came to power in 2007 , immediately called the whole episode a sick rightwing plot to quash the president 's call for raising business taxes and providing fairer treatment for the country 's Mayan majority .
" Nobody could figure out what was happening , " said Fernando Barillas , then the president 's spokesman and top aide , as he described the Colom administration 's reaction to the video .
" We were discusing the H1N1 [ swine flu ] virus and whether this was a national epidemic or not . . .
Then you have this recording where someone – before they die – accuses the president of his death ?
It was like something out of a novel or a movie script . "
But among the ruling elite , a consensus was boiling up : the president had organised the hit , so the president must go .
Colom 's bumbling interview with Patricia Janiot on CNN , and his ­refusal to immediately address the charges , added to the conclusion that the end of his reign was imminent .
For a tense two weeks , Colom 's ­tenure was in serious doubt .
Protests both for and against filled the plazas of Guatemala city .
Had George Bush still been in power in the US , the leftist Colom might well have been dumped , but in a quiet victory for Obama - style diplomacy , a delegation from the US - dominated Organization of American States was sent to Guatemala to provide full US - backing for Colom 's administration , which nonetheless was almost washed away by a Twitter and Facebook - led wave of criticism .
In the eight months since the ­killing , amid all the feverish ­speculation ­endemic to Guatemalan life , two ­favoured scenarios emerged : ­Rosenberg was murdered either because he got too close to dirty deals himself , or by rightwing activists in a plot to frame President Colom .
The truth , however , which emerged only this week , is even more bizarre and shocking .
Rosenberg planned his own suicide , then tried to pin it on the president .
" Nobody else but him is responsible for his own death , " Carlos Castresana , leader of the UN 's investigation into the killing , told a stunned press conference in Guatemala City on Tuesday .
" He planned it all . "
Rosenberg 's entire script , said ­Castresana , was fiction – a twisted plot hatched by the lawyer to upend Colom 's presidency .
It was apparently Rosenberg himself who asked distant relatives of his ex-wife for help .
" These are very close friends , to whom he says : ' I have a swindler who is threatening me , and I want him dead . '
They receive the ­mission and look for someone capable of doing it . "
Rosenberg also negotiated the ­specifics of the hit , and even provided the mobile phones used to negotiate the fee , which was set at 300,000 ­Quetzal [ £ 22,000 ] .
Once the execution was ­arranged , Rosenberg had one last detail to sort – he told his driver to fix up his long - abandoned bicycle .
Until April last year , Rosenberg was a low - profile lawyer with a low - profile life .
But that world was shattered when a pair of assassins on a red ­motorcycle unleashed a volley of ­bullets at 74 - year - old ­industrialist ­Khalil Musa , one of ­Rosenberg 's ­clients , as his daughter Marjorie drove him away from his Guatemala City ­office .
Musa was hit six times , the ­bullets splintering his body .
One passed through him and killed his daughter instantly .
The murders made few headlines , even though they were carried out in broad daylight and Musa was a well - known businessman .
But to Rosenberg , the death of Marjorie Musa was devastating .
As emails and text ­messages uncovered by the UN ­investigation would determine , ­Marjorie , who was married , and Rosenberg , a divorcee , were having an affair .
The distraught Rosenberg became obsessed with solving the Musa murders – and linking them to what he believed was a corruption scam reaching to the highest level of government ; all the way to President Colom and his wife Sandra , who regularly infuriated Guatemala 's ruling class by appearing on TV handing out food and healthcare to the poor .
The first lady adamantly refused to have her social programmes audited , leading to widespread rumours that millions were being skimmed off by corrupt officials .
As a top corporate lawyer in Guatemala , Rosenberg was well versed in the incestuous relationships that dominate the country 's corporate - government relationships .
And he had the means to investigate them – friends in government and industry , his own law firm .
He began telling close friends that he was now immersed in a Bond - like world where informants passed on secret documents and called him to clandestine , Deep Throat - style meetings .
Death threats , he calmly explained , were now commonplace .
He even provided his friends with the mobile numbers from which those threats originated .
" Rosenberg felt guilty about the ­assassination of [ Marjorie ] Musa , " said Castresana at the press conference .
" He began a desperate search all over to find Musa 's killers . . . but he found no proof . "
Instead , he began to fabricate evidence and incidents to bolster claims that he had uncovered a massive government corruption scandal .
He sent his bodyguard to buy two mobiles – one to make death threats to himelf , the other for the hitmen to broker the assassination of the imaginary " swindler " .
And then , after making the video , Rosenberg placed several calls to friends , took out his mended bike , and rode to the designated kill zone on 2da Avenue .
Then he sat down , waiting for the killers to arrive .
But amid all the careful plotting , Rosenberg made one critical miscalculation .
No other square block of Guatemala City has more security cameras than the murder site , on account of all its rich residents .
Recording from various angles , these cameras captured the getaway Mazda , which in turn led to the assassins .
And after months in jail , they finally began to collaborate , helping Castresana to unravel the truth of this extraordinary crime .
Instead of being toppled by the ­bogus video , Colom now appears to have emerged as a stoic leader who did not cave in to populist sentiment .
Whereas Rosenberg , once widely ­regarded as a patriotic hero who died for his nation , leaves a legacy of betrayal that is likely to put some of his associates in prison for decades .
" The crimes that happen here are unthinkable in other parts of the world and rival any political thriller , " concludes Simon Granovsky - Larsen , an author who is a leading expert on political violence in Guatemala .
" In the first months , or even years , after a political crime like Rosenberg 's , it is difficult to know what is a crazy conspiracy theory – and then one of those crazy conspiracy theories turns out to be true .
In other parts of the world , this could only be fiction . "

Fowlkes and Dundas are highly regarded journalists in the sport with years of experience to draw upon and have a natural chemistry together along with a great sense of humor which makes this one an easy , enjoyable listen .
2. THE MMA HOUR
Where Can I Find It : MMAFighting.com
When Is It Broadcast : Once A Week
How Long Is It : 3hrs +
Description :
The most recognizable MMA journalist in the sport , Ariel Helwani also finds time to host a weekly radio show .
Comments : Helwani is a natural on the mic , a true ‘ MMA Insider ’ and someone who shines when given the opportunity to interview the stars of the sport as he does here for several hours each week .
As someone who regularly breaks major stories , his interviewees are often happy to divulge information you would n’t hear anywhere else which makes the show essential listening for all MMA enthusiasts .
Also look out for The MMA Beat show which steers more towards analysis of the weeks talking points which Helwani hosts alongside Luke Thomas , Jeff Waggenheim and Chuck Mindenhall .
3. THE ROUNDTABLE / BEATDOWN AFTER THE BELL
Where Can I Find It : Sherdog Radio Network
When Is It Broadcast : The Roundtable usually airs the night before major events , while Beatdown After The Bell comes on within an hour of an event finishing .
How Long Is It : Aprox 2 hours per show
Description :
The Roundtable sees a mix of MMA journalists from Sherdog.com and beyond gathering on the night before major fight cards from the UFC to discuss the bouts and make their predictions .
Directly after the fights Beatdown After The Bell provides immediate reaction and analysis to the events from both the Sherdog pundits and callers .
Comments :
These two shows are a good companion to any UFC event , with Beatdown After The Bell , in particular , standing out since it ’s one of the few podcasts that airs directly after the fights .
4. PROMOTIONAL MALPRACTICE
Where Can I Find It : https://www.youtube.com/user/MMAFightingonSBN/videos
When is It Broadcast : Wednesdays
How Long is It : 1hr +
Description : Promotional Malpractice is a weekly live chat with Luke Thomas , the highly respected senior editor at MMAfighting.com and SBNation .
Comments : Thomas is a man who ’s opinion is highly respected and sought after in the MMA world .
Similar in some ways to Sherdog.com ’s Jordan Breen , Thomas is not afraid to talk in painstaking detail about a myriad of MMA related topics , though he takes a more no -nonsense approach .
He also hosts the ‘ Monday Morning Analyst ’ show each week which is also worth checking out .
5. THE FIGHT COMPANION
Where Can I Find It : http://podcasts.joerogan.net/
When Is It Broadcast : Infrequently , airing live during some UFC fight cards
How Long Is It : 3 hours +
Description :
As the name suggests , this is a podcast from Joe Rogan that ’s designed to be listened to as a companion to the UFC event that he and his friends are watching .
These shows only happen every once in a while for events that Rogan is not covering in his capacity as the UFC ’s color commentator , so often ends up being for international UFC Fight Night cards , while his guests also vary , but often include Brendan Schaub , Bryan Callen and Eddie Bravo .
As Rogan is the first to admit these podcasts often steer wildly off - topic and so it ’s not a substitute for the UFC ’s own commentary if you ’re looking for blow by blow accounts of what ’s happening , but it ’s fun to listen to and works well either listening live , or indeed listening back later to see how they reacted to some of an event ’s big moments .
6. THE CHEAP SEATS
Where Can I Find It : Sherdog Radio Network
When Is It Broadcast : Tuesdays And Thursdays
How Long Is It : 2 hours
Description : Join two of Sherdog.com ’s main men , Jordan Breen and Greg Savage as they talk about the big stories in MMA .
Comments :
If your a hardcore MMA fan then look no further than this show for in - depth insight and analysis on the sport .
With an encyclopedic knowledge of the sport and a keen attention to detail , Breen can easily hold court on any subject you care to think of related to the sport and also has a knack for breaking down fights , and the fighters themselves in the kind of detail that puts the vast majority of other podcast pundits to shame .
Savage is a worthy co-host given his vast experience as an MMA journalist over the years dating back to the time when Sherdog was one of the few sites covering the sport .
He ’s often able to give an insider ’s perspective given that he knows most of the fighters , managers , etc in the sport and he ’s just as opinionated as Breen which makes for some healthy and entertaining debate .
7. ANIK AND FLORIAN PODCAST
Where Can I Find It : https://soundcloud.com/anikandflorian
When Is It Broadcast : Once A Week
How Long Is It : 1hr
Description : UFC host / commentator Jon Anik and former fighter turned analyst Kenny Florian discuss the big stories of the week together with high profile interviews with the stars of the sport .
Comments :
As one of the UFC ’s commentary teams as well as often working side - by - side on FOX Sports 1 , you ’re in safe hands with Anik and Florian here who are also friends out in the real world and that comes across in their good natured relationship on the mic .
Both men are articulate and bring a level of polish to their analysis and interviews that ensures this podcast stands up with the best .

Comments :
One of the longest running shows around , MMA Junkie Radio generally revolves around their guests , and being that it ’s broadcast from Las Vegas , one of the mecca ’s of mixed martial arts , that gives them access to many of the top names in the sport on a regular basis .
The relaxed atmosphere in the studio often brings out the best in the guests , and they really excel when they invite a fighter to hang out for the entire show .

If you ’ve been missing the man from the mean streets of West Linn , Oregon since he retired from the sport then this is the way to get your fix .
As you might expect , Sonnen , who also serves as an MMA analyst for ESPN these days , brings bags of personality to his show and is n’t afraid to speak his mind , though it ’s not all about him as he does have regular guests onboard too and scores some big names , with the likes of GSP and even the elusive Nick Diaz chatting to him recently .
10 . MMA ’S GREAT DEBATE
Where Can I Find It : http://damonmartinwriter.podbean.com/
When Is it Broadcast : Weekly

Description : Damon Martin hosts his ‘ MMA ’s Great Debate ’ show covering the latest MMA talking points .
Comments : Industry veteran Damon Martin , who writes for FOX Sports and UFC.com brings credibility to this show and delivers well known guests too .

People base their plans and their lives around how long they expect to live .
With fewer years ahead , you are more willing to take risks and less willing to participate in long - term plans .
But much of the value that we humans create and maintain in the world around us requires long - term planning and commitment .
The waste inherent in modern democratic governments is a good illustration of what short - termism does to value : political appointees placed in stewardship of resources have no incentive to undertake the tasks necessary for long - term growth , and every incentive to squander the prospects for long term gains in favor of maximizing short term gains .
But what I said above about plans and time is true on every timescale .
There are ( probably largely unknown and unknowable ) economic benefits and patterns of growth that cannot be realized today because people simply do n't live long enough to be interested in discovering these possibilities .
I believe this to be the case because there exist many forms of economic growth and industries today that were not undertaken or discovered in past centuries due to a much shorter adult life expectancy .
While wandering the wild places of the internet , I came across a paper on the burst of economic growth that took place in 18th century England .
The paper makes a fine argument that the roots of this growth lie in a sudden increase in adult life expectancy - how many more years someone can expect to live on average once old enough to own property and make meaningful economic decisions .
Those people who expect to be around longer make for better stewards of property , more diligent investors , and overall better engines of compound growth .
Interestingly , the easiest historical life expectancy data to dig up is life expectancy at birth , which does not correlate well with economic growth .
In the past few hundred years , life expectancy at birth has changed largely due to reductions in childhood mortality rather than gains in adult life span - and it is those gains in adult life span that are the true engine of growth .
But take a look at the full PDF paper - it 's a good read , even for the layman .
Economics at its best is a very clear assembly of ideas , with minimal resort to mathematics , I think :
During the 17th and 18th century the English economy underwent a dramatic transformation : its capacity to feed and increasing population increased impressively .
...
Perhaps for the first time in the history of any country other than a land of recent settlement , rapid population growth took place concurrently with rising living standands .
...
The notion of life expectancy provides the most important tool to examine the phenomenon of mortality , taking into account the age structure of the population .
Life expectancy at age x is the average number of years that a person of age x will still survive at a given date .
The most commonly used indicator is e(0 ) , life expectancy at birth ( or at age 0 ) , but sometimes other statistics like e( 1 ) , e( 5 ) , e( 20 ) , e( 50 ) , are also tabulated .
Their main advantage is that they capture age - specific mortality profiles : for instance , an increase in mortality concentrated in the age - group between 20 - 25 ( due , for instance , to a long war ) would affect e( 0 ) but not e( 30 ) because the probability of survival , given that a person is already 30 , does not change .
Decisions about future capital and consumption are not taken by the agent when he is born but , rather , when he is twenty or twenty five years old .
Therefore , the relevant survivial profile for considering the influence of mortality over investment choices is given by adult life expectancy .
In fact , making the distinction between e(0 ) and adult life expectancy is expecially important for our problem because adult mortality behaves in a completely different way from infant and child mortality in the first half of the 18th century : adult mortality rates decreased very sharply from the end of the 17th century , while infant and childhood mortality rates were unusually high between 1680 and 1750 .
..
If life cycle inspiration was present in rural England in the 18th century , farmers who were becoming aware that old people were gradually living for longer periods must have been more concerned about their own means of subsistence in the future .
This may have been an important stimulus to reduce consumption , increase savings and take into account longer horizons .
Savings are the root of investment , and it is investment that enables work to improve existing resources and develop new resources .
The choice between saving ( investment ) or spending now ( consumption ) is fundamentally the choice between working on improvement or squandering that opportunity .
Much of the paper concerns the economic mechanisms and choices that led to improvement in that era , such as use of land , changing the way in which existing agricultural technology was used , and so forth - all stemming from longer lives and longer horizons for investment .
When reading about transformative growth in economic activity and resulting changes in society due to enhanced longevity in the past , one has to wonder what might be in store for us in the years ahead .
The proposed roots of 18th century progress are at work again today as human adult life expectancy continues to rise .
None of the fundamental line items are meaningfully different between then and now : economic activity today might be more complex , but it is built upon the same truths of physics and human nature as it was hundreds of years ago .
So many choices flow from our expectations of life remaining to us : what grand projects and greater wealth for all will be enabled through longer healthy lives ?
DENVER , Jan. 5 ( UPI ) --
Denver police said a shooting death and a man with a gunshot wound likely are connected and are the result of a medical marijuana sale gone wrong Tuesday .
Officers found an unidentified man shot in the head at a Denver home .
The man was pronounced dead at the scene , the Denver Post reported .

Shortly thereafter , another man entered the Denver Health Medical Center for treatment for a gunshot wound , the newspaper said .
Investigators believe the two men were conducting a medical marijuana transaction at the residence when an altercation occurred , Sonny Jackson , a Denver Police Department spokesman , said .
Police are treating the incident as a homicide , and the wounded man is being held as a suspect .
There are approximately 689,000 people viewing this site daily .
Thanks to WorldNews.com for their help in exposing the issues and misuse of power and authority within Johnson County , TN .
Within the last five years while Scott Conover lived in Johnson County , TN , the sheriff 's department has charged him with eight charges , all being dismissed .
It is blatantly clear that these cops have violated Mr. Conover 's civil rights and civil liberties , over and over again .
No one should be subjected to this kind of intimidation and retaliation by any law enforcement agency ; the abuse of power and authority within this department is as clear as day , after reading all of the reports , and documented evidence .
Conover stated that he has spent over one hundred thousand dollars in legal fees to defend himself for the numerous fictitious charges that these cops have continued to fabricate against him because they dislike him , and obviously hold a personal vendetta against him , for once being sued in the United States Federal Court for Civil Right Violations by him .
In all my years in the media , I have wrote thousands of articles and never have I came across a story of this magnitude - with such vindictiveness and malice intent .
Conover stated that he feels for the people that live in this county , and that cannot afford to defend themselves or are unable to stand up for their rights against this corrupt Sheriff 's Department in Johnson County , TN .
==========================================================
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF MOVING TO THIS COUNTY , THINK TWICE .
Click below to read his coverage on this bizarre story :
Photo of Scott Conover being arrested by Starling McCloud , one of the many incompetent deputies in Johnson County , TN , for taking a photograph of him .
How do you meet the dysfunctional Sheriff in the county ?
Easy ,
Take a photograph of one of his moronic deputies .
Story by : UK REPORTER - Kevin Donley
This is a clear implication is that the Johnson County Sheriff 's Department , was well aware that photography is not illegal , and undertaking a campaign of harassment against Conover in retribution for having once been sued by Conover , in The United States Federal Court for Civil Right violations , and arrested him out of spite , not because he had done anything illegal .
This is merely the latest in a series of actions designed to intimidate Conover , his family , and his customers and put them out of business .
Conover is not guilty of " disorderly conduct " because Conover did nothing wrong .
The officer attempted an unlawful arrest of Conover .
Unfortunately in today 's society , despite the fact that the officer is guilty of a crime under Title 18 USC 242 , depriving a citizen of his rights " under color of law " , it 's unlikely that anything will happen to officer McCloud , who will remain free to intimidate citizens of Johnson County , TN and abuse his authority as he sees fit .
Only a few percent of all violations of Title 18 USC 242 are ever prosecuted , nationally .
For those interested in pressuring the Johnson County District Attorney to address this clear abuse of authority in this county , Johnson County falls under Tennessee 's 1st District .

Pandiagonal bimagic and trimagic squares
A pandiagonal magic square is a magic square with a supplemental property : all its broken diagonals are magic .
A lot of pandiagonal magic squares of various orders are known .
The smallest possible panmagic squares are of order 4 .
Among the 880 different magic squares of order 4 , only 48 are pandiagonal .
Here is one of them :
A pandiagonal magic square 3 6 15 10 16 9 4 5 2 7 14 11 13 12 1 8
In the above square , the two diagonals 3+9+14+8 and 10+4+7+13 sum to 34 .
But also all the broken diagonals , for example 10+16+7+1 , 15+5+2+12 , 6+4+11+13 , ...
It is more difficult to create a pandiagonal magic square which is also a bimagic square .
The first one was published in 1903 by Gaston Tarry , in Compte - Rendu de la 32ème Session ( Angers ) de l'AFAS :

Necessary condition for bimagic diagonals : r( a - b ) = c ( p-q ) .
On the right , his example with ( a , b , c , d ) = ( 1 , 4 , 1 , 4 ) and ( p , q , r , s ) = ( 0 , 24 , 8 , 32 ) .
In Tarry 's example above :
the rows , the columns , the two standard diagonals , and the broken diagonals are magic .
the rows , the columns , the two standard diagonals are bi magic ...
BUT only two broken diagonals are bi magic .
In January - February 2012 , Francis Gaspalou enumerated the squares obtained by Tarry 's method : see Gaspalou 's PDF file , and also his study of Coccoz 's method here .
In October - November 2013 , Holger Danielsson worked on ten other similar families of 8x8 squares , also invented by Tarry : see Danielssson 's PDF file # 1 and PDF file # 2 ( list of squares ) .

the two standard diagonals and the broken diagonals are bi magic ...

Six years later , in February 2006 , Su Maoting was the first to succeed in constructing a normal pandiagonal bimagic square , using consecutive integers , with all its broken diagonals bimagic .
A lot of people ( including me ... ) thought that this problem was perhaps impossible .
A difficult problem unsolved for more than one century .
Congratulations !

In 2011 , Chen Kenju , Li Wen , and Pan Fengchu published " A family of pandiagonal bimagic squares based on orthogonal arrays " in the Journal of Combinatorial Designs , Vol. 19 , Issue 6 , November 2011 , pp. 427-438 .
Here is their abstract :
In this article we give a construction of pandiagonal bimagic squares by means of four - dimensional bimagic rectangles , which can be obtained from orthogonal arrays with special properties .
In particular , we show that there exists a normal pandiagonal bimagic square of order n4 for all positive integer n ≥ 7 such that gcd ( n,30 ) = 1 , which gives an answer to problem 22 of Abe in [ Discrete Math 127 ( 1994 ) , 3 – 13 ] .

In 2012 , Li Wen , Wu Dianhua , and Pan Fengchu published " A construction for doubly pandiagonal magic squares " in Discrete Mathematics , Vol. 312 , Issue 2 , 28 January 2012 , pp. 479-485 .
Here is their abstract :
In this note , a doubly magic rectangle is introduced to construct a doubly pandiagonal magic square .
A product construction for doubly magic rectangles is also presented .
Infinite classes of doubly pandiagonal magic squares are then obtained , and an answer to problem 22 of [ G .
Abe , Unsolved problems on magic squares , Discrete Math . 127 ( 1994 ) 3 ] is given .
" Doubly magic " means here " bimagic " .
The important part of their paper is this theorem :
Theorem 1.3 .
For each integer n ≥ 1 , and ( p , q ) ∈ E = { ( 11 , 7 ) , ( 13 , 7 ) , ( 19 , 7 ) , ( 13 , 11 ) , ( 17 , 11 ) } , there exists a doubly pandiagonal magic square of order ( pq ) n .
It explains for example why the squares above of orders 77 = 11*7 and 91 = 13*7 , constructed by Li Wen in 2009 , are possible .
In 2015 , Li Wen constructed a pandiagonal bimagic square of order 385 .
It is difficult to construct such squares of order pqr , with p , q , r distinct primes !
Here 385 = 5*7*11 .

Iceland ’s president accused the United Kingdom and the Netherlands on Friday of financially “ bullying ” his country .
Olafur Ragnar Grimsson said the two countries had been “ using their influence within the International Monetary Fund ” to stop it lending Iceland billions of dollars needed to rebuild the country ’s debt - ridden economy .
“ We are being bullied .
The British and the Dutch are using their influence within the IMF to prevent the IMF program from going forward , ” Grimsson told CNN ’s Richard Quest .

In the past week , I 've heard of other Senate and House versions of a bill forbidding campaign contributions from foreign - owned companies ( and in one case , companies that have even one foreign stockholder ) .
This one 's from Sen .
Al Franken , announced today :
" Since 1974 , federal law has banned foreign companies from giving or spending in American elections .
Nothing in our current laws , however , explicitly prohibits foreign companies from creating American subsidiaries or getting control of American companies and using them to flood the airwaves in support of their preferred candidates .
Citizens United gives companies unlimited power to do that - and does not distinguish between American companies and companies that are owned or controlled by foreign interests .
" I was pleased to hear the President recognize the need for this bill in his address last night , " said Sen. Franken .
" I think we can all agree that foreign interests have no place in American elections . "
The " American Elections Act of 2010 " was developed in coordination with Professor David Schultz of Hamline University School of Business in Minnesota .
" The Supreme Court decision in Citizens United was an attack on democracy and fair elections , " said Professor Schultz .
" It undid laws seeking to regulate corporations across the country and in Minnesota that go back over 60 years .
As a result of it corporate money will flood into Minnesota , threatening the basic integrity of our elections and the power of citizens to control their own government .
Senator Franken 's bill is an important first step in addressing Citizens United and preventing money from further destroying our elections in Minnesota . "
Branch Delay Slots are one of the awkward features of RISC architectures .
RISC CPUs are pipelined by definition , so while the current instruction is in execution , the following instruction (s ) will be in the pipeline already .
If there is for example a conditional branch in the instruction stream , the CPU cannot know whether the next instruction is the one following the branch or the instruction at the target location until it has evaluated the branch .
This would cause a bubble in the pipeline ; therefore some RISC architectures have a branch delay slot :
The instruction after the branch will always be executed , no matter whether the branch is taken or not .
So in practice , you can put the instruction that would be before the branch right after the branch , if this instruction is independent of the branch instruction , i.e. does n’t access the same registers .
Otherwise , you can fill it with a NOP .
Out - of - order architectures can do this reordering at runtime , so there would be no need for a delay slot .
Nevertheless , the delay slot is a feature of the architecture , not the implementation .
Some RISCs like PowerPC and ARM do not have a delay slot , but for example MIPS , SPARC , PA - RISC have it .
But there are some variations : MIPS and PA - RISC have an annihilation / nullify / likely bit in the instruction , so the programmer can choose that the instruction in the delay slot only gets executed if the branch is taken .
Other CPUs , like SPARC , PA - RISC or the ill - fated Motorola M88 K have optional delay slots :
The programmer can set a bit in the opcode if he cannot come up with a good instruction for the delay slot , and save the wasted NOP in the program code this way – the CPU will put a bubble into the pipeline .
Now the interesting question is what happens if the branch and the delay instruction are not independent .
What if the delay instruction writes r5 and the branch jumps to r5 ?
What if it ’s a branch - and - link , and the delay instruction modifies the link register ?
On MIPS , this is illegal , and undefined .
In practice , MIPS wo n’t halt and catch fire though .
As you would expect from the design of a CPU pipeline , the CPU basically executes the branch and the delay instruction in order , as they are stored in the instruction stream , and it only delays the write to PC , i.e. the actual jump until after the delay instruction .
So , for example , if you modify a register that the branch depends on , it will not influence the branch , but be in effect after the jump .
On the aforementioned Motorola M88 K , this behaviour is documented , and GCC even makes use of it :
820 : 7d ad 00 08 cmp r13,r13,0x08 ; compare 824 : d4 6d 00 05 bb0.n 0x03 , r13,0x834 ; cond .
branch 828 : 63 df 00 00 addu r30,r31,0 ; delay slot 82 c : cc 00 00 7f bsr.n 0xa28 ; function call 830 : 60 21 01 ac addu r1,r1,0x1ac ; delay slot : fix up link 834 : 00 00 00 00 nop
The first three instructions are a compare / branch sequence .
If the branch is taken , execution will continue at 0x834 , otherwise at 0x82 c , after the delay slot .
The delay instruction is independent of the branch , nothing special here yet .
But now look at the following two instructions : 0x82c and 0x830 are not independent .
r1 is the M88 K ’s link register , so the “ bsr ” writes the addres of the following instruction after the delay slot ( 0x834 ) into r1 .
The delay slot also writes into r1 :
It adds 0x1 ac to it .
These instructions are executed in order , but the actual branch to 0x a 28 will only be done after the delay instruction .
So what these two instructions effectively do is call a function , but set up the return address to skip the next 0x1 ac bytes ( 107 instructions ) after return .
If the conditional branch at 0x824 is taken , the code at 0x834 will be executed , otherwise , 0 x a28 is called , and the “ taken ” case of the conditional branch is skipped .
This trick can be used whenever you have C code with an “ if ” statement of which one case is a single function call :
if (... ) { call_something ( ) ; } else { [...] }
People can reduce their sensitivity to pain by thickening their brain , according to a new study published in a special issue of the American Psychological Association journal , Emotion .
Researchers from the Université de Montréal made their discovery by comparing the grey matter thickness of Zen meditators and non-meditators .
They found evidence that practicing the centuries - old discipline of Zen can reinforce a central brain region ( anterior cingulate ) that regulates pain .
" Through training , Zen meditators appear to thicken certain areas of their cortex and this appears to be underlie their lower sensitivity to pain , " says lead author Joshua A. Grant , a doctoral student in the Université de Montréal Department of Physiology and Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal .
" We found a relationship between cortical thickness and pain sensitivity , which supports our previous study on how Zen meditation regulates pain . "
As part of this study , scientists recruited 17 meditators and 18 non-meditators who in addition had never practiced yoga , experienced chronic pain , neurological or psychological illness .
Grant and his team , under the direction of Pierre Rainville of the Université de Montréal and the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal , measured thermal pain sensitivity by applying a heated plate to the calf of participants and followed by scanning the brains of subjects with structural magnetic resonance imaging .
According to MRI results , central brain regions that regulate emotion and pain were significantly thicker in meditators compared to non-meditators .
" The often painful posture associated with Zen meditation may lead to thicker cortex and lower pain sensitivity , " says Grant , noting that meditative practices could be helpful in general for pain management , for preventing normal age - related grey matter reductions or potentially for any condition where the grey matter is compromised such as stroke .
This study was supported jointly by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research and a Mind and Life Institute Varela Grant .
Review OpenOffice 3.2 - now now available for Windows , Mac and Linux - boasts faster start - up times than before .
But the really big news is that now - finally - this open - source suite offers full compatibility with files created using Microsoft 's Office 2007 .
If you 've ever tried opening or converting .docx and other Microsoft Office 2007 file formats outside of Office 2007 itself , you 've likely pounded your head against more than a few walls - downloading plug-ins or struggling with online conversion services .
That should be a thing of the past with OpenOffice 3.2 , which supports all the Office 2007 formats out of the box .
That said , the conversion process still is n't completely perfect , especially if you 're trying for pixel - perfect document formatting or , in my testing , spreadsheets with complicated equation cells .
Of course , it 's hard to be too excited about the new conversion tools given that they arrive three years after Office 2007 hit the shelves .
If your business had a mission - critical need to work with Microsoft 's formats let 's hope you were n't holding your breath for OpenOffice to come through for you .
Is it fair to give an open - source project a hard time for taking three years to reverse engineer a document format more or less invented to make OpenOffice 's life more complicated ?
Well , no , but in the real world Microsoft Office is - for better or worse - the moving target OpenOffice.org must aim for - and , in this case , taking quite a while to hit .
Also on the document support front , OpenOffice 3.2 boasts improved compliance with Open Document Format ( ODF ) 1.2 standards as well as the ability to open password - protected Word , Excel , and PowerPoint files .
Given that Microsoft 's preview release of Office 2010 offers support for ODF files there 's some small chance that OpenOffice might actually have an easier time integrating with Microsoft 's Office in the future .
The latest version of OpenOffice is n't all about format wars , though , and version 3.2 makes a worthwhile update for the considerable speed boost - especially in start up times .
It 's so fast , I no longer had time to grab a fresh cup of coffee while the suite came to life .
No , I double clicked the icon and - just like - that OpenOffice was ready to go .
Also , I found most of the applications were somewhat snappier in general usage .
The one exception seemed to be the database application , which felt sluggish in comparison - particularly with large database files .
After the speed and file format improvements , the OpenOffice release notes get very technical , very quickly .
The gory details can be found on the OpenOffice site , but suffice to say that the Calc tool spreadsheet application has received quite a few improvements - such as improved copy - and - paste features - while the rest of the applications also see minor updates and bug fixes .
Cultural and scientific ties , however , have continued , even if Iranians living in Japan number fewer than 7,000 , and Japanese in Iran are a tenth of that .
In 2006 , a major exhibition entitled “ The Glory of Persia ” opened at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum and then toured Japan .
Shirin Ebadi , the Iranian Nobel Prize winner , remains an admired role model for Japanese women .
And last year , Shirin Nezammafi , a 29 - year - old Iranian engineer working in Japan , won a prestigious literary prize for her first novel , written in Japanese .
She was only the second foreigner ever to receive the prize .
Japanese attitudes toward Iran have changed since the Iranian presidential elections last June .
Images of young Iranians with green headbands defying the batons and bullets of government forces have come as a shock , particularly to the politically meek Japanese youth .
Terse two - paragraph statements by the generally cautious Ministry of Foreign Affairs in July , August and again December last year expressed “ concern ” and “ regret ” over Tehran ’s abuses ( including the persecution of Iranian staff members at the Japanese embassy ) and encouraged a peaceful settlement of differences .
When Saeed Jalili , secretary of Iran ’s supreme national security council , visited Japan in December , the chill was palpable .
The time has come for Japan to use its prestige with the Iranians to search for a peaceful resolution to Iran ’s internal turmoil .
Tokyo should do so in the understanding that the nuclear issue swirling around Tehran is , at least in part , an attempt by the regime to contain its domestic problems .
To deal with one without addressing the other is self - defeating .
Japan also needs Iran , to support its efforts in Afghanistan , where it has invested considerable prestige and money .
Tokyo can up the ante in at least two ways .
First , the Hatoyama government should appoint a special representative for human rights in Iran .
The Diet , too , should stop its internal bickering for a moment to form a bipartisan committee to monitor events in Iran and reach out to Iranian legislators across a range of issues , including compliance with universal norms of human rights .
Second , Japan should take a more active role in mobilizing diplomacy at the United Nations , such as facilitating visits to Iran by U.N. human rights monitors while persuading Tehran that cooperation — in particular opening up its prisons — is in its own best interest .
Vice President Joe Biden still believes the Iraq war was a bad idea , a position he had held from the outset .
“ I do n’t think the war was worth it in the sense that we paid a horrible price , ” Biden told NBC ’s David Gregory Sunday .
Gregory asked Biden about a statement he made that the resolution of the Iraq War would be viewed as one of President Barack Obama ’s great achievements .

“ We are going to be in a position to bring home 90,000 combat troops by the end of the summer , ” he added .
Biden also predicted a successful election in Iraq with full participation of Sunnis , Shias , Kurds and other minorities .
Gregory asked the Vice President if the Iraq War was worth it .
“ No I do n’t think the war was worth it , ” Biden replied .
“ We paid a horrible price not only in loss of life , the way the war was mishandled from the outset .
But we took our eye off the ball putting us in a different and more dangerous position in Afghanistan .
We lost support around the world and it has taken a lot of hard work to get it back . ”

Pictured :
The tiny police officer who has made British history ...
5 ft - tall Pc Port
They call him Laptop .
But as Britain 's smallest PC , Robin Port has heard all the jokes before .
At just 5ft tall in his police boots , he has learned that it helps to have a towering sense of humour .
The 29 - year - old constable has made an impressive 17 arrests in his first month on the beat for the Devon and Cornwall force .
Small but effective : Britain 's shortest ever police officer Pc Robin Port with his supervisor Inspector Matt Lawler ( who is 6ft )
Which is evidence enough that this former soldier has what it takes to fight crime .
' I am very confident I can hold my own , ' he said .
' I have martial arts training so I do n't see myself as more at risk than any other police officer .
' In a situation where I might be faced with a 7ft bloke , their size also makes them vulnerable as I could sweep their legs out .
' When it comes to jokes about being short , I have heard them all so it 's nothing new to me .
' I have learned that if people want to make an offensive comment towards a police officer they will find something to pick on , be it too short , too tall or having ginger hair or glasses .
' I 've got quite a thick skin which is a requirement in this job .
And the uniform still carries with it a lot of authority . '
Thick skin : Robin , originally from East Sussex , says members of the public have made comments about his stature but he was well used to the jokes about his height before joining the police
In the past , male recruits had to be at least 5ft 10in and women 5ft 4in to join many forces .
But from the early 1990s , height restrictions have gradually been removed .
Now there are no British forces which still operate a minimum height requirement .
Before training as a police officer , PC Port was in the force 's crime data input bureau as a civilian worker .
He was previously in the Army and served in Iraq and Northern Ireland , reaching the rank of Lance Corporal and being awarded several campaign medals .
' I was able to serve the country by joining the Army , whereas being a police officer is a chance to serve the community , ' he said .
' My fellow recruits were all incredibly supportive and I always felt included like any other officer . '
PC Port 's supervisor , Inspector Matt Lawler , who stands at 6ft , said he has already proved to be a first - rate frontline officer .
' I have been really pleased with PC Port 's progress and the work he has done over the last two months , ' he said .
' I am pleased to have him with us and continue to support him .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A strong 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck offshore Northern California on Thursday , but there were no injuries or damage to buildings reported .
The quake struck at a depth of seven miles at a distance of 35 miles west - northwest of Petrolia , California , the United States Geological Survey said .
The temblor failed to trigger a tsunami warning and local police and fire officials did not expect to receive reports of damaged structures or injuries , according to a police spokesman in Eureka , the biggest town near Petrolia .
“ Spilled coffee is about the worst thing , ” said Lt. Murl Harpham of the Eureka Police Department .
A magnitude 6.5 temblor struck off the coast of Eureka on January 9 , damaging some buildings in the city ’s downtown , knocking at least one house off its foundation and forcing more than 120 homeowners to begin taking down unsafe chimneys , Harpham said .
ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES
ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES
Under the current versions of the health care bills , the IRS would oversee : • Subsidies for low - income people purchasing health insurance through newly created state exchanges .
• Small - business tax credits to provide insurance to employees , • Enforcement of mandate that all U.S. citizens and legal residents have insurance .
•
Penalties on employers for not providing affordable coverage if any of their employees get subsidies under the new insurance exchanges .
•
A tax on insurers that provide high - cost " Cadillac " insurance benefits .
• Penalties for improper distributions from Health Savings Accounts , which would increase under the legislation .
• Contributions to Flexible Savings Accounts , which would be limited .
•
New requirements for non-profit hospitals to prove their charitable missions , such as doing a " community needs assessment " once every three years .
•
Taxes on pharmaceutical companies , medical device companies and health insurance providers .
Source : Kaiser Health News Internal Revenue Service agents already try to catch tax cheats and moonshiners .
Under the proposed health care legislation , they would get another assignment : checking to see whether Americans have health insurance .
The legislation would require most Americans to have health insurance and to prove it on their federal tax returns .
Those who do n't would pay a penalty to the IRS .
That 's one of several key duties the IRS would assume under the bills that have been approved by the House of Representatives and Senate and will be merged by negotiators from both chambers .
The agency also would distribute as much as $ 140 billion a year in new government subsidies to help small employers and as many as 19 million lower - income people buy coverage .
In addition , the IRS would collect hundreds of billions of dollars in new fees on employers , drug companies and device makers , according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
Some critics of the health bill question whether the IRS , which has struggled in recent years with budget problems , staffing shortages and outdated computer systems , will be up to the job of enforcing the mandate and efficiently handling the subsidies .
" It 's hard to see how the IRS could take on the huge responsibility it would be given under pending health care legislation without some real glitches , or worse , " said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee .
He voted against the bill , as did every other Republican senator .
GOP : Attorneys general threaten lawsuit over Nebraska deal TIMELINE : Health legislation 's path
The CBO estimated the IRS would need $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in the first decade to cover the costs of its expanded role .
The IRS ' annual budget is currently $ 11.5 billion .
Neither the House nor Senate bill includes funding for the IRS , but money could be added by House and Senate negotiators .
The IRS already has trouble meeting its primary duty : collecting taxes .
By the IRS 's own estimates , it failed to collect about $ 290 billion in taxes in 2005 , the latest year for which data are available .
Pete Sepp , spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union , an IRS watchdog group , says the IRS might be the " logical " agency to enforce the mandate , " but that does n't mean things will go smoothly . "
' Social engineering ' Howard Gleckman of the Urban Institute , an economics and social policy think tank , sees the IRS ' proposed new role as a part of a historical pattern .
" We are always asking the IRS to do all kinds of social engineering , " he said , such as tax credits for new homeowners and renewable - energy companies .
In one of the biggest examples of using the tax code to achieve a social goal , Congress shifted much of its effort to help the poor in the 1990s from direct spending to the Earned Income Tax Credit , an IRS - run program that pays rebates to low - income working people to offset taxes .
In 2005 , more than 22 million people claimed the credit , resulting in more than $ 40 billion in payments , a Treasury Department inspector general found last year .
The audit found $ 11.4 billion in improper payments in 2005 — about 28 cents of every dollar paid out .
Grassley has called the program " rife with fraud and abuse . "
John Dalrymple , a former IRS deputy commissioner , said the tax - credit program — despite its flaws — demonstrates that the IRS has the experience to handle the new subsidy program .
Under the health care legislation , the IRS would determine who qualifies for the insurance subsidies .
Those subsidies would apply to people with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level , which is $ 43,320 for an individual and $ 88,200 for a family of four .
The government would pay insurance companies to help individuals buy policies on the new exchanges .
The exchanges , a central feature in both bills , would be a sort of marketplace where small businesses and individuals who do n't get employer - sponsored coverage could shop for health plans .
To meet the mandate , Americans would have to provide proof of insurance coverage with their annual tax returns .
The mandate would begin in 2013 under the House bill ; 2014 in the Senate bill .
The penalty in the Senate bill for not having coverage would start in 2014 at $ 95 or 0.5 % of an individual 's income , whichever is greater .
It would rise to $ 750 or 2 % of annual income in 2016 , up to the cost of the cheapest health plans .
The House bill penalty would be up to 2.5 % of an individual 's income up to the cost of the average health plan .
Massachusetts as a model
In 2007 , Massachusetts became the first state to enact a health insurance mandate and lowered the percentage of uninsured residents from 7 % to 4 % .
State residents are required to report their health insurance status on a special form they attach to state income tax returns .
Insurers provide statements to policyholders confirming coverage and report that data to the state Department of Revenue .
The state tax agency did not get extra staff or money for enforcement and has not had serious difficulties gathering the information , spokesman Robert Bliss said .
In 2008 , more than 96 % of tax filers provided proof of coverage .
Only 1.3 % of filers , or about 45,000 residents , were assessed a no-coverage penalty of up to $ 1,068 .
The " vast majority " of Massachusetts residents who pay the penalty are self - reported , Bliss said .
Bliss said the fact that the department had 18 months to get ready for the state 's insurance mandate was " enormously important " in making sure it was ready to handle the assignment .
That bodes well for the IRS , which would have three to four years to get ready under the bills .
Despite concerns over whether IRS will be up to the job in the health bills , Gerard Anderson , health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University , said : " The IRS seems like the only logical enforcement mechanism . "

Jake wanted to eat lunch on the West Highway Promenade again - because , he said , it was such a nice day .
But I knew he just likes being a dick to the lifeless that are always milling around the brain - counter on 3rd .
It was lunchtime for them , too .
" Look at 'em , " he said , one arm resting on the rail .
There was a big sack on the bridge next to him .
" Good for nothing pieces of shit ruined it for the rest of us . "
Down below , on the Ground , there they were : hundreds and hundreds of them stumbling about , most of them more or less queued into a line that progressed into a building , one of the few open buildings on the Ground here .
It had taken a few years to instill the training , but they were simple things and eventually - without even understanding what they were doing , I 'm sure - the walking dead had begun to realize that certain places could and would feed them on a schedule , if they 'd just be orderly about it .
Three times a day , the brain - counter would open up and the robots would begin serving .
If the lifeless tried to be greedy , the fire would burn them to near incapacitation .
Too tough to actually destroy , but they did n't like being all messed up .
Gradually , they began to learn .
Hell , you can train a planarian worm to run a maze ; the walking dead were at least that capable .
Maybe someday , we 'd finally be in a position to exterminate them , we 'd find something that worked , but until then their teeming millions simply had to be appeased , while life - real life , our lives - went right along as always on the Second and higher Floors .
No more stairs or ramps or elevators - only ladders .
They could n't climb , they were too slow and clumsy to be a real threat under any reasonable circumstances or in small numbers .
If one ever got loose on the Second Floor , everyone would just scale up to the Third until security could knock the troublemakers back down to the Ground .
They were just an embarrassing obstacle at this point … as long as you did n't go to the Ground .
Down there , it was a different story .
Down there , they still ruled .
" They can't help what they are , " I sighed .
We always went round and round like this .
I do n't know why I even humor him about it .
" Nobody * asks * to become lifeless , you know . "
" Ground - floor shopping staffed by expensive robots , " he muttered , then shouted : " Fuck you rot - baggers for making my tax dollars pay so you can have free meals ! "
" Jake , you know I hate it when you bring this angry shit to lunch - break . "
But he was n't listening to me .
He never really was , when he was in these moods .
He reached down into the bag and pulled out a big clump of raw meat .
Chicken , I think .
" You want a handout , you deadbeats ? " he shouted again .
" Here , come get some ! "
He hucked the raw meat down onto the Ground , onto the road next to the slow - shuffling line .
Immediately , a few heads turned .
He hurled another half pound down : SPLAT .
More heads .
Then , some hands began reaching .
The groaning started .
Suddenly , the orderly line broke apart into a riot of chaos as the poor dead people began rushing , rushing desperately to the scraps of edible that were scattering on the road .
Jake began cackling at the sight of them , pathetically scrabbling on the old asphalt for little shreds of meat .
I looked down at the deli sandwich I 'd brought with me .
" Thanks for ruining lunch , you dick , " I said to Jake , but he was still enraptured at the ruinous mob he 'd incensed below .
I carefully put the sandwich into the nearest composting bin and made my way back across the walkway to my own building .
But no matter how many doors I closed behind me , I could still hear the hungry groaning of the lifeless .
They would never stop wanting .

For consideration : the venn diagram intersection of social welfare and national security and public health
OTTAWA --
Many households in Ontario and Quebec are set to see their Internet speeds increase dramatically according to Bell , as the company announced plans Thursday to install new fibre cables to replace older infrastructure in several cities .
Bell said it will begin its three - year plan to install high - speed Fibre to the Home ( FTTH ) across the Quebec City region in 2010 .
Quebec
City was chosen because it can be “ completed quickly and economically because it is served largely by aerial infrastructure — above - ground wiring on utility poles , ” the release stated .
It also noted that Quebec City is the largest urban centre in Canada to be selected to date for the deployment of FTTH .
Often referred to as the final step for high speed , FTTH replaces the last mile copper connection from the neighbourhood node to the home with glass or optical fibre .
At minimum , homes with fibre have the potential for 100 Megabits per second connections .
Currently , most household in Canada receive around two to seven Mbps .
Japan , Singapore , Korea and Western Europe have been leading the way for FTTH for years , with infrastructure in the U.S. and Canada lagging .
Bell also announced it will deploy FTTH in all new urban and suburban housing developments in Ontario and Quebec beginning in the second half of 2010 .
This is in addition to the company ’s deployment of Fibre to the Building ( FTTB ) to multi-dwelling units already under way .
Bell said its FTTB will deliver 60 - Mbps service to around 1,600 condominiums and apartment buildings in Ontario and Quebec by the end of 2012 .
The company said it expected 3.6 million households in Quebec and Ontario will be enhanced by the end of 2010 .
Another 1.8 million homes in Toronto and Montreal are expected to see Fibre - to - the - Node ( FTTN ) technology in the first quarter of 2010 .
FTTN offers download speeds of up to 25 Mbps , according to Bell .

Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was on ABC’s This Week this morning , where she made an interesting offer to the tea party movement .
Pelosi claimed that the tea partiers share the same view as progressives on the issue of the special interests , so they should work together on that issue .
Of course , since the tea party is now controlled by special interests , her offer will be rejected .
Here is the video :

When asked about the tea party movement , Pelosi said , “ the Republican Party directs a lot of what the Tea Party does , but not everybody in the Tea Party takes direction from the Republican Party .
And so there was a lot of , shall we say , Astroturf , as opposed to grassroots .
But , you know , we share some of the views of the Tea Partiers in terms of the role of special interest in Washington , D.C. , as — it just has to stop . ”
The strategy which the Democrats have adopted starting with the healthcare summit is to move to the middle and offer common ground with the right .
If Republicans continue to turn them down , then they paint themselves as the party of out of touch extremism , while the Democrats can appeal to voters in the middle of the political spectrum .
As far as the tea parties themselves are concerned , as Pelosi herself said today , much of this movement is being funded and directed by the Republican Party and right wing special interests .
There are smaller organic tea party groups that are leftover from the Ron Paul presidential campaign in 2008 , but these genuine tea partiers have been dwarfed by the corporatized GOP takeover of their movement .
Pelosi ’s offer of unity with progressives on the issue of special interests is designed to expose much of the fraudulent nature of the movement .
If the tea partiers are sincerely interested in battling the special interests , then they should work with anyone , but if they are nothing more than a tool of the GOP , they will scoff at Pelosi ’s offer .
Most of the tea partiers are nothing more than unwitting participants in a special interest lobbying campaign , and these are the people that Pelosi was speaking to .

WHAT more can Iran 's ruthless rulers do to squash their opponents ?
Since nationwide protests broke out last June over the disputed results of presidential elections , the official winner , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has pulled few punches .
His security apparatus has beaten and arrested thousands , tried scores of dissidents in kangaroo courts , hounded others into exile , throttled the press and jammed the airwaves .
But the massive and violent demonstrations that engulfed the capital , Tehran , and other cities on December 26th and 27th suggested that repression only deepens and broadens the opposition .
Footage of the protests , shot by phones and spread via the internet , revealed scenes of mayhem unprecedented since the 1979 revolution that toppled the shah .
Mobs of youths , including many women , attacked and in some cases overcame squads of riot police .
The rioters , mostly unmasked in contrast to previous protests , apparently chanted as many slogans against Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , as against Mr Ahmadinejad .
They set police vehicles on fire and torched at least one police station .
Plainclothes government thugs fought back , bludgeoning isolated protesters and apparently shooting several at close range .
At least eight people died in Tehran alone , including a nephew of Mir Hosein Mousavi , a former prime minister who is widely thought to have truly won the June election and who has become an opposition figurehead .
Some opposition sources say the nephew was “ executed ” as a warning to Mr Mousavi .
Kayhan , a newspaper that is a mouthpiece for regime hardliners , countered with the charge that Mr Mousavi had himself orchestrated his nephew 's shooting .
The violence was particularly shocking because the protests coincided with Ashura , a solemn day in the Shia calendar that commemorates the martyrdom of Hosein , a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad .
Reflecting Iran 's stark polarisation , government supporters and opponents accused each other of desecrating Hosein 's memory .
Reflecting a fear of generating new “ martyrs ” to fuel further protests , security forces took over Tehran 's cemeteries and nabbed the bodies of those killed , preventing their immediate burial in accordance with Muslim rites .
State news agencies say police arrested more than 1,000 protesters during the riots .
Dozens more campaigners have been jailed in a dramatic widening of the purge against reformists that began in June .
They include such luminaries as the 78 - year - old Ebrahim Yazdi , the Islamic Republic 's first foreign minister and now head of a banned liberal party , as well as numerous close relations of prominent dissidents , including a sister of Shirin Ebadi , a Nobel laureate and human - rights lawyer .
This tactic has often been used in Iran to frighten prominent people , without stoking more public anger by detaining them directly .
So far the authorities have refrained from arresting such figures as Mr Mousavi himself , but a new wave of arrests has swept up many of their close associates .
As in the past , conservatives have blamed foreign powers for stirring up the protests .
Yet with the clashes persisting despite Iran 's isolation from the outside world , this charge is carrying ever less weight with the people .
On the contrary , the government 's tactics , along with Mr Khamenei 's silence and the increasingly ungloved intervention of the Revolutionary Guards , the elite military corps that commands the plain - clothes baseej militia used for crowd control , may reflect a growing sense of desperation .
Signs of the regime 's fading legitimacy are numerous .
In December , for instance , the head of Iran 's central bank issued a stern warning that from January 8th it would no longer accept bank notes defaced by extra words .
In practice , this would mean taking millions of notes out of circulation , following a quiet campaign by oppositionists to mark them with anti-regime slogans .
More embarrassing still for a regime that describes itself as Islamic is the government 's treatment of dissident clerics , including some prominent ayatollahs .
The most senior was Grand Ayatollah Hosein Ali Montazeri , a confidant of the Islamic Republic 's founding father , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , with whom he fell out of favour shortly before the old man 's death in 1989 .
Placed under house arrest for a decade , Mr Montazeri continued to criticise the government , siding openly with the reformists after the tainted June elections .
Despite his isolation , Mr Montazeri remained popular , so his death on December 20th was yet another occasion for protest .
Rather than risk demonstrations , the government saturated his official funeral with baseej agents and banned memorial rites elsewhere , sparking clashes in several cities .
In recent days baseej forces have surrounded the homes of two other prominent dissident ayatollahs in a blunt effort to block them from becoming a focus for protest .
Perhaps worse yet for Iran 's government , its troubles at home have crippled its foreign policy , at a time when it faces rising pressure to curb its controversial nuclear programme .
Western countries that had shied from too strong a condemnation of Iran 's human - rights record , for fear of empowering the more extreme nationalists and threatening nuclear diplomacy , are losing patience .
Even the pragmatists among Iran 's friends , such as Russia and China , now fear their longer - term and potentially lucrative interests in Iran may be hurt by too close an embrace of the regime .
If they refuse to vote against tougher sanctions expected to be proposed soon against Iran at the UN Security Council , even Messrs Ahmadinejad and Khamenei may start to fear that their days in power may be numbered .
Let ’s Talk About Private Nukes
Start a discussion about either or both of two topics — victim disarmament ( “ gun control ” ) or anarchy — and invariably , sooner or later , you ’re going to get an earful about private nukes .
“ We must have some restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms — after all , we ca n’t have every Joe Sixpack walking down the street with a hydrogen bomb strapped to his back . ”
“ If we get rid of governments , what happens to all those nukes they have lying around ?
What if al Qaeda gets them ? ”
These two lines of argument are intended to shut down the respective discussions , and they ’re often successfully deployed to that purpose .
But just this once , let ’s have a look at the facts instead of throwing up our hands in horror and conceding the validity of .
The first fact to take into consideration is that nuclear weapons ( or even primitive atomic fission devices ) are incredibly expensive and difficult to develop and build .
So expensive , in fact , that it generally takes a huge organization with a coercive monopoly on the incomes of lots and lots of people — in other words , a government — to build one .
The US government spent about $ 23.6 billion ( in 2008 dollars ) on the Manhattan Project , which yielded three fission weapons :
One detonated as a test , the other two dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Altogether the US government has probably spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 7 trillion ( once again in 2008 dollars ) — or , to put it a different way , more than half its “ national debt ” — on nuclear weapons development , testing , maintenance and production .
Even relatively well - funded governments of relatively populous nations — that of Iran , for example — have n’t figured out a way to make the production of nukes cheap or easy .
The second fact to keep in mind is that nukes really are n’t really good for very much .
Or , rather , they ’re not good for much here on Planet Earth .
Elsewhere they may be good for quite a few things , but we ’ll get to that in a minute .
Here on Earth , the only thing they ’re useful for is extortion or deterrence of same , and then only in the context of huge populations whom small groups of individuals — in other words , governments — claim the authority to negotiate on behalf of .
Those two facts taken together inevitably lead us to two conclusions :
First , that no matter how badly someone might want a private nuke , there are n’t more than a handful of people on Earth who could afford one .
Second , that among that handful of people on Earth who might be able to afford a private nuke — if they liquidated all their assets and devoted those assets exclusively to the purchase of one — it ’s likely that not a single one of them would see any reason to buy / build one for terrestrial use .
The threat of “ private nukes ” is non-existent , and would be so even in the absence of laws forbidding them .
Anyone who pulls out the “ private nukes ” argument in favor of “ gun control ” — or the continued existence of the state — is , by doing so , confessing that they ’re all out of real arguments and grasping at straws .
But let ’s come back around to my note that there ’s a potential use for “ private nukes ” off - planet — and that hanging threat of nukes just “ lying around ” in the absence of government .
These two topics were made from each other .
Off - planet , nukes could be useful .
For example , they could be used to propel a Project Orion type spacecraft .
Or they could be used to terraform Mars — detonated over its polar caps to melt them and release their water and carbon dioxide , thickening the atmosphere , etc .
On - planet , nukes are a threat because they are , in fact , just “ lying around , ” waiting to either be unleashed on all of us in war , or to be stolen and used by al Qaeda or some other nefarious group .
For either outcome , we can thank government , if we live through the experience .
The existing nuclear threat is n’t the threat of “ private nukes . ”
It ’s the threat of stolen “ public nukes . ”
Maybe it ’s just me , but I do n’t believe in rewarding knotheads who bring threats like this by leaving them in charge .
Government should go , and so should its nukes … preferably at a deep discount to private space exploration / exploitation firms which promise to get them the hell off of our home planet and put them to some useful purpose elsewhere .
In Forbes Magazine , Bruce Bartlett ( an advisor to Ronald Reagan and a treasury official under Bush I ) points out the staggering hypocrisy of any politician who is criticizing the Democratic health care reform bill as socialist or deficit - busting , but who voted for the Republican Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit in 2003 ( which the US Comptroller called “ the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s ” ) .
It astonishes me that a party enacting anything like the drug benefit would have the chutzpah to view itself as fiscally responsible in any sense of the term .
As far as I am concerned , any Republican who voted for the Medicare drug benefit has no right to criticize anything the Democrats have done in terms of adding to the national debt .
A case in point is Congressman Trent Franks of Arizona , who is fighting health care reform , saying “ I would remind my Democratic colleagues that their children , and every generation thereafter , will bear the burden caused by this bill .
They will be the ones asked to pay off the incredible debt . ”
As Bartlett puts it :
Maybe Franks is n’t the worst hypocrite I ’ve ever come across in Washington , but he ’s got to be in the top 10 because he apparently thinks the unfunded drug benefit , which added $ 15.5 trillion ( in present value terms ) to our nation ’s indebtedness , according to Medicare ’s trustees , was worth sacrificing his integrity to enact into law .
But legislation expanding health coverage to the uninsured — which is deficit - neutral — somehow or other adds an unacceptable debt burden to future generations .
We truly live in a world only George Orwell could comprehend when our elected representatives so easily conflate one with the other .
What makes Franks doubly hypocritical is that he is blatantly lying about health care reform increasing the debt burden , since the current bill is deficit neutral , when he himself voted for a bill that actually did dramatically increase the deficit , and cost more than health care reform .
But Franks is n’t the only one .
By Bartlett ’s count in the Senate alone there are 24 Republicans who voted for the Medicare Drug Benefit , including such supposed fiscal conservatives as Jim Bunning , Mitch McConnell , John Cornyn , Mike Crapo , Orrin Hatch , and Jon Kyl .
Of course , the Medicare Drug benefit was a “ pure giveaway ” to the drug companies , while Health Care Reform is opposed by these same companies .
So I guess that makes everything OK .
If you regulate CO2 produced from manufacturing , it 's probably more expensive for you to produce goods compared to somebody who just blithely opens the smokestacks like they 're living in 19th - century England .
Carbon tariffs are a way for countries that do control CO2 to level the economic playing field against ones that do n't — you simply tariff imported goods that are cheap because of polluting so that the price better reflects the damage done , and so that the cleaner country can compete .
Or , rather , it was assumed the parties would be countries — and it was generally assumed that China would be the first polluter to have a tariff levied against it .
But , you know assumptions …
The first carbon tax to reduce the greenhouse gases from imports comes not between two nations , but between two states .
Minnesota has passed a measure to stop carbon at its border with North Dakota .
To encourage the switch to clean renewable energy Minnesota plans to add a carbon fee of between $ 4 and $ 34 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions to the cost of coal - fired electricity , to begin in 2012 , to discourage the use of coal power ; the greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions .
Coal has immediate health effects in addition to the well documented long term effects on climate .
Coal has been implicated in asthma , diabetes , heart disease and even neurological damage , reducing intelligence levels .
North Dakota ranks 8th in toxic metals contaminating its coal waste , with 3,419 tons of toxic metals .
If this seems a little weird , you should probably understand that Minnesota has been generally pushing for cleaner power within its borders ( it 's no California , but it 's doing better on this than most states ) , but the utility companies that operate here have , over the past decades , sited a lot of coal power plants on the relatively cheap and open land of North Dakota .
My guess would be that this is a way of extending policy to cover more of the energy used within the state , even though it happens to be produced elsewhere , while simultaneously spurring investment ( theoretically in both Minnesota and North Dakota , as only coal - power electricity is affected ) in renewable energy development .
North Dakota , meanwhile , is pissed , and has sued the state of Minnesota .
Minnesota had anticipated this , and has a half million dollars set aside to fight .

His trial is scheduled to start Monday .

Davis County Sheriff's Office
Mr. Mowen , 47 , who has pleaded not guilty and remains in custody , faces more than 100 years in prison if convicted of multiple charges , including wire fraud and retaliating against a witness .
His lawyer , Stephen R. McCaughey , did not return telephone calls seeking comment .
The federal indictment against Mr. Mowen says that in 2006 and 2007 he promised investors in a foreign currency trading operation returns that might have sounded too good to be true  and , according to the indictment , later turned out to be completely false .
Profits of up to 33 percent a month were paid for a while , the indictment said , but only because new money coming into the fund was used to pay off previous investors , which is the classic definition of a Ponzi scheme .
The dimensions of the case expanded last fall , after Mr. Mowen  arrested in Panama after being recognized and turned in by other United States citizens  was brought back home .
From jail , according to a superseding indictment filed against him in November , he enlisted a fellow inmate to kill four prospective witnesses .

But his cars and motorcycles have also been intertwined with the saga from the beginning .
According to the indictment , they were bought in part to impress prospective investors with the lifestyle that high - profit currency trading could buy .
AP ’s Seth Borenstein is running a story titled “ 49 states dusted with snow ; Hawaii ’s the holdout “ .
As shown in the map below , every state in the Continental US has snow someplace .
As pointed out in the article , this is a rare occurrence :
The idea of 50 states with snow is so strange that the federal office that collects weather statistics does n’t keep track of that number and ca n’t say whether it has ever happened .
The office ca n’t even say whether 49 out of 50 has ever taken place before .
It ’s been a very busy week for snow and also for lowest max temperature , thanks to our El Nino induced weather patterns , while the Pacific Northwest is seeing warmer conditions , the southeast and eastern US gets lots of snow thanks to the pattern .
Record Events for Sat Feb 6 , 2010 through Fri Feb 12 , 2010
Total Records : 2182
Rainfall : 662
Snowfall : 1180
High Temperatures : 9
Low Temperatures : 31
Lowest Max Temperatures : 220
Highest Min Temperatures : 80
Continuing the pattern of top ten Northern Hemisphere snow extent rankings from October , December and January , it looks like February may also be headed for the record books .
North America , Europe and Asia are all showing large positive anomalies in snow cover .
Daily Departure – February 11 , 2010
Source : Rutgers University Global Snow Lab
The record February snow extent occurred in 1978 with an anomaly of more than 5 million square miles .
That may be tough to beat , but from the map above it may have already happened .
February will definitely be ranked in the top two .

NORMAN , Oklahoma —
A University of Oklahoma student is taking an extra interest in this week ’s snow storms in the south and northeast and is working to document the events in a very unique way .
Patrick Marsh said it ’s likely by the end of the week snow will be on the ground in all 50 states
Ten years ago we were told that “ Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past ” Alarmists are now attempting to rewrite history and claim that they predicted record snow and cold all along – but it simply is n’t true .
Everyone from Hansen on down was predicting the demise of snow in the temperate zones , until they realized they were wrong .

As Royal Dutch Shell and other majors increase their investments in Iraq , some oil market analysts argue that Iraq could export over 12 mb/d ( million barrels per day ) within a decade , significantly shifting global production closer to 100 mb/d from the present 83.5 mb/d inventory supply .
Are Iraqi oil production estimates too ambitious or perhaps , not optimistic enough ?
The northern Kurdish - governed territory of Iraq situated between Iran , Turkey , and Arab - Iraq is of particular importance to these expected Iraqi oil production estimates .
The Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) publicly claims to possess oil reserves greater than half the cumulative value of all the oil reserves within the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) community .
Kurdish - Iraqi production may reach 250,000 b/d by the middle of this year and up to one mb/d before 2012 .
As American forces draw down as a part of the U.S. exit strategy , many oil and gas uncertainties remain .
Specifically , the KRG possess few incentives to accurately report proved reserves or encourage oil investment while the U.S. hands over political and military control to the Iraqi people — meaning that Kurdish - Iraq could possess even greater reserves than publicly stated .
Kurdistan Sovereignty over Oil Reserves
When some in the U.S. were encouraging partitioning Iraq several years ago , one could only imagine that the Iraqi - Kurds were not exactly disappointed at the prospect of having sovereign control over the future of their nation , including its oil reserves .
Thus , one would be rational to assume that many Iraqi- Kurds had little intention and few incentives to cooperate with the Iraqi Central Government after liberation in 2003 from Saddam Hussein ’s control of Kurdish territory Iraq .
After 2003 , 7.5 million Iraqi- Kurds immediately secured their own perimeter within Iraq and set up a visa system requiring Arab - Iraqis to obtain permission to enter KRG - governed territory .
The KRG then asserted themselves as an autonomous international power by establishing diplomatic channels with a number of countries including the US , UK , Germany , France , Russia , and Italy via consulates and representative offices independent of Baghdad .
The KRG simultaneously took control of their oil fields and signed Exploration and Production ( E&P ) contracts with Hunt Oil , Det Norske Oljeselskap AS , SK Energy , and countless other oil companies to explore , develop , produce , and export oil without intending to share profits with the Iraqi Central Government .
The KRG only began to take a real interest in working with the Iraqi Central Government after the U.S. started to focus on stabilizing Iraq , which included the surge as well as encouraging sectarian cooperation and parliamentary coherence .
Following the success of the U.S. troop surge in 2007 and the stabilization of Iraqi ’s political affairs in 2008 , the Iraqi Central Government , now more organized and confident , ruled in June 2009 that all foreign investment oil contracts made directly with the KRG are illegal .
The Iraqi Central Government now takes 83 % of all oil export revenue from Kurdish territory .
Because the U.S. is drawing down its forces and turning internal conflict matters over to Iraq , the world should expect the KRG to ignore central government authority and revenue - sharing agreements after the U.S. is gone .
Once the Iraqi Central Government is unable to enforce their legal authority over the KRG after the U.S. exits Iraq , the KRG will likely encourage more wildcat drilling , draw soil samples , and collect the data necessary to potentially transition reserve classifications from possible and probable to proved reserves ( U.S. Reserve Classification System ) .
The Iraqi -Kurds will then both claim all , or most , of the potential oil profits and potentially increase their commercially recoverable proved reserves estimates .
Geopolitics , Intervention , and Energy Supply Compromises
Some analysts argue that the official establishment of a Kurdistan state could create a domino for anywhere from 21 to 28 million other Kurds to stand up and demand autonomy in Kurdish - dominated regions across the Middle East .
Therefore , these analysts argue that Turkey and Iran might take military action to prevent the KRG from asserting autonomy over Kurdish territory in Iraq in order to prevent the dominos from falling .
However , it is unlikely Turkey and Iran would undertake such military action for fear of a blowback from Kurds within their own border regions , an outcome that would only emboldened regional Kurdish solidarity .
What is more , Turkey and Iran would also be wary of taking responsibility for nation building in Iraq given the very costly U.S. experience .
Thus , it is unlikely any outside forces will forcefully intervene in the Kurdish pursuit of sovereign control over northern Iraq .
Moving past the domino fear , economics proves to be the true ruler of Kurdish regional relations .
Insofar , Turkey and Iran appear to prioritize investment over fear of this domino theory as both countries continue to send millions of dollars in Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) into Kurdish - Iraq due the neo-liberal nature of the KRG ’s economy .
In fact , in June 2009 , a Turkish oil company investing in Kurdish - Iraq began exporting 40,000 b/d of oil back to Turkey through an agreement with the KRG : an estimated one billion dollars worth of oil per year at $ 80 per barrel .
In addition to potentially becoming a significant oil import source for Turkey and the rest of the Western world , the KRG also controls strategically located natural gas reserves that could become increasingly valuable to Europe ’s diversification strategy .
With almost 89 % of Iraqi ’s natural gas reserves within Kurdish territory — an estimated 2.83 Trillion Cubic Meters ( TCM ) — the European Union will likely pressure Turkey to work with the KRG — even should it become sovereign — to bring this gas to European consumers .
The KRG may be able to support some of Europe ’s greater strategic needs to diversify their gas import sources and supply their fastest growing energy input source — natural gas — over the next two to three decades , particularly due to the increasing use of combined cycle gas turbines to generate electricity .
Thus , if the KRG asserts itself as a sovereign country by ignoring Iraqi Central Government authority , Turkey will not cease oil and gas imports from Kurdish - Iraq out of fear of a Kurdish autonomy domino theory , whether this be by dint of personal economic interest or foreign pressure .
In fact , such an outcome may induce Turkish leaders to work more closely to resolve internal conflicts with Kurds living in Turkey .
With foreign investment coming into the KRG from all over the world , these nations are sending a subtle message to the KRG : “ Our governments prioritize economic development and energy security over politics . ”
Although regional leaders make speeches discouraging a sovereign Kurdish - Iraq , their investment actions juxtapose their rhetoric , particularly in the case of Turkey .
More important than the words in a leader ’s speeches are the measurable actions of their government .
Kurdish Nationalism , Oil , and Power
Like Israel after 1945 , the KRG have not wasted anytime to ensure they are powerful enough to never be dominated by an occupying culture or military force , including by Arab - Iraqis that once forced on Kurds their language , culture , and rule of law .
The Iraqi -Kurds are securing support from the international business community , tapping into economic integration , organizing a loyal and professional military , and developing close ties with liberal nations that prioritize development over ideology .
While Kurdish - Iraq could hold one of the keys to increasing or decreasing the expected Iraqi oil production over the next 10 years , we must remember that asking the Kurds in northern Iraq to remain unified with the rest of Iraq would be like asking Koreans after 1945 to remain unified with their previous Japanese occupiers .
Thus , Iraq will not be unified should the Iraqi - Kurds have their day to decide for themselves , and that day may be coming soon .

Funding from CZI May 27th , 2020
We are excited to announce that the igraph project will be supported with a grant of $ 180,000 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in the Essential Open Source Software for Science program .
It was recognized that igraph fulfills a critical role for providing network analysis in a variety of scientific domains , including biomedical research .
The funding will expedite ongoing development efforts , and should result in a 1.0 release of igraph ’s C core with a stable , well - documented and supported API .
For years , the development of igraph was done on a voluntary basis .
With funding available , we can make sure developers have more time available to dedicate to igraph .
In particular , the funding will support Gábor Csárdi , Tamás Nepusz , Szabolcs Horvát , Vincent Traag and Fabio Zanini .
The core of igraph is written in C , but most people use igraph through its high - level interfaces for R , Python or Mathematica .
Much of the development effort will be concentrated on the core of igraph , but the high - level interfaces will not be overlooked .
Even though we will dedicate more time to igraph , the project cannot survive without a vibrant community of users and contributors .
Whether you reported issues , contributed code or improved the documentation , your contributions remain vital to the project .
We hope that our new community forum will enable us to form a tighter and more supportive community , where you can ask questions , support others , or discuss recent advances in network analysis or graph theory .
The project will start from the 1st of September onwards , and will last for a year .
The 1.0 version is planned to be released towards the end of the project .
C/igraph 0.8.2 , the second bugfix release of the 0.8 series , has arrived .
The sources can be obtained from the GitHub releases page .
This release includes no new features , only bug fixes and reliability improvements .
The changelog is below .
Changed Improved argument checking : igraph_all_st_mincuts ( ) and igraph_sir ( )
and Improved interruptibility : igraph_sir ( ) Fixed igraph_community_leiden ( ) : fixed crash when interrupting
: fixed crash when interrupting
The tests are now more robust .
Some incorrect test failures were fixed when running on i386 architecture , or when using different versions of external dependencies .
Others
Improved error messages from igraph_sir ( ) .
. Improved compatibility with more recent versions of Microsoft Visual C .
We are happy to announce the first bugfix release of the 0.8 series of igraph's C core !

Documentation improvements
Release 0.8.0 of igraph's Python interface follows the recent release of version 0.8.0 of the C core with many bug fixes that have accumulated over the last five years , and an improved build process that does not require the C core of igraph to be downloaded at the time when python - igraph is installed ; the tarball of python - igraph already bundles the appropriate version of the C core in it .
Including the C core directly in the source tarball also allows us to decouple python - igraph 's version number from the version number of the C core in the future .
This means that we no longer have to wait for a release of the C core in order to fix some bugs in the Python interface .
Precompiled Python wheels
Starting from this release , we will also aim to provide pre-compiled Python wheels for most platforms .
The current release includes Python wheels for Python 2.7 , 3.5 , 3.6 , 3.7 and 3.8 on Windows , macOS and Linux , so most users will not have to compile anything when installing python - igraph from pip .
Currently the only limitation is that the Windows wheels do not support GraphML import ; this will be fixed in the next patch release ( 0.8.1 ) .
End of support for Python 2.7
python - igraph 0.8.x will also be the last version that supports Python 2.7 .
Since Python 2 has reached its end of life , we will drop support for Python 2 before python - igraph 0.9 so we can simplify some parts of the codebase where we needed to introduce additional code to support both Python versions .
As for Python 3 , we are committing ourselves to supporting at least the last three minor releases of Python 3 .
Although we are not suporting PyPy officially , python - igraph will also be tested with PyPy regularly in a CI environment , and we will strive to fix any issues that arise with PyPy .
If you use python - igraph with PyPy and you are willing to become an official maintainer responsible for PyPy compatibility , please let us know in the community forum .
New community forum
Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8 , we have launched a new community forum , which replaces the mailing list as the main support channel .
The community forum is also meant for users of python - igraph , so If you are a current python - igraph user or just interested in the project , please join !
We would like to thank everyone who reported issues , contributed features or fixes , or edited the documentation .
igraph is an open - source project run by volunteers .
As always , your contributions are very welcome !
Release 0.8.0 of igraph's C core , coming almost five years after 0.7.1 , is a major improvement with several new features , performance and robustness improvements , and many bug fixes .
New functionality includes additional graph generators , functions for handling trees , new community detection methods , improved clique finding , spectral graph embedding , as well as several other features .
Please see the changelog for more details .

Most people use igraph through its high - level interfaces for R , Python or Mathematica .
A new release of the Python interface , incorporating all these improvements , is expected to be released in a few weeks .
The R and Mathematica interfaces already include some of the improvements , and will continue to integrate more .
Concurrently with the release of igraph 0.8 , we are launching a new community forum , which will replace the mailing list as the main support channel .

I Graph / M , a Mathematica interface for igraph is now officially one of the supported higher - level interfaces for igraph .
We would like to thank Szabolcs Horvát for all his efforts dedicated to supporting igraph from Mathematica !
New releases of IGraph / M will be published on the GitHub page of the project .
Release Notes
This is a new major release , with a lot of UI changes .
We tried to make it easier to use , with short and easy to remember , consistent function names .
Unfortunately this also means that many functions have new names now , but do n't worry , all the old names still work .
Apart from the new names , the biggest change in this release is that most functions that used to return numeric vertex or edge ids , return vertex / edge sequences now .
This requires some time to get used to and if you want the numeric ids instead , just use the as.vector ( ) function on the vertex / edge sequences .
We will update the documentation on this site , once the package is on CRAN and available for all architectures .

Repositories at GitHub Jan 16th , 2015
A couple of days ago we changed how we use GitHub for igraph development .
Our goal is to make igraph development more accessible , and our build process simpler .
Instead of using a common repository for everything , we now use separate repos for the igraph C library , the R package and the Python extension .
The igraph.org website was already in a separate repository , and we will also break up the R package , by putting loosely coupled parts in their own packages and repositories .
Main igraph repositories now :
igraph C library : https://github.com/igraph/igraph
igraph R package : https://github.com/igraph/rigraph
python- igraph : https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph
igraphdata R package : https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata

I think the problem is that the kicking parts are too curved ; note the time that it kicked and still went off the edge .
If it kicked things out forward a bit more , there would n't be the inertia to overcome .
Ostankino Tower is a free - standing television and radio tower in Moscow , Russia .
Standing 540 metres ( 1772 ft ) tall , Ostankino was designed by Nikolai Nikitin .
It is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers , currently the tallest in Europe and 4th tallest in the world .
The tower was the first free - standing structure to exceed 500 m ( 1640 ft ) in height .
The tower was constructed to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution .
It is named after the Ostankino district of Moscow in which it is located .

Construction began in 1963 and was completed in 1967 .
It surpassed the Empire State Building to become the tallest free - standing structure in the world .
It held this record for nine years until the CN Tower was completed in Toronto , Canada in 1976 , which surpassed its height by 13 metres ( 43 ft ) .
The Ostankino Tower remained the second - tallest freestanding structure in the world for another 31 years until the Burj Khalifa surpassed both it and the CN Tower in height in 2007 .
The height of the tower is also expected to be surpassed by One World Trade Center in New York City .
The tower created a desire for other large cities in the Soviet dominated countries to build high towers .
Towers taller than 300 metres were built in Kiev , Tashkent , Almaty , Riga , Berlin , Vilnius , Tallinn , Yerevan , St. Petersburg and Baku .
The Ostankino Tower has remained the tallest free - standing structure in Europe for 42 years .
The Russia Tower , a proposed 612 - metre ( 2,010 ft ) mixed - use skyscraper planned for the Moscow International Business Centre , was originally expected to exceed the Ostankino Tower ’s height when completed .
However , the project has been suspended due to financial difficulties and it remains unclear if construction will resume

Longest solar eclipse for 1,000 years turns
Sun into a blazing ring of fire
The sun is reduced to a ring of gold against the black sky as the Moon slips between it and Earth .
This solar eclipse yesterday lasted for 11 minutes and eight seconds , setting a record that will not be beaten until December 23 , 3043 .
Such events , which only blot out the middle of the Sun , are known as annular eclipses .
They occur about 66 times a century and can only be viewed in the narrow band on the Earth ’s surface below their path .
Scroll down to see video report
A Chinese couple watches the solar eclipse over Zhengzhou , in the country 's central Henan province
The skies over Hongdao , China , where the spectacular ' ring of fire ' could be seen .
The eclipse was annular , meaning the Moon blocked most of the Sun 's middle
WHAT IS AN ANNULAR ECLIPSE ?
Not every eclipse of the Sun is a total eclipse .
On occasion the Moon is too small to cover the whole of the Sun .
This is because of the Moon 's orbit around Earth which is oval or elliptical in shape .
This means that as the Moon orbits Earth its distance varies from about 221,000 to 252,000 miles .
This 13 per cent variant makes its apparent size , from our perspective , vary by the same amount .
It is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses .
When the Moon is on the near side of its orbit , it will block out all of the Sun 's light resulting in a total eclipse .
This will only be experienced at a specific point on Earth where a shadow cast by the Moon , called an umbra , reaches our planet .
However , if an eclipse occurs while the Moon is on the far side of its elliptical orbit , it appears smaller than the Sun and can't completely cover it .
When this happens , the umbra cannot reach Earth and an antumbra shadow is created over the planet 's surface .
The track it creates is called the path of annularity .
If you are within this path , you will see an annular eclipse where , at its maximum phase , a ring ( annulus ) of sunlight surrounds the Moon .
Yesterday ’s light show began in Africa before crossing the Indian Ocean , where it reached its peak at about 7 am GMT .
It then continued into Asia where it could be seen in the Maldives , southern India , parts of Sri Lanka , Myanmar and China .
In other parts of Africa as well as the Middle East and Eastern Europe , skywatchers were treated to a partial eclipse .
In India , the phenomenon gave an extra auspicious edge to the Kumbh Mela festival , where thousands of people immerse themselves in the Ganges river , an act believed to purge all sins .
‘ Taking a holy dip during the solar eclipse is a very pious act , ’ said Hindu priest Babu Ram Sashtri from the banks of the Ganges .
‘ It is very auspicious .
It is very fruitful and it can get one salvation . ’
The eclipse sent sea birds in Sri Lanka looking for a place to roost for the night – shortly after lunchtime .
' Many amateur astronomers have taken time off work and spent a lot on money on travel to see it , ' said Lin Qing , head of the Sheshan Station of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory in China .
This image show a total solar eclipse which passed over Europe and the Middle East , and into India .
The Moon 's umbra can be clearly seen as a black disc , approximately 63 miles across
The best view of the eclipse was in the Maldives ( left ) .

' We will travel across China simply to witness the magnificent astronomical phenomena , ' she added .
The eclipse , the first of its kind to cross over Sri Lanka since 1955 , sent sea birds along the oceanside capital of Colombo looking for a place to roost for the night , shortly after lunchtime .
A pelican looped over the city as the skies darkened from the north and the eclipse neared its peak .
' Wow , it 's marvellous , ' said an army officer , who was on security duty in Sri Lanka 's capital Colombo .
' This is the first time I have seen this kind of eclipse . '
According to astronomical websites , the last annular eclipse occurred roughly one year ago on January 26 , 2009 .
The next one will happen May 20 , 2012 .

Let ’s face it :
Many of us looking to sharpen our intellectual edges have already passed the age when becoming a prodigy is an option .
We missed the opportunity to start clarinet lessons at 5 .
We lacked the discipline to practice for hours on end .
We were told we could n’t carry a tune in a bucket .
It ’s never too late , say researchers .
Just as second languages are more easily learned young , neuroscientists point to periods of heightened sensitivity — particularly before the age of 8 or 9 — when minds are more readily shaped by musical instruction .
With age , the “ plasticity ” that allows experience to mold the brain so easily declines .
But it does n’t disappear .
At any age , learning a challenging new set of skills such as instrumental music is likely to return cognitive dividends , says Harvard University neurologist Gottfried Schlaug .
And for adults , he added , the prospect of making music can be a far more effective motivator to practice than nagging parents are to younger musicians .

“ Music is sort of the perfect activity that people can engage in from young to older years .
It affects how the brain develops and affects how the brain changes in structure ” at any age , Schlaug says .
For the mature brain , even listening to beloved music may have what scientists call a “ neuroprotective ” effect .
Dr. Antonio Damasio , director of USC ’s Brain and Creativity Institute , is an expert on emotion and a committed musicophile .
Even if music did little more than lift our spirits , he says , it would be a powerful force in maintaining physical and mental health .
The pleasure that results from listening to music we love stimulates the release of neural growth factors that promote the vigor , growth and replacement of brain cells .
In that way , Damasio says , just the simple act of absorbing music may help keep older minds healthy , active and resilient against injury and illness .

SHANGHAI  Chinese officials misused or embezzled about $ 35 billion in government money in the first 11 months of the year , according to a national audit released this week .
The announcement is the latest indication of how widespread corruption has become among government agencies and how difficult it will be for Beijing to root it out .
The National Audit Office , which carried out the examination , did not disclose the size of the budgets reviewed this year .
But the agency , which is based in Beijing , said that it surveyed nearly 100,000 government departments and state - owned companies , and that more than 1,000 officials were facing prosecution or disciplinary action because of the audits .
Auditors said government officials engaged in everything from money laundering and issuing fraudulent loans to cheating the government through the sale or purchase of state land or mining rights .

You Sherwood Not Want To Make A Mochrie Out Of These Two
You ’ve witnessed their shenanigans on VH1 , TV commercials , movies and the long - running improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway ?
But have you seen them live ?
For the last six years , Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood have toured with their show An Evening With Colin Mochrie And Brad Sherwood ( check their site for upcoming tour dates ) , where the dynamic duo takes their experience with comedy improv and encourages audience participation , including the sound effects game that was so popular on their long - running BBC / ABC hit show .
But the best part of the night is the mousetrap game , where the duo alternate singing lines of an opera — the theme determined by the audience , each line beginning with a letter of the alphabet picked by said fans , then going in backwards order — while also walking the stage blindfolded through a minefield of mousetraps .
You can imagine how absurd and painful it gets .
And how funny .
Given their pedigree with improv , Mochrie and Sherwood have made a career out of throwing themselves to the wolves .
Despite the unpredictability of a show or audience on any given night , they thrive on performing live without a net .
Luckily , ADD was not as tough an audience when we sat this humorous twosome down in their hotel to discuss their long - running act , chemistry and love for spontaneous comedy .
I also chatted with them for a new Stage Directions cover story entitled “ MacGyvers Of Improv , ” the extended online version of which can be found here .
Of all the people you ’ve worked with , how did you two develop this chemistry , decide to work together and take this show on the road ?
Brad :
We ’ve done different [ improv ] incarnations with bigger groups , but some of the guys were busy or do n’t like to fly , and we ’ll go anywhere .
We ’ve worked together for so many years …
Colin :
We do n’t like sharing stage time .
Brad :
The bigger the group the less we ’re on stage , so we thought , if there are only two of us we ’re on stage the whole time .
Have you been doing a lot of press while you ’re here in New York ?
Brad :
We just did the Fox News show and walked back here .
Colin :
All we really wanted was you .
Excellent .
How was Fox News ?
Brad :
It ’s weird .
I think it was [ for ] their weird online news outlet .
So who ’s actually watching an online live Fox TV show other than shut - in conservatives ?
Did you perform at a White House gala in 2007 ?
Brad :
It was the Congressional Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner .
It was n’t the White House one , it was the one being sponsored by Congress .
So technically we were being hired by Democrats .
I just want to put that out there .
We were performing for the President , but we were hired by Democrats .
I ’m assuming you were n’t quite in line with the last administration at that point ?
Brad : I have never been in line with that administration .
So how do you get up and perform in front of people like Karl Rove , whom you might not like , and manage to make it work without politicizing it or creating any tension ?
Colin :
It ’s pretty easy for us just because we never do political humor .
I think when you improvise political humor it just becomes pretty much black and white , like , “ Oh , they ’re stupid . ”
That kind of thing .
You ca n’t really satirize it like Saturday Night Live or other people who can spend time writing the sketch and fine - tuning it .
Ours would be broad strokes .
It ’s really not our strength .
We just tend to go for the silly .
Brad :
Our show is goofy and very apolitical .
We came in the year after Stephen Colbert did his skewering of Bush , so I think everybody on both sides of the aisle were interested in having a fun , light , apolitical comedy act , which is what we are .
We went in there to make people laugh and did n’t have a political agenda .
We were n’t sermonizing in any way , and we just did really goofy , silly stuff .
We got great feedback .
Everyone said it was the funniest thing that they had at one of those things .
Usually it ’s standups who generally do n’t do political humor but feel compelled to write a complete political set for that event , so they ’re doing stuff that ’s way out of their comfort zone and doing stuff that ’s making half the audience feel uncomfortable at any given moment , depending upon what their political bent is .
The show has such a wide demographic , and we have a lot of kids and families in our audiences .
We have the widest demographic for any comedy show : 7 to 70 .
You may not have raunchy humor , but there is racy humor .
Even some of the improv stuff on Whose Line , Just For Laughs and various TV appearances you have made is not all G-rated .
Some of it is PG content that almost pushes R- rated material .
Colin :
It hits that spot where it kind of goes over the younger people ’s heads but the parents get it .
Brad :
Most of our stuff is [ double ] entendre .
If it ’s racy it ’s vague enough that it ’s not specifically filth .
It walks that line where the adults know what we ’re talking about , but the kids have no idea that there ’s even a dirty reference going on .
Like when you spilled red wine during the “ lie down ” sketch at the Just For Laughs festival and made a porn reference with the spillage .
Colin : Yeah , those kinds of things .
Good , clean family humor !
Modern comedy has become more adversarial , which mirrors the way we are as a society .
We have become more confrontational with each other .
It ’s been said that a lot of standup comedians have issues .
Do you guys fit into that stereotype of trying to work something out on stage ?
Colin :
There is nothing going on with us .
Brad :
I think improvisers as a breed tend to be more social because everything we do is interactive and requires more than one person , whereas standups tend to be a bit more misanthropic and asocial .
They comment on and have an angry perspective on the world and talk about how everything is stupid , whereas what we ’re doing is creating right there on the spot , and it ’s a communal event between us and the audience .
It ’s a totally different mindset .
Improv is for people that play well with others , whereas the social outcasts tend to be the standups , where they have their bitter take on the world and comment on what is wrong with it .
I get crankier as I get older .
Brad :
I think the reason people get angrier as they get older is that as you get older you get wiser .
But as you get older the world becomes full of more people that are less wise than you , so the population of people that is dumber than you continues to grow .
As you become more enlightened the world continues to fill with less enlightened people .
Your perspective is just so frustrating when you have these morons who are text messaging while they ’re making your café mocha .
It ’s this new techno age of bonehead children who are completely asocial and think the world owes them something .
I think that ’s what frustrates you as you get older .
That ’s your rant !
Brad : I was doing standup .
Are there any roles that you guys would like to do , either comedic or dramatic , that would be different from what you ’ve done and that would allow people to perceive you differently ?
Colin : I do n’t know if people would accept us as anything else at this point .
Brad :
I ’d like to play one of those villains in those Jason Statham type movies , like The Transporter .
I think because I ’m tall and look a little bit dour that I ’d be good as the big guy that walks around with a trenchcoat and a gun .
Colin : I would love to do an action movie just because action heroes look like they could beat up a terrorist with their bare hands .
Look at them .
But with me it would be a surprise .
Or you could be the ringleader of a big bank heist .
Brad : I would n’t want to be the hero .
I ’d want to be the bad guy .
The henchman to the little , evil , weaselly guy or the aloof , I ’ll - kill - you - if you - look - at - me - wrong guy .
Cowboy movies – I would like to be in violent , Clint Eastwood style spaghetti westerns .
There are so many entertainment choices now that everything seems to have been done , so it seems harder to capture an audience ’s attention .
Colin :
It ’s been hard to be original .
Every idea has been done .
If you look at comedy , Saturday Night Live is doing what Sid Caesar did – a 90 - minute show every week with live sketches .
It ’s just finding that different point of view , and after awhile everything becomes new again .
I ’m hoping that people forget some really good ideas so I can use them in the future .
Bryan , I was looking on your site , and you are a serious metalhead .
[ Throws the horns ]
What about you ?
Brad : I ’m a total metalhead .
What groups did you see when you were younger ?
Brad : I saw the Scorpions , Black Sabbath , Twisted Sister , Def Leppard , Triumph , Iron Maiden , all the good ones .
But I never saw Judas Priest or AC / DC .
I saw Judas Priest in ‘ 84 .
Brad :
Those are two embarrassing admissions .
I did n’t get to see them , but I saw pretty much anybody else .
Colin : I ’m kind of shocked that you have n’t seen AC / DC .

The 250 - pound running back rushed for 13,662 yards and 94 touchdowns in his successful career , while also racking up six Pro Bowl appearances and claiming the 1993 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year , the 1996 NFL Comeback Player of the Year and the 2001 Walter Payton Man of the Year awards .
Did we mention he also won a Super Bowl ?
“ The Bus ” has teamed up with DiGiorno for their “ You Bettis Believe ” sweepstakes , which runs through February 12th and will award one lucky winner ( along with 10 of his or her friends ) a chance to win a fantasy football draft party hosted by DiGiorno and Jerome .
The winner and his group will be heading to Las Vegas in August for the draft and of course , the chance to meet Jerome Bettis .
All you have to do to sign up is visit Facebook.com / Digiorno for a chance to win .
Along with providing more details on the “ You Bettis Believe ” sweepstakes , Jerome was more than happy to talk a little football with us .
We asked him what his most memorable moment was from the Steelers ’ run to the Super Bowl in 2005 , what was the hardest hit he ever laid on a defender and what he thinks it ’ll take for the Steelers to get back in title contention .
He also filled us in on where Bill Cowher may wind up when he decides to start coaching again .
The Scores Report : Hey Jerome , how are you this is Anthony .
Jerome Bettis :
How you doing , Anthony ?
TSR : Real good , I appreciate your joining me today .
JB : Oh , not a problem .
TSR : Talk to me a little bit about this DiGiorno ’s sweepstakes that you ’re a part of .
This fantasy football draft in Vegas sounds like a great time .
JB : The sweepstakes is called “ You Bettis Believe ” and all you have to do is go to Facebook .com / DiGiorno and register to win the fantasy football draft party in Las Vegas .
You get the opportunity to go out to Vegas and have a fantasy football draft with me .
We ’ll talk football , pizza ; it ’s the best sweepstakes you could ever win .
The 12th of February is the last day you can enter so make sure you go to Facebook.com / DiGiorno to sign up .
TSR : How did you get involved in a sweepstakes like this , Jerome ?
Have you worked with DiGiorno before ?
JB : I ’m a big DiGiorno fan .
My wife loves making the pizza at home , so it was a great fit .
I love to eat , as you can probably tell , and pizza is my favorite past time so it ’s been a terrific fit .
TSR : ( Laughs )
What ’s your favorite DiGiorno pizza ?
JB : ( Laughs )
It ’s the DiGiorno quick rising crust !
TSR : Have you participated in any fantasy football leagues now that your career is over ?
JB : I have not actually , so this will be my first one .
TSR : Will you have the opportunity to be in the league or are you just going to be a part of the draft in Vegas ?
JB : I ’ll be a part of the draft but you never know – maybe they ’ll convince me to get a team .
TSR : I highly recommended you get a team – it ’s fun .
Okay , I win the sweepstakes and I ’m heading to Vegas in August – what advice do you give me in the first round ?
JB : The way I look at it is you have to do your homework on this past year .
It ’s a no - brainer to go with a guy like Peyton Manning , but Drew Brees has also put up good numbers back - to - back years in terms of touchdowns , so there are quite a few great choices .
For years , especially with the first pick , you always looked at taking running backs .
But I think there are a couple of quarterbacks that are worthy of taking high now .
TSR : Has DiGiorno told you about the details yet for how long you guys will be in Vegas ?
JB : Not yet , but any time you get out to Vegas it ’s a great time and when you ’re with 10 of your buddies playing fantasy football , believe you me it ’s going to be fun .
TSR : I ’m sure there are going to be a lot of significant others worried about the combination of pizza , fantasy football , Jerome Bettis and Las Vegas .
I see some break ups happening .
JB : I do n’t think this will cause any break ups !
You get to have the same opportunity to have the draft party you ’ve always had , but with a different back drop .
I do n’t think it ’s cause for concern for any significant others .
TSR : ( Laughs ) I ’m sure you ’re right !
No , it sounds like a great time .
Do you mind if I ask you a couple football questions .
JB : Absolutely !
TSR : With the playoffs going on , which player or team has impressed you the most , or what team are you looking forward to watching that has n’t played yet ?
JB : Obviously Tony Romo has been very impressive to me .
To watch him perform at the level he has played at has been very impressive .
If I ’m going with one guy right now , it ’s Tony Romo because nobody expected him to play this well given what has happened to him in December and in the postseason in the past .
For him to play this well lately is pretty special .
TSR : Now that the Cowboys have gotten the playoff monkey off their back , do you see them continuing to play well and reaching the Super Bowl ?
JB : I think they ’re over the hump .
The Super Bowl is a lot to ask right now because they have to have a one - game - at - a - time mentality , but they ’re going into Minnesota this weekend to play a Vikings team that they can beat .
Anything is possible and I ’ll tell you what , I like Dallas ’ chances .
TSR : I look at a team in the Baltimore Ravens , who you know very well from your playing days , and I compare them a little bit to your Pittsburgh Steelers in terms of having to go on the road throughout the playoffs .
Your Steelers team a couple years ago won on the road as a team and were able to reach the Super Bowl , but how hard is it to consistently win when you do n’t have home field advantage in the playoffs ?
JB : It ’s really hard to do , but it ’s all about the type of team you have and the makeup of your football team .
I like Baltimore ’s makeup and they have what it takes but unfortunately , this is a bad matchup for them this weekend .
The Colts present a lot of problems for the type of team that Baltimore is .
They ’re not a high scoring football team and they like to do a lot of blitzing ; all those things kind of play into the hands of the Colts .
They have n’t been able to beat the Colts the last seven times they ’ve played them and I just think it ’s a matchup problem .
Any other team and I like their chances , but this is a team in the Colts that are led by Peyton Manning and who always seem to be one step ahead of them .
TSR : The Colts have a very underrated defense and obviously the Jets and Cowboys are very good .
But do you feel like these playoffs are lacking a little bit on the defensive side ?
JB : I think they ’re lacking in certain areas , but you have the Jets that have a great defense , Baltimore is very good and the Cowboys are also playing very well .
So you do have some good defensive football teams , but they ’re being overshadowed by these high - scoring offenses .
TSR : How do your Steelers get back on the right track ?
JB : First things first , they have to get back to establishing the running game .
They have to be a different type of running team ; they do n’t need to be the Pittsburgh Steelers of old , who ran the ball 60 % of the time .
But they do need to be a Pittsburgh Steelers team that can run the ball when they need to .
When everyone in the stadium knows that they ’re going to run the ball and they still are able to run it and pick up a first down , I think that ’s what they need and that ’s what has been missing over the last couple of years .
TSR : What ’s your take on head coach Mike Tomlin ?
JB : I like coach Tomlin and I think he ’s doing the right things .
I think he made a statement this offseason by firing the offensive line coach ( Larry Zierlein ) and sent the message that :
We are going to get back to running the football .
I do n’t think there ’s any stronger message then firing the offensive line coach and replacing him with a guy ( Sean Kugler ) whose forte is run blocking .
So , I think they ’re going to get back to running the ball , which is something they ’ve sorely missed .
TSR : Where do you think your old head coach Bill Cowher will wind up ?
JB : He ’s going to wind up in New York at some point .
I think he ’s holding out hope that he ’ll be able to coach the Giants – that ’s what I believe .
It ’s not going to happen this year , but I think if they fall on their faces again next year that it ’ll open the door for Cowher to become the next head coach of the New York Giants .
on where he thinks Bill Cowher will wind up …
“ He ’s going to wind up in New York at some point .
I think he ’s holding out hope that he ’ll be able to coach the Giants – that ’s what I believe .
It ’s not going to happen this year , but I think if they fall on their faces again next year that it ’ll open the door for Cowher to become the next head coach of the New York Giants . ”
TSR : Wow , that ’s pretty interesting .
He ’s been linked to a couple of different teams – the Bills , the Panthers – but you think the Giants .
That ’s very interesting .
JB : I think that ’s the job that he would really like to have and the ownership is very familiar with him , and he ’s very familiar with the ownership .
The Mara ’s and Rooney ’s are very close and I think that ’s the place he would really like to go .
TSR : Interesting .
Going back to your Super Bowl days , what was your finest moment besides winning of course ?
What ’s the one thing from that year in the playoffs that really stands out ?
JB : The one thing that really stands out is when we were in Denver .
We won and I ’ll never forget there was a sign that read : Going Home .
It was one of those things that was like wow , I am really going home and it hit me all at once .
I ’ll never forget my feelings at that moment when I realized I was going home and going to the Super Bowl .
TSR : I was living in Detroit the year that you won the Super Bowl and I can remember how many Steeler fans were walking the city .
I ’ll never forget how the city embraced you because it was your hometown and you were getting the opportunity to play in the Super Bowl .
JB : Oh , it was amazing – it really was .
You know what kind of exposure the Super Bowl gets , and to have that media attention focused on me was absolutely amazing .
TSR : I can only imagine .
All right – I ’ve got some fun questions .
What was the hardest hit you ’ve ever laid on a defender ?
JB : On a defender ?
We played the Ravens one year and , I ca n’t remember the safety ’s name , but I ran through a hole and broke his collarbone .
TSR : ( Laughs ) Really ?
JB : Yeah , it was pretty powerful .
I can remember it like it was yesterday , too .
It was one of those moments when I was full stride and I knew there was no breaking .
I just put my head down ready to embrace the hit and went right through him .
TSR : Oh man !
And what was the hardest hit you ’ve ever received from a defender ?
JB : One year , Sam Adams was the defensive nose guard for the Baltimore Ravens and we called a screen pass .
I caught the screen pass , jumped in the air and the next thing I remember was getting off the ground .
He knocked me silly .
TSR : ( Laughs )
Who is the greatest defender you ’ve ever faced ?
JB : Lawrence Taylor .
TSR : Lawrence Taylor ?
Yeah , I ’ve heard he was pretty good .
What about Ray Lewis ?
How do the two compare ?
JB : I did n’t get a chance to face Lawrence Taylor in his prime , but in his prime , I do n’t think there ’s any question who the greatest defensive player was of all time .
I do n’t think there ’s anyone even close , but Ray Lewis is a great player in and of itself .
But Lawrence Taylor changed how the game was played and how you guard against defensive players .
He was the first guy that you had to know where he was at all times and it was a much different NFL before Lawrence Taylor .
TSR : What running back impresses you the most nowadays ?
JB : I ’ve been very impressed with what Ray Rice can do .
Of course there ’s Adrian Peterson and those guys , but Ray Rice has been very impressive over the past half of the season .
TSR : Well , I really appreciate your sitting down with us Jerome , and I encourage everyone to head to Facebook.com / DiGiorno to take part in the sweepstakes .
Is there anything else you wanted to say to readers about the contest ?
JB : I just want to add : “ You Bettis Believe ” it ’s no delivery , it ’s DiGiorno .
TSR : ( Laughs ) Sounds great !
Thanks again , Jerome .
JB : Thank you !
Take care .

( PhysOrg.com ) — Scientists studying dolphin behavior have suggested they could be the most intelligent creatures on Earth after humans , saying the size of their brains in relation to body size is larger than that of our closest relatives , the chimpanzees , and their behaviors suggest complex intelligence .
One scientist said they should therefore be treated as " non-human persons " and granted rights as individuals .
The behavioral studies showed dolphins ( especially the bottlenose ) have distinct personalities and self - awareness , and they can think about the future .
The research also confirmed dolphins have complex social structures , with individuals co-operating to solve difficult problems or to round up shoals of fish to eat , and with new behaviors being passed from one dolphin to another .
Several examples of learning being passed on to other individuals have been observed .
In one case a rescued dolphin in South Australia , taught to tail - walk during recuperation , in turn taught the trick to other wild dolphins in the Port Adelaide river estuary when she was released .
According to marine biologist Mike Bossley it was " like watching a dance craze take off " , with the dolphins apparently learning the trick just for fun , since tail - walking has no natural function .
Work carried out by professor of psychology at the City University of New York , Diana Reiss , showed dolphins could recognize themselves in a mirror , and could use it to inspect other parts of their bodies , an ability previously only demonstrated in humans and a few animals such as apes , elephants and pigs .
In another study Reiss was able to teach captive dolphins a rudimentary language based on symbols .
In anatomical studies of the dolphin , zoologist Lori Marino and colleagues from Emory University , Atlanta , Georgia in the US , used MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scans to map the brains of dolphins and compare them with the brains of primates .
She found the ratio of dolphin brain mass to body size to be second only to the human brain , which means dolphin brains are relatively larger than those of chimpanzees .
The neocortex and cerebral cortex of the bottlenose dolphins were particularly large and the cortex had similar convoluted folds to those found in human brains and strongly associated with intelligence .
Cortical folds increase the volume of the cortex and its capacity for interconnections to form .
Marino said the findings on brain anatomy and intelligence of dolphins mean we should re-examine the treatment of dolphins , especially when their treatment results in suffering .
Reiss and Marino say their behavioral and anatomical findings and our new understanding of dolphin intelligence mean it may not be ethical to keep dolphins in aquatic amusement parks for our entertainment , or to kill them for food .
Around 300,000 whales , dolphins , and porpoises die each year , with some being killed for food , such as the annual killing of thousands of dolphins and small whales in Taijii , Japan , or even to prove the manhood of those killing them , such as the slaughter of Calderon dolphins at Faroe Island , in Denmark .
Reiss and Marino will present their findings at a conference in San Diego , California next month .
Also speaking at the conference will be professor of ethics and business at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles , Thomas White , who said the new research adds weight to his ideas that dolphins should be regarded as " non-human persons " with the right to be treated as individuals .
White is the author of the book " In Defense of Dolphins " .

Iraq Effect ( continued )
Our study shows that the Iraq War has generated a stunning sevenfold increase in the yearly rate of fatal jihadist attacks , amounting to literally hundreds of additional terrorist attacks and thousands of civilian lives lost ; even when terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan is excluded , fatal attacks in the rest of the world have increased by more than one - third .
We are not making the argument that without the Iraq War , jihadist terrorism would not exist , but our study shows that the Iraq conflict has greatly increased the spread of the Al Qaeda ideological virus , as shown by a rising number of terrorist attacks in the past three years from London to Kabul , and from Madrid to the Red Sea .
In our study we focused on the following questions :
Has jihadist terrorism gone up or down around the world since the invasion of Iraq ?
What has been the trend if terrorist incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan ( the military fronts of the “ war on terrorism ” ) are excluded ?
Has terrorism explicitly directed at the United States and its allies also increased ?
In order to zero in on The Iraq Effect , we focused on the rate of terrorist attacks in two time periods : September 12 , 2001 , to March 20 , 2003 ( the day of the Iraq invasion ) , and March 21 , 2003 , to September 30 , 2006 .
Extending the data set before 9/11 would risk distorting the results , because the rate of attacks by jihadist groups jumped considerably after 9/11 as jihadist terrorists took inspiration from the events of that terrible day .
We first determined which terrorist organizations should be classified as jihadist .
We included in this group Sunni extremist groups affiliated with or sympathetic to the ideology of Al Qaeda .
We decided to exclude terrorist attacks by Palestinian groups , as they depend largely on factors particular to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Our study draws its data from the MIPT - RAND Terrorism database ( available at terrorismknowledgebase.org ) , which is widely considered to be the best publicly available database on terrorism incidents .
RAND defines a terrorist attack as an attack on a civilian entity designed to promote fear or alarm and further a particular political agenda .
In our study we only included attacks that caused at least one fatality and were attributed by RAND to a known jihadist group .
In some terrorist attacks , and this is especially the case in Iraq , RAND has not been able to attribute a particular attack to a known jihadist group .
Therefore our study likely understates the extent of jihadist terrorism in Iraq and around the world .
Our study yields one resounding finding :
The rate of terrorist attacks around the world by jihadist groups and the rate of fatalities in those attacks increased dramatically after the invasion of Iraq .
Globally there was a 607 percent rise in the average yearly incidence of attacks ( 28.3 attacks per year before and 199.8 after ) and a 237 percent rise in the average fatality rate ( from 501 to 1,689 deaths per year ) .
A large part of this rise occurred in Iraq , which accounts for fully half of the global total of jihadist terrorist attacks in the post - Iraq War period .
But even excluding Iraq , the average yearly number of jihadist terrorist attacks and resulting fatalities still rose sharply around the world by 265 percent and 58 percent respectively .
And even when attacks in both Afghanistan and Iraq ( the two countries that together account for 80 percent of attacks and 67 percent of deaths since the invasion of Iraq ) are excluded , there has still been a significant rise in jihadist terrorism elsewhere–a 35 percent increase in the number of jihadist terrorist attacks outside of Afghanistan and Iraq , from 27.6 to 37 a year , with a 12 percent rise in fatalities from 496 to 554 per year .
Of course , just because jihadist terrorism has risen in the period after the invasion of Iraq , it does not follow that events in Iraq itself caused the change .
For example , a rise in attacks in the Kashmir conflict and the Chechen separatist war against Russian forces may have nothing to do with the war in Iraq .
But the most direct test of The Iraq Effect–whether the United States and its allies have suffered more jihadist terrorism after the invasion than before–shows that the rate of jihadist attacks on Western interests and citizens around the world ( outside of Afghanistan and Iraq ) has risen by a quarter , from 7.2 to 9 a year , while the yearly fatality rate in these attacks has increased by 4 percent from 191 to 198 .
One of the few positive findings of our study is that only 18 American civilians ( not counting civilian contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan ) have been killed by jihadist groups since the war in Iraq began .
But that number is still significantly higher than the four American civilians who were killed in attacks attributed to jihadist groups in the period between 9/11 and the Iraq War .
It was the capture and killing of much of Al Qaeda ’s leadership after 9/11 and the breakup of its training camp facilities in Afghanistan–not the war in Iraq –that prevented Al Qaeda from successfully launching attacks on American targets on the scale it did in the years before 9/11 .
Also undermining the argument that Al Qaeda and like - minded groups are being distracted from plotting against Western targets are the dangerous , anti-American plots that have arisen since the start of the Iraq War .
Jihadist terrorists have attacked key American allies since the Iraq conflict began , mounting multiple bombings in London that killed 52 in July 2005 , and attacks in Madrid in 2004 that killed 191 .
Shehzad Tanweer , one of the London bombers , stated in his videotaped suicide “ will , ” “ What have you witnessed now is only the beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you pull your forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq . ”
There have been six jihadist attacks on the home soil of the United States ’ NATO allies ( including Turkey ) in the period after the invasion of Iraq , whereas there were none in the 18 months following 9/11 ; and , of course , the plan uncovered in London in August 2006 to smuggle liquid explosives onto U.S. airliners , had it succeeded , would have killed thousands .
Al Qaeda has not let the Iraq War distract it from targeting the United States and her allies .
In a January 19 , 2006 audiotape , Osama bin Laden himself refuted President Bush ’s argument that Iraq had distracted and diverted Al Qaeda : “ The reality shows that that the war against America and its allies has not remained limited to Iraq , as he claims , but rather , that Iraq has become a source and attraction and recruitment of qualified people ….
As for the delay in similar [ terrorist ] operations in America , [ the ] operations are being prepared , and you will witness them , in your own land , as soon as preparations are complete . ”
Victorian Public Transport Minister Lynne Kosky is to quit politics , citing significant health problems in her family .
An emotional Ms Kosky called a press conference in Melbourne at 11 am to announce her intention to leave parliament immediately , forcing a by - election that will test the State Government 's hold on power before November 's election .
With trembling voice , Ms Kosky said she first contemplated quitting to devote more time to her family during a week 's holiday this month .
The Altona MP is married with two children , 14 and 16 .
She would not go into details about the family health issues but said the reasons behind her decision were particular to her and she encouraged all women to enter public life .
My Mom :
Have you heard , Apple ’s launching a pill in a couple of weeks !!
Me : …
Me : Erm …
Me : …
Me :
Is it possible you mean a ‘ tablet ’ ?
My Mom :
Yeah that !
Audience : [ hysterical laughter ]
The band : [ rimshot ]
It looks like everyone and their next door neighbor is super excited about whatever Apple will supposable reveal on January 27th .
We ’re no longer asking ourselves “ Will Apple launch a tablet , ” or “ When will the tablet be available ? ”
No , we ’re completely certain Apple will reveal a 10 ” touchscreen pumped up iPhone / scaled down Mac in the upcoming weeks .
The buzz around this is only comparable with the launch of the first generation iPhone .
As far as I can tell , there ’ve always been 2 major subjects when it came to rumors about which products Apple could launch : A phone , and a tablet .
Which makes me wonder what rumor sites will talk about after Steve pulls a tablet out of his pocket on January 27th .
As Spencer Fry said on Twitter :
We ’ll just go back to bitching about [ the ] Apple TV .
I had a large draft with predictions ready , but waited too long to publish it .
By the time I opened it early this week , multiple bloggers had already written a lot on the subject , and covered about 75 % of my ideas .
Here ’s a list you should check out if you want to catch up on what everyone is guessing the tablet will be :
A couple of these much respected bloggers mention that Apple might try to change the way we see desktops and laptops .
Combined with this new Lenovo IdeaPad U1 Hybrid Notebook ( what ’s in a name … ) , it sparked my imagination .
I had a dream
What about this :
You have a tablet , which stores all your media like music , pictures , movies , contacts , personal documents …
It has a touchscreen , wifi , bluetooth , fast SSD storage and a lot more .
Everything you can dream of in a tablet , a nice “ computer ” you could use on the couch , in bed , on the toilet , in the kitchen .
Let ’s say it looks like this :
Exhibit A : The Tablet
Next , imagine an iMac sans the internal computer , just a screen with some extra storage , extra RAM , a stronger video card , maybe even an extra processor , and a docking bay for the tablet .
Sounds familiar ?
Yes it does .
Combine this “ shell ” with our tablet , and you get a fully functional desktop computer :
Exhibit B : The Desktop
Finally , to come back to our original source of inspiration , we have something that looks like the bottom part of a laptop .
Built in you have a keyboard , a trackpad , some extra hardware and most importantly : A large second battery .
If the battery life of the tablet would be something between 6 and 8 hours ( in my opinion that ’s the minimum ) , this peripheral would extend that to 12 - 16 .
Exhibit C : The Laptop
This would be a perfect solution when you are traveling , when you need to take notes in a long meeting …
All your files , with you all the time , and no need to keep multiple devices in sync .
Exhibit D : The Complete Package
But I ’m not an idiot .
I ’m well aware Apple will never launch something that can slide or click into a peripheral .
Too many loose parts that can break , too many separate “ devices ” .
Like I said : a dream .
“ Why would I buy a device like that ? ”
Maybe you love using a laptop , but would like something more powerful for when you ’re in your office .
Maybe you ’re a die - hard fan of desktops , but you miss having all your files with you when on the road .
The possibilities are endless , especially when you add the option to install third party applications ( like on the iPhone ) .
If it ’s not running Mac OS X , but something more like the iPhone OS , it could be the perfect computer for your parents or grandparents .
Or for your kids .
Imagine the possibilities when using this device at schools .
It could be a notebook , a diary , multiple textbooks …
Do n’t expect Apple to advertise the device as an electronic book reader though .
Yes , it ’ll be used as one a lot , but it ’s not catchy enough to sell it under that name .
Just like with the iPhone , the software independent developers are going to write for this device will reveal the true power of it .
There ’s a lot you can do with a 10 ” touchscreen device .
Conclusion
Nobody ( not even the people who say they do ) has any idea what Steve will pull out his sleeve on January 27th .
Right now , it ’s a big blur , but as soon as the keynote is over , it ’ll be so clear , so logical , that we ’ll all say “ Now why did n’t I think of that ? ! ”
The only thing I know , is that I ’ll take 2 .

Back in October 2005 this Spy Blog article Terrorism Bill 2005 - part 2 of our comments asked :
Why is there any need for regulation in this area at all ?
The existing Acceptable Use Policies of all UK website operators , for example , already means that there are no public " terrorist websites " operating from servers within the United Kingdom .
If the intention is to somehow stop impressionable people from falling into the clutches of terrorist recruiters , then this is already as effective as it will ever be .
If people are already moving within extremist circles , then private websites , especially those hosted abroad , are beyond the competence and legal jurisdiction of the Home Office or the UK Police .
Any attempts to " disrupt " these systems , such as those hosted in , say China , could easily be interpreted as " cyber war " , which would damage the UK economy far more than the slight , temporary effect that " disruption " of such sites would have on the terrorists .
It would also remove the opportunity for covert surveillance of such " honeypots " for intelligence gathering purposes .
It now turns out that this inept Labour Government 's scaremongering and controversial Terrorism Act 2006 section 3 Application of ss. 1 and 2 to internet activity etc.. internet censorship powers , which relate to section 1 " Encouragement of terrorism " and / or section 2 . " Dissemination of terrorist publications " , have never actually been invoked .

Written answers and statements , 10 February 2010 Baroness Warsi ( Shadow Minister ( Community Cohesion and Social Action ) , Communities and Local Government ; Conservative )
To ask Her Majesty 's Government how many times the police have used powers under section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2006 to seek the removal or modification of unlawful terrorist - related material from the internet in each of the last six months .
Lord West of Spithead ( Parliamentary Under - Secretary ( Security and Counter - terrorism ) , Home Office ; Labour ) The Home Office and ACPO ( TAM ) have set up a new unit , the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit ( CTIRU ) , which was launched in a pilot capacity on 1 February 2010 .
The CTIRU is responsible for the co-ordination and execution of voluntary and Section 3 take - down notices .
Further details on the CTIRU , including statistics regarding take - downs , will be available in due course .
To date , the preferred route for removing potentially unlawful terrorist content is through informal contact between the police and the internet service provider .
This approach has proved effective .
As a result , it has not been necessary to use the formal powers given under the Terrorism Act 2006 to seek the removal or modification of unlawful terrorist - related material from the internet .
Note the creation of Yet Another Unaccountable Bureaucratic Quango , the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit ( CTIRU )
The legal powers under the Terrorism Act 2006 , were , typically , and totally unnecessarily , made available to any Police Constable , no matter how ill trained , or ignorant of the internet or of free speech or religious freedom issues .
Why did the original legislation not restrict these legal power only to members of a properly trained unit , dedicated full time to the task , as , hopefully the CTIRU now is ?
Before the Terrorism Act 2006 , UK based internet and telecommunications companies always cooperated voluntarily with the Police , and they appear to have done so since .
Before the Terrorism Act 2006 , foreign based internet companies had no obligation to cooperate and neither do they now .
What was the point of it all ?
Why not simply repeal this Act , with no loss in effectiveness whatsoever against real terrorists , and thereby nullifying somewhat , the propaganda victory which these repressive powers handed to the terrorists ?
On Tuesday , the 2nd most emailed article on WSJ.com was Crisis Compels Economists To Reach for New Paradigm .
It is an intriguing look at the problems of the the field of economics .
It went , however , way too easy on both the profession and its practitioners .
The article fails to ask some very basic questions about the soft science , and does not discuss the fundamental incompetency of many economists .
Given the failures of the profession — failing to anticipate the worst recession in decades , missing the warping effect of the housing boom , not recognizing the credit collapse until too late — a damning indictment of the dismal science might have been more appropriate .
Perhaps I can be of assistance .
There are many areas I would have liked to see the Economics Crisis article explore :
The lack of Scientific Method , the mostly awful performance of economists , its misunderstanding of the value of modeling , the bias inherent in Wall Street variant of economics , and lastly , the corruption of economics by politics .
I will just touch on some of these ; you can fill in much of the blanks yourself .
Let ’s start with the basics .
Hard “ science ” — Physics , Biology , Chemistry , and all variants thereto — begins humbly .
They try to describe the universe around us by creating theories , and then testing them .
These theorems are always preliminary .
Even when testing validates them , Science is always prepared — even eager — to replace them with newer theories that are proven to be even more valid .
The humility of science begins with an admission :
We know nothing .
We seek to learn through experiment and logic , and constantly evolve more and more accurate explanations .
Scientific belief evolves gradually over time .
Nothing is assumed , presumed , or hypothesized as true .
Indeed , research is a presumption that current theories are inadequate or incomplete .
The practice of science is a an ongoing search for better explanations , more proof , further verification — for Truth .
Science is the ultimate “ show me ” state .
Economics has a somewhat , shall we call it , less rigorous approach .
Indeed , the arrogance of economics is that it is the polar opposite of Science .
It begins with a few basic assumptions , many of which are obviously untrue ; some are demonstrably false .
No , Mankind is not a rational , profit maximizing actor .
No , markets are not perfectly , or even nearly , efficient .
No , prices do not reflect the sum total of all that is known about a given market , sector or stock .
Those of you who pretend otherwise are fools who deserve to have your 401 ks cut in half .
That is called just desserts .
The problem is that your foolishness helped cut nearly everyone else ’s 401 ks in half .
That is called criminal incompetence .
Where was I ?
Ahhh , our sad tale of the practitioners of the dismal arts .
Starting from a false premise that fails to understand the most basic behaviors of the Human animal , economics proceeds to build an edifice of cards on a foundation of sand .
( How could that possibly go astray ? )
Like a moonshot off by a few inches at launch , by the time the we reach further into time and space , the trajectory is off by millions of miles . . .
~~~
Economics has had a justifiable inferiority complex versus real sciences the past century .
It has attempted to overcome this by throwing lots of smart mathematicians at its practice , in an attempt to make the social art seem more “ sciency , ” and thus more credible .
This had led to lots and lots of formulas and models .
The problems is , Economics places way too much weight on these .
It creates an illusion of precision where none exists .
The belief in their models led to all manner of mischief , from subprime to derivatives to risk management .
Economics forgot George E. P.
Box ’s most basic rule :
“ Essentially , all models are wrong , but some are useful ”
Box was a statistician who recognized the fundamental truth of all attempts to depict the universe mathematically :
They are inherently flawed .
He also understood that these flawed attempts can at times have value .
His insights contextualize what mathematical modelers do — and fail to achieve .
Economics fails at this often .
The belief in the validity of their models — like the theories they are based upon — is the Achilles heel of the profession .
This is not to say there are not good , even great economists ( some are even friends of mine ! ) who foresaw the coming crisis and warned about it .
Many are aghast at the rigor mortis in the academic establishment ; some are horrified at how poorly the profession has done .
Forget forecasting the future , too many economists cannot accurately describe what happened yesterday .
The Behaviorists have been fighting the mainstream for decades now , trying to correct the errors of the basic building blocks of the dismal science .

Excerpt :
It was over two years ago when Google announced Gears , which promised to make Google services — and potentially lots more — available offline .
Since then the project has moved at a creep , all but stalling entirely .
Gears , it seems , has died .

Mark Milian and Harry McCracken have been collecting the murder evidence , which has been mounting for months :
• Gears is not supported in Mac versions of Chrome
• Standalone Gears is not supported in Snow Leopard , months after release
• Google 's been evasive about Gears support in Chrome OS , even though offline web apps are a vital part of it
• Google has n't announced a new Gears - compatible product in months

All this is decidedly circumstantial , but it hints that Google is planning to wait to HTML5 , which supports a lot of the same offline features as Gears , before putting all their eggs in one basket .
Then , this :
We 're continuing to support Gears so that nothing breaks for sites that use it .
But we expect developers to use HTML5 for these features moving forward as it's a standards - based approach that will be available across all browsers .

This is directly from Google in response to Milian 's post , and stops short of kicking Gears to the curb , but only just .
Here 's what it really means :
Google will quietly move away from Gears , let it live out its life in comfort , and after starting a beautiful family with HTML5 , pretend that it never existed .
[ LAT , Technologizer ]
I do not subscribe to the viewpoint that a race is inherently superior to another , because there are ALWAYS exceptions .
Nothing is black and white .
Call me a liberal shithead , but that 's how it is for me .
Diversity does n't work
AT THE END OF THE DAY , DIVERSITY HAS JUMPED THE SHARK , HORRIFICALLY
" Diversity " is a difficulty to be overcome , not an advantage to be sought .
True , America does a better job than most at accommodating a diverse population .
We also do a better job at curing cancer and containing pollution .
But no one goes around mindlessly exclaiming : " Cancer is a strength ! " " Pollution is our greatest asset ! "
Preserving each ethnicity is important
Most people are stupid or corrupt , so we should clear them out and keep the 5 % who are good
Evolution is real
This is basically where I come from , except the " nothing is black and white " meaning " no decisions are binary " part -- clearly false .
I think there 's a couple issues here :
History shows us no successful examples of " diverse " societies , but a repeated pattern : wealthy civilizations in decay import labor and mercenaries , then become embroiled in constant race / class conflict , which helps kill them off .
They leave behind mixed - race civilizations that while they have a few good people , are unable to do anything constructive , because the mob mentality is too strong .
Examples : Mexico , Brazil , Iraq , Russia .
Diversity is the new Swastika , King George or Hammer and Sickle : official unrealistic dogma you must obey , in denial of reality ; a means by which the stupid get ahead of the smart .
When the stupid get ahead of the smart , and form a lynch mob to drown them out because they bring up unpopular truths , your society becomes third world I am a Conservationist .
I believe in conserving forests .
I believe in conserving the Purple House Finch just as much as the sparrow .
To that end , Germany for Germans , Israel for Jews .
Kick the Jews out of Germany , and the Palestinians out of Israel .
Unfortunately , our mania for " diversity " and commerce , democracy and popularity contests -- it destroys these things .
This is the point that deadite is slyly making : you 're not good just because you 're white , and you 're not superior to anyone by birth , because in the dice roll of genetic recombination at birth , you could have turned out bad .
Encoding errors happen .
Sometimes good families give birth to retards , autistics , sociopaths and others .
Yes , some races evolved in more challenging climates , and so have multiple physical attributes that are different and often improved .
Santayana calls them " favored races " ; if he 's talking about North Asians , Northern Europeans and Jews , I agree .
These groups are the smartest and most capable people we have and we should encourage them .
IQ determines ability , and correlates highly with health , strength and good moral character .
It is the single most important measure of a human being , but alone predicts nothing other than the ability to be intelligent .
If you 're a high - IQ sociopath , you 're still no good .
But if you 're a low - IQ person , you 're more likely to steal , rape , destroy , etc. out of pure stupidity .
People under 105 IQ points cannot understand this discussion , although theypretend to be able to .
What does that tell you ?
True , Africa is lagging behind on average IQ -- that means there are fewer smart people , and others who possess other evolutionary leaps , among them .
Still does n't mean you treat them badly .
Evolution is also real at the individual level , whcih is why the previous point : we should smite the stupid / bad , and protect / nurture the good / smart .
Not rocket science .
I 'm glad we have a topic to finally fight this out after years of doing it in the Summoning topic .
I hope it does n't take over the board like it did in the past , because then neither side can speak to the other .
I came from a leftist background , and from it I retain the ideals of ( a ) fairness and ( b ) rabid environmentalism , although the latter originated in the far - right .
My problem with leftism is that it 's the lynch mob mentality : it 's individuals deciding the world did them wrong , so they 're going to blame society and destroy it , and theyreplace societies with third world regimes
This cycle has been documented for longer than the Bible has existed ; you can find it in not only Plato , but Herotodus , and Tacitus , as well as many others .
Modern versions are Spengler and Toynbee , and even liberal Jared Diamond points out much of it The chaos at this board was so much that SRP / VP documented his opinions on this topic here :
Anyone who has been a gamer over the past decade or so will have noticed that many games shout about an additional creative feature : the level editor .
These allow us , the players , to produce maps for our favourite games , and to feel like we 're giving something back to the gaming community when we share them online .
These tools are , of course , rooted in the actual tools that game development studios use to make the games in the first place , and it's the significance of that toolset , for both commercial and hobbyist purposes , that we 'll be examining .
Way back at the time of Doom lots of us picked up the editor and began to work out how to turn these line - models into playable levels .
It was fiddly stuff , and not exactly the most obvious process .
Reading tutorials was a must .
Nowadays , however , things are a little shinier , and seemingly a little more straightforward .
As the tech has developed , so the design process has moved onward , giving us new stuff to play with at home .
Powerful editing suites for games such as Unreal Tournament 3 and Crysis give us far more instant gratification and flexibility than ever before , and yet the flipside of that is complexity .
Loading up one of these editors and playing with its toolset gives the impression that these game - authoring tools are more accessible and easier to use than previous generations , and yet commercial operations talk about games being harder to make than ever before .
Mods for big games are taking longer , and maps are become a colossal undertaking .
So what 's really going on with level design ?
Is it really becoming too complex for the hobbyist ?
That 's been id 's excuse for not supporting mods in Rage , for instance .
Have we already lost the art of the one - man level ?
We 'll talk to some of the experts who use the current editors , see how the process has changed in the past decade , and examine some of the strange applications that people ending up finding for game level design .
Could level design possibly be… art ?
Level design is one of the fundamental processes of game development .
Building the 3D environments we play our games in is a talent that underlies a huge number of gaming experiences , from Tomb Raider to Wipeout .
It 's probably within the first - person shooter genre that this process is at its most visible , since the level - editing kit is regularly released to us , the gaming public .
Many level designers start out using these tools and then find their way into the industry proper .
One such case in point is Neil Alphonso , a level designer currently employed at UK studio Splash Damage , where he 's making the new shooter , Brink .
" I worked in special effects and editing for television and film after graduating , " says Alphonso , " but after some introspection I thought I had the necessary skills to take a different career path , one in games .
I took the time to learn an engine and started making maps , and in a total case of being at the right place at the right time , I landed a role on the first Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell game . "
Alphonso's career path following this decision was pretty exciting , even by jet - setting games industry standards : " I then worked on a game called Shadow Ops : Red Mercury , and then spent some time on the infamous Duke Nukem Forever , before moving to Holland to work on Killzone 2 . "
Alphonso is now working on a multiplayer shooter , a genre that can be regarded as the heartland of level design , because it 's where so many designers get started .
This is evident in the kinds of maps that Alphonso mentions as classics , when we prod him for some suggestions :
" The first levels that always come into my mind are ' The Dark Zone ' and ' The Bad Place ' from the original Quake ( DM4 and DM6 , respectively ) , as they played a huge role in my decision to pursue a career in the games industry .
A more recent single player focused example is the outstanding ' All Ghillied Up ' for Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , a level in which you re-enact a past mission of your hard - nosed CO .
All three of those levels would certainly qualify as classics among level designers , but by now that list has gotten pretty large ! "
A craft refined
What we 've seen in the past ten years is very much a refinement of the level designer 's art .
Great levels , in which everything is built to lead the experience , without ever betraying that to the player .
While a multiplayer deathmatch level might need to be essentially donut - shaped and circular ( so that players can move through the level to pick up weapons and not become trapped by their opponents ) , other game designs demand other kinds of environments : open levels that close down into corridors so you can perform specific objectives , for example , or the non-linear levels that allow you to explore but create paths so that you do n't get lost , such as in STALKER .
Ever notice how you get lost far less in modern games than in the games we saw a decade ago ?
Probably not , because it 's such a subtle effect .
Level design in single - player games has become the art of sign - posting , which is about pointing people in the right directions with subtle visual aids : a light here , a blood trail there .
As Alphonso mentions , this is all encoded within the architectures that designers create .
" Levels like the original Halo's ' Silent Cartographer ' have formed a sort of language that we can use to convey form , pacing , direction , and the other various aspects of level design , " says the Brink level lead .
Level design is essentially a new frontier – a place where designers are learning to create artificial environments with constantly refreshed technology .
What you learned two years ago might not be relevant in a couple of years time .
It 's a huge challenge to stay on top .
However , what has driven the development of level - editing tools , says Alphonso , is less about this craft , and more about the commercial concerns of the people who make game engines .

Abstract
Aims :
This study was aimed to determine whether there was any relationship between consumption of chillies and postoperative symptoms after closed anal sphincterotomy in patients with chronic anal fissure .
Materials and Methods : Patients were randomly assigned to receive analgesics and fiber supplement alone ( control patients ) or consumption of 1.5 g chilli powder twice daily along with identical fiber and analgesics ( chilli group ) .
The evaluation of symptoms ( pain , anal burning , and pruritus ) during the postoperative period was assessed by means of patients ’ self - questionnaires .
The amount of analgesic tablets consumed and the frequency of stool during the study period were also noted .
Results : 28 patients were recruited in each arm .
Postoperative symptoms were higher in the group consuming chillies during the first postoperative week .
The global scores for postoperative pain ( 7.60 in chilli group and 2.95 in control group , p < 0.001 ) and for anal burning ( 8.85 for the chilli group vs. 4.21 for the control group , p < 0.0001 ) were significant .
Conclusion :
This study shows that consumption of red chillies after anal fissure surgery should be forbidden to avoid postoperative symptoms .

Introduction
Chillies are generally believed to be harmful to patients with anal pathologies [ 1 ] like anal fissures and hemorrhoidal disease [ 2 ] .
Consequently , these patients are advised to take a relatively bland diet containing little or no spices and chillies .
However , very few studies are available which demonstrate a direct relationship between consumption of chillies and development or deterioration of anorectal diseases [ 3 ] .
Sun -dried chillies , which contain capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin , contain nitrophenols , which by producing nitrosation of foodstuff , often believed to be gastric stimulant , are known to cause toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract [ 4 ] .
Capsaicin is known to affect visceral sensory perception and chillies have been shown to accelerate gut transit increasing the bowel frequency [ 5 ] .
In an experimental study , it was found that consumption of red chillies produced exfoliation of intestinal epithelium in the lumen in rats [ 6 ] .
Chillies have been blamed as being an ulcerogenic food substance [ 7 ] .
For the reasons mentioned above , we set a trial to evaluate any cause - effect relationship between the ingestion of dried chillies and postoperative symptoms after a closed anal sphincterotomy in patients with chronic anal fissure , through a prospective , randomized , placebo - controlled and double - blind trial .
Materials and Methods
Patients were recruited from Fine Morning Hospital and Research Center between January and August 2006 .
All patients with chronic idiopathic fissure in ano ( defined as anal fissure with > 8 weeks ’ symptom duration ) in whom conservative treatment had failed and who were suitable for lateral sphincterotomy were considered for inclusion in this study .
Exclusion criteria were previous sphincterotomy or anal dilatation , fissure associated with inflammatory bowel disease , suspicion of malignant fissure or ulcer , concomitant procedure to be performed at the time of sphincterotomy ( excision of skin tag was permitted ) .
Further exclusion criteria were an inability to understand the end points of the study and to complete the forms for data recording .
The study was conducted by following a randomized , control design .
56 patients ( 21 women and 35 men ) with an average age of 32 ( range 18 – 44 ) years were recruited .
The study population was then randomly assigned by computer - based sequential method , either post - sphincterotomy analgesic therapy plus placebo ( as described below ) ( control patients , n = 28 ) or identical analgesic therapy plus chillies ( chilli patients , n = 28 ) .
Preparation of Capsules of Chillies and Placebo
After analyzing cookery books from five different expert cooks and the medical literature [ 1 ] , it was estimated that about 1.5 g of dried chilli powder is required to add to a normal dish to make it spicy enough .
So this amount of chilli was confectioned in a capsule .
The capsules were prepared by an independent pharmacy not attached with the hospital .
Capsules were numbered consecutively , but the sequence of placebo and chilli powder was randomized .
The chilli powder was obtained through a commercially available pack of chilli powder approved by the Food and Drug Administration in India and containing ground sun-dried red chillies .
The active capsule contained 1.5 g of chilli powder and 0.5 g lactose - free microcrystalline cellulose .
Placebo capsules contained 2 g of microcrystalline cellulose alone .
Both the capsules were colored black to prevent identification of the contents .
Surgery
A single surgeon performed all the procedures , with the patient in the lithotomy position .
Closed lateral sphincterotomy was performed by the technique described by Hoffmann and Goligher [ 8 ] , using a short stab incision and blind division of the internal sphincter guided by the surgeon ’s finger .
The Ethics Committee of Fine Morning Hospital and Research Center , Nagpur , approved the protocol of this study .
Drug Treatment
In the immediate postoperative period , 50 mg of diclofenac was administered by intramuscular route .
Patients were routinely discharged on the evening of the procedure unless otherwise clinically indicated .
All patients were supplied with tablets containing diclofenac sodium 50 mg , 2 tablets orally a day or more as needed but not more than 4 tablets .
They were also prescribed with a fiber supplement Fybogel ( manufactured by Nicholas Piramal India Ltd ) 10 g daily and were instructed to maintain a high fluid intake .
Each patient was given a pack containing 14 capsules ( containing placebo or chilli powder ) numbered consecutively and to be taken after lunch and dinner every day for the following 7 days .
Both the patients and the doctors associated with this study were unaware of the contents of the capsules .
During the study period , patients were instructed to avoid any other food potentially related to gastrointestinal and hemorrhoidal symptoms such as spices , alcohol , tobacco , tea and coffee .
Assessment and Evaluation of Symptoms
After hospital discharge , patients were asked to report after 7 days .
They were asked to self - assess specific symptoms , which included pain , anal burning ( described as burning sensation in the anus after defecation ) , and pruritus .
Each symptom was allocated a score from 0 to 3 ( 0 = no symptoms , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe intensity ) .
Patients were also asked to note the amount of analgesic tablets consumed and the number of stools passed in 24 h from day 1 to day 7 in the post - discharge period .
Statistical Analysis
A sample size calculation estimated that a minimum of 25 patients in each arm would be required to demonstrate an increase in the postoperative symptoms at the 5 % significance level with a power of 95 % .
In our analysis , we used Friedman ’s test for categorical variables as mean scores for each symptom analyzed ( pain , anal burning and pruritus ) and the Mann - Whitney U test for continuous variables ( for global scores ( GS ) ) .
The Friedman ’s test does not allow for a comparison between two treatments .
Therefore a GS was constructed to compare increase in symptoms in the chilli group with those in the control ( placebo ) group .
For each symptom the GS was calculated by adding up mean scores throughout the study period of 7 days .
This was done for each group ( control and chilli ) .
The Mann - Whitney U test was used to compare aggravation of GS for each symptom in both groups over the study period .
The mean frequency of stool passed and the amount of analgesic tablets consumed during these 7 days was also assessed .
Results
Comparison of Patient Groups
Patients were assessed at baseline for demographic characteristics .
There was no significant difference in these variables between the two groups ( table 1 ) .
No intra- or postoperative complications were recorded .
Table 1
Evaluation of Symptoms
Pain .
The daily mean pain score was significantly lower in the placebo group throughout the study period ( GS = 7.60 in chilli group and 2.95 in control group , p < 0.001 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
With regard to the mean analgesic requirement in the study period of 7 days , patients used an average of 11 tablets ( range 6 – 14 ) in the placebo group in the first 7 days after surgery compared with 16 tablets ( range 11 – 21 tablets ) in the chilli group .
Fig. 1
Anal Burning .
There was a significant burning sensation experienced by the patients in the chilli group ( GS = 8.85 for the chilli group vs. 4.21 for the control group , p < 0.0001 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
The GS for pruritus ( 4.45 in the control group and 5.75 in chilli group , p < 0.69 ) was higher in the chilli group when compared with the control group ; however , it did not reach statistically significant level .
The mean frequency of stool passed over the study period in patients from the chilli group was 17 , while it was 13 in the control group .

Discussion
Anal fissure is a split extending from the anal verge towards the dentate line .
The pathogenesis is thought to be related to severe constipation or to straining at stool , since the hard fecal bolus may crack the anal canal [ 9 ] .
Risk factors frequently mentioned include constipation , pregnancy and diet [ 10 ] .
A diet rich in fats , alcohol , spices and pepper as well low fluid intake have been implicated [ 11 ] .
In women , certain obstetric events have been reported to favor symptom development [ 12 ] .
As regards relationship of chillies and anal fissure , the literature is very scanty with very few papers describing the effect of pepper or chillies on anal fissure and its symptoms [ 13 ] .
The exact mechanism by which chillies influence the colonic and rectal physiology is not well understood .
Capsaicin , the pungent principle of hot pepper , has the ability to excite and later defunctionalize a subset of primary afferent neurons [ 14 ] .
Chillies are known to cause rectal hyperalgesia in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [ 15 ] .
A significant increase in the number of mucosal inflammatory cells and an increase in BrdU - immunoreactive nuclei were detected following mucosal exposure to capsaicin in the colon [ 16 ] .
One study in rats showed that chilli supplementation promotes colon carcinogenesis [ 17 ] .
A case of small bowel obstruction and localized ileal perforation caused by an undigested green chilli has been reported [ 18 ] .
The most important study was of Altomare et al . [ 19 ] , where in a randomized and controlled study they found that there is no relationship between consumption of red chillies and aggravation of hemorrhoidal symptoms .
However , we feel that the amount of capsicum used for this study was much less ( 10 mg ) than what is actually used in Indian diet [ 20 ] .
Secondly , the conclusion was made after a very short period of ingestion of chilli ( 48 h ) , which we feel to be too brief to reach to any significant conclusion .
There are few studies which have shown that chillies have an adverse effect in the gastrointestinal tract causing duodenal ulcer [ 7 ] , esophageal and gastric cancer [ 21 ] , ileal perforation , pruritus ani [ 22 ] , incisor tooth wear [ 23 ] and cancer of the abdomen [ 24 ] .
Few other studies have found that spices do have an adverse effect on hemorrhoid and anal fissure symptomatology , though they have not mentioned chillies in specific [ 25 ] .
Chillies are known to cause accelerated gut transit increasing frequency of stool [ 26 ] , which itself could be a factor aggravating symptoms of anal fissure .
In our study there was a definite increase in the stool frequency in patients consuming chillies when compared to the placebo group causing increased frequency of anal burning and pain .
Our study has clearly demonstrated that consumption of red chilli powder increases the postoperative symptoms after sphincterotomy showing a direct relationship between chilli consumption and symptoms of anal fissure .
This was more significant with regard to pain and anal burning .
Conclusion
This study shows that consumption of 3 g of red chillies per day in the postoperative period after sphincterotomy for anal fissure increases the extent and duration of typical postoperative symptoms , which include pain , anal burning , and anal itch .

What is a magic square A magic square consists of the distinct positive integers 1 , 2 , ... n2 , such that the sum of the n numbers in any horizontal , vertical , or main diagonal line is always the same magic constant .
If the rows and columns sum to the magic constant ( so ignoring the main diagonals ) it is called a semimagic square .
Several ways exist to automatically generate magic squares , among which the most famous one is the Siamese method to generate odd - sized magic squares .
It is also called the de la Loubere 's method .
The method is purported to have been first reported in the West when de la Loubere returned to France after serving as ambassador to Siam .
Example of the classic constructions
This example is taken from the excellent description on Math Forum .
I reproduce it almost literally here in case that link ever goes away .
Start with an empty n x n square , where n is odd .
We 'll begin with n = 5 and denote its blank entries with dots .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The problem of making this into a magic square is one of counting from 1 to 25 ( in general n2 ) as one runs through the boxes of the square in some order .
The basic rule for doing this is that one counts diagonally upwards to the right .
For example , if one has written a 12 in the 2nd position of the 4th row . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 . . . . . . . . then the numbers 13,14,15 will be placed thus : . . . . 15 . . . 14 . . . 13 . . . 12 . . . . . . . .
Let 's see this in action .
First you have to know where to start : begin in the middle of the top row with a 1 .
( Here we for the first time use the assumption that n is odd , which guarantees that there is a middle square in the top row ) .
If you do n't start there , the row and column sums will be ok , but the diagonals wo n't add to the magic sum .
. . 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now , the first thing one observes is that it is impossible to move diagonally upwards from this position , since we are already at the top of the square .
This is an example of what can go wrong with the basic method of moving diagonally upwards to the right .
There are actually three things that can go wrong :
You could be at the top edge of the square so you can't go up .
You could be at the right edge of the square so you can't move right .
The square you would like to put the next number in may already be occupied .
Here is what to do in those cases :
If you are at the top edge , pretend that the top edge is pasted to the bottom edge and come up through the bottom .
Thus , after 1 , we place 2 as follows : . . 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 .
In other words , we pretend that the bottom row is the row above the top row .
Moving diagonally upwards to the right means moving up one row and over one column to the right .
So the 2 goes in the bottom row one column to the right of the column containing the 1 .
If you are at the right edge , pretend that the right edge is pasted to the left edge and that the left edge is immediately to the right of the right edge .
We are in this situation after counting to 3 , since after the above diagram , we have . . 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 . . . 2 . and apparently have no place to go .
But moving diagonally upwards to the right is the same as moving right one column and up one row .
Moving right one column from the rightmost column puts us in the leftmost column , so 4 must be in the leftmost column , and moving up one row we put the 4 in the row above the row containing the 3 .
So we get . . 1 . . . . . . . 4 . . . . . . . . 3 . . . 2 .
What if there is a number already occupying the square one would like to move into ?
We are in this situation after we place the number 5 .
Indeed , continuing from the previous diagram , we place the 5 diagonally upwards and to the right of the 4 and get . . 1 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . . . . . . 3 . . . 2 . and when we next try to place the 6 , the square we would like to put the 6 in already has the 1 in it !
When this happens , the rule is to abandon , just this once , the plan of moving diagonally upwards to the right and instead just drop down one square from the square one is in presently .
So the 6 will be placed directly below the 5 . . . 1 . . . 5 . . . 4 6 . . . . . . . 3 . . . 2 .
After that , one continues counting normally : . . 1 8 . . 5 7 . . 4 6 . . . . . . . 3 . . . 2 .
Eventually , one gets the whole 5x5 square in this way : 17 24 1 8 15 23 5 7 14 16 4 6 13 20 22 10 12 19 21 3 11 18 25 2 9
The magic constant is 65 in this example , and indeed all rows , columns and the two main diagonals sum to 65 .
The application of the basic rule of counting diagonally upwards , with the modifications above for handling the edges and the case where a number is in the way , is pretty straightforward .
But there is one case that requires a little thought .
Namely , when one gets to 15 , where does one go next ? . . 1 8 15 . 5 7 14 . 4 6 13 . . 10 12 . . 3 11 . .
2 9 Since 15 is in the top row , 16 would normally go in the bottom row .
Since 15 is on the right edge , 16 would normally go on the left edge .
The position which is in the bottom row and the left edge is the lower left corner .
That is where we want to put the 16 .
Unfortunately , it is already occupied by the number 11 .
So there is a number in the way , and the rule is then to drop down to the square below the 15 .
That is why the 16 is directly below the 15 . . . 1 8 15 . 5 7 14 16 4 6 13 . . 10 12 . . 3 11 . . 2 9 All other instances of the rules are a lot easier to figure out .
The same method was used to make a 3x3 magic square : 8 1 6 3 5 7 4 9 2
It is directly obvious that this construction is is really only one of a whole family .
Instead of generating the diagonals going up / right , we could also have chosen to go down / left or up / left or down / right , appropiately changing the step we do when we come to an already filled in square .
But the family is more general in fact .
Consider for example the follwing description of the pyramid method taken from Mathematics Enrichment .
The Pyramid method or extended diagonals consists of three steps : Draw a pyramid of same size squares as the magic square 's squares , on each side of the magic square .
The pyramid should be two less , in number of squares on its base , than the number of squares on the side of the magic square .
Sequentially place the numbers 1 to n2 of the nxn magic square in the diagonals as shown in figure 1 .
Relocate any number not in the nxnsquare to the opposite hole inside the square ( shaded ) .
The same Pyramid method can be used for any odd order magic square as shown below for the 5x5 square .
Now if you carefully observe the resulting magic squares , you see that it is in fact just the standard Siamese method , but with a different starting point ( one to the right of the center ) and another displacement in case a square is already occupied ( go 2 to the right )
The standard dispacement also does not have to be a simple diagonal .
Consider for example using a knights jump down right as standard move and moving up two as exceptional move : 10 12 19 21 3 17 24 1 8 15 4 6 13 20 22 11 18 25 2 9 23 5 7 14 16
However , not just everything works .
Consider for example going one to the right as standard move and one down as exceptional move : 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 6 13 14 15 11 12 19 20 16 17 18 25 21 22 23 24
Here even the rows and columns do n't sum to the magic constant , and it 's obvious that moving the starting point wo n't change this ( you 'll still end up with a row containing a permutation of 1,2,3,4,5 and another row containing a permutation of 21,22,23,24,25 which obviously do n't have the same sum ) .
So the question arises : what exactly are the rules ?
Formalizing the construction
Let 's denote the amount of times we applied the standard move by i ( start counting at 0 ) , and the amount of times we did the exceptional move by j ( again start counting at 0 ) .
And let 's apply a coordinate system to the square , where x runs from left to right and y runs from top to bottom , again both counting from 0 .
And let 's call the x and y coordinates of the initial number a ' and b' respectively .
Let 's also call the dispacements of the normal step in the x and y direction u' and v' .
So for the first few steps in the Siamese method we get something like : x = i*u '+a ' y = i * v '+b'
In the first example we started in the middle of the top row , so with a= ( n - 1 ) / 2 and b = 0 , and a standard dispacement of ( 1 , - 1 ) , so that gives : x = i + ( n - 1) /2 y = -i Oops , we already get into trouble at i=1 , where y goes negative ( the point where in the construction we should wrap from top to bottom ) .
And at i = ( n+1 ) / 2 we get x=n , the point where we should wrap from right to left .
We can take care of the wrapping by taking x and y modulo n , the size of the square , so we get : x = ( i*u '+a ' ) % n y = ( i*v '+b ' ) %n
In modular arithmetic it 's directly obvious that i=n is equivalent to i=0 , so we will get to the point ( a ' , b ' ) again .
This might be when we must do the exceptional move .
However , it 's also possible that already for some lower value of i we got back to the initial point .
So let 's call the lowest value for which this happens i0 ( so we know 0 < i0 <= n ) .
This implies that i0 * u ' = k * n .
Now consider the multiplicative factors of n .
Each of them must be in either i0 or u .
If none are in u' , they are all in i0 , which must then be a multiple of n , and , since we know i0 < =n , i0=n .
So i0 != n can only happen when gcd ( u ' , n ) = f != 1 . Let 's again consider ( with f either 1 or not ) : i0 *f *( u '/ f ) = k* f * ( n /f ) or i0 *( u ' / f ) = k *( n /f ) where u' / f has no factors in common with n/f ( since gcd ( u ' , n ) = f ) .
So again all factors in n/f must be in i0 , so i0 =m * ( n / f ) .
The same reasoning can be applied to the y - coordinate , so i0 =m ' *( n / f ' ) .
The smallest non -zero number fulfilling both of these is lcm ( n / f , n /f ' ) , and for this number we have : i*u = m *( n / f ) *f*( u'/ f ) = m *n*( u '/f ) = 0 ( mod n ) i*u = m' *( n / f ) *f *( v'/f ) = m ' *n *( v'/f ) = 0 ( mod n ) ( a = b ( mod n ) is an alternative notation for a%n = b%n )
So we see that i0 = lcm ( n / gcd(n , u ' ) , n / gcd(n , v' ) ) = n /gcd(n , u' , v' )
So each time i is a multiple of i0 , we apply the exceptional case by adding and extra offset of p ' and q ' to x and y .
So we get : x = ( i* u '+ j * p '+a ' ) % n y = ( i *v'+j* q '+b ' ) %n
Notice that this is slightly different from the way we formulated the exceptional displacement up to this point , since that used to be relative to i0 - 1 , so it correspondeds to ( p'+u ' , q'+v ' ) .
This is ( 0 , 1 ) in the original example , so ( p ' , q ' ) = ( - 1 , 2 ) , so the complete formula is : x = ( i - j + ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) %n y = ( - i+2 * j ) %n
Again it is obvious that in general when j is a multiple of n , this is equivalent to j=0 , but it 's possible that already before that point we end up in the same place .
Let 's call the first j for which that happens j0 .
Like before we conclude j0 = n / gcd(n , p ' , q ' ) .
So i has really i0 essentially different values , and j has j0 essentially different values .
So we end up with at most i0 * j0 different values for x and y.
Since i0 <= n and j0 <= n we see that i0 = j0 =n , otherwise not all squares will get filled .
This also means gcd(n , p ' , q ' ) = gcd(n , u' , v' ) = 1 .
It 's also interesting to see that i and j are symmetrical , so at least for filling up the matrix it does n't matter if you exchange the normal displacement with the exceptional displacement ( we do n't say anything yet about if that gives a magic square or not ) .
So we have for both i and j basically n different values [ 0 .. n - 1 ] .
And each of these n2 combinations gives a certain ( x , y ) coordinate where we fill in j*n+i+1 .
We also found a necessary condition for the ( x , y ) coordinates to be all different , but do n't know yet if the condition is sufficient .
A necessary and sufficient condition will in fact be if for every ( x , y ) we can find a ( i , j ) mapping to it .
So let 's try to invert the basic formula : i*u '* q '+ j* p'* q ' = x * q ' - a '* q ' ( mod n ) i* v '* p '+ j* q '* p ' = y*p '- b'* p ' ( mod n ) ------------------------------------
i*( u'* q '- v'* p ') = ( x - a ' ) * q '-(y - b ' ) * p ' ( mod n ) and simularly : j *( u '* q ' - v '* p ' ) = ( y - b ' ) * u'-( x - a ' ) * v' ( mod n )
This is obviously solvable if gcd ( u ' * q ' - v'* p ' , n ) = 1 . ( we will prove this by accident later when we are considering sequences ) .
Let 's denote the inverse element with 1 /( u '* q ' - v'* p ' ) , so we get : i = ( ( x - a ' ) * q ' -(y - b ' ) * p ' ) /( u'* q ' - v'* p ' ) %n j = ( ( y - b ' ) * u ' -( x - a ' ) * v' ) /( u'* q ' - v'* p ' ) %n or , after introducing new names for constants : u = q ' /( u '* q ' - v'* p ' ) ( mod n ) v = - v ' /( u '* q ' - v'* p ' ) ( mod n ) p = - p ' /( u'* q ' - v'* p ' ) ( mod n ) q = u' / ( u '* q ' - v'* p ' ) ( mod n ) a = ( b ' * p ' - a ' * q ' ) / ( u'* q ' - v'* p ' ) ( mod n ) b = ( a ' * v ' - b ' * u ' ) / ( u'* q ' - v'* p ' ) ( mod n ) we get : i = ( x*u+y* p+a ) % n j = ( x* v+y*q + b ) % n
This is in fact of exactly the same form as we started from , so viewing magic squares in the ( i , j ) space and the ( x , y ) space seems to be some kind of dual .
What if gcd ( u '* q ' - v'* p ' , n ) = g != 1 ? Then i*g *(( u '* q ' - v '* p ' ) / g ) = ( x - a ' ) * q ' -( y - b ' ) * p ' ( mod n ) for every x and y .
So if we take x=( a '+1 ) % n and y=b ' , we see that q ' must be a multiple of g , and in the same way so must p ' .
So we are in the case gcd(n , p ' , q ' ) != 1 , and we know that the mapping wo n't be complete .
So gcd ( u '* q ' - v'* p ' , n ) = 1 is in fact necessary and sufficient for the inversion to work .
And since the new formula is exactly like the original , we also see that gcd ( u * q - v*p , n ) is also necessary and sufficient for the inversion back to work .
And if the inversion works in one direction , it also works in the other direction .
Let 's quickly go back to the question if the conditions gcd(n , u' , v' ) = 1 gcd(n , p ' , q ' ) = 1 are sufficient .
Consider ( u ' , v' ) = ( 2 , 5 ) , ( p ' , q ' ) = ( 7 , 11 ) and n = 39 .
In that case u' * q ' - v'* p ' = - 13 = 26 ( mod 39 ) , which is not relatively prime to 39 .
We know this is not invertable , so indeed the condition can't in fact be sufficient .
And indeed if you consider ( we ignore any offsets here , it 's easy enough to do the same if they are there ) : x = 2 *i + 7 *j ( mod 39 ) y = 5 * i +11 *j ( mod 39 ) Multiplying the second by 7 and subtracting the first times 11 gives : 7*y - 11 *x = 13*j ( mod 39 )
So we see that the real reason is that the equations are not independent , and so not all ( x , y ) combinations are allowed .
For example when x is 0 , y must be 0 , 13 or 26 .
Example inversions
Let 's go back to the original example : x = i - j + ( n - 1 ) /2 ( mod n ) y = - i+2 * j ( mod n ) So ( u ' , v' , p ' , q ' ) = ( 1 , - 1 , - 1 , 2 ) .
The determinant ( the obvious name to give to u' * q ' - v'* p ' ) is in this case det = 2 - 1 = 1 ( so gcd ( det , n ) = 1 for all n ) , whose inverse is obviously also 1 .
So we get ( u , v , p , q ) = ( 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) i = 2 * x + y+1 ( mod n ) j = x+y -( n - 1 ) /2 ( mod n )
For another example we 'll take the pyramid method , which we can write as : x = i+j + ( n+ 1 ) / 2 ( mod n ) y = - i+j + ( n - 1) /2 ( mod n) So ( u ' , v' , p ' , q ' ) = ( 1 , - 1 , 1 , 1 ) .
Therefore det = 1+1 = 2 .
And since we are only considering the cases where n is odd , we also have gcd(n , 2 ) = 1 .
More interesting is in this case the inverse , which is obviosuly ( n+1 ) / 2 since this is the smallest number such that 2 * m = k*n+ 1 for k and m positive integers .
So we get ( u , v , p , q , a , b ) = ( ( n+1 ) / 2 , ( n+1 ) /2 , -( n+1 ) / 2 , ( n+1 ) / 2 , -( n+1 ) / 2 , 0 ) or : i = ( x - y - 1 ) * ( n+1 ) / 2 ( mod n ) j = ( x+y ) *( n+1 ) /2 ( mod n )
This case is particularly interesting since it shows an example of displacements that are not a constant , but multiples of ( n+1 ) / 2 .
And due to the duality this makes us suspect that displacements of this form can also be used in the Siamese method ( this suspicion will turn out to be true .
You can get magic squares like that ) .
Also notice that -( n+1 ) /2 = ( n - 1 ) /2 ( mod n ) , so you can consider them as displacements that are multiples of ( n - 1 ) / 2 in the other direction .
Demanding the square is semi-magic
So now let 's consider : value( x , y ) = i+ j * n where : i = ( x* u+y * p+a ) % n j = ( x* v+y* q+b ) %n and : gcd(u*q - p*v , n ) = 1 Notice that I sneakily subtracted one from the value .
This does n't really matter , since subtracting one from every value in the square makes no difference whatsoever to the magicness or semi-magicness of a square ( though it changes the value of the magic constant obviously ) .
We know that all magic squares generated with the Siamese method are of this form .
What about the other direction ?
Due to the invertability , we know that all values from 1 to n2 will appear in the generated square .
But obviously it 's not always magic , for example : i = x%n j = y%n Leads to this very obviously non-magic square : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
Clearly we must demand that the sum of the rows and columns gives the magic constant .
Let 's first determine this magic constant .
The total sum of all elements in the square is obviously the mean value times the number of elements , so TotalSum = n 2 *( n2 - 1) /2 .
There are n rows , each of which sum to the magic constant S , and all of which sum to the TotalSum , so S = TotalSum / n = n*( n2 - 1)/2 = n*( n - 1 ) *( n+1 ) /2 = n * [ n *( n - 1)/2 + ( n - 1)/2 ]
Next let 's get rid of that ( a , b ) offset .
Since we know every ( i , j ) pair is realised , let 's consider ( x , y ) = ( x 0 , y 0 ) for which ( i , j ) = ( 0 , 0 ) , so 0 = x 0 * u+y 0 * p+a ( mod n ) 0 = x 0 * v+y 0 * q+b ( mod n ) which we subtract from the basic formula to get : i = ( x - x 0 ) * u + ( y-y 0 ) *p ( mod n ) j = ( x - x 0 ) * v + ( y-y 0 ) *q ( mod n )
This basically corresponds to taking off the top x 0 rows of the square and reattaching them to the bottom , and removing the left y 0 rows and attaching them to the right .
This obviously does not change either the row or column sums ( though it does change the diagonals ) .
So since we are only going to demand semi-magicness in this section , it 's enough to study : value( x , y ) = i+ j * n where : i = x*u+y* p ( mod n ) j = x* v+y*q ( mod n ) and : gcd(u*q - p*v , n ) = 1 Let 's fix y = 0 , and let x run over [ 0 .. n - 1 ] . then obviously the consecutive values of i and j are : i 0 u%n 2*u % n .... ( n - 1 ) * u % n j 0 v%n 2*v % n .... ( n - 1)*v%n
If we denote the sum over n multiples of u with sum( u , n ) , we get as condition for the total rowsum : S = n * ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) + ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) = n * sum( v , n ) + sum( u , n ) So we are led to study the sum of sequences of the form : 0 u%n 2*u% n .... ( n - 1) *u %n
The key question to ask here is if any of these values ( after the first one ) will be 0 .
Let 's assume that the first multiplier for which this happens is m and that µ=gcd ( u , n ) .
So gcd ( u/µ , n/µ ) = 1 m*µ*( u/µ ) = k * µ * ( n /µ ) m*( u/µ ) = k * ( n /µ)
All factors of n/µ are not in u/µ , so they must appear in m , so m is a multiple of n/µ .
In the same way k must be a multiple of u/µ , so the smallest solution is m = n/µ k = u /µ
So the sequence to sum will look like : gcd( u , n ) = µ U = u /µ N = n/µ gcd( U , N ) = 1 µ times ( 0 U*µ%n 2*U*µ%n .. ( N - 1 ) * U*µ%n )
For example , if n=6 , u=4 then µ = gcd ( 6 , 4 ) = 2 and the sequence is 0 4 2 0 4 2 Which is indeed 2 times 0 2*2%6 2*2*2%6 0 4 2
So now let 's consider one such subsequence .
We can obviously divide out the common factor µ to get the sequence : 0 U%N 2*U%N ....
( N - 1 ) * U%N
Which in the example indeed corresponds to 0 2 1 where each element then has to be multiplied by µ =2 .
We also know that no other 0 except the first one will appear .
And we know that each other value in the sequence will only appear once ( otherwise walk back from the first one with a given value to 0 .
Walk equally many steps back from the second one .
This must also be 0 .
But there is only one 0 , so the positions must have been the same ) .
So in fact the sequence is a permutation of 0.. N - 1 ( as is again obvious to see in the example ) .
Since it will in fact be a permutation , there will be a 1 in the sequence , so there exists an m such that m*U%N = 1 if and only if gcd ( U , N ) = 1 ( if you go back to the sequence for the case gcd ( u , n ) = µ you can see that the smallest non-zero value that will appear is µ ) .
Which is the condition we still needed to prove for the inversion formula .
At this point we have all we need to work out the general sum .
First the sequence with the factor µ divided out : sum = 0 1 2 .... N - 1 ( writing the sequence forward ) sum = N - 1 N - 2 N - 3 .... 0 ( writing the sequence backward )
---------------------------- 2*sum = N - 1+N -1+N -1 .... N - 1 = N * ( N - 1 ) sum = N*( N - 1)/2
So adding back the µ factor and that we have this sequence µ times gives : sum( u , n ) = µ 2 * N * ( N - 1) /2 = µ 2 * ( n /µ ) * (( n/µ ) - 1)/2 = n * ( n-µ )/2
Notice that this is always less or equal to n*( n - 1 ) / 2 with equality if and only if µ=1 .
Combining this with S = n * ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) + ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) = n * sum( v , n ) + sum( u , n ) shows sum( v , n ) = n * ( n - 1 ) / 2 and sum( u , n ) = n * ( n - 1 ) / 2 which will be the case if and only if gcd( u , n ) = gcd( v , n ) = 1 .
We 've also proven that if gcd ( u , n ) = 1 then x*u%n will assume all values in [ 0 .. n - 1 ] .
So adding a constant value to that before the modulo operation will just be a permutation of these same values .
So if we consider a different row with j !=
0 , the row will still have the same sum .
So all rows will sum to the magic constant .
And applying the same reasoning to j gives that all column sum to the magic constant if and only if gcd ( p , n ) = gcd( q , n ) = 1 .
Notice that at this point we have n't really used yet that n is odd .
So can this method lead to even squares ?
Since u , v , p and q must be relatively prime to n , all of them must be odd .
but then det = u*q - p*v will be even , and cannot be relatively prime to n .
Which is why the Siamese method wo n't work for even sized magic squares
Demanding the square is magic
So now let 's consider : value( x ' , y ' ) = i+ j *n where : i = ( x '*u+y ' * p+a ' ) % n j = ( x ' * v+y ' * q+b ' ) %n and : gcd ( u* q - p*v , n ) = 1 gcd( u , n ) = gcd( v , n ) = gcd( p , n ) = gcd( q , n ) = 1
We know that every magic square generated with the Siamese method is of this form .
What about the other direction ?
Due to the invertability we know that every value will appear in the resulting magic square .
Due to the conditions on u , v , p and q we know that all sums and rows sum to the magic constant .
What remains is to study the diagonals .
The two diagonals meet in the center .
To make the situation more symmetric , we will move the ( x , y ) coordinates so that ( 0 , 0 ) is the center .
So we introduce x = x '- ( n - 1 ) /2 ( mod n ) y = y ' - ( n - 1 ) / 2 ( mod n ) so : i = ( x + ( n - 1)/2)*u+(y +( n - 1)/2) *p+a' = x*u+y*p +( a'+( u+p ) *( n - 1) /2 ) ( mod n ) j = ( x +( n - 1)/2)*v+(y +( n - 1)/2 ) *q+b' = x* v+y*q +( b'+( v+q ) * ( n - 1) /2 ) ( mod n)
So by defining a = a ' + ( u+p ) * ( n - 1) /2 ( mod n ) b = b' + ( v+q ) * ( n - 1)/2 ( mod n) We get the familiar : value( x , y ) = i+ j * n where : i = ( x* u+y * p+a ) % n j = ( x * v+y * q+b ) % n and : gcd ( u* q - p*v , n ) = 1 gcd( u , n ) = gcd( v , n ) = gcd( p , n ) = gcd( q , n ) = 1
So let 's run x and y from - ( n - 1 ) / 2 to ( n - 1 ) / 2 .
We get the following sequences i : [ -(n - 1)/2*( u+p ) + a ] %n , [ ( 1 -( n - 1 ) /2 ) *( u+p ) +a ] % n .... a%n .... [ ((n - 1)/2-1 ) *( u+p ) +a ] %n [ ( n - 1)/2*( u+p ) +a ] %n j : [-(n-1)/2*( v+q ) +b ] %n , [ (1-(n - 1 ) /2 ) *( v+q ) +b ] %n .... b% n .... [ ((n-1)/2-1)*( v+q ) + b ] %n [ ( n-1)/2*(v+q ) +b ] %n
Let 's denote the sum of the i sequence as sum ( u+p , a , n ) , then we get for this diagonal : S = n * ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) + ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) = n * sum ( v+q , b , n ) + sum ( u+p , a , n ) For the other diagonal we let x run from - ( n - 1 ) / 2 to ( n - 1 ) / 2 while y runs from ( n - 1 ) / 2 to -( n - 1 ) / 2 .
This gives : i : [ -( n - 1) /2*( u - p ) +a ] %n , [ ( 1 - ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) * ( u - p ) +a ] % n .... a%n .... [ ( ( n - 1) /2-1 ) *( u - p ) +a ] %n [ ( n - 1)/2*( u - p ) +a ] %n j : [ -(n - 1)/2*( v-q ) +b ] %n , [ ( 1 -( n - 1 ) /2 ) *( v-q ) + b ] %n .... b% n .... [ ((n - 1)/2-1 ) *( v-q ) + b ] %n [ ( n - 1)/2*( v-q ) +b ] %n so S = n * ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) + ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) = n * sum( v-q , b , n ) + sum ( u- p , a , n) So this time we study a sequence of the form ( -( n - 1) /2*u+a ) %n , ( ( 1 - ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) * u+a ) %n , ... ( - u+a ) %n , a%n , ( u+a ) %n , ... ( ((n-1)/2-1)*u+a ) %n , ((n -1)/2*u+a ) % n
It will be interesting to see if the value a%n is repeated in this sequence .
so let 's again call gcd( u , n ) = µ .
We will get a%n again if ( m* u+a ) = a ( mod n ) , so if m*u = 0 ( mod n ) which happens for the first time for m = n/µ = N as we showed higher .
This time we will use that n is odd , so all factors are odd , so m is odd and we can write it as m = 2 * k+1 .
So we can write the repeated sequence as ( - k* u+a ) %n , ( ( 1 - k ) * u+a ) %n , .... ( - u+a ) %n , a%n , ( u+a ) %n , ... ( ( k - 1 ) * u+a ) %n , ( k*u+a ) % n which will appear µ times .
Since we want to try to get rid of a factor µ again , let 's write a as a=å * µ+ A with 0 <= A < µ , so the sequence is ( - k*U*µ + å*µ+ A ) %n , ( ( 1 - k ) * U*µ+å*µ+A ) %n , .... ( - U*µ+å*µ+A ) %n , å*µ + A %n , ( U *µ + å*µ+ A ) %n , ... ( ( k - 1 ) * U*µ+å*µ+A ) %n , ( k* U *µ + å*µ+A ) %n
This sequence consists of multiples of µ ( which divides n ) plus A where 0 <= A < µ .
So in fact A will never cause this multiple of µ to go over a multiple of n , so we can move it outside the modulo operation .
So we get µ times the sequence : (- k*U *µ + å*µ ) %n+A , ( ( 1 - k ) * U*µ+å*µ) %n+A , .... ( - U*µ+å*µ) %n+A , å*µ%n+A , ( U *µ +å*µ ) %n+A , ... ( ( k - 1 ) * U*µ+å*µ) %n+A , ( k* U*µ+å*µ) %n+A
So if we remove n times A from the elements of the sequence , we get ( - k* U * µ + å *µ ) %n , ( ( 1 - k ) * U*µ+å*µ ) %n , .... ( - U*µ+å*µ ) %n , å*µ %n , ( U * µ + å*µ ) %n , ... ( ( k - 1 ) * U*µ+å*µ ) %n , ( k*U *µ + å*µ ) %n
Which is of the form we already handled , and equals sum( u , n ) ( the å additions again only cause an extra permutation , but do not change the sum ) .
So sum( u , a , n ) = sum( u , n ) + n * A = n*(n-µ)/2+n*A = n*( n+2*A-µ)/2
So the demand that : S = n * ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) + ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) = n * sum ( v+q , b , n ) + sum ( u+p , a , n ) leads us to consider : n * ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) + ( n * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) = n * ( n*( n+2*B-ð) /2 ) + n*( n+2*A-µ)/2 n * ( 2*B-ð+1 ) + ( 2* A -µ+1 ) = 0 Let 's consider 2 * A - µ+1 .
The possible values of A are in [ 0 ..µ - 1 ] , so the possible values of this run in [ - ( µ - 1 ) ..µ - 1 ] and µ <= n .
So this value can never compensate for a multiple of n .
Therefore : 2*A-µ+1 = 0 2*B-ð+1 = 0 or , if we consider it our job to determine a and b once u , v , p and q are known : A = ( µ - 1)/2 B = ( ð - 1) /2
Each diagonal will lead to a condition of this kind .
They must of course be compatible .
Let 's recap what we worked out in the previous section : µ = gcd ( u+p , n ) A = a %µ ð = gcd ( v+q , n ) B = b%ð 2 * A = µ - 1 2*B = ð - 1 µ' = gcd ( u-p , n) A ' = a % µ' ð' = gcd ( v-q , n) B ' = b%ð '
2 * A ' = µ' - 1 2* B' = ð'- 1
So the compatibility conditions become : a = s * µ + A = s' * µ' + A' b = t * ð + B = t' * ð' + B ' with s , s ' , t and 't integers s * µ + A = s' * µ' + A' s * µ + ( µ - 1)/2 = s' * µ' + ( µ ' - 1)/2 ( 2*s+1 ) * µ = ( 2*s '+ 1 ) *µ'
So we must find out more about gcd(µ , µ') = g .
Since g | µ and g | µ' and since µ | n , we see that g | n ( | is a notation for " divides " ) .
Also g | u+p and g | u-p , so summing these we see g | 2*u .
Since we know n is odd , we get µ is odd and therefore g is odd , so g | u .
but that means that g | gcd(n , u ) .
But gcd( u , n ) = 1 , so g = 1 .
So each factor of µ' must appear in 2 * s+1 , and each factor of µ must appear in 2 * s ' +1 , so : 2*s '+1 = ( 2*k+1 ) * µ 2*s+1 = ( 2*k+1 ) * µ'
With k an integer ( we know the factor is odd because 2 *s ' + 1 is odd ) .
So : a = s * µ + ( µ - 1)/2 = ( ( 2*s+1 ) * µ- 1)/2 = ( ( 2*k+1 ) *µ*µ'- 1)/2 = k*µ*µ'+(µ*µ'- 1)/2
Formulating a in terms of µ' leads to the same formula , so we found the necessary and sufficient condition for compatibility of a .
And in the same way we find : b = ( ( 2*l+1 ) * ð*ð'- 1)/2 = l*ð*ð'+(ð*ð'- 1) /2
And translating back to ( x , y ) we see : a' = ( ( 2*k+1 ) *µ*µ'-1)/2-(u+p ) *( n - 1)/2 = k'*µ*µ'+( 1-u-p )*(µ*µ'- 1)/2 b' = ( ( 2*l+1 ) *ð*ð'-1)/2-(v+q ) *( n - 1)/2 = l'*ð*ð'+(1-v-q ) *(ð*ð'- 1)/2
In the last step I used that µ | n , µ' | n , and gcd(µ , µ') = 1 , so µ*µ ' | n .
And since all of these must be odd , we can write n = ( 2* M+1 ) *µ*µ' , and in a simular way that n = ( 2* E+1 ) *ð*ð' .
Substituting this and some rearrangement and renaming of the arbitrary constant then gives the result .
Main formula
So the final conclusion is that we get a magic square generated with the Siamese method if and only if : value( x , y ) = i+ j * n where : i = ( x*u+y*p+k*µ*µ'+( 1- u -p ) *(µ*µ' - 1) /2 ) %n j = ( x* v+y*q+l*ð*ð'+ ( 1 - v-q ) *( ð*ð' - 1) /2 ) %n and : gcd ( u* q - p*v , n ) = gcd( u , n ) = gcd( v , n ) = gcd( p , n ) = gcd( q , n ) = 1 µ = gcd ( u+p , n ) µ' = gcd ( u- p , n ) ð = gcd ( v+q , n ) ð' = gcd ( v-q , n ) and k and l are arbitrary integers .
We can also write i and j as : i = ( ( 2*x -n+1 ) * u+( 2*y - n+1 ) * p+( 2*k'+1 )*µ*µ'- 1)/2%n j = ( ( 2*x-n+1 ) * v+( 2*y- n+1 ) * q +( 2*l'+1 )*ð*ð'- 1)/2%n
Example formulas
Let 's first consider the original example again .
( u , v , p , q ) = ( 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) µ = gcd ( 3 , n ) µ' = gcd ( 1 , n ) = 1 ð = gcd ( 2 , n ) = 1 ð' = gcd( 0 , n ) = n
So we must distinguish two cases : gcd(n , 3 ) = 1 i = ( 2*x+y+k ' ) %n j = ( x +y - ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) %n gcd(n , 3 ) = 3 or n = 3 *( 2* m+1 ) i = ( 2*x + y +3*k'+1 ) %n j = ( x+y - ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) %n
And if we want a formula that handles both cases , we get : i = ( 2*x + y +3* k'+1 ) %n j = ( x+y - ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) %n
In the previous case it was very interesting that the i formula had an almost arbitrary offset .
It was in a way caused by µ and µ' being small constants .
Let 's try to get that effect on both i and j : ( u , v , p , q ) = ( 2 , 2 , 1 , - 1 ) det = u*q - v*p = - 2 - 2 = - 4 , which is prime relative to all odd numbers , so the square will be magic .
µ = gcd ( 3 , n ) µ' = gcd ( 1 , n ) = 1 ð = gcd ( 1 , n ) = 1 ð' = gcd ( 3 , n ) Again we must distinguish two cases : gcd(n , 3 ) = 1 i = ( 2*x+y+k ' ) %n j = ( 2 * x - y+l ' ) % n gcd(n , 3 ) = 3 or n = ( 2m+1 ) * 3 i = ( 2*x +y +3*k'+1 ) %n j = ( 2*x -y+3*l ' ) % n
And if we want a formula that handles both cases , we get : i = ( 2*x + y +3*k'+1 ) %n j = ( 2*x -y+3*l ' ) % n
If we for example take k'=1 and l'=0 , and add 1 to all values again , we get for n=5 the following magic square : 5 12 24 6 18 21 8 20 2 14 17 4 11 23 10 13 25 7 19 1 9 16 3 15 22
It 's interesting to note that the average value , 13 , does not appear in the center .
Demanding the square is associative
So what if we decided to move the 13 to the center ?
We can take two columns from the right side and reattach them at the left , and take one row from the top and attach it to the bottom .
This sort of operation would obviously not impact the semi-magicness of the square , but it might disturb the diagonals , so the result might not be a magic square .
In the example under consideration 2 would move to the top left , and this fact of course completely determines this " translation " .
In general , we can decide to move the number at ( x 0 , y 0 ) to ( 0 , 0 ) so we go from the original i = x * u +y * p+a ( mod n ) j = x * v+y * q+b ( mod n ) x ' = x -x 0 ( mod n ) y' = y-y 0 ( mod n ) to i = ( x '+x 0 ) *u +( y'+y 0 ) * p+a = x'*u+y'* p +( a+x 0 *u+y 0 * p ) = x'*u+y'* p+a' ( mod n ) j = ( x '+x 0 ) * v + ( y '-y 0 ) *q+b = x'* v+y'*q +( b+x 0 *v+y 0 * q ) = x'* v+y '* q+b ' ( mod n ) a ' = a+x 0 * u+y 0 *p ( mod n ) b' = b+x 0 * v+y 0 *q ( mod n ) ( I used the ( mod n ) notation here instead of %n to stress that this works whether we are considering the range [ 0 .. n - 1 ] or [ - ( n - 1 ) / 2..( n - 1 ) /2 ] or any other such range ) .
So every translation leaves the multipliers for x and y unchanged , but just changes the offsets .
And since there are n2 different values we can move to ( 0 , 0 ) ( each of which must give different offsets since the value on ( 0 , 0 ) is different ) , and n*n essentially different values for the offsets , each change in offsets also corresponds to a translation ( notice how this reasoning fails if the multipliers are not linear independent since not all ( 0 , 0 ) results would be distinguishable ) .
So if we choose the average value in the center and use a coordinate system with ( 0 , 0 ) in the middle , it 's obvious that for ( 0 , 0 ) we must have i = j = ( n - 1 ) / 2 , so : i = ( x* u+y* p + k *n+ ( n - 1 ) /2 ) %n j = ( x*v+y*q+l*n + ( n - 1 ) /2 ) %n
( I left in the k and l to stress the complete set of solutions .
In practise they of course have no influence and you just drop them ) .
If you now consider two points in positions symmetric with respect to the center , their x and y coordinates have opposite sign , so equally much gets added or subtracted from ( n - 1 ) / 2 .
And since 0 an n - 1 are equally far from ( n - 1 ) / 2 , if the modulo wraps - 1 or lower up , the other position is at n or higher and gets wrapped down equally much .
So the sum of the values at symmetric positions is constant , and in fact twice the average ( and now central ) value , ( n - 1)/2*n+ ( n - 1)/2 = ( n - 1)/2*( n+1 ) = ( n2 -1) /2
In fact , a square is called " associative " if all positions symmetric to the center sum to n2+1 ( this definition is for squares that start counting at 1 ) .
So that is n2 - 1 for 0 - based squares , so moving the average value to the center makes a semi-magic siamese square associative .
And since the whole square is on average filled with the average value and all pairs ( except the center ) sum to twice the average value , every associative semi-magic square must have the average value in the center , so the two conditions are equivalent for siamese squares .
Using that n = ( 2* M+1 ) *µ*µ' and n = ( 2* E+1 ) *ð*ð' gives for the offsets : a = ( ( 2*k+1 ) ( 2*M+1 ) *µ*µ'- 1)/2 b = ( ( 2*l+1 ) ( 2*E+1 ) *ð*ð'- 1) / 2 which is compatible with the condition for the diagonals to sum to the magic constant , so every associative semi-magic Siamese square is magic .
So moving the average value to the center in the example in fact did n't destroy the magicness .
On the contrary , it 's a way you can make any semi-magic Siamese square magic .
Translating back to zero - based coordinates for ( x , y ) gives : i = ( x * u +y * p + ( 1 - u - p ) * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) %n j = ( x * v+y*q + ( 1 - v- q ) * ( n - 1 ) /2 ) %n
Going back to our standard example ( u , v , p , q ) = ( 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) gives : i = ( 2*x+ y + 1 ) % n j = ( x +y - ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) % n which is the exact formula we found for the example inversions .
So the classic construction gives associative magic squares .
The other example we recently looked at was ( u , v , p , q ) = ( 2 , 2 , 1 , - 1 ) .
This gives : i = ( 2*x + y +1 ) %n j = ( 2*x-y ) % n
Notice how choosing u+p and v+q to be odd tends to get rid of the ugly offsets .
Demanding the square is panmagic
When all the diagonals , including those obtained by " wrapping around " the edges , of a magic square sum to the same magic constant , the square is said to be a panmagic square .
In this example from MathWorld you see at the left the normal magic square condition and to the right the conditions for all wrapped diagonals ( in both directions ) :
If you go back to the sequences we studied when demanding a square is magic , it 's easy to see that e.g. moving z times one down from the main diagonal corresponds to adding z*p to the i entries and z*q to the j entries .
Each of these must give a component of the magic constant ( We only demanded that all diagonals sum to the same value , but since in this way we cover all positions , this value must be the magic constant .
And the diagonal compatibility condition will also be fullfilled ) .
So : n * ( n - 1 ) / 2 = sum ( u+p , a+z* p , n ) = sum ( u+p , n ) + ( a+z * p ) % µ * n n * ( n - 1 ) /2 = sum ( v+q , a+z*q , n ) = sum ( v+q , n ) + ( a+z*q ) % ð * n ( moving the diagonals to the right instead of down would correspond to adding z*u and z*v and will of course lead to the same conclusions , since in the end they represent the same diagonals ) .
Since each of these must give the same result irrespective of z , it follows that ( a+z * p ) % µ is constant .
Considering z=0 and z=1 we see that µ | p , and assuming this is also enough to to make ( a+z * p ) % µ constant .
But we also have µ | u+p , so µ | u .
And since µ | n , we also see that µ | gcd( u , p ) , so µ=1 .
Doing the same for the others , we see that the necessary and sufficient condition for a semi-magic square to be panmagic is : µ = µ' = ð = ð' = 1 So a Siamese square is panmagic if and only if : value( x , y ) = i+ j *n where : i = ( x* u+y * p+k ) % n j = ( x * v+y * q+l ) %n and : gcd ( u* q - p*v , n ) = 1 gcd( u , n ) = gcd( v , n ) = gcd ( p , n ) = gcd( q , n ) = 1 gcd ( u+p , n ) = gcd ( u- p , n ) = gcd ( v+q , n ) = gcd ( v-q , n ) = 1 and k and l are arbitrary integers .
We can easily make the square associative too by choosing k and l so that they are of the form we determined higher .
Looking again at the examples , we see that ( u , v , p , q ) = ( 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) implies ð' = n , so the classic construction never gives a panmagic square ( except n=1 ) .
Considering ( u , v , p , q ) = ( 2 , 2 , 1 , - 1 ) we see that we need gcd ( 3 , n ) = 1 as necessary and sufficient condition .
So the squares generated by i = ( 2*x+y+k ) %n j = ( 2 * x - y+l ) %n are panmagic if n is not a multiple of 3 , so of the form n = 6 * m ±1
What happens in the previous example is pretty typical .
Siamese squares that are a multiple of 3 never seem to be panmagic .
Why ?
u+p , u-p , u and p may obviously not be multiples of 3 , otherwise their gcd with n is at least 3 , so u = ± 1 ( mod 3 ) and p = ± 1 ( mod 3 ) which means that either the sum or the difference must be 0 ( mod 3 ) , so either u+p = 0 ( mod 3 ) or u -p = 0 ( mod 3 ) , which is not allowed .
So the Siamese method never generates panmagic squares whose size is a multiple of 3 .
And in fact no panmagic squares of size 3 exist at all , Siamese or not .
The show may not go ahead if participants are not found
A terminally ill patient is being sought to donate their body to be mummified for a Channel 4 TV show .
The programme will explore the mysteries of ancient Egyptian embalming , which was believed would help people reach the afterlife .
Adverts have been placed asking for dying patients interested in participating to get in touch .
Channel 4 said : " If the scientists are able to find a donor , we would be willing to follow the process . "
It is understood the project - which has been proposed by production company Fulcrum TV - is in its very early stages and may not actually be made .
The idea was uncovered when an executive producer from Fulcrum TV , Richard Belfield , spoke to an undercover journalist posing as a possible volunteer .
He was quoted as saying it had been suggested - although it was not obligatory - that the body be placed in a museum exhibition to enable people to understand the mummification process .
It is not the first time Channel 4 has tackled the subject of death and the human body .
In 2002 , the first public autopsy in the UK for 170 years was broadcast on the channel .
Bobby Southworth gained infamy in the TUF season 1 house as part of the duo ( along with Josh Koscheck ) who sent Chris Leben into a drunken rage , smashing a window and breaking down a bedroom door along the way .
Southworth failed to make a major impact in the competition though , losing out to eventual finalist Stephan Bonner by split decision in his second fight .
He returned for the season finale , but came out on the wrong side of a decision to Sam Hoger .
Afterwards Southworth found a new home – Strikeforce .
He was then involved in one of the most bizarre fights in MMA history when he and his opponent James Irvin fell out of the unlocked cage door just moments into the fight .
Better days were ahead though as he claimed the vacant Strikeforce light - heavyweight title against Vernon
White in his next fight .
He would notch up a further three wins , including one successful title defense , in the next two years before losing his belt to Renato Sobral in December of 2008 .
He has n’t fought since .
10 seasons after first appearing on The Ultimate Fighter , Southworth turned up at the tryouts for the 11th season of the show in October of 2009 .
It ’s since been confirmed the show will only feature middleweights , ruling out the chance of him returning .
Now 40 , Southworth ( 9 - 6 ) remains without a fight deal , but is still hoping to return to the cage in the future .
Meanwhile he teaches BJJ at the American Kickboxing Academy gym in California .

Alterations to the new - for - 2010 Formula 1 points system are still possible , with the topic set to be discussed at a forthcoming Formula 1 Commission meeting .
In December last year the FIA 's World Motor Sport Council approved an F1 Commission proposal that the top ten finishers in each race should score under a 25- 20 - 15 - 10- 8-6-5-3 - 2 - 1 distribution to reflect the fact that the grid was growing from 20 to 26 cars in 2010 .
But Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali confirmed at the Wrooom ski meeting today that this may yet be adjusted , amid suggestions of a minor tweak to give a greater percentage separation between the first and second place scores .
" There 's going to be a meeting in the next couple of weeks to reconsider some items of the regulations , among which is the scoring system , " he said .
" In the agenda we do not only have the fact that we have to re-seed the scoring system , but also there may be other issues that may be important , linked to the use of tyres , linked to the number of pitstops .
This is going to be defined by the end of January .
" There 's going to be a meeting of the Formula 1 Commission , I think it 's going to be 1 February .
Then we have to give some time to our fans , the media and all those involved , to understand what these changes are going to be .
This issue is not stable yet .
To date I cannot anticipate anything because we still have to discuss it . "
He does not expect any major changes to the Q1 / Q2 / Q3 qualifying format , but hinted at small adjustments to make the system work with the 2010 race format , under which mid-race refuelling is removed .
" [ Qualifying ] should remain the same as a system , " said Domenicali .
" Clearly the cars will do qualifying without a fuel load .
The discussion is about the tyres which can be used and if the tyres used in Q3 have to be used at the start of the race . "
He believes that all parties involved in F1 also need to finalise a long - term strategy for the championship during the early part of this year .
" 2013 is very close .
We 're going to have new challenges then , " Domenicali said .
" From a technical point of view we 're going to have to review the car concept with a view also of the new environmental needs and the new technologies that have to be implemented not only in the automotive world but in the sports world .
" We 're going to have to renegotiate the commercial agreement .
We have many issues that we have to tackle , so in the coming weeks we 're going to have to put down an agenda in FOTA with our priorities . "
Domenicali suggested that a relaxation of the new strict testing restrictions should also be discussed in the near future .
" I think we have gone too much under the limit , " he said .
" For example with Michael [ Schumacher ] - that he has to use GP2 shows that clearly we have to make some changes .
" We believe we have to reconsider this again , with a goal of cutting down costs of course .
But there is also safety for young drivers and the need of having to work on the race track .
If we limit the costs on one hand we increase the costs in other areas .
One of the activities the FOTA teams have to tackle is how to increase the number of tests , I think it is necessary to do so . "
He also thinks that the issue of teams running third cars could be revisited if some of the new squads joining F1 in 2010 run into trouble .
" We 're going to have to understand how these teams are going to be , if they 're going to follow up on their programme , " Domenicali said .
" We 've seen many meteorites in the past , and we need stars that stick in the sky .
" As for the third car , we have always been in favour of this possibility , and I think this follows up on the interest of our fans who want to see big teams with big names .
" We think this could be discussed again should things go differently , should there be a situation in which some teams may not be as sturdy as they have presented themselves .
From this point of view , we 've always said that a third car could be a possibility for allowing Formula 1 to grow . "
I teach courses on child psychology , and every textbook has a chapter on IQ .
It ’s always a bit touchy talking about it — I ’ve got to be on my best behavior .
I discuss the data showing genetic influences and then I point out that most of the “ environmental influences ” on IQ could equally well be explained by parent - child genetic correlations :
Smart parents are genetically inclined to high IQ and they talk to their kids more .
This results in correlations between IQ and parents talking to their kids .
But the chapter always ends on an optimistic note for the environmentalists because of the Head Start data .
The standard line is that Head Start has a positive effect on IQ for a while and then tapers off to nothing after a few years .
But the good news for environmentalists is that there are lots of other great things Head Start does , like improve academic achievement , prevent school dropout , etc .
However , the recent report on Head Start shows that there are no positive effects at all on academic achievement , social and emotional functioning , or health , even in the first grade .
These are overwhelmingly poor non-White children — the future of America
As the Brookings Institute ’s Russ Whitehurst notes ,
The children in Head Start are overwhelmingly poor and minority .
They are at high risk of starting school far behind their more advantaged peers , and falling further behind over time .
They tune - out and drop - out at alarming rates .
In a world in which nearly everything we value , from a long lifespan to financial wealth to family stability , is associated with educational attainment , these children ’s lives are in danger .
So the ever hopeful left is back to square one .
No positive effects at all .
Indeed , things seem to have gotten worse : “ In the critical area of vocabulary ( a good measure of IQ ) , 3 - year - olds entered the study at the 29th percentile in terms of national norms and finished first grade at the 24th percentile whether or not they attended Head Start . ”
They might as well have stayed home with grandma .
But because the ever hopeful educational establishment did n’t want the word to get out , they delayed the report for three years .
During this time they sweated the data ( as we psychologists say ) to try to come up with some positive results .
Not possible .
And believe me , they were motivated .
There are lots of private contractors and an entire bureaucracy to feed .
They pulled out all the stops .
Actually , it ’s quite surprising that they could n’t come up with something positive , since , as Whitehurst points out , the same federal agencies that administer the programs are in charge of evaluating them .
Short of making up the data , they could n’t come up with what they wanted .
It ’s something of a miracle that they did n’t falsify the data .
All for a good cause , you know .
But , as Whitehurst notes , when the report was finally released there was absolute silence in the MSM .
The New York Times did not think it was news fit to print , nor did the Washington Post .
I am still waiting for an article to appear in the LA Times .
Reports like this are just not the sort of thing that the left wants to hear , because it does not augur well for the future of the impending multicultural paradise we are heading into .
I wonder if the next edition of my textbook will even bother to note it .

The video is n't as much of a slam dunk on the lag factor .
At some points it looks like there 's a definite delay between the dancer 's movements and those of his avatar on screen , and at other times the lag seems imperceptible .
It 's hard to say for sure .
But as for the motion capture itself , even in low light situations , it appears to be undeniably smooth .

Introduction
The founding fathers of our country sought to establish a nation where men would be free to worship as they chose .
Government was to protect man ’s freedom to worship , not to infringe upon it .
We now have come full circle .
Today our government seems intent upon prohibiting religious groups such as the Gideons from distributing copies of the Bible to our school children , yet evolutionism and humanism are freely propagated and promoted in the classroom .
In schools Bible reading and prayer is prohibited by government , yet it provides our children with birth control pills and pays for their abortions , while denying the parents of these children even the knowledge that such “ services ” are being furnished .
Government now seems more inclined to prosecute religion than to protect it .
Such evils , while frustrating to Christians in our day , are not unique to 20th century America .
The author of Psalm 94157 also lived in a time when his government was engaged in the promotion of evil and the persecution of the righteous .
The wicked arrogantly furthered their own interests at the expense of those who were defenseless : the widows , the aliens , and the orphans ( v. 6 ) .
Government had formed an evil alliance with these oppressors .
Indeed , wickedness was even legislated ( v. 20 ) .
The unjust of the psalmist ’s day not only prospered , they seemed to prevail .
The evil - doers were not forced to clandestine meetings and dark alleys ; they congregated in the Congress and in the White House of the land .
The evils against which the psalmist protested were those which had been practiced over a considerable time ( cf. v. 3 ) .
Apparently things had deteriorated to the point that the righteous were unable to reverse the trend .
Protest no longer could be expected to change matters ; at best it would be ignored and at worst it would result in scorn and persecution ( cf. vv. 17,21 ) .
In spite of this , the psalmist boldly addressed God , the wicked , and the righteous .
His words are as relevant to us today as they were to the people of his own day .
Let us look carefully at this psalm for a word from God to those who dwell in a sinful society .
The Psalmist Speaks to God About Sinners
( 94:1 -7 )
1 O LORD , God of vengeance ; God of vengeance , shine forth !
2
Rise up , O Judge of the earth ; Render recompense to the proud .
3
How long shall the wicked , O LORD , How long shall the wicked exult ?
4
They pour forth words , they speak arrogantly ;
All who do wickedness vaunt themselves .
5
They crush
Thy people , O LORD , And afflict Thy heritage .
6
They slay the widow and the stranger , And murder the orphans .
7
And they have said , “ The LORD does not see , Nor does the God of Jacob pay heed . ” ( NASB )
The psalmist first addresses God regarding the wicked .
The first seven verses of the psalm are addressed to God , petitioning Him to act to avenge the oppressed and punish the wicked .
Verses 1 - 3 plead with God to judge the wicked because it is His responsibility to do so .
The psalmist describes the evil deeds ( vv. 4 - 6 ) and the feeble defense ( v. 7 ) of the wicked , which are worthy of God ’s wrath .
Verses 1 - 7 strongly imply that the psalmist believed God alone was able to correct the evils of his day .
From a human perspective , the righteous have not been able to successfully resist the plots of the wicked , who now have the authority of the government behind them , or who , worse yet , are the government ( vv. 20 , 21 ) .
The twice used expression “ how long ” ( v. 3 ) indicates that the conditions against which the psalmist protests were of some duration .
God alone can handle this matter because men have not been successful in restraining evildoers .
Far more importantly , the psalmist calls upon God to act because it is His responsibility to do so .
God is the “ Judge of the earth ” ( v. 2 ) , an expression found first in Genesis 18:25 , and later in the Psalms ( 58:11 ; 82:8 ) .
In addition , God is called the “ God of vengeance ” twice in verse 1 .
Retribution is God ’s responsibility : ‘ Vengeance is Mine , and retribution ’ ( Deut. 32:35 ) .
The expression “ God of vengeance ” may not accurately convey the psalmist ’s meaning .
As it stands thus translated we might conclude that God is vengeful .
158 While wrath towards sin is one dimension of God ’s character , it is not the sum total of His character .
The King James Version seems to have caught the force of the psalmist ’s words better by its rendering : “… God to whom vengeance belongeth . ”
By this we are informed that vengeance does belong to God and not to man .
If there is to be retribution , let God perform it , for it is His responsibility .
The psalmist understood this and therefore appealed to God to appear , to “ shine forth , ” manifesting Himself in power and glory and bringing justice to the earth ( cf. Ps. 50:2 ; 80:1,19 ) .
Vengeance is set forth as God ’s responsibility in verses 1 - 3 .
In verses 4 - 7 the psalmist seeks to prove that vengeance is deserved by describing the deeds of the wicked .
The evildoers were said to exult ( v. 3 ) .
The Berkeley Version renders the wicked as “ jubilant . ”
The idea seems to be that the wicked prevail , and they triumphantly rejoice .
The wicked arrogantly flaunt their success ( cf. v. 4 ) .
The wicked also oppress and persecute men .
They prey upon those for whom God has a special concern .
The oppressed are God ’s people , His heritage ( v. 5 ) .
The victims of these cruel men are the helpless among God ’s people : the widow , the orphan , and the sojourner ( v. 6 ) .
The wicked have dared to touch the apple of God ’s eye ( cf. Exod .
22:21 -24 ; Deut 32:10 ; Ps. 17:18 ) .
The psalmist is convinced that the oppression of the weak among God ’s people is sufficient basis for God to appear and punish the evildoers .
The most distressing fact of all is that the wicked oppressors have gone so far as to impugn God ’s character in order to excuse their evil deeds .
They have attributed their prolonged success as sinners to God ’s ignorance or indifference .
“ God does not see , ” they claim , “ and if He does , He must not care ” ( v. 7 ) .
Little wonder , then , that the psalmist appeals to God to act not only to defend His people , but also to vindicate His reputation .
Who are these wicked ones with whom the psalmist petitions God to deal ?
Are they the pagan unbelievers of other nations or are they the wicked unbelievers within Israel ?
I am inclined with others159 toward the view that the wicked described here are Israelites .
In Psalm 50 the wicked are identified as God ’s people ( cf. vv. 4 , 16 - 21 ) .
Many other Old Testament passages describe similar sins as the deeds of Israelites ( cf. Isa .
1:23 ; Jer. 22:3 ; Ezek .
22:6-7 ; Amos 5:10 - 13 ; Zech. 7:8-12 ) .
In Psalm 94 the wicked speak of Yahweh as “ the God of Jacob ” ( v. 7 ) , and they are called the “ senseless among the people ” ( v. 8 ) .
The arguments of verses 9 - 11 are more forceful to Israelites , not to pagans .
Most likely , then , the wicked are the evildoers within the nation Israel .
The Psalmist Speaks to Sinners About God
( 94:8-11 )
8 Pay heed , you senseless among the people ;
And when will you understand , stupid ones ?
9
He who planted the ear , does He not hear ?
He who formed the eye , does He not see ?
10 He who chastens the nations , will He not rebuke , Even He who teaches man knowledge ?
11 The LORD knows the thoughts of man , That they are a mere breath .
( NASB )
In verses 1 - 7 the psalmist spoke to God about sinners .
Now in verses 8 - 11 he turns and speaks to sinners about God .
The psalmist attacks the wicked at their most vulnerable point .
It seems that the cruel oppressors knew they were doing wrong , but justified themselves by passing part of the blame to God .
“ Sure , ” they seem to have said , “ We ’re sinning , but why has n’t God done anything about it ? ” “ God either does not know or He does n’t care . ”
“ If God is n’t concerned about our sin , why should we worry about it ? ”
Bluntly , the psalmist calls the logic of the wicked “ stupid ” and “ senseless ” ( v. 8 ) .
These same terms are employed in Psalm 92:6 to describe the wicked .
“ Senseless ” emphasizes the brutish , beastly nature of those who reason in such a way .
“ Stupid ” stresses the moral depravity of such men .
The use of these words should have shocked those who were thus addressed .
Two lines of argumentation are employed by the psalmist to show just how stupid the reasoning of the wicked is .
Verse 9 argues on the basis of men ’s belief in God as the Creator .
How can the God who gives men ears to hear not be capable of hearing Himself ?
How is it possible that the God who gives men eyes to see is unable to see their sinful deeds ?
To think that God does not see or hear their evil deeds is to ignore the fact that God is the One who enables men to see and hear .
How can God not possess those abilities which He gives to men ?
Verse 10 is based upon Israel ’s belief in God as the One who chastens the nations .
Israel had witnessed God ’s chastening hand on the Egyptians at the exodus .
The Israelites expected God to chasten the nations , especially if they oppressed God ’s people ( cf. Num. 21:21 -25 ) .
God drove out the Canaanites because of their sinful deeds and gave their land to the Israelites ( Deut . ( 9:4- 5 ) .
God also warned
His people that He would discipline them , just as He had the Canaanites ( Deut. 8:19 - 20 ) .
Therefore , the psalmist reasons , if God does chasten the nations , how can the wicked think He will not rebuke His own people ?
If I as a parent will trouble myself to correct a neighbor child for doing wrong , will I not much more certainly correct my own child when he sins ?
Surely then God not only knows what the wicked are doing , but He can be expected to act in discipline .
The wicked have given their appraisal of God in verse 7 : He neither knows nor cares what they do .
Now , in response to such foolishness , God gives
His opinion of man ’s reasoning : “ Lord knows the thoughts of man , that they are a mere breath ” ( v. 11 ) .
Such are the sinful thoughts of man .
They are mere breath .
Man ’s foolish reasoning is only worthy of God ’s disdain and ridicule .
Why would the psalmist trouble himself to respond to the wicked as he has done in verses 8 - 11 ?
One possible reason is that he can hardly allow such stupid reasoning to pass without comment .
The godly are obliged to show the folly of the excuses offered by sinful men .
There may well be another more gracious reason for verses 8 - 11 .
Is it not possible that while the psalmist is appealing to God to come and pronounce judgment upon the wicked he is also appealing to the wicked to reconsider their sinful ways and repent ?
The argument of verses 8 - 11 certainly challenges the sinner to face up to the folly of his way , just as wisdom warns the foolish in the Book of Proverbs ( cf. Prov. 1:20 - 33 ) .
The Psalmist Speaks to the Righteous About God
( 94:12 - 15 )
12 Blessed is the man whom
Thou dost chasten , O LORD , And dost teach out of Thy law ; 13 That Thou mayest grant him relief from the days of adversity , Until a pit is dug for the wicked .
14 For the LORD will not abandon His people , Nor will He forsake His inheritance .
15 For judgment will again be righteous ;
And all the upright in heart will follow it .
( NASB )
We should remember that in the psalmist ’s day the wicked were not just prospering ; they were prevailing .
They were not only getting away with evil , they were governing , promoting evil from the highest offices of the land ( v. 20 ) .
The wicked were oppressing the weak and persecuting the righteous ( cf. v. 21 ) .
While the wicked needed a word of correction , the righteous needed a word of comfort .
How could God allow them to be mistreated for such a long period of time ?
Why was God allowing them to suffer , and when would relief come ?
Verses 12 - 15 address the righteous providing some answers to these questions .
The terms “ chasten ” and “ teach ” found in verse 10 are employed in verse 12 but with a different meaning .
While God chastens and teaches the nations in His wrath , He lovingly chastens
His own people as His sons ( Deut .
8:1-5 ; Prov. 3:12 ; Heb. 12:6 ) .
The inference of our text is that God accomplishes this chastening by employing the oppression of the wicked to instruct the godly .
Other passages reveal that suffering is instrumental in the process of learning God ’s law :
So I shall have an answer for him who reproaches me , for I trust in Thy word ( Ps. 119:42 ) .
Before I was afflicted I went astray , but now I keep Thy word ( Ps. 119:67 ) .
It is good for me that I was afflicted , that I may learn
Thy statutes ( Ps. 119:71 ) .
I know , O Lord , that Thy judgments are righteous , and that in faithfulness
Thou has afflicted me ( Ps. 119:75 ) .
Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers , a cruel and wicked act , yet he was later able to comfort his brothers with these words : “ Do not be afraid , for am I in God ’s place ?
And as for you , you meant it for evil against me , but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result , to preserve many people alive ” ( Gen. 50:19 b-20 ) .
Just as God allowed Joseph ’s brothers to sin against him , for a good end unknown to them , so God also allows the wicked to promote
His good purposes in the lives of His people .
While not identical in thought , we read in Psalm 76:10 : “ For the wrath of man shall praise Thee . ”
God chastens us ( by means of wicked men ) in order to teach us His law .
One of the ways God ’s law benefits us is by giving us “ relief ” in times of adversity : “ Blessed is the man160 whom Thou dost chasten , O Lord , and dost teach out of Thy law ; that Thou mayest grant him relief161 from the days of adversity , until a pit is dug for the wicked ( vv. 12-13 ) .
There is a sequence of events suggested in verses 12 and 13 .
God allows the wicked to prosper , which results in the chastening of the righteous .
This chastening is a vital part of the teaching process , for in the midst of adversity we become much more attentive to God ’s law .
Learning
God ’s law gives the righteous “ relief ” or inner peace ( cf. Ruth 3:18 ; Isa. 7:4 ; 30:15 ; 32:17 ) in the midst of adversity .
Not only does
God ’s law enable us to find rest of soul in the days of adversity , it also assures us that in time to come ( when a pit is dug for the wicked , v. 13 ) the wicked will receive their just “ reward . ”
In this way the righteous find God faithful both to give peace in adversity and ultimately to give deliverance from adversity .
God ’s grace is sufficient to enable us to endure adversity as well as to escape it .
The adversity we endure is the wrath of men .
The adversity we escape , however , is the wrath of God on sinful men .
Better to endure the former and to escape the latter .
There is a television commercial in which a mechanic says , “ See me now or see me later . ”
The inference is that we will either pay for maintenance or for repairs , but sooner or later we will pay .
There is a sense in which this is true of suffering .
All men are required to suffer sooner or later .
The righteous are privileged to suffer now so that they will not suffer later .
The wicked may prosper now , but ultimately they will suffer the wrath of God for their sin .
The point of the Book of Hebrews seems to be to encourage the saints to accept present suffering for righteousness ’ sake so as to experience God ’s eternal blessings .
Moses is cited as one of the Old Testament examples of those who were willing to suffer now in order to experience blessing in the future :
By faith Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’s daughter ; choosing rather to endure ill - treatment with the people of God , than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin ; considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he was looking to the reward .
By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing Him who is unseen ( Heb. 11:24 -27 ) .
Likewise , the apostle Paul considered present suffering a small thing in light of the eternal blessings of God : “ For momentary , light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison ” ( 2 Cor. 4:17 ) .
Suffering the wrath of wicked men for a time , the psalmist teaches , is really a blessed privilege ( v. 12 ) .
God teaches us His law , which produces blessed inner peace .
It promises us ultimate deliverance , contrary to the wicked who prosper momentarily but perish ultimately .
Verses 14 and 15 both begin with an explanatory “ for . ”
The man whom God chastens is truly blessed ( v. 12 ) , for the righteous can be absolutely confident of the promises of verses 12 and 13 .
The promises state that we will be able both to endure present adversity and to escape God ’s judgment on the wicked .
Notably we can find consolation and assurance in the fact that God will never abandon
His people , nor will He forsake His inheritance 162 ( v. 14 ) .
Those who are being oppressed by the wicked are God ’s own possession , His people ( cf. v. 5 ) .
In a very special way the righteous Israelite belongs to God .
God would never consider forsaking those with whom He has entered into such an intimate relationship .
God ’s nature is such that we can be assured of a day when righteousness will reign and when all the righteous will joyfully follow in the way of the upright ( v. 15 ) .
The Psalmist Speaks to Himself About God
( 94:16 - 23 )
16 Who will stand up for me against evildoers ?
Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness ?
17 If the LORD had not been my help , My soul would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence .
18 If I should say , “ My foot has slipped , ” Thy lovingkindness , O LORD , will hold me up .
19
When my anxious thoughts multiply within me , Thy consolations delight my soul .
20 Can a throne of destruction be allied with Thee , One which devises mischief by decree ?
21 They band themselves together against the life of the righteous , And condemn the innocent to death .
22
But the LORD has been my stronghold , And my God the rock of my refuge .
23 And He has brought back their wickedness upon them , And will destroy them in their evil ; The LORD our God will destroy them .
( NASB )
I have chosen to depart from the paragraph divisions of the NASB here for two reasons .
First , the Hebrew text indicates that verse 16 begins the next section rather than concluding verses 12 - 15 .
Secondly , verse 16 seems to fit best into the context of the final section .
Verses 12 - 15 speak of God ’s relationship to the righteous , “ His people ” ( v. 14 ) .
Verses 16 - 23 focus upon
God ’s faithfulness to the psalmist personally and individually .
Notice the continual reference in verses 17 - 23 to “ me ” and “ my . ”
Likewise , verse 16 is written from the perspective of the psalmist , not from the more general viewpoint of the righteous : “ Who will stand up for me ? ”
In this last section then the psalmist speaks to himself , reminding himself of God ’s faithfulness in the past and assuring himself of God ’s trustworthiness in the future .
Verse 16 fittingly introduces the conclusion to this psalm : “ Who will stand up for me against evildoers ?
Who will take his stand for me against those who do wickedness ? ”
Initially , I thought the psalmist was inviting others who were righteous to join him in resisting evildoers .
I now understand him to be saying , “ No one but God is able to stand up for me . ”
The psalmist was right to take this matter to God in verses 1 - 7 , for only God can and will deal with the wicked .
The matter is simply too great for anyone else .
163
The psalmist asks , somewhat rhetorically , “ Who will stand up for me ?
Who will take a stand for me against the wicked ? ”
The two expressions “ stand up ” and “ take a stand ” both refer to a powerful , purposeful defense and even beyond this , an attack launched against the wicked .
When God “ stands ” it will signal that He is no longer going to tolerate sin .
He will take action against the wicked ( cf. Num .
10:35 ; Isa. 28:21 ; 33:10 ) .
My children know that it takes a great deal to get me out of my easy chair to act in discipline , but once I stand it is the beginning of the end .
The psalmist is suggesting that when God stands up , look out !
When one “ takes a stand ” he is ready and able to “ stand fast ” and to hold his position ( cf. Deut .
7:24 ; 9:2 ; 11:25 ; Josh . 1:5 ) .
Also , to “ take a stand ” is to prepare for battle , to get ready to wage an attack ( cf. 1 Sam .
17:16 ; Ps. 2:2 ; Jer. 46:4 ) .
God alone can and will “ arise ” and “ take a stand ” against the wicked .
Rather than to criticize others who have not come to his defense , the psalmist confesses that he , too , is unable to stand apart from divine enablement : “ If the Lord had not been my help , my soul would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence .
If I should say , ‘ My foot has slipped , ’ Thy lovingkindness , O Lord , will hold me up ” ( vv. 17-18 ) .
The “ abode of silence ” ( v. 17 ) is a poetic reference to death .
The Old Testament saint viewed death as a state of silence in which the believer was no longer able to praise God ( Ps. 115:17 ) .
Here in Psalm 94:17 the psalmist speaks of death as a state of dwelling in silence .
Had God not come to his rescue , the psalmist confesses , he would have been put to death long ago by his enemies .
A similar poetic allusion to the imminent danger of death is found in verse 18 , where he speaks of his foot nearly slipping .
As elsewhere ( cf. Deut .
32:35 ; Ps. 38:16 ; 73:2 ) , losing one ’s footing is equivalent to perishing .
Even if the psalmist thought his destruction was inevitable , God would be there to uphold him .
More often than not the possibility of our destruction is more a figment of our imagination than a fact rooted in reality .
Living in days of danger tends to make us fearful of whether our anxieties are well founded .
God ’s faithfulness not only delivers us from real danger , His consolations deliver us from dread and anxiety ( v. 19 ) .
164 God is more than a mighty warrior , who stations Himself before us in times of battle .
He is also a mighty counselor , who comforts us in times of mental distress .
Such consolation comes from two major sources : ( 1 ) the promises of God ’s Word ( the law , v. 12 ) ; and ( 2 ) the protection
He has personally provided for us in times past ( v. 17 ) .
In verses 20 - 23 the psalmist ponders these things so as to find comfort in a time when evil men seem to prevail .
Verses 20 and 21 provide consolation to the psalmist as he contemplates the character of God in contrast to the conduct of the wicked : “ Can a throne of destruction be allied with Thee , one which devises mischief by decree ?
They band themselves together against the life of the righteous , and condemn the innocent to death . ”
The wicked thus described are not a small minority within the nation .
Indeed , they seem to be those who are in control of the government .
They devise mischief “ by decree ” ; that is , they actually pass laws which permit them to sin , or worse yet , which promote sin .
The power of government is no longer employed to punish evil - doers , but to promote wickedness .
God ’s delay might be interpreted as some kind of approval of the administration of the wicked , almost an alliance .
Certainly that is what the wicked suggested ( cf. v. 7 ) .
But as the psalmist considers both the wickedness of these evil men and the goodness of God , he concludes that God cannot and will not form any kind of alliance with evildoers .
Because they legislate sin and they mobilize government to oppress the righteous , God must ultimately deal with them in judgment .
Verses 22 and 23 summarize the confidence which the psalmist has in God , which gives him peace in times of peril and assures him that he has been right in leaving the fate of the wicked with God : “ But the Lord has been my stronghold , and my God the rock of my refuge .
And He has brought back their wickedness upon them , and will destroy them in their evil ; the Lord our God will destroy them . ”
The freedom with which the Hebrew language allows the poet to utilize the past tense leaves some room for differences in interpretation and translation here , 165 but the force of the argument is unaffected by these differences .
God has been faithful in the past and has proven Himself to be the stronghold and the refuge of the psalmist ( v. 22 ) .
On the basis of this confidence , he can leave the destiny of the wicked to God , knowing that their ultimate destruction is certain no matter how long the delay ( v. 23 ) .
Conclusion
The most impressive feature of this psalm is its breadth and its balance concerning the attitudes and actions of the righteous in response to the wicked .
The psalmist recognizes that revenge is not our responsibility , but God’s .
Repaying men for their evil deeds is God ’s responsibility .
We may appeal to Him to act , knowing that He is the “ Judge of the earth ” ( v. 2 ) , that He is fully aware of men ’s deeds , and that He is concerned with the welfare of His people and the upholding of His reputation .
Committing the destiny ( or the destruction ) of the wicked to God is not only the right thing to do , it relieves the righteous of feelings of bitterness and hostility which are self - destructive .
Committing the fate of wicked men to God does not mean that we are to be entirely passive concerning evil .
Verses 8 - 11 instruct us that we should speak out against evil and that we should seek to show the wicked the folly of their thoughts and deeds .
I personally believe that leaving the punishment of the wicked in God ’s hands also frees the righteous to appeal to the wicked to repent of their evil and to turn to God in faith .
Evangelism is promoted by the righteous , who commit vengeance to God .
Committing the wicked to God ’s care also clears the air in our understanding of His purpose for our lives in the midst of the prosperity of the wicked .
Verses 12 - 15 instruct us that the psalmist had a good grasp of God ’s present purposes for the righteous .
Sinful men are still under the controlling hand of the sovereign God , who uses them to accomplish His purposes in the lives of His people .
In affliction , the righteous learn God ’s law in a personal and practical way .
God gives peace to endure affliction and He gives deliverance from
His wrath to escape future adversity when the wicked are punished .
The psalmist has a proper perspective so that he encourages the righteous to persevere in times of suffering .
Finally , the psalmist is able to apply what he knows about God ’s plan for the wicked and the righteous to his own life .
God ’s character and His purposes , as revealed in His Word , assure the saint that God will continue to care for His own , just as He has done in the past .
The righteous can turn to no one else .
God alone is our refuge and our strength .
Let us seek to think and to act as the psalmist has , especially in times such as ours when the wicked not only prosper , but prevail and persecute the righteous .
Let us commit their destiny and their destruction to God .
Let us commit ourselves to His keeping and His purposes .
Let us draw strength from His Word and from His faithfulness in our lives .
Furthermore , let us warn the wicked of the folly of their ways , seeking to turn them to God while there is yet time .
God ’s delay in dealing with the wicked is not only to accomplish
His purposes in our lives ( vv. 12-15 ) and to dig a pit for their destruction ( v. 13 ) , but also to give them time to repent ( 2 Pet. 3:9 ) .
157 It should be noted that the Septuagint , the Greek translation of the Old Testament , does attribute this psalm to David , calling it “ A Psalm of David , for the fourth day of the week , ” but most scholars are inclined to question the accuracy of this superscription since it is not found in the Hebrew text .
158 God is a “ God of vengeance , ” cf. Ps. 9:12 ; Isa .
35:4 ; Jer. 51:56 ; Nah. 1:2 . Nevertheless , we should not think of this dimension of His character as unworthy of Him .
Leupold warns , “ … this expression is not the outgrowth of an unworthy conception of God but rather an appeal to a function that He will from time to time exercise .… there are times when it must be exercised , and when such times come , the issue rests safely in the hands of Him who knows how to administer this difficult function . ”
H. C. Leupold , Exposition of Psalms ( Grand Rapids : Baker Book House [ reprint ] , 1969 ) , p. 668 .
159 “ The miscreants involved do not appear to be heathen oppressors who have been afflicting a victimized people , but rather men from within Israel as many writers are now beginning to maintain in conformity especially with v. 8 , as also in his day Luther strongly insisted :
‘ In my opinion this psalm does not lament about the heathen but about the kings , princes , priests , and prophets and calls them fools among the people . ’ ”
Leupold , p. 668 .
160 Interestingly , the Hebrew word rendered “ man ” here is not the usual term , but rather the term geber , which conveys the nuance of strength .
The geber is a strong man ( cf. Ps. 34:8 ; 40:4 ; 127:5 ; 128:4 ) .
The man who is made strong is the one who has been oppressed by the wicked but has been made strong by the Word of God .
161 Kidner writes , “ Respite is hardly the meaning here ; in any case the Hebrew word tends to be used of inward quietness in face of outward troubles ( e.g. Is. 7:4 , ‘ be quiet and do not fear ’ ; cf. Is. 30:15 ) . ” Derek Kidner , Psalms 73 - 150 ( Downers Grove : InterVarsity Press , 1975 ) , p. 342 .
Perowne agrees : “ In this sense the ‘ rest ’ is the rest of a calm , self - possessed spirit , as Is. vii.4 , xxx.15 , xxxii:17 , lvii.20 , and ‘ to give him . ’ = ‘ that Thou mayest give him . ’
Others interpret the ‘ rest ’ of external rest , deliverance from sufferings ( comp. Job iii.13 , 17 ) ; then ‘ to give ’ would be = ‘ so as to give , ’ etc. ” J. J. Stewart Perowne , The Book of Psalms ( Grand Rapids : Zondervan [ reprint ] , 1976 ) , II , p. 188 .
162 The term “ inheritance ” is frequently used in the Old Testament for the land of Canaan which God has promised to give His people as an inheritance .
But the same term is also used of Israel as God ’s “ inheritance , ” stressing God ’s vested interest in His people , Israel ( cf. Deut .
4:20 ; 9:26,29 ; 1 Kings 8:51 ; Ps. 28:9 ; 33:12 ; 74:2 ; 106:5,40 ; Isa. 19:25 ; 47:6 ; Jer. 12:7-9 ; Mic. 7:14 ) .
Here in Psalm 94:5 , 14 it is intended to emphasize God ’s great concern for His people , which inclines Him to act on their behalf .
163 Kirkpatrick comments ,
“ It is not a question of doubt or unbelief , but an emphatic form of assertion that Israel has no helper but Jehovah . ”
A. F. Kirkpatrick , The Book of Psalms ( Grand Rapids : Baker Book House [ reprint ] , 1982 ) , p. 570 .
164 The “ anxious thoughts ” of which the psalmist speaks are literally “ divided or branching thoughts ” ( Perowne , II , p. 188 ) .
Kirkpatrick ( p. 570 ) calls them , “… distracting thought which divide and perplex the mind . ”
This seems to be consistent with the faithless doubts of which James speaks ( James 1:5 - 8 ) ; cf. also Ps. 139:23 and Job 4:13 .
165 “ The preterites here express , not so much what has already taken place , as the confidence of faith which looks upon that which shall be as if already accomplished . ”
Perowne , II , p. 189 .
Is n't this lovely ?
From Benen :
QUOTE OF THE DAY ....
In Massachusetts this morning , Scott Brown campaigned in West Springfield , where the conservative Senate hopeful complained about the tone of the campaign .
" I 'll tell you what , " Brown said , using a megaphone to address the crowd .
" There 's negative campaigning , and then there 's malicious campaigning . "
" She 's malicious ! " a man in the crowd cried out .
" She 's a phony ! " shouted another .
" Shove a curling iron up her butt ! " a third man interjected a few moments later .
Yes , because it 's not ironic at all to complain about " malicious " campaigning while your supporters call for assaulting the state Attorney General with a curling iron .

In the video it sounds like Brown responds " We could do that " but it 's hard to make out his exact words .
Maybe someone with better ears than I have can tell .
What a guy .
Update :
Here 's another clip of the same event from another angle .
You can't hear the person yelling very well , but you can see Brown 's response to it .
As one commenter said , it does appear he says " We can do this " and it does appear he pauses and smiles after the man yells out the curling iron comment .
Video- Brown smiles at ' curling iron ' jibe .

From McJoan at DK :
The Obama administration has already sent a sternly - worded letter to Anthem Blue Cross over the company 's excessive rate increase for individual policy holders in California .
How excessive ?
Up to 39 percent .
But that 's not all .
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield also informed their customers that they are changing their practice of adjusting rates annually , and as of now are reserving the right to raise premiums basically whenever they feel like it .
You got that ?
They want to do exactly what the credit card companies were doing .
There 's little beyond sternly - worded letters that the administration can do , other than something like maybe advocating strongly for some kind of legislative remedy , say in the form of serious competition to private insurers in the form of a robust public option for health insurance .
But there 's something Congress can do , and that 's put the insurers on the hot seat and investigate .
From the Speaker 's blog , The Gavel :
As Secretary Sebelius pointed out , WellPoint [ parent company to Anthem Blue Cross / Blue Shield ] reported a staggering $ 2,740,000,000 in profits for the fourth quarter of 2009 alone – eight times more than the last quarter of 2008 – and more than $ 4,750,000,000 for all of 2009 .
In fact , the company reaped these record profits even as it lost more than 1.4 million members .....
Today , Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman and Subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak announced that the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will hold a hearing on February 24th regarding the premium rate increases .
The hearing , conveniently , will be held on February 24 , the day before the bipartisan White House healthcare summit .
Almost all lawyers offer the same fee arrangements and almost all lawyers claim expertise in accident recovery or personal injury .
You need to know an attorney ’s reputation for honesty , dependability , successful representation , ability to predict the likely outcome , and promptness in returning your calls .
Your best source for such referrals is to ask friends , family , your doctor , people employed in the legal system , or acquaintances who have used an attorney .

Cluster Monitoring with Ganglia & Ruby
A good monitoring solution can make or break an entire service - a well implemented one will enable you to forecast and plan ahead , as well as , quickly spot and debug problems when they arise .
However , anyone that has worked with a cluster of machines will know that this is also a non-trivial problem .
There are a number of options , both open - source and commercial , and they span a variety of use cases : alerting and notification ( Nagios ) , intrusion detection ( SNORT ) , performance monitoring ( Ganglia , Cacti , Scout , etc ) , or even customized systems such as MySQL Monitor for in - depth database analysis .
Chances are , you will have to run a mix of all of the above to cover all the cases ( ex : WikiMedia ’s Nagios & Ganglia ) since there is no all - in - one solution and each has its tradeoffs .
On that note , for performance monitoring , Ganglia is definitely an option to explore ( it seems that I tried everything but Ganglia first , and I wish I did so much earlier ) .
Originally developed at University of California , it is an open - source project designed from the ground up to be a distributed monitoring system for high - performance system such as clusters and grids - let ’s see what that means .
Ganglia ’s Distributed Architecture
Ganglia is powered by three independent components : gmond , gmetad and a PHP frontend .
Due to how the system is architected , all three could either run on the same host , or more likely , be distributed between a number of different nodes .
Gmond is the workhorse responsible for gathering user specified stats and sharing them over the network : a gmond daemon runs on every monitored node .
It is designed to be fast , portable , with low memory footprint , and comes with a number of native monitoring modules ( disk , memory , network , etc ) .
Importantly , the gmond daemon never actually persists any data ( memory only ) to optimize for speed .
But that ’s not all , because it can also receive data from other gmond ’s , allowing us to build arbitrary hierarchies of nodes - this is how and why Ganglia is capable of scaling to thousands of nodes .
Unlike other monitoring solutions such as Nagios or Cacti , all of the Ganglia metrics rely on data push - there is absolutely no polling involved .
The gmond daemons are all responsible for periodically gathering and distributing their stats upstream .
However , the gmond ’s do not persist data , and that is where the gmetad daemon comes in .
This daemon is responsible for collecting data from an arbitrary number of gmond ’s , or even other gmetad daemons , persisting the metrics into correct RRD ( round robin database ) files , and then making this data available to the PHP frontend ( or any other service that consumes RRD’s ) .
Distributed Monitoring & Custom Metrics
Wikimedia ’s Ganglia setup is a good example to dissect : it consists of two “ clusters ” ( Florida and Kennisnet ) , each most likely running their own gmetad node , which is then monitored by a central gmetad node which stitches them together .
Each cluster , in turn , has its own hierarchy of gmond nodes : squids , apaches , databases , and so on .
All together , it is monitoring over 350 nodes without breaking a sweat - not bad .
Alas , one gotcha to be aware of upfront : run your gmetad ’s off a ram - disk to avoid the IO bottleneck associated with updating hundreds of RRD’s .
With default configuration the gmond daemon will automatically monitor over 20 core metrics : load , network in and out , disk , memory and so on .
However , it is also easily extensible via several mechanisms : custom monitoring modules , or straight up gmetric command line client .
As of version 3.1.0 , Ganglia now offers a simple Python API which allows us to create custom metrics modules which will be integrated directly into the gmond process .
Hence the gmond process will call the code , gather the metrics and then distribute the data for us .
A great working example is Gilad Raphaelli ’s MySQL extension , which gathers over 50 metrics about your database , and creating your own is also pretty straightforward .
However , if writing a python script is too heavy weight , Ganglia also provides the ‘ gmetric ’ executable which you can call right from the command line .
Give the metric a name , type and a value , and you are off to the races .
In other words , you can use bash , Ruby , or anything that will execute from the command line , in combination with gmetric , to funnel data into Ganglia :
# submit " variable_name " which is a string , with value of " hello " , remove this var after 600s $ gmetric -n variable_name -t string -v " hello " -d 600 # submit " int_var " , which is an 8 - bit int , with value of 20 , remove this var after 60s $ gmetric -n int_var -t uint8 -v 20 -d 60
Connecting Ganglia With Ruby
One of the key advantages of Ganglia over Cacti or similar services is that there is no per variable data source setup .
Once a metric is pushed to a gmetad node , it automatically gets its own RRD file , and appears on your dashboard - no configuration required , just bring up a new service , push the data and you ’re rocking !
Now , if you want to monitor a Ruby process , you have a couple of alternatives : write a python module , or shell out to gmetric .
Neither is optimal because while the first method requires more ( Python ) code and extra polling , the system exec option can also be prohibitively expensive in terms of performance .
Thankfully , Ganglia uses a simple UDP protocol with XDR data formatting which means that with a little reverse - engineering , we can talk to our gmond process directly from Ruby ( by pretending that it is gmetric generating the packets ) :
require ' gmetric ' # generate metric from Ruby and send it over UDP Ganglia :: GMetric . send ( " 127.0.0.1 " , 8670 , { : name => ' pageviews ' , :units => ' req / min ' , : type => ' uint16 ' , # unsigned 8 - bit int :value => 7000 , # value of metric : tmax =>
60 , # maximum time in seconds between gmetric calls : dmax => 300 # lifetime in seconds of this metric })
gmetric - GMetric Ruby Library
Install the gmetric gem , specify the hostname and port number of your gmond daemon and fire off your metrics via UDP directly into the monitoring system .
This way , you can track latency , request rates , throughput , or any other application metric directly from Ruby and push it into Ganglia without any performance penalties .
Finally , once you have pushed a dozen new metrics , you can then also generate your own cumulative reports , which aggregate data from multiple sources ( key database metrics , etc ) .
Ganglia is an incredibly flexible platform , and the 3.1.x release has done a lot to improve the ability to customize and extend it to fit your applications .
If you have n’t already , definitely a tool to look into for your cloud applications .
Le secrétaire d'Etat français à la justice Jean - Marie Bockel a visité mardi 12 janvier deux établissements dits " prisons sans barreaux " dans les environs de Vienne dans l'idée de développer ce système de vie carcérale alternatif en France .
Il était accompagné de l'expert Paul - Roger Gontard qu'il a chargé d'une mission d'évaluation de ce type de modèle carcéral en Europe .
Une étude sur ce type d'établissements ouverts est attendue pour février .
Le premier des deux établissements autrichiens visités près de Vienne , celui de Muenchendorf , existe depuis 1974 et permet aux détenus , soigneusement sélectionnés , de travailler la journée dans l'agriculture ( culture céréalière et élevage bovin et porcin ) avant de regagner un centre fermé le soir .
Le second établissement à Simmering permet aux condamnés de choisir entre six formations professionnelles dans l'artisanat ( maçon , peintre , menuisier ou cuisinier , entre autres ) couronnées d'un diplôme en vue de faciliter leur réinsertion dans la société .
Rappelant qu'au Danemark , en Belgique et Suède notamment , le taux d'incarcération dans ces " prisons sans barreaux " a déjà atteint 10 % , M. Bockel a souligné que ses efforts entraient dans le cadre de la réforme pénitentiaire lancée fin 2008 .
" Je connais mon pays et je ne dirai pas qu'il faut un gosplan sur dix ans mais si on réfléchit déjà dans chaque établissement comment développer des nouveaux concepts , ce serait déjà pas mal " , a - t - il ajouté .
Seul un établissement de ce type existe en France .
Il a été ouvert à Casabianda en Corse il y a près de soixante ans .

At least 50 people have been killed in storms that have lashed parts of Spain , Portugal and France , officials say .
Forty - five of the victims died in France , where many drowned or were hit by parts of buildings or falling trees .
Winds of up to 140 km /h ( 87 mph ) caused chaos as they moved from Portugal up through the Bay of Biscay .
The storm system is moving north - eastwards and areas of France bordering Belgium and Germany are on alert for heavy rain and high winds .
Power cuts Worst affected have been the Vendee and Charente - Maritime regions on the western coast of France .
In pictures : Storm batters Europe ' The worst storm I 've encountered '
Huge waves and strong gusts battered many coastal towns , spreading floods inland and destroying buildings .
Residents took to their roofs in the Vendee region and police helicopters were in action attempting to locate and rescue them .
At least a dozen people are said to be missing in France and 59 others injured .
President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his condolences to relatives of victims , and said that he would visit the stricken area on Monday .
The French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said France would formally declare the storm a natural disaster , freeing up funds to help communities rebuild .
He said that the priority now would be to make all the homeless people and those still threatened by rising waters safe .
He added that flood prevention defences would be strengthened .
" The government will , along with the local authorities , set up without delay a special plan to rebuild and strengthen the dykes , " he said .
The storm system , named Xynthia , has put five of the 95 French departments on red alert - only the second such warning since a new emergency system was introduced in 2001 .
More than a million homes in France have lost electricity , from the Brittany peninsula in the west to the highlands of the Massif Central in the centre of the country .
According to the AFP news agency , the French national power company EDF said half a million customers were still without power at nightfall on Sunday , and Mr Fillon said it would take several days to restore power everywhere .
Transport hit AFP reported that in Germany , a man was killed and his wife injured when a tree fell on their car in the Black Forest region .
A female jogger in the western town of Bergheim , and a man in Belgium , were also killed by falling trees .
Earlier on Sunday two Spanish men died when a tree crushed their car near Burgos .
A Spanish woman was killed by a falling wall in Galicia , and a Portuguese boy was killed by a tree in Paredes .
Rail services were severely affected in northern Spain and a number of trains in western France were delayed because of flooded tracks .
Air France said 100 of its flights had been cancelled from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris .
Wind speeds hit 175 km /h at the top of the Eiffel Tower , French radio reported .
The French meteorological service said that shortly after 1700 local time ( 1600 GMT ) the storm passed into Germany , Belgium and the Netherlands , and there were reports of high winds in the Swiss Alps .
Spain 's Canary Islands , particularly La Palma , Gran Canaria and Tenerife , were also hit by the storm , although there was no great damage .

Editor 's Note :
This is the fourth in a series of five features on carbon capture and storage , running daily from April 6 to April 10 , 2009 .
The Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators Committee oil field , better known as SACROC , near Snyder , Tex. , has slurped 140 million metric tons of liquid carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) since 1972 — 80 million metric tons of which has stayed trapped in the reservoir .
Pumping all that CO 2 down has meant pumping more oil out .
For 36 years , oil services companies like Denbury Resources and Kinder Morgan have piped carbon dioxide from naturally occurring reservoirs in Colorado to the declining oil fields of the Permian Basin in West Texas .
The U.S. has at least 100 such projects like SACROC and 3,100 miles ( 5,000 kilometers ) of CO 2 pipelines .
All told , companies have injected some 10.8 trillion cubic feet of the greenhouse gas since the 1970s , according to petroleum engineer R. Tim Bradley , Kinder Morgan 's president of CO 2 , to raise the yield from oil fields by some 650,000 extra barrels a day — more than 10 percent of daily U.S. total production .
Most important with respect to carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota has pumped as much as two million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year to the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan since 2000 .
" The Dakota gasification project is creating synthetic gas and taking the CO 2 from that process , " then pipelining it to the Weyburn oil field , observes carbon storage development coordinator Kurt Waltzer of the Boston–based environmental group the Clean Air Task Force .
" In effect , you have demonstrated all the components of doing a CCS project . "
In all of these projects , the CO 2 basically scours more hydrocarbons out of the oil field .
When injected into the oil reservoir , it mixes with the oil and mobilizes more of it — like turpentine cleaning paint — and then allows it to be pumped to the surface .
Using carbon dioxide to churn out more fossil fuels — and permanently storing some of the CO 2 in the process — might sound counterproductive to limiting climate change because those fuels , when burned , put more CO 2 into the atmosphere .
But it does reduce overall emissions by at least 24 percent , calculates petroleum engineer Ronald Evans , Denbury 's senior vice president of reservoir engineering : every recovered barrel of oil eventually puts 0.42 metric ton of CO2 into the atmosphere , but 0.52 to 0.64 metric ton are injected underground recovering it .
In fact , Kinder Morgan 's Bradley estimates that enhanced oil recovery in the U.S. could reduce CO 2 emissions by 4 percent , if done correctly .
The great fear commonly associated with carbon sequestration is that trapped CO 2 might suddenly escape to the surface with deadly consequences , as happened in 1986 at Lake Nyos in Cameroon .
That volcanic lake had naturally accumulated two million metric tons of carbon dioxide in its cold depths ; one night it spontaneously vented , displacing the oxygenated air , and suffocated more than 1,000 nearby villagers .
Yet in all three decades of commercial use of CO 2 for EOR , there have been no dangerous leaks .
CO 2 from leaks and ruptured injection wells has always dispersed too quickly to pose a threat .
For example , prospectors in Utah drilling for natural gas in 1936 accidentally created a CO 2 geyser .
It still erupts a few times a day as pressure builds but is " so unhazardous that it 's a tourist attraction , not a risk , " says hydrologist Sally Benson , director of the global climate and energy project at Stanford University .
In fact , air concentrations of carbon dioxide have to build up to more than 10 percent to be hazardous , which is difficult to achieve , according to modeling from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) .
The reason is that CO 2 belching from a volcanic lake creates conditions very different from those of the gas escaping from a wellhead or seeping into a basement , explains Julio Friedmann , leader of the carbon management program at LLNL .
At Lake Nyos , an abrupt release of the CO 2 allowed dangerous concentrations to pool in low - lying surrounding areas .
Pressurized gas escaping from a wellhead or crack simply mixes rapidly with the atmosphere , presenting no danger , much as the use of a fire extinguisher is not hazardous .
In situations where atmospheric mixing is minimal , such as for a slow leak into a basement , the problem can be eliminated by simply installing a sensor and a fan , as in apartment buildings today near natural CO 2 seepages in Italy and Hungary .
The greatest risk is from the wellheads themselves leaking : one in 12,000 injection wells leak , according to LLNL .
And , not unlike a vase that is glued back together , a wellhead provides the crack where a new break will most likely form , particularly if CO 2 is injected too fast and too much pressure builds up deep underground .
Most wellheads , though , seem to hold up .
For example , oil wells drilled in 1944 near Cranfield , Miss. , are not reacting to extra pressure from injected CO 2 , according to geologist Susan Hovorka of the University of Texas at Austin , who is running the test .
" I 'd like to congratulate the roughnecks that drilled those wells , " she says , " because they seem to be holding pressure just fine . "
At a demonstration project in Japan , even a magnitude 6.8 earthquake did n't shake injected CO 2 loose from a deep saline aquifer ; the wellheads did not so much as leak .
Big earthquakes might cause leakage , but in many cases , they will not , Friedmann says .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , under the terms of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 , is currently crafting new measures to regulate wells for CO 2 injection — final rules are set to be adopted by 2011 to protect groundwater sources from CO 2 in the subsurface , according to Stephen Heare , director of the EPA 's drinking water protection division .
" There are 800,000 wells out there injecting almost everything imaginable , " Heare says .
" We think the technology is there and we can move ahead safely . "
Nevertheless , " the first CCS project that is done badly is the last CCS project that will be done , " warns Mark Brownstein , New York - based managing director of business partnerships in the climate and air program at the Environmental Defense Fund .
" In this respect , it is very similar to nuclear power . "
SAN FRANCISCO 
If electric cars have any future in the United States , this may be the city where they arrive first .
The San Francisco building code will soon be revised to require that new structures be wired for car chargers .
Across the street from City Hall , some drivers are already plugging converted hybrids into a row of charging stations .
In nearby Silicon Valley , companies are ordering workplace charging stations in the belief that their employees will be first in line when electric cars begin arriving in showrooms .
And at the headquarters of Pacific Gas and Electric , utility executives are preparing “ heat maps ” of neighborhoods that they fear may overload the power grid in their exuberance for electric cars .
“ There is a huge momentum here , ” said Andrew Tang , an executive at P.G.& E .
As automakers prepare to introduce the first mass - market electric cars late this year , it is increasingly evident that the cars will get their most serious tryout in just a handful of places .
In cities like San Francisco , Portland , Ore. , and San Diego , a combination of green consciousness and enthusiasm for new technology seems to be stirring public interest in the cars .
The blurring on the top and bottom of this makes depth perception hella confusing , but otherwise it 's a very nicely colorful photo .
A Mother ’s Love
A Mother ’s love is something
that no on can explain ,
It is made of deep devotion
and of sacrifice and pain ,
It is endless and unselfish
and enduring come what may
For nothing can destroy it
or take that love away . . .
It is patient and forgiving
when all others are forsaking ,
And it never fails or falters
even though the heart is breaking . . .
It believes beyond believing
when the world around condemns ,
And it glows with all the beauty
of the rarest , brightest gems . . .
It is far beyond defining ,
it defies all explanation ,
And it still remains a secret
like the mysteries of creation . . .
A many splendoured miracle
man cannot understand
And another wondrous evidence
of God ’s tender guiding hand .
SEATTLE — A federal appeals court ordered Microsoft Corp. to stop selling its Word program in January and pay a Canadian software company $ 290 million for violating a patent , upholding the judgment of a lower court .
But people looking to buy Word or Microsoft 's Office package in the U.S. wo n't have to go without the software .
Microsoft said Tuesday it expects that new versions of the product , with the computer code in question removed , will be ready for sale when the injunction begins on Jan. 11 .
Toronto - based i4i Inc. sued Microsoft in 2007 , saying it owned the technology behind a tool in the popular word processing program .
The technology in question gives Word users an improved way to edit XML , or code that tells the program how to interpret and display a document 's contents .
A Texas jury found that Microsoft Word willfully infringed on the patent .
Microsoft appealed that decision , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Tuesday upheld the lower court 's damage award and the injunction against future sales of infringing copies of Word .
Michel Vulpe , founder and co-inventor of i4i , said in a statement that the company is pleased with the decision , calling it " an important step in protecting the property rights of small inventors . "
Microsoft said it has been preparing for such a judgment since August .
Copies of Word and Office sold before Jan. 11 are n't affected by the court 's decision .
And Microsoft said it has " put the wheels in motion to remove this little - used feature " from versions of Word 2007 and Office 2007 that would be sold after that date .
" Beta " or test versions of Word 2010 and Office 2010 , expected to be finalized next year , do not contain the offending code , the software maker said .
Redmond , Wash .- based Microsoft said it may appeal further , asking for either a rehearing in front of the appeals court 's full panel of judges or in front of the U.S. Supreme Court .

Judy Battista was in Indianapolis and John Woods was in Manhattan providing live analysis of Saturday ’s game between the Ravens and the Colts .
Scroll down to track the progress of the game , as it happened .
You also can follow Judy on Twitter .
The Colts looked a little like a team that maybe should have been adding to an undefeated record , not that I am trying to start an argument .
They were efficient and aggressive early in the game , chewing up big chunks of clock and converting on two scoring chances late in the second quarter .
Peyton Manning , playing very much like this year ’s M.V.P. , had two touchdown passes , leading the Colts into the AFC championship game with a resounding victory .
The Colts will host the winner of tomorrow ’s game between the Chargers and the Jets .
But as sharp as Manning was , it was the Colts ’ defense that made a bigger difference .
Indianapolis held Baltimore to 87 rushing yards a week after the Ravens gained 234 at New England .
The Ravens could get nothing going through the air , either .
Flacco was 20 of 35 for 183 yards and 2 interceptions .
The Ravens ’ offense spent almost the whole second quarter on the sideline as the Colts , who had a nearly - eight - minute advantage in time of possession , swept to a 17 - 3 lead .
In the end , it was the mistakes the Ravens made — not the plays they did n’t — that cost them .
They were penalized 7 times for 64 yards ( the Colts drew 4 flags for 25 yards ) , and it seemed like every whistle hurt the Ravens .
Their first erased a long kick return .
Nos. 2 and 3 pushed the Colts closer to their first touchdown .
Three penalties helped stall their first two drives of the second half , and the final flag negated a long interception return by Ed Reed .
It was too much to overcome .
Flacco keeps throwing .
But the completion streak ends .
And a streak of incompletions begins .
A few plays later , that ends — with an interception .
All the Colts need to do is take a knee .
This game is over .
Flacco comes out throwing .
Three in a row , probably his only three pass plays in a row all game .
They get 16 yards before the two - minute warning , with the ball at the Colts ’ 27 .
And that has to be the last straw .
The Ravens had something working on offense there .
A lot of energy , some good , crisp gains , but Flacco just missed the mark on that last pass .
The Colts go back to work and pound the rock .
Three consecutive running plays , very little gained , and they line up to punt with 3:17 left .
The Ravens get it back at the Colts ’ 43 .
The Ravens gamely keep at it .
Consecutive first downs brings the Colts ’ midfield helmet into view , and a third first down — a short pass to and 16 - yard run by Ray Rice — sends the Ravens ’ offense into Colts territory .
On a second - and - 10 from the Colts ’ 39 , Flacco tries to stretch the offense again .
He launches a deep pass to inside the 5 , intended for Mason , but it is picked by Antoine Bethea .
Mason was open for a score , but Flacco ’s pass was short .
The Colts will take over at their 2 .
Gumbel just said the clock was “ slo - o - owly becoming an enemy for the Baltimore Ravens . ”
… The Colts ’ offense goes right back to the Ravens ’ game plan .
Short run .
Short pass on a slant route .
And all with the clock ticking .
On third - and - 1 , as the clock slips under seven minutes , Manning tries to lob the ball on a timing pattern to Collie , who is looping out of the slot .
The pass is incomplete and an observer has to wonder why the Colts did n’t run the ball again .
After the punt , the Ravens take over at their 22 .
The Ravens , with nine minutes left , like I said , are sticking with Rice .
They run inside with Rice on first down and , about 30 seconds later , Flacco throws incomplete to the sideline .
Third - and - 8 with 8:16 left .
Flacco is under center , and he faces heavy pressure .
The pass is incomplete , intended for Washington , who has the ball hit him in the hands , though a step behind him .
The Ravens punt and the Colts will take over their their 25 .
The Ravens ’ defense , which has to be stunned by that last play , rises to the occasion .
The Colts , though , were n’t trying anything fancy .
They go three and out , and punt it back to the Ravens .
With about nine minutes left , the Ravens will have the ball at their 21 .
The Ravens get the kick out to the 28 .
… The Ravens go right back to Rice — and short gains .
On third - and - 5 , though , Flacco stretches out and finds Kelley Washington for 11 yards and a first down .
And then the Ravens ’ offense starts to build momentum .
After a nice 7 - yard pass to Heap , Rice takes a handoff up the middle .
And he finds lots of room .
And when the Colts close in on him , he just bulls ahead .
His jersey is stretched .
He ’s butting heads .
He drives 20 yards deep into the heart of the Colts ’ defense — and then a solid hit jars the ball loose .
Clint Session recovers for the Colts .
They take over at their own 20 .
… Ouch .
Strangely , with a chance to put the game away , the Colts start moving backward .
On first - and - goal , and the Colts try a run , out of a single - back set .
The play had nothing to recommend it .
They lose 3 .
On second down , Manning tries the gun , but is flushed to his right and he slides to the turf after losing 4 .
On third down , Manning tries for the end zone and his pass is long .
But just getting that far might have been enough .
Stover makes his second field goal of the game , and the Colts lead , 20 - 3 .
Manning keeps the Colts on the move .
As time winds down in the third quarter , he finds Dallas Clark for 5 yards for a first down at the Ravens ’
9 .
The third quarter ends .
From Judy : Ravens just burned their second timeout — with 4:24 left in the third quarter .
Time is slipping away , for the Ravens .
And the theme of self - destruction continues , too .
Is a fumble on an interception not enough for you ?
How about another interception by Ed Reed and another long return negated by a pass - interference penalty ?
That ’s exactly what happens .
A great pick by Reed , and this time he hangs onto the ball .
But there are flags down .
And the Colts go from possibly having the Ravens at their doorstep , with first - and - goal from the 10 to getting the ball back and penalty yards to boot .
From the Ravens ’ 37 , the Colts dial it back a little with consecutive runs , but Manning airs it out on third - and - 4 , finding Wayne for 11 yards to the Ravens ’ 20 .
… From Judy :
That ’s two Ed Reed picks on this drive .
And the Colts are inside the Ravens 35 yard line anyway .
Bizarro world .
My thoughts exactly .
So , a big thing happens on the next play .
Manning throws to Garcon , but Ed Reed picks the ball off and takes off like a shot .
He ’s up the sideline and he goes 30 some yards and you do n’t notice that Garcon was following the whole way .
He finally catches up , and pops the ball out .
And the ball bounces right to Dallas Clark .
You go from turnover to turnover in a blink of an eye .
… Manning gets the Colts almost all the way back to the 45 two plays later .
It ’s like Reed ’s big play never happened .
The Ravens seem dead set on stopping themselves .
They lengthen the field with a holding penalty on the next play , and then Flacco throws incomplete on third - and - 3 and fourth - and - 3 .
Colts take over at their 45 , poised to possibly pull out their pot of spackling and put the finishing touches on this game .
Ngata is not as corpulent as some of the wide bodies who play on the interior of the defense , but Manning was wise to avoid a direct hit .
… The Ravens start with their best field position of the game , by far .
And they go right back to Rice .
Two runs and they are facing a third - and - oh - so - short .
The wilder monkeys in the crowd amp up their screeching , but flags are thrown and it ’s a false start on the Ravens .
( Penalties are killing them so far in this game . )
The Ravens shrug it off , though , and Flacco finds Todd Heap over the middle for 10 yards and a first down .
You do n’t have to wear an ugly suit and stand in front of a TV camera to know that the Ravens need to stop the Colts here , and get back on offense .
They have the Colts pinned back , though , so a turnover could be a game - changer .
… Manning gives himself breathing room right away , with completions to Brown and Wayne .
But that is where the good feeling stops .
On his third play , Manning is forced to take a dive , disappearing under the pumpkin - shaped Haloti Ngata .
On second down , Manning throws deep and incomplete .
His third - down pass is dropped by Pierre Garcon .
… No return on the punt , but the Ravens will have decent field position at their own 34 .
So , on third down , Flacco niftily dodges the pass rush , and dumps a pass off to Rice , who gains 26 yards , up the right sideline , finishing his run by blowing right into a tackler .
An exclamation point on a powerful run , which brought the Ravens to midfield .
But on third - and - 3 , the Ravens ’ offense shorts out .
Flacco throws incomplete , and the punt is downed at the Colts ’
7 .
Greg Gumbel muses , as the Colts kick off the start the second half , about how long the Ravens can stick with their game plan .
A long time , I say .
There is a lot of time left in this game , and Flacco might be a young player , but he has shown plenty of composure in his short career .
… The Ravens start with Rice , who runs for short yardage .
And after an incomplete second - down pass , Flacco lines the Ravens up in the shotgun and … calls timeout .
Wow .
I just checked Manning ’s numbers .
It ’s the story of the game — so far .
He was 21 of 29 for 180 yards and 2 touchdowns .
He had completions to seven different players , led by Dallas Clark , who has 6 catches for 54 yards .
… Flacco was 5 of 10 for 55 yards , but I think that works out to be 1 of 4 for 1 yard in the second quarter .
The Colts ’ big time - consuming drive in the second quarter prevents us from getting a solid feel for the Ravens ’ offense , but so far it has been one - dimensional .
The 55 yards of pass offense were all to Derrick Mason , in just 3 catches .
Ray Rice has shown some power running with the ball .
He has 28 yards on 8 carries , but his longest run was only 6 yards .
… Flacco is sure to face a strong pass rush in the second half , so Rice is going to have to make some plays running the ball if the Ravens are going to have a chance .
Judy writes , Peyton was right .
He wanted one more play — TD to Wayne .
two TD lead at the half .
Is that the game ?
That ’s the end of the first half .
The Colts get an important score after an impressive two - minute drill by Manning .
The Colts went 64 yards in 8 plays and 1:48 .
Manning can be heard on TV shouting at his teammates to “ move , move , move ! ” … On second - and - 10 from the 14 , Ray Lewis is flagged for a helmet - to - helmet hit on Austin Collie .
The Colts creep closer to the goal line , but time is slowly slipping away .
On first - and - goal from the 7 , Manning finds Clark for a 3 - yard gain , and the Colts have to call their final timeout with 11 seconds left .
… They line up for another play , though .
The Colts are showing that they are not afraid to be aggressive .
… Manning works out of the gun , and he throws incomplete .
He had pressure coming up from his backside , and he was knocked down after he threw .
… With 7 seconds left , Manning wants to take another shot .
He is slow coming out of the huddle , though , and the Colts are flagged for delay of game .
The Colts will still go for it , though , possibly turning their back on a sure 3 points .
( Never mind . )
Manning finds
Wayne , who is right at the goal line , almost straddling it .
He goes down , but gets the ball in the end zone .
TOUCHDOWN .
Colts add to their lead , 17 - 3 .
Brown is the Colts ’ backup running back , and he went from pass catcher to runner on the very next play .
He bulled off the left side , out of the shotgun , for 13 yards , breaking tackles in old - time Earl Campbell style .
The Colts catch a huge break on the next play , with the Ravens getting flagged for pass interference .
That moves the ball safely in field - goal range at the Ravens ’ 27 with 34 seconds left .
The Ravens have to be disappointed .
They needed either to bleed the clock , or gain yards .
Instead , they give Manning a very real chance to expand the Colts ’ lead .
… Manning wastes no time , rattling off three completions , including one to his seventh different receiver — 8 yards to Donald Brown .
They bang across midfield to the Ravens ’ 40 with 55 seconds left .
The Ravens ’ starting field position had been gradually inching away from the goal line , but on the ensuing kick it slips backward .
Two minutes left , they take over at their 18 .
… They start with Rice , a bullish run behind the right guard and then call timeout .
… On second - and - 6 , Flacco is jolted hard as he threw , a deep pass toward the post .
It ’s incomplete .
Which brings up third down and a seemingly louder wave of crowd noise .
Flacco throws incomplete again , and the Ravens meekly prepare to turn the ball back over to the Colts .
With plenty of time for them to score again .
From Judy , referring to the Ravens ’ Domonique Foxworth , Foxworth beaten on that TD by Collie .
8 minute drive —
Ravens defense was out there a long time .
The Colts are much more methodical on this drive .
They have chewed up six minutes so far .
… They bounce inside the 20 on a pass to Mike Hart , a player who began the season on the Colts ’ practice squad .
Gain of 9 up the sideline to the Ravens ’ 11 .
And they take the lead back on a 10 - yard pass from Manning to Austin Collie .
TOUCHDOWN .
Colts move back in front , 10 - 3 .
The Colts go 75 yards in eight minutes .
… We ’ve hit the two - minute warning .
The Colts were n’t bluffing .
It ’s fourth - and - 4 from the Ravens ’ 35 .
Not a bad place to do something like this , when you consider the distance a field goal would be .
Manning passes to the right side to Addai who appears to have room to run , but Dannell Ellerbe arrives for a solid hit right at the first - down marker and the officials have to measure .
… They give it to the Colts , the fourth first down of the drive .
The Colts move inexorably on , though now in smaller steps .
After Addai is stuffed on a third - and - 2 at the Ravens ’ 33 , the Colts line up as if to go for it on fourth down .
The Ravens , perhaps caught off guard , call timeout .
Manning finds Reggie Wayne on first down for 12 yards , which is Wayne ’s first touch of the game .
On the next play , as if to emphasize Wayne ’s importance to the Colts ’ offense , Manning goes to him again , and Wayne makes a spectacular catch .
Gain of 11 to the Colts ’ 48 .
… The Colts have done a good job of spreading the workload .
Manning has completions to five receivers .
But the hardest worker so far is Dallas Clark , who has four catches for 39 yards .
His fourth was a nice 7 - yard gain on third - and - 6 from the Ravens ’ 48 .
The Ravens stick with Rice .
He runs , he catches .
On third down from their 24 , however , Flacco does n’t have a chance to get Rice the ball .
Flacco disappears under a white and blue wave of plastic .
Loss of 6 yards and an entree for the punt team .
… Flags fly like crazy on the ensuing punt .
It was , you might have guessed , a nifty return .
All for naught .
Colts take over at their 25 .
The Colts ’ drive ends as effectively as the Ravens ’ did .
There was a brief blip when Joseph Addai pulled down a tipped pass for a short gain .
Manning throws long and incomplete on third down , and the Colts are forced to punt .
About the only thing you can take from those four plays are the fact that the punt went out of the end zone .
The touchback gives the Ravens their best starting field position of the game .
The Ravens bring the hammer for their second drive .
They start with consecutive runs up the middle by Ray Rice , but on third - and - 2 an unremarkable incompletion sends the ball back to the Colts .
The punt is returned close to midfield .
Manning was 7 for 11 and 75 yards in the first quarter .
As Judy writes ,
We can also stop talking about Peyton being rusty — yeah , he ’s not .
Looks better than he did against Jets by a mile .
Flacco was 4 of 6 for 55 yards .
A very fast - moving first quarter .
… The Colts punt , and the Ravens fair catch inside their 10 .
More bad field position .
The Colts begin their second drive with the kind of precision passing that Manning is known for .
He finds Clark on a short crossing route .
The TV heads agree that the defensive coverage was pretty good , but Manning puts the ball right where it needs to go and the Colts pick up 19 yards .
A clutch 8 - yard completion to Austin Collie on third - and - 6 gets the Colts close to midfield .
But they ca n’t get back across .
On third - and - 7 , Manning finds Clark on the left side , but he is pulled down after 3 yards .
The quarter ends , and the Colts are likely to punt .
A tweet from Judy says it all : Flacco is obviously much healthier than last week — is throwing to the edges with ease .
But that ’s a killer to not get 7 there .
The Ravens ’ erased their next third down with a sneak by Flacco for 2 yards to the Colts ’
8 .
Closing in on the end zone , the Ravens try to run .
They try a pass .
And on third - and - goal , Flacco is nearly picked off by Antoine Bethea , who would might have taken it to the house had he been able to hang on .
The Ravens settle .
Billy Cundiff is good from 25 yards and the Ravens tie the score , 3 - 3 .
The Ravens erase the bad taste of a short gain on their very first play with a short pass on second down that Derrick Mason turned into a 16 - yard gain .
And with that , their offense stretches its legs .
Five plays go by before they face their first third down , third - and - 7 from midfield .
They get 5 yards on a penalty and then the Ravens ’ Joe Flacco toss his first deep pass , 18 yards to Mason down the right sideline .
First down at the Colts ’ 18 .
Judy said the Colts would be looking for a fast start .
I am not sure that qualifies , but the Indy offense did look crisp to start and they moved quickly across midfield and in big strides .
… The Ravens cause a bit of a stir on the ensuing kick .
The returner Jalen Parmele found some room up the left sideline , and ripped of a 64 - yard return — that was called back because of an illegal block .
Ravens ’ ball at their 7 .
The Colts start with bold passing strokes , straight up the middle of the field .
20 yards to Austin Collie. 10 yards to Dallas Clark .
Then they shorten their reach , starting with a pass underneath to Pierre Garcon , who shrugs off a tackle and gains 8 .
After a nice off - tackle run by Joseph Addai , to bring the Colts to the Ravens ’ 26 , the Ravens ’ defense stiffens .
Back - to - back incompletions , including a wicked collision between Ray Lewis and Clark , end the Colts ’ drive .
They line up for a 44 - yard field goal , and Matt Stover converts .
Colts move ahead , 3 - 0 .
We are on .
The Colts won the toss , and they chose to receive .
( Inexplicably , CBS cut to commercial just as the coin flip was being resolved . )
It was a deep kick and a touchback .
* The game starts at 8:15 p.m. Eastern time and is broadcast on CBS .
You can check out the breakdown from the N.F.L. here .
The Indianapolis Star notes that “ it ’s put up or shut up ” time for the Colts .
While in Baltimore , The Sun has a to - do list for the Ravens .
We begin our coverage with this from Judy :
Shifting the Terms of Debate : How Big Business Covered Up Global Warming
[ Here ’s the first part of an article I wrote last year about how right - wing think tanks shift the debate . ]
In 2004 , Michelle Malkin , a conservative editorialist , published the book In Defense of Internment .
It argued that declassified security intercepts showed that Japanese internment during World War II — the government policy that relocated thousands of Japanese to concentration camps — was actually justified in the name of national security .
We needed to learn the truth , Malkin insisted , so that we could see how racial profiling was similarly justified to fight the “ war on terror . ”
Bainbridge Island was the center of the evacuations ; to this day , residents still feel ashamed and teach students a special unit about the incident , entitled “ Leaving Our Island ” .
But one parent in the district , Mary Dombrowski , was persuaded by Malkin ’s book that the evacuation was actually justified and insisted the school was teaching a one - sided version of the internment story , “ propaganda ” that forced impressionable children into thinking that the concentration camps were a mistake .
The school ’s principal defended the practice .
As the Seattle Times reported :
“ We do teach it as a mistake , ” she said , noting that the U.S. government has admitted it was wrong .
“ As an educator , there are some things that we can say are n’t debatable anymore . ”
Slavery , for example .
Or the internment — as opposed to a subject such as global warming , she said . †
True , Japanese internment is n’t a controversial issue like global warming , but ten years ago , global warming was n’t a controversial issue either .
In 1995 , the UN ’s panel on international climate change released its consensus report , finding that global warming was a real and serious issue that had to be quickly confronted .
The media covered the scientists ’ research and the population agreed , leading President Clinton to say he would sign an international treaty to stop global warming .
Then came the backlash .
The Global Climate Coalition ( funded by over 40 major corporate groups like Amoco , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , and General Motors ) began spending millions of dollars each year to derail the Kyoto Protocol , the international treaty to help reduce global warming .
They held conferences entitled “ The Costs of Kyoto , ” issued press releases and faxes dismissing the scientific evidence for global warming , and spent more than $ 3 million on newspaper and television ads claiming Kyoto would mean a “ 50 - cent - per - gallon gasoline tax . ” †
The media , in response to flurries of “ blast faxes ” ( a technique in which a press release is simultaneously faxed to thousands of journalists ) and accusations of left - wing bias , began backing off from the scientific evidence .†
A recent study found only 35 % of newspaper stories on global warming accurately described the scientific consensus , with the majority implying that scientists who believed in global warming were just as common as global warming deniers ( of which there were only a tiny handful , almost all of whom had received funding from energy companies or associated groups ) . †
It all had an incredible effect on the public .
In 1993 , 88 % of Americans thought global warming was a serious problem .
By 1997 , that number had fallen to 42 % , with only 28 % saying immediate action was necessary .
1
And so Clinton changed course and insisted that cutting emissions should be put off for 20 years .
US businesses seriously weakened the Kyoto Protocol , leading it to require only a 7 % reduction in emissions ( compared to the 20 % requested by European nations ) and then President Bush refused to sign on to even that .†
In four short years , big business had managed to turn nearly half the country around and halt the efforts to protect the planet .
And now , the principal on Bainbridge Island , like most people , thinks global warming is a hotly contested issue — the paradigmatic example of a hotly contested issue — even when the science is clear .
( “ There ’s no better scientific consensus on this on any issue I know , ” said the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , “ except maybe Newton ’s second law of dynamics . ” )
2
But all this debate about problems has kept us away from talk about solutions .
As journalist Ross Gelbspan puts it , “ By keeping the discussion focused on whether there is a problem in the first place , they have effectively silenced the debate over what to do about it . ” †
So is it any wonder that conservatives want to do the same thing again ?
And again ?
And again ?
