'' (1 ) UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANT . '( A ) The term ' unlawful enemy combatant ' means ' 'a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant ( including a person who is part of the Taliban , al Qaeda , or associated forces ) ; or ' ' ( ii ) a person who , before , on , or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense . '
~HR6166 , The Definition of Enemy Combatant , ushering in the utter destruction of Habeas Corpus in its mirrored form SB3930 ( actually signed into law )
I hereby declare myself an Unlawful Enemy Combatant .
No , I am not , nor have I ever been part of the Taliban , al Qaeda , or associated forces , but I will save a Combat Status Review Tribunal or any other [ in ] competent tribunal established by Dubya or Rummy the trouble .
Yes , I know this means I can be tortured under whatever distorted definition of ' information gathering ' these war criminals utilize to make me admit that I am a terrorist .
Maybe by admitting it now , I can save them the trouble of doing that too , but they may do it anyway just for practice .
You know , keep the torture machine nicely greased and all that .
Do n't want it to get messy , mind you .
And yes , I know this means I 'll end up in Gitmo or in one of those nifty new Kellogg Brown and Root Detention Centers .
But I would suffer the fate of demons should I make a whore of my soul , to paraphrase another Unlawful Enemy Combatant .
Why do I consider myself even remotely capable of being labeled this way ?
Posted on www.whitehouse.gov, the National Security Council 's ' Strategy for Winning the War on Terror ' states the following :
' Subcultures of conspiracy and misinformation .
Terrorists recruit more effectively from populations whose information about the world is contaminated by falsehoods and corrupted by conspiracy theories .
The distortions keep alive grievances and filter out facts that would challenge popular prejudices and self - serving propaganda . '
On Monday , October 16 , 2006 , Fatherland Security Chief Chertoff stated that an ' area of concern ' is the threat of ' plots involving local communities , American citizens , who may become radicalized over the Internet . . . .'
It is clear : the next front of control is the blogosphere and the alternative news media .
By contributing towards the ' subculture ' exposing the fascist nightmare oozing out of D.C. , I must be necessarily ' keeping alive grievances ' that make our population a ripe recruiting ground for bad people .
Any parent can quickly imagine how horrible it would feel being forcibly separated from one 's children .
Any parent would sacrifice lofty ideals to see their children and loved ones protected from the ugliness of the world , and from suffering .
We are willing to tolerate so much just to have the chance to watch our children grow up happy .
Never did I think that I would find myself dragged to the horrible grey area between keeping my mouth shut in the hopes that nothing bad would happen , or risk persecution ( no exaggeration ) for speaking out against these travesties of freedom in the fear that the future for my children fades to bleakness .
Economic margin theory now comes into play .
We must now make the determination within our own value systems as individuals :
Is the future in which our children must live too horrible to contemplate for those who value liberty ?
Are the ever - increasing chances of this nightmare becoming real high enough now that we can no longer sit on the sidelines hoping it will fix itself ?
Keep our mouths shut and hope for the best , or speak out in defiance against this nightmarish Orwellian veil descending on our lives -- though that exposes us to renegade kangaroo proceedings with the real chance of being held indefinitely with no charges filed , and no ability to even see the evidence against us .
I 'm afraid for many of us who see the writing on the wall , this quandary looms quite closely overhead .
Come and get me , you sons of bitches !
I will not suffer this farcical disgrace .
I will not silence myself in the hope that maybe this evil machine of injustice , oppression , and horror overlooks me , though I , of all that is good and decent , expose my family to God knows what .
By writing this article , I may very well have doomed myself to a first class ticket to the KBR Camp o' Horrors .
Has it come to this ?
Am I hallucinating ?
Is this really what is going on in this country ?
I sit typing this , pausing , looking around , thinking ' I 'm sure I 'm not just reflecting on a really bad nightmare I might have had last night . . . .'
Have you not seen the legislation , now law ?
Are you so foolish as to think that 'it will only be used against bad people . . . terrorists . . . .
It 's just to keep us safe ' ?
To those who believe this childishness , to those frightened sheep who do not wish to rock the boat , or who either misguidedly or in brown - shirt fashion support this travesty against humanity , I say , ' Beware the father who fears for his children 's future . '
I offer you , in closing , the following quote from Samuel Adams :
" Contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen , and then say , ' What should be the reward of such sacrifices ? '
Bid us and our posterity bow the knee , supplicate the friendship , and plough , and sow , and reap , to glut the avarice of the men who have let loose on us the dogs of war to riot in our blood and hunt us from the face of the earth ?
If ye love wealth better than liberty , the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom , go from us in peace .
We ask not your counsels or arms .
Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you .
May your chains sit lightly upon you , and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen ! "
Before getting a reading , make sure you have a clear idea of the questions you 'd like to ask .
If you seek relationship advice -- be prepared to ask about the specifics .
Also , the way you phrase your question during the reading can play a big difference .
Avoid questions that can be answered with " yes " or " no . "
" Will my relationship last ? " is an example of a passive question .
Instead , use questions that begin with " how " and " what . "
For example , " How can I make my relationship stronger ? " is an active question .
Asking your psychic active questions makes for the most insightful readings .
Return a dict ( which I often call " response " ) with one or more of the
following as appropriate :
successful
This is a bool to indicate success .
pylons_response
If unsuccessful , this is a Pylons response object that your
controller can return .
It will contain an appropriate error
message for the user .
file_handle
Upon success , this is the file handle returned by
``urllib2.urlopen`` .
Per urllib2 , it has an ``info ( ) `` method
containing things like headers , etc .
xml_document
Upon success , if you set ``parse_xml_document =True`` , this will
contain the parsed xml_document .
I 'll take care of parsing errors
with an appropriate pylons_response for you .
server_response = talk_to_server(parse_xml_document=True )
if not server_response [' successful ' ] :
return server_response['pylons_response ' ]
etag = server_response [' file_handle '].info( ) .getheader (' ETag ' )
xml_document = server_response[' xml_document ']
If you are a strong believer in statically typed languages , you wo n't want to read this post !
Sometimes it makes sense for a function to return multiple things .
In such cases , it 's common to just return them in a tuple : " return ( count , new_obj ) " .
Sometimes you might want to return objects of different types based on whether an operation succeeded or not .
For instance , if the operation was successful , you might return " ( True , obj ) " .
If it failed , you might return " ( False , reason ) " .
Often , you can use exceptions to handle this situation .
Sometimes you might want to return objects of different types based on arguments to the function .
For instance , did the caller ask for the data in this format or that format ?
Sometimes you 'll want all of these variations at the same time .
In such cases , I have found that using a dict for your return value is a good solution .
For instance , here is a piece of a docstring that I wrote yesterday :
The calling code then looks like this :
If you read it out loud , the code " reads " easily , and yet it has the flexibility to contain all the different things I need to return .
If I ask for something that is n't there , I get an exception , which is life as usual for a Python programmer .
Oral is the new second base , the “ mostly ” girls keep on kissing girls , and the Bro Job has arrived ( but is still not ready for its close - up )
Does this scene look familiar ( from either side ) ?
Read the results of our sex survey !
On a recent Friday night a line of people were braving the rat - drowning downpour outside the Coolidge Corner Theatre to see the amateur porn medley You Oughta Be in Pictures .
But they were n’t the sort of pervy , long - lost penny - arcade refugees you might expect to find at an XXX - on - celluloid series .
No , the umbrella - toting throng were part of another demimonde , that of flask - concealing kids in mangy hoodies , college - hockey jackets , and T - shirts with video - game logos .
“ Maybe I ’ll know somebody up there , ” a kid in a red sweatshirt said in a loud whisper to his rain - splotched buddy , spilling popcorn on the floor and smirking as he picked out seats .
“ That would be hot . ”
Maybe so .
But that ’s not what ’s here .
As the lights went down , mysterious fluids began squirting on - screen .
Middle - aged men cavorted in thongs , paid tribute to bulges , and danced to Aaron Copeland .
With the exception of one gangsta - styled submission in which attractive , young naked women made out on a motorcycle , the median age of the people on the screen appeared to be 45 .
MILFs might be a guilty pleasure in pop-culture , but this was n’t any 12 - year - old ’s wet dream .
Near the end of the film , when a saggy - skinned , frizzy - gray - haired happy - go - lucky woman straddled a horse with her breasts exposed , someone cried out , “ Noooooooh , Grandma ! ”
Why do n’t younger people generally submit footage to the series ?
“ The older you are , the more comfortable you are with your body ? ” guesses sex maven Kim Airs , who started the annual series You Oughta Be in Pictures seven years ago .
So what , exactly , is going on in the house / apartment / dorm room next door circa 2006 ?
It ’s probably no big shocker for a generation that came of age during Lewinskygate that oral sex is the new second base .
“ It used to be that you had to be in a serious relationship to get it — and you had to ask for it , ” recalls one 28 - year - old male living near Inman Square who recently emerged from the second of two consecutive long - term relationships wide - eyed and blinking .
“ Now you just get it .
Sometimes , I ’ve been fooling around with a girl and the situation has just gone there when I was n’t expecting it . ”
He adds , “ I ’ve actually had to stop it . ”
It ’s also not surprising that given such cultural references as The L Word and a 2003 New York magazine –anointed term “ hasbians ” ( “ women who came out of the closet only to end up in heterosexual relationships ” ) , sexual orientation among straight - leaning younger women has become increasingly fluid .
Girls who sleep with boys do n’t limit themselves to terms such as “ straight , ” “ bi , ” or “ lesbians until graduation ” anymore .
There ’s also the increasingly porous distinction of “ mostly ” ( “ mostly straight ” ) , a modifier loaded with possibility .
Even a well - heeled female friend who has long been a good litmus test for gauging those moments when trends merge with the mainstream announced recently over beers , “ Did I tell you ?
I finally made out with a girl ! ”
This is someone in her late 20s who has had fewer than five male partners and now lives with a long - time boyfriend who ’s a lawyer .
She was talking about kissing a girl as if it were a rite of passage among the sort of people who use the word “ edgy ” to describe tattoos .
And so how did it feel to swap spit with a lady ?
She frowned .
“ It was sort of gross . ”
Girls making out with each other “ is obviously a social phenomenon now , ” says Mary ( not her real name ) , a “ mostly straight ” 25 - year - old who has on separate occasions invited a female friend and a gay - male acquaintance to mess around with her and her boyfriend of nearly five years .
Mary ’s boyfriend , Jonathan , “ has less experience with dudes than I have with girls . ”
Even so , Mary says , “ my whole hardcore sexual experience with girls is limited — like , really limited . ”
She acknowledges that Jonathan is among the minority of men willing to admit to messing around with another guy .
“ Girls are way more comfortable with it than guys , ” she says .
The sexual orientation of straight - leaning males does n’t seem to be quite as openly mutable as it is among younger women ( no matter how many dudes saw Brokeback Mountain ) .
Certainly a lot of people have witnessed super - drunk “ straight ” dudes sloppily kissing in the corner at parties , but those same guys do n’t usually run around calling themselves “ mostly straight ” : they talk as though they ’re loyal to one team or the other .
Poke around Boston ’s Craig ’s List , and you ’ll find plenty of men who are “ st8 ” but “ curious , ” looking to meet other men discreetly .
All of which increases the quiet mystery surrounding the “ bro job , ” a term defined in the Urban Dictionary as “ oral sex between two allegedly heterosexual male friends , particular [ sic ] when said friends are wasted . ”
( Usage example conveniently provided by someone from Cambridge , using the pseudonym Freddie Cougar : “ So are you , like , gay now that Ernie sucked your wang ? ” “ No !
It was totally just a bro job .
I loves the ladies . ” )
Tales of the bro job have been whispered around these parts for months , although “ straight ” men willing to own up to giving or getting one have been elusive .
Artist 's Statement Note from Ms. C.-H. : I make update maintaining and reorganize all the Web site .
You are invited please to see the revised archives , books , letters , friends , and pages of enemies , as well as of new pages for writings and photographs .
( Please moreover to note the new version of the cartoon " Support Our Troops Paraphernalia " for April 27 of 2005 , which Mr. Kreider has for reasons obscure of his private drawn again . )
I hope that you the readers will be satisfied with these improvements .
- C. - H. I will be appearing on Minnesota Public Radio ’s Midmorning show this Thursday , * from eleven to noon Eastern Standard Time , speaking on the subject of war cartoons .
No idea what I will have to say on this subject .
The last intelligent thing I had to say about Iraq was : maybe we should n’t invade it .
I knew it would be a disaster , even though I did n't have access to the same highly classified false intelligence that the Bush administration did .
I knew it because I know how even very modest plans usually work out in the real world .
Think about how you 've gone out to run a few easy errands , like pick up a library book and buy some razors and cat litter , and how unexpected little inconveniences inevitably conspire to thwart even those not exactly hubristic goals .
Also , I 've watched a lot of Stanley Kubrick films , which , if they taught me nothing else , taught me that nothing ever goes as planned .
Never forget the Fool 's Motto : " Nothing is Foolproof . "
But nobody listened to me , and now look .
The Democrats have voted for a March 2008 deadline for withdrawal , apparently assuming we 'll have everything pretty much tidied up over there by then .
But our Commander - in - Chief is going to veto that bullshit ; he ’s going to get the situation under control with this " surge " of 20,000 more troops .
The cartoon that best epitomizes our current situation , and our political leaders ’ response to it , is the old Shel Silverstein cartoon of two guys shackled by their wrists to a dungeon wall , hanging about fourteen feet off the ground , with one tiny barred slit of a window high overhead .
One of them is whispering to the other : " Now here ’s my plan … "
Once again , I will quote Matt Taibbi at some length , because he ’s right about everything and too good to edit .
He begins here by paraphrasing / mocking columnist Thomas Friedman :
In other words , both Vietnam and Iraq failed not because they were stupid , vicious occupations of culturally alien populations that despised our very presence and were willing to sacrifice scads of their own lives to send us home .
No , the problem was that we did n't make an effort to " re-evaluate tax and spending policies " and " shift resources " into an " all - out " war effort .
The notion that our problem in Iraq is a resource deficit is pure , unadulterated madness .
Our enemies do n't have airplanes or armor .
They are fighting us with garage - door openers and fifty year - old artillery shells , sneaking around barefoot in the middle of the night around to plant roadside bombs .
Anytime anyone dares oppose us in the daylight , we vaporize them practically from space using weapons that cost more than the annual budgets of most Arab countries to design .
We outnumber the active combatants on the other side by at least five to one .
This year , we will spend more on the military than the rest of the world combined -- more than six hundred billion dollars .
And yet Tom Friedman thinks the problem in Iraq is that we ordinary Americans did n't tighten our belts enough to support the war effort .
( Perceptive readers will not that Panel # 2 is inspired by ( stolen from ) this passage , for which I thank Matt . )
There is one time - honored way to win a war of occupation , as Edward Luttwak , senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , explained in a recent article for Harper ’s [ http://www.harpers.org/DeadEnd.html], which is to behave like Hittites , committing mass executions of insurgents and their families and eradicating whole towns to make examples of them and deter anybody else from ever even considering joining the resistance .
Which we are n’t willing to do because a. ) we are civilized nation and b. ) it would make us look bad .**
I take it as a foregone conclusion that the war is lost , as does almost everybody who actually knows what they 're talking about .
Only George Bush and his most intimate and deluded henchmen in the bunker are still issuing official promises of victory .
But now I 'm afraid we 're going to have to listen to exactly the same dumb gullible assholes who supported this war angrily explain to us liberals why it 's our fault we lost it for the nexxt fifty years .
We 'll read it in labored , stentorian newspaper columns by blowhards transcribing Republican talking points like a kid copying his report out of the World Book ; in ponderous , vapid tomes written by impressively credentialed hacks paid by right - wing think thanks ; and , most dreadfully , we 'll hear it from every surly , Fox - watching redneck shithead slumped over his Bud who still does n't understand how his country turned into just another bankrupt has - been empire .
So the only thing I have to say about Iraq now is the one thing nobody wants to hear : that there is no solution .
Iraq is a Kobyashi Maru , a no -win situation , a test of character that we are all failing .
It was not just a strategic mistake but an international crime and , if you believe in this sort of thing , an irredeemable mortal sin .
I do n’t even know how I ’m going to be able to discuss the situation on the radio without using words like shitstorm and clusterfuck .
And one reason it ’s impossible for politicians of either party to say this is that to do so would imply two ghastly , unfaceable admissions : that all those lives were wasted for nothing , and that nobody has any idea what to do now .
But there ’s another , more important reason the Democrats are n’t going to yank the troops out of there anytime soon , which is that we can't .
The whole point of the invasion was to get the oil .
The world runs on oil , see .
And the problem is , the oil is running out .
World leaders understand this — I ’m sure Mr. Cheney has explained it to George - - and the major players are now scrambling to position themselves for what promises to be an ugly and savage every - man - for - himself - type brawl over the dwindling energy resources as industrial civilization implodes .
The Russians have enough oil and natural gas to maintain their current stylish standard of living for another thousand years .
Do n’t you worry about the Russians .
The wily Chinese are forging better alliances in Asia and Africa than we ’ve ever had , and are also whistling and looking innocent while building a modern army that is probably not exclusively for rescuing stranded hikers .
Our main thing these days , of course , America 's equivalent of Belgian ale or those big cigars they make in Andorra , is having the most terrible military machine in the history of the world .
So our best play is to use that to try to take over the Middle East , where there is lots and lots of oil , but , inconveneintly , everybody hates our guts .
We ( along with the British ) have secured the contracts to Iraq ’s oil ( previously held by the Russians and French — ha ha , suckers ! ) , but if the flimsy little government we ’ve propped up there collapses later on in the same afternoon we pull out , only to be replaced by some batshit fervid - eyed mullah crying Death to the Great Satan , then it ’s like it was all for nothing .
And the thing is , we kind of have to have the oil .
We really need it .
Seriously .
We would n’t even have invaded if we did n’t need it so bad .
Like , okay , just listen : today , for example , we have to get home from work , which in rush hour traffic takes like an hour and a half , and pick up the kids from lacrosse practice and cello lessons , and stop off at Pizza Hut on the way , and oh right also get the fucking cat back from the vet ’s .
So I mean you see how it is .
That ’s like five gallons right there , and that shit is not free .
Just please let us have all the oil and we ’ll go home , okay ?
Deal ?
By the way : turns out Captain America is n't dead after all .
He 's in critical condition and the Avengers are keeping his survival a secret to protect him and find out who did it .
What a cheap rip - off .
Back in the days of weekly cliffhanger movie serials , kids called this kind of deceptive escape a " cheat , " and it was justly despised .
Fuck it : Marvel 's forfeited the moral right ( although , as I 'm ssure I will sooon learn , probably not technically the legal rights ) to Cap .
He belongs to us now .
We are all Captain America .
* I 've been bumped to either next Thursday or Friday for the hearings on Alberto " The Torturer " Gonales .
It 'll be worth it if they end up sacking that little Nazi shyster .
I will announce the new time here .

Artist corrects her infamous spelling mistakes in Livermore mural
Miami artist Maria Alquilar works on her art piece outside the front entrance to the Livermore library .
Miami artist Maria Alquilar arrived in Livermore Sunday to correct the $ 40,000 ceramic mural she created outside Livermore 's new public library .
She replaced the tiles containing misspelled names of Einstein , Shakespeare , Vincent Van Gogh , Michelangelo and seven other historical figures .

( 08-09 ) 14:02 PDT Livermore ( SF Chronicle ) --
 What s in a name ? 
Shakespere asked .
Make that  Shakespeare . 
Miami artist Maria Alquilar , much maligned for 11 misspellings that popped up in the educational mural she designed for the Livermore public library last year , spent today under the hot sun correcting her mistakes .
In addition to fixing the bards name , she changed  Eistein to  Einstein ,   Gaugan to  Gauguin and more .
But Alquilar , who at first claimed artistic license and said she wasnt going to return to fix the faux pas because people were being too mean about it , was giving no media interviews as she worked under a broad - brimmed straw hat and blue tent .
She sliced and diced the tiles with power tools , protected from the public by a barrier .
She wagged her finger at a television cameraman and threatened to throw a rock at a print photographer .
 No pictures of me ! she yelled .
 If I m in it , I m going to sue you . 
Apparently , Alquilar wanted to return quietly to do the edits , for which city officials are paying her $ 6,000 plus travel expenses .
Thats on top of the $ 40,000 she received for creating the 16 - foot circular mosaic , made up of 175 historical names and cultural words .
But after she arrived Sunday , word spread , and today she had a consistent audience for her work , which she expected to complete today or Wednesday .
Assistant City Manager Jim Piper assured reporters that city officials were spell - checking Alquilars replacement tiles .
 We certainly believe they are spelled correctly ,  he said .
Livermore officials selected Alquilar in 2000 to create a mosaic at the entrance to Livermores new library , which opened in May 2004 .
Icons representing science , art , literature and history surround a tree of life in the center .
Library patrons were of varied opinions about whether a name by any other spelling smelled as sweet .
A woman named Betty , who wouldnt give her last name for fear of reprisal from her stickler school - teacher chums , said she didnt mind the imperfect art .
 I feel sorry for her out in the heat ,  she said .
 It was kind of fun to have something unique .
I thought it was very nice . 
But Jarod Vash , 17 , who was borrowing videos with his girlfriend and her family , said he thought the misspellings were embarrassing .
 When the story first broke , I thought ,  Oh , Livermore , the town that misspells stuff ,   he said .
 The only thing weve got in Livermore , and its misspelled . 
But he added ,  Everybody makes mistakes . 
 Not this bad ,  said his girlfriends 13 - year - old brother , Eric Smyth .
I have seen Alan Cooper ’s book The Inmates Are Running The Asylum recommended many places and I finally got around to read it myself .
Overall I liked the book .
It is not too long and Alan Cooper is a really good and entertaining writer .
However , Alan Cooper spends almost half the book ranting over programmers at large and how bad programmers are at designing user interfaces .
But if you are able to take the excessive ranting as entertaining in the style of old - school stand - up comedy ( at least , that is how I took it ) then Alan Cooper offers some good insights .
The main insights I took with me from the book are :
Design Matters Design is one of the pillars of what make users ( customers ) lust for you product and makes them super - loyal .
Design does not relate solely to visual design but also interaction design .
The prime example of a master of design is Apple .
An other example is Palm PDAs , for years they were technically behind the Windows CE based PDAs both in hardware and software capabilities .
Still , the Palms were able to sit on 70 % of the market or so .
Mainly because the interaction design on the Palms was much better designed .
( I do n’t know the current status of the PDA market , as I no longer use a PDA . )

Homo Logicus Programmers are different from most “ normal ” people , so different that they are a different species than Homo sapiens .
One of the main traits of Homo Logicus is that they wants control , and accepts complexity as trade - off , whereas Homo sapiens wants simplicity , and accepts less control as a trade - off .
I think that this is important to remember as a Homo logicus when you make programs for Homo sapiens .

Goal - Directed Design and Personas
For me , the most useful part of the book is that Alan Cooper describe a method for making good interaction design .
Part of this method is that you should define a set of Personas who are the ones you design the program for , usually there will be just one main persona for which you optimise your design .
Personas are fictive persons often precisely described : age , gender , profession , favourite ice - cream flavor , etc. .
Personas makes perfect sense to me .
Just as most ( non-fiction ? ) writers write to a specific person to make the writing process easier and to write to a specific person also gives better results .
The goal - directed part means that the design should take offset in the Personas ’ goals , not in a specific process or task .
Again , this makes perfect sense .
To start with a persona ’s goal can lead to untraditional and better solutions .
Likewise , to be goal - directed also makes it easier to make judgement call about what functionality should be ( easily ) available in the program .
So that it is the functionality that the user needs to solve her goal which is available and not a dog ’s breakfast of all the functionality in the program .
Remember the Homo sapiens are in majority .

The Elastic User
If you do n’t have Personas then it extremely easy as a programmer to make “ the user ” elastic .
This means , that sometimes you ’ll take extra care and make a context sensitive help systems with carefully written pedagogical texts , for instance , because otherwise “ the user ” can get lost and confused .
Later you decide that “ the user ” will want to be able to customise the colours and fonts of each individual UI element .
The reason for the elasticity of “ the user ” is that when you do n’t design for a specific persona , “ the user ” have to play the role as many different groups of users , and it is easy to lose track of who you are designing for .
For me these are the main insights ( that I can remember now ) , but there are lots of more good stuff in the book and I can wholehearted recommend it .
Pexpect version 4.8 ¶
Pexpect makes Python a better tool for controlling other applications .
Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications ; controlling them ; and responding to expected patterns in their output .
Pexpect works like Don Libes ’ Expect .
Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands .
Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh , ftp , passwd , telnet , etc .
It can be used to automate setup scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers .
It can be used for automated software testing .
Pexpect is in the spirit of Don Libes ’ Expect , but Pexpect is pure Python .
Unlike other Expect - like modules for Python , Pexpect does not require TCL or Expect nor does it require C extensions to be compiled .
It should work on any platform that supports the standard Python pty module .
The Pexpect interface was designed to be easy to use .
Contents :
Pexpect is developed on Github .

Over the dissent of their executive committee , the Vermont Democratic State Committee today ( March 24 ) voted overwhelmingly to call on the Vermont Legislature to endorse an impeachment resolution that has been until now stuck in the House Judiciary Committee in Montpelier .
Although the Vermont Speaker of the House , Democrat Gaye Symington , does not want to take up the issue , her counterpart in the Senate , President Pro-Temp Peter Shumlin , called on the delegates to support impeachment .
The vote was lopsided , with less than eight votes against , The State Committee also included Dick Cheney in their call for accountability , and demanded that the legislature take up the issue in this session .
…
If Mr. Welch wants to get serious about ending this war , then he will recognize that Vermonters are on the right track with their calls for impeachment and he will honor our calls by working with his counterparts in Washington to initiate the impeachment proces .

What can WE do ?
Contact Speaker of the VT House Gaye Symington , and tell her she ’s failing to fulfill her oath to defend / protect the Constitution .

Apple Care 's Solution is to Keep it off my Lap ...
I was using my MBP last week when the fan came on .
I was n't doing anything unusual in terms of computing power , so I thought it odd , especially since I had n't heard the fan come on in the two plus months I had been using it .
Then I felt the bottom of the machine , and that sucker was hot to the touch .
I shut down the machine as a precaution , waited for about a half hour and turned it on again .
After about 20 minutes the fan came on again and I called AppleCare .
I explained that I generally work with the MBP on my lap with a lap pad from Laplogic to protect me from heat ( which is why I did n't feel the heat more acutely ) .
I was then told that the MBP was not intended to be used on the lap .
" It 's a notebook , " the technician told me , " not a laptop . "
Oh , I can see the clear semantic distinction there .
He went on to suggest that I only use it on a flat surface and avoid using it on my lap , but if the fan does come on , it 's safe to keep working .
The OS will warn me to shut down before it gets so hot , it would damage the components .
I hope he 's right .
I really love this computer .
I would hate to learn at this point in the courtship that it actually turns out to be one of those high - maintenance relationships .
BAGHDAD , Dec. 12 — A truck loaded with bags of wheat drove up to a crowd of poor Shiites early Tuesday , lured them close with a promise of work and exploded as they gathered around .
Seventy were killed and 236 were wounded , officials said .
The attack , in a square in central Baghdad , together with corpses found by Iraqi authorities , pushed the day ’s death toll across Iraq to at least 131 , the highest total since a bombing killed more than 200 here last month .
Shiite political leaders often point to such attacks , arguing that they , not the American military , should control security here .
The attack comes at a sensitive time for the Bush administration .
The White House is weighing proposals for major changes in its policy on the war .
Months of escalating violence have drained support for the occupation in the United States and left officials here and in Washington searching for a way out of an increasingly complicated war .
The Iraqi government , meanwhile , is pushing the American military to cede control of security in the capital , arguing that Iraqis knows best how to protect themselves .
American commanders , however , fear the Shiite - dominated government will use the predominantly Shiite army as a weapon against Iraq ’s embattled Sunni Arab minority .

Kein Thiago , kein Problem !
Ohne den angeschlagenen Mittelfeldspieler gewann der FC Liverpool am Montagabend das Spitzenspiel gegen den FC Arsenal mit 3:1 ( SERVICE : Tabelle der Premier League ) .
Thiago hätte nach seinem Rekord - Debüt am 20 .
September gegen den FC Chelsea Chancen gehabt , gegen die Gunners in der Startelf zu stehen , fiel aber laut Vereinsangaben mit einem " kleinen Fitnessproblem " aus , das ie ihn laut Medienberichten zuvor auch einige Trainingseinheiten gekostet hatte .

" Nach der Länderspielpause wird er wieder dabei sein " , erklärte Klopp bei SkySports .
Heißt : Thiago wird die Premier - League - Partie gegen Aston Villa ( 4. Oktober ) ebenso verpassen wie das Pokalspiel gegen den FC Arsenal ( 1. Oktober ) .
Aktuell sei er " mit Sicherheit nicht fit genug " , weswegen Klopp auf Thiago am Montag verzichtete .
Unklar ist , ob Thiago verletzt ist oder nur nicht in dem von Klopp gewünschten Fitnesszustand .

The consequences of false statements on enlistment documents can end what could have been a very bright career .
But what about the recruiter who lies or asks you to lie ?
Most recruiters are hard - working , honest , and trustworthy , tasked to do one of the most difficult jobs in the military .
However , military recruiting is a numbers game : Recruiters ' careers are made and broken based on whether or not they can meet their monthly quotas ( called " goals " in the recruiting world ) .
Keep in mind ( depending on the service branch ) that most recruiters are non-volunteers .
Some never wanted the job in the first place , but -- once selected -- are told that the prospect of returning to their previous jobs after three or four years of recruiting duty with an unblemished service record depends primarily upon making their goals .
Here are some of the half - truths and misrepresentations of truth you may hear from some military recruiters :
© The Balance , 2018
Chances of Being Sent to a Combat Zone
The fact is , this depends primarily upon your branch of service and your military job .
Your chances of being deployed ( on the ground ) to a combat zone not as great in the Air Force and Navy as they may be in the Marines or the Army .
Your chances may be greater based on the job , or military occupational specialty , you have .
Becoming a Navy SEAL via the Marine Corps
The short answer is :
This rarely happens .
The Navy SEAL program only takes members who are in the Navy .
No other branch can go through SEAL training .
While it is true , serving in the Marines will prepare you well for a job in any Special Forces program , getting into the Navy from the Marines is not an easy task .
Typically , former Marines , after their four - year enlistment , get out , join the Navy then go to SEAL training only if the Navy is taking sailors with prior military experience .
Regardless , the numbers are small coming from active duty to SEAL training .
Getting the Job Listed on Your Enlistment Contract
While you will be trained in a specific job , once training is complete , there is no guarantee that you will actually be assigned to perform that specific job .
In most cases , you probably will get to perform your job .
However ( in the Army especially ) , it 's not really all that uncommon to arrive on a post after training , only to find out they have too many of your particular job on that post and be assigned to do something else .
Even the training is not necessarily guaranteed .
While there are some exceptions , the general rule is if you fail to complete the training for the " guaranteed job " in your enlistment contract , due to something the military considers to be their own fault ( such as the job is eliminated / reduced , the job standards change , or you fail to qualify for a security clearance through no fault of your own ) , then the service will generally give you the choice of re-training into a different job , or an honorable discharge .
In this case , the choice is yours .
If , on the other hand , you fail to complete training for the job for something the military considers to be your fault ( such as academic failure , getting into trouble , or being denied a security clearance because of false statements ) , whether you are re-trained or separated is a decision made by your commander , and / or the Military Personnel .
You get no say in the matter , and often do n't even get a say about what job you will be re-trained into .
Active duty assignments are based on the " needs of the service . "
( There are exceptions , such as a qualifying humanitarian assignment , but these are really hard to qualify for . )
Quitting or Leaving the Military
You can't simply quit the military if you do n't like it ; this is not an acceptable reason for discharge .
Even if you quit trying in basic training , resulting in failing the program , the drill instructors will first try everything else imaginable to keep you in , including " recycling " you so you spend extra time in basic .
If the commander ultimately decides that discharge is the only course of action , you 'll be reassigned to a special unit to await discharge processing .
Everybody who enters the military for the first time incurs a total eight - year service commitment .
It does n't matter if your contract says you 're enlisting for two , three , four or five years active duty , you are obligated for a total of eight years .
If you sign a six - year Guard / Reserve contract and elect not to reenlist at the end of the six years , you will still be obligated for an additional two years .
Basic Training and Drill Instructors Yelling
The truth is , drill instructors do n't yell as much they did in years gone by .
You will still get to experience plenty of yelling , but mostly during the first part of basic .
After that , you will find your Drill Sergeants taking on more of a mentoring role .
This does not mean basic training has gone soft , in fact , a greater emphasis has been put on combat readiness in recent years .
Reporting Recruiter Misconduct
So , what do you do if you run into an unethical recruiter ?
All military commands have senior officers whose job it is to investigate wrongdoing , and the recruiting commands are no exception .
If you report it to one of these officers , it will be investigated .
While it often comes down to your word against the recruiter 's word , if a particular recruiter gets enough complaints against him / her , you can bet his / her bosses are going to start watching the recruiter a little more closely .

When designing a game , a good game designer will present the player with a solid collection of compelling choices .
As long as the choices remain compelling , the game has a chance of being fun .
But if the choices are boring , confusing , pointless , or broken , it ’s unlikely a fun game will emerge … although you could still end up with a Zune . 😉
Consider classic games like poker , chess , and go .
Compelling choices abound .
Now consider tic tac toe .
When you ’re a child , the choices may seem compelling , and the game can even be fun .
But as you mature , the choices become boring and obvious , and the game quickly loses its appeal .
Even skill - based games like golf or Quake involve compelling choices .
There are tactical choices as well as training choices .
What skills will you seek to develop and when ?
How much time are you willing to invest ?
How will you leverage your strengths and compensate for your weaknesses ?
In a game you may also have resources , a currency you can spend .
Maybe it ’s gold , mana , or energy .
Resources add new choices :
How will you generate income ?
How much will you generate ?
How will you spend your income ?
How will you balance your time between production vs. production capacity ( i.e. generating income vs. increasing your earnings potential ) ?
Having been a game designer myself , I found it easy to start seeing life as a game filled with compelling choices .
For starters , real life includes all the properties previously mentioned .
We ’re presented with a wide variety of choices for skill building , resource acquisition , relationships , and more .
As we age our decisions tend to become more complex , since childhood priorities no longer hold the same appeal .
What ’s the purpose of a game ?
The purpose of a game is to enjoy the experience — to have fun .
Another reason for playing games is to grow , since games can be wonderful teachers .
Having fun and growing sounds like a nice way to spend real life , does n’t it ?
What makes for a good game player ?
To answer this question , you ’ll probably imagine someone who ’s a good sport , who makes an effort to play his / her best while respecting that all players need an opportunity to enjoy the experience , including would - be competitors .
A good player takes time to develop his / her skills .
S/he takes the play of the game seriously , but not so seriously as to become overly attached to outcomes .
A person who ’s overly attached to outcomes is what we call a sore loser or sore winner .
If life is a game , how good a player are you ?
Do you play full - out for the enjoyment of the experience ?
Do you care about your performance and take time to hone your skills ?
Are you a good sport ?
Do you embrace the whole game , or resist some part of it ?
Is n’t it silly that so many of us get caught up in the subgames of life and totally lose sight of the larger game ?
Have you ever built a level 50 character in some fictional world , overflowing with wealth and radiant superpowers , while your real life character wallows around level 5 , apathetic , out of shape , and barely able to pay the bills ?
Lots of us have fallen into this trap at one time or another .
What other subgames have you mistaken for the complete game of life ?
The education game ?
The career game ?
The financial security game ?
The family game ?
The physical fitness game ?
The spirituality game ?
There are endless subgames that can divert our attention from making progress in the far more expansive game of life itself .
These subgames are interesting and valuable in their own right , but they ’re only pieces of the larger puzzle .
What do you think of a world - class actor who turns to drugs and alcohol ?
What about a world leader whose own spouse despises her ?
How about a massage therapist who never learns to manage his / her finances ?
No virtual reality can compete with the compelling decisions that real life offers every single day .
The choices before us are infinite , and the consequences are interesting enough to motivate us to choose carefully .
The game of life has a very strong design .
Despite being presented with the most wonderful game imaginable , most of us decline to play .
We sit on the sidelines , worrying about the complexities of the world instead of embracing them .
We only dabble in parts of the game .
Very few ever consciously commit to mastering the whole game .
Why ?
Your current level of engagement with life depends on how you evaluate yourself relative to the game of life .
Are you bigger than the game , or is the game bigger than you ?
When you play a game that ’s bigger than you , you feel overwhelmed .
It ’s too much to handle , and you soon give up .
I remember when I tried to play chess when I was only 7 years old .
I got frustrated because I could n’t understand it .
The game seemed bigger than me .
So I never wanted to play .
Chess was someone else ’s game .
If you think life is bigger than you , you probably do n’t want to play either .
The game becomes one giant inconvenience .
On the other hand , when you play a game that ’s smaller than you , you remain in control .
If the game is too much smaller , however , it becomes boring , like tic tac toe .
Games that are too small have little appeal because the challenge is n’t there .
There just are n’t enough compelling choices .
Some people have fallen into this pattern , mastering the game ’s novice setting and never realizing that there are other difficulty levels to experience , including intermediate , advanced , and master .
The sweet spot is when the game is nearly equal to you .
It ’s the perfect match for who you are .
You learn the rules , you take time to understand the gameplay , but you know that mastery will be a lifetime process .
Online role - playing games try to maintain this sweet spot , so their players will keep renewing month after month .
They have to make the game easy enough for beginners while continuing to challenge the expert players .
Social attachments play a key role as well .
When you feel that you and real life are equally matched , you ’ll experience the sweet spot of human life .
This is where the game is the most fun and rewarding .
You become fully engaged , and life events are valued for the juice of the experience .
You might describe this state as being in flow , the zone , wonder , or fascination .
What happens in a game when you experience a setback ?
If you ’re a good sport , you ’ll see it as added challenge .
Good players do n’t whine when the chips are down .
When the game gets tough , good players rise to the challenge .
I perform at my best when I maintain the perspective that life is the ultimate game , filled with compelling choices and interesting consequences .
Instead of resisting seemingly negative events , I treat them as an added challenges .
For example , if I experience a financial setback , it ’s not a big deal because money is nothing but a game world resource .
It ’s just game gold , something that can always be replenished with hard work and creativity .
And figuring out how to earn more gold is a fun challenge , full of compelling choices .
Good players do n’t rest on their laurels when everything goes their way either .
What happens when the game becomes too easy , when the choices start to seem dull and uninteresting ?
Then it ’s time to ramp up the challenge again by venturing into new territory .
For example , financially things have gotten pretty easy for me , and I ’m earning far more gold than I need for my family .
Sure it ’s nice to have some reserves , but spending the rest of my life stockpiling gold would be boring beyond belief , not to mention a waste of an interesting resource that could be put to good use .
The fun thing about having gold is that you can buy upgrades and thereby take on bigger challenges .
And that ’s exactly what Erin and I are planning to do — use our resources to build a larger team and take on bigger challenges .
Find ways to provide even more value .
Take the game to the next level .
It ’s unfortunate that people so easily forget that life is supposed to be interesting , challenging , and fun .
If your life is filled with compelling choices , consider yourself blessed .
Make some decisions , experience the consequences , and grow from there .
It ’s all good .
The only way to lose the game of life is not to play .
When you actively play the game , you gain skill and experience ( and hopefully gold as well ) .
Keep playing , and you ’ll eventually build yourself a level 10 , level 20 , level 30 character .
Just make sure that when you hit level 30 , you are n’t still fighting level 10 monsters .
What would an experienced player say to a character who sits on the sidelines , complaining incessantly about how hard it is to earn gold , how evil the monsters are , how unfairly experience points are doled out , how nobody is a good teammate , etc ?
I imagine the response would be something like , “ Nooooooooooobbbbb !
Quit whining and go play ! ”
If you find yourself in a human body , you came here to play the game of human life .
Do n’t sit on the sidelines whining like a noob .
The truth is that if you lose all your gold , if your teammates dump you , or if your character gets infected by the plague , it ’s all part of the game .
Every setback initiates another round of compelling choices .
The game is n’t supposed to be fair — it ’s supposed to be fun and interesting .
Whether or not you have a fun and interesting experience largely depends on what kind of player you are .
Did you think you were supposed to succeed in every attempt to battle monsters , secure gold , or find good teammates ?
Of course not .
That is n’t how the game works .
On plenty of occasions , you ’ll charge onto the battlefield filled with motivation and positive intentions , and you ’ll get slammed .
That ’s supposed to happen .
It ’s part of the game .
The game is supposed to be challenging .
How boring life would be if all of your attempts succeeded the first time … and instantly !
A game that includes setbacks , delays , and randomness is a lot more fun .
It keeps you playing longer and with greater motivation .
Thank goodness our desires do n’t manifest immediately , or we ’d be bored to tears .
It ’s the effort and uncertainty that makes life so rewarding because the ultimate reward is the experience of playing , not the gold we collect .
The game of human life may eventually end when you die , but in the meantime enjoy yourself while you ’re here .
Life is supposed to be fun .
Get out there and go play !
Tackle some of those compelling choices you ’ve been avoiding , accept the consequences , and grow from there .
His theory on evolution has influenced many science disciplines
The project run by Cambridge University has digitised some 50,000 pages of text and 40,000 images of original publications - all of it searchable .
Surfers can even access downloadable audio files to use on MP3 players .
The resource is aimed at serious scholars , but can be used by anyone with an interest in Darwin and his theory on the evolution of life .
" The idea is to make these important works as accessible as possible ; some people can only get at Darwin that way , " said Dr John van Wyhe , the project 's director .
One big collection
Dr van
Wyhe has spent the past four years searching the globe for copies of Darwin 's own materials , and works written about the naturalist and his breakthrough ideas on natural selection .
The historian said he was inspired to build the library at darwin - online .org.uk when his own efforts to study Darwin while at university in Asia were frustrated .
Images as well as texts are available online
Darwin Online features many newly transcribed or never - before - published manuscripts written by the great man .
These include a remarkable field notebook from his famous Beagle voyage to the Galapagos Islands , where detailed observations of the wildlife would later forge his scientific arguments .
Free use
The real artefact was stolen in the 1980s and is still missing , but the text has been transcribed from a microfilm copy made two decades earlier .
" It is astonishing to see the notebook that Darwin had in his pocket as he walked around the Galapagos - the scribbled notes that he took as he clambered over the lava , " said Randal Keynes , the great - great - grandson of Charles Darwin .
" If people can read it on the web and they learn that it was stolen then I think there is more chance that this very important piece of national heritage is recovered , " he told BBC News .
Darwin travelled to the Galapagos in The Beagle
There is no charge to use the website .
Most texts can be viewed either as colour originals or as fully formatted electronic transcriptions .
There are also German , Danish and Russian editions .
Users can also peruse more than 150 supplementary texts , ranging from reference works to contemporary reviews of Darwin 's books , obituaries and recollections .
At the moment the site contains about 50 % of the materials that will be provided by 2009 , the bicentenary of the naturalist 's birth .
" The family has always wanted Darwin 's papers and manuscripts available to anyone who wants to read them .
That everyone around the world can now see them on the web is simply fantastic , " said Mr Keynes .

Apple Computer 's iPods are everywhere these days , and they 're hungry .
Just ask Catherine Keane , 24 , who started her business , HungryPod , shortly after an acquaintance offered her $ 500 to load his CD collection onto his iPod .
Keane took the offer and determined that with two more customers paying similar prices , she could launch a business for $ 1,500 - enough to buy a computer that could handle large volumes of data transfer .
Loosely based on what its first client paid , Hungry Pod charges $ 1.75 per CD for the first 50 CDs , and $ 1.50 for each additional CD .
Keane will pick up both the CDs and iPods at her clients ' homes or offices in Manhattan for an extra $ 15 - unless they have more than 100 discs , in which case pickup is free .
Keane , who interned at a top 40 radio station in Florida prior to starting HungryPod , also recommends music to clients based on their collections for a fee .
According to Keane , 1 in 4 customers requests this service .
Thanks in part to a small story in The New York Times , Keane 's advertising efforts on Craigslist and word - of - mouth , HungryPod has expanded to three employees and four computers , and has annual sales that exceed $ 100,000 .
Now others want to get involved , so Keane has hired a marketing / sales employee and hopes to start Hungry Pod centers nationwide in the near future .

' Timid ' Congress drives GQ correspondent to draft six articles of impeachment for Vice President Cheney RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday February 21 , 2007 Print This Email This
In the March issue of GQ , Wil S. Hylton argues that Vice President Richard Cheney should be impeached for committing " high crimes and misdemeanors . "
" Over the past six years , as the country has spiraled into military misadventure , fiscal madness , and environmental meltdown , the vice president has not merely been wrong about the issues ; he has been duplicitous , deceitful , and deliberately destructive to the American democracy , " Hylton writes .
" These things can no longer be denied by rational minds :
That in the buildup to war in Iraq , the vice president , lacking confidence in the true casus belli , conspired to invent additional ones , misrepresenting the available intelligence , crafting new ' intelligence , ' and then spreading these falsehoods to the public , perverting the democratic process that he is sworn to uphold , " Hylton adds .
Hylton crafts six " articles of impeachment " because " a timid Republican Congress and a refusal to act by the new Democratic leadership " means that " the Fourth Estate " must " take the mantle of indictment unto ourselves . "

Update :
This article was dugg and made it to the Digg front page .
The traffic came and I discuss the aftermath here .
Go here For a Primer of Majority Rule in Social Networks .
>
Below is the voting chart for that story :
Inspired by Greg ’s insightful post , I thought I ’d take a minute ( or more ) on explaining how Digg is a game .
Elements of a Game
In Game Theory , we care about the elements that arise from interactive decisions .
Below are the main elements of a game :
Players – who is interacting ?
Strategies – what are their options ?
Payoffs – what are their incentives ?
Information – how do they know ?
Rationality – how do they think ?
In digg , players are the voters ; the voters have n options ; and , where non-paid voters are concerned , reputation is the over - riding incentive for voting a story ( top - digger status , etc. ) ; information come in the form of following the vast web of links of blogs on the web .
Rationality — this assumes that the voters are rational & that each voter knows that each voter is rational and that each player knows that each player knows that each player knows that ….ad infinitum .
How does Digg work ?
I ’ll use Philipp ’s concise summary of how digg works :
The Digg system of measuring a story ’s importance is based on a semi-random set of people voting for or against a semi-random set of news stories .
The Urn Game
In graduate school , I played a really fun and revealing game called “ The Urn Game . ”
The game shows very simply how the concepts of GroupThink , Conformity , Paradigm Shift , and Information Cascades work .
Here are the rules of the game :
There are two indistinguishable urns .
Urn “ W ” has two white balls , one yellow .
Urn “ Y ” has two yellow balls , one white .
A proctor will flip a coin to choose an urn .
You must guess which urn it is after seeing one ball from the urn AND AFTER HEARING ALL THE GUESSES OF THOSE BEFORE YOU .
Your goal is to choose wisely .
In our version of the game , 8 students were called per round ( new urn - draw each round ) .
At each turn , draw out a ball without looking at any others and without showing the ball to anyone else .
Return the ball to the urn , write your guess on the provided sheet , then give the sheet to the proctor .
Playing this game reveals a few things that are relevant to digg and to all social software :
GroupThink :
This game illustrates how conformity can be rational for individuals , even when they do n’t care what others do .
The decisions made by others convey some information — that is , rational individuals may ignore their own information .
Conformity : People in a group often believe and do the same thing as people around them .
This leads to an Information Cascade — that is , you do what other people do…etc …
For example , if you are eating at a fancy restaurant and do n’t know which fork to use , you naturally look to see which fork the first person used , and you use the same one .
Then , the third person notices which fork you and the first person used , and he does the same .
And so on .
Paradigm Shift :
If wholesale conformity occurs , then voters decisions convey no information — that is , if the first 2 people vote for x and everyone follows the first 2 people regardless of their true feelings about the thing voted for , then 100 votes conveys no more information than the first 2 votes .
We can further conclude that even when individuals are rational , the group may not be — that is , a few irrational individuals can swing the behavior of an entire group .
These irrational individuals are phenomenally first movers also .
In the case of Digg , these are the power users — these users commit to a strategy and are known as top diggers .
Digg is not a Prisoner ’s Dilemma
In response to Alex Bosworth ’s thoughtful post , Digg is not a Prisoner ’s Dilemma .
Some applications of Game Theory work , and some do n’t for certain situations .
For example , Nash Equilibrium is not the right concept for some strategic situations .
The Prisoner ’s Dilemma is about 2 players , not N players .
The two key features of the Prisoner ’s Dilemma are ( 1 ) both players have a dominant ( and rational ) strategy to confess AND ( 2 ) both players are better off if they do n’t both confess .
The Prisoner ’s Dilemma is the wrong metaphor for Digg .
A Proposed Way of Thinking about Digg
Digg is the online version of The Urn Game .
What I see are power users , typically the first movers , wherein a vote is casted by one of the top diggers , and then a flood of comformity follows — that is , voters follow the first movers , typically the power users , and ignore their own rational feelings about the article being dugg and vote anyway , following the power user ’s vote .
At a wholesale level , this creates an information cascade , such that the Nth vote conveys no more information than the first 2 votes .
Philipp is right in his analysis on Groupthink — but , it ’s more than that :
Digg is a system that allows the power users to swing the behavior of an entire group .
Others Chime In
Here ’s Kevin Rose ’s solution to the Digg problem :
What is changing however is how we are handling story promotion .
While we do n’t disclose exactly how story promotion works ( to prevent gaming the system ) , I can say that a key update is coming soon .
This algorithm update will look at the unique digging diversity of the individuals digging the story .
Users that follow a gaming pattern will have less promotion weight .
This does n’t mean that the story wo n’t be promoted , it just means that a more diverse pool of individuals will be need to deem the story homepage - worthy .
I ’m not sure what he means .
But , arrington apparently gets it ( or pretends to ) .
I think what Kevin is saying is that Digg will weigh votes , based on the unique user ’s historical profile and voting data .
Still , it ’s vague and I ’m not sure what he ’s talking about .
But , it sounds interesting .
Arrington suggested the following :
I think this is the right thing to do .
Digg needs to continue to encourage people to recommend stories to their friends , but also find ways to get truly unique and interesting stories to the home page without the sponsorship of a Digg user group .
Hopefully the algorithm changes will help .
Another suggestion to improve things that I recently passed on to Digg CEO Jay Adelson : weigh a story digg more if it comes from perusing the upcoming stories  area v. someone hitting the story via a direct link .
Since friends often email or IM stories around via the direct link , it ’s more likely to be a vote from a group .
A digg from the upcoming stories page is much more likely to simply be a user reviewing stories and picking the ones that he or she thinks are important .
Arrington ’s suggetion is truly lame — to weigh a vote coming from a previously dugg article completely supports the concept of Information Cascade .
Calacanis , of course , has to chime in :
Calacanis — I like you , I really do — you ’re level - headed and you go against the tide , but you ’re wrong on this one .
Digg and most social software smooth over time , and can eventually be approximated by a poisson distribution .
This distribution is what Pareto is built on ; this means that social software — Digg , ‘ Scape , and all of them are not Democratic — they are Republics .
A truly democratic society would mean that all votes are equally weighed — a majority rule – , but that ’s not the case with first - movers and top - diggers .
My Proposal
If Digg were to be relevant again , it must tackle the problems of GroupThink , Conformity , Paradigm Shift and Information Cascades .
To tackle Groupthink , make it truly democratic again — do not profile Top Diggers or elevate anybody higher than anyone else .
This includes no special weights on previous digging history , etc. — level playing ground for everyone , no monarchies or philosopher - kings .
To tackle the problem of conformity , do not show profile or # of votes for up - and - coming dugg articles .
Just show the article link , with no profiles or votes attached to it .
As a compromise , only show the profiles and votes on the articles that make the digg front page , but make them un -diggable from the front page .
Doing the above 2 items will most likely fix the Paradigm Shift and Information Cascade problem .
What ’s Left of Digg if Kevin Rose follows my advice ?
If Kevin Rose follows my advice , Digg will become a user - generated meme , truly democratic , where the votes are equally weighed and blind to any first - mover , power - user , and irrational individuals that may sway the behavior of the group .
The quality of the front page articles will be higher for sure .
The social aspect of Digg will be compromised , but it will be relevant again .

« What can we learn from game developers ?
| Main |
And one more thing ... »
When only the glib win , we all lose
In way too many meetings , the fastest talkers win .
And by " fastest talkers " , I mean those who are the first to articulate an idea , challenge , issue , whatever .
Too many of us assume that if it sounds smart , it probably is , especially when we are n't given the chance to think about it .
The problem is , the guy with the " gut feeling " -- the one who senses that something 's not right , but has no idea how to explain it , let alone articulate it on the spot -- might be right .
Too bad , though , because the glib usually rule .
Let 's face it -- the clever , witty , glib talkers can make the non-clever , non-witty , and non -glib sound like slow dolts .
Slow - to - articulate is mistaken for slow - in - the - head .
And as the world speeds up and decisions have to be made right frickin ' NOW , it just gets worse .
So there 's the heart of the problem -- if you 're not able to explain your thoughts , ideas , and concerns quickly and articulately , you are often at a disadvantage .
I 've been there .
I am there .
I 'm capable of thinking ( some would debate that ) , willing to do the research , and reasonably articulate .
But I need time !
I have never been one of those think - on - your - feet types .
With the exception of those few things in which I have a lot of expertise and experience , I pretty much suck at having to explain , defend , or promote something in real - time .
[ Note : Making this a glib vs. thoughtful issue is not what I 'm saying ; lots of people can be thoughtful , right , and quick to articulate .
Just because someone can think and speak fast on their feet does n't necessarily mean they 're automatically wrong .
The problem is that too often they 're assumed to be automatically right . ]
Perhaps we can attack this on two fronts :
1 ) We all need to fight the culture of the quick , by recognizing that giving people a little time to think will do more good than harm .
2 ) If you 're not good at the glib game , there are some things you can do to improve , starting with the most important :
Memorize this : " I have some concerns , but I need a little time before I can really articulate them . "
If you 're a manager , or anyone who leads meetings and discussions , please PLEASE have respect for that phrase .
It 's unlikely ( but possible , sure ) that someone will abuse this , since " buying time " in the context of a work decision does n't usually buy us anything other than the chance to think more deeply .
I do have a few other suggestions , and I hope to hear more from you ...
Listen -- and respect -- your own " gut feelings "
( known as bad smells in the programming world ) .
Read Blink for a greater appreciation of the research behind it .
This does n't mean that your instincts are always right , but they should NEVER be dismissed without thought .
Work to move up the glib continuum
Dig for the source of your feelings about the rightness or wrongness of an idea .
If you 're in the " I know it when I see it , but I can't explain why or how " stage , you need to do some serious analysis .
Here are a few tips :
1 ) Compare the thing - that - feels - wrong to something that you know is right .
Look for the deltas .
Sometimes we miss the subtle but crucial things because we 're looking in the wrong place .
It might help to bring in an outsider who does n't come with pre-existing biases .
( Like the drawing on the right side of the brain thing , where you can draw a thing more accurately if you analyze it as lines and shapes and shades and try to ignore / forget what you know the thing is )
2 ) Use rubberducking to force yourself to explain something .
Even if you have no idea what you 're going to say , just start talking !
( to a rubber duck or a helpful friend or co-worker )
The act of speaking can engage other parts of your brain and help you shape an explanation .
The tricky part is , we sometimes try so hard to find a reasonable , logical explanation that we just make s*** up without even realizing it .
So explain it , then do the next thing :
3 ) Find someone to tear holes in your explanation .
This is when you need a devil 's advocate .
Not necessarily to prove you 're wrong , but to help you figure out why you 're not .
And of course , most of us need to practice defending our ideas .
4 ) If your communication skills are weak , work on them .
You should be able to talk as fluently and naturally as the guys in marketing -- only authentically and without the semantically - empty buzzwords and jargon .
I hesitate to suggest this , but joining a toastmasters program could be a big help if you 're struggling to make your point quickly and effectively , especially in front of a group .
5 ) Take an improv class !
Nothing helps you learn to speak on your feet ( and not get in your own way ) better than improvisation .
This is something Johnnie Moore talks about , and I think it 's a lot more valuable than I previously recognized ( on many different levels ) .
6 ) I know I do n't have to say this , but for disclaimer purposes I will : do n't use your glibness to avoid having to think more deeply or to " win . "
The best solution is to ask for time to think , research , analyze , evaluate , etc .
Just because you can talk fast does n't mean you should .
But it helps to be quick enough to make the case for why you can't articulate your point on the spot , and why taking the time to do so could be of great value .
Again , if you 're a manager , understand that most of us are biased to favor glibness ( assuming it sounds smart at first listen ) .
Most of us unconsciously link articulation with intelligence , and quicker is better .
Do n't be blinded by glibness .
While it might be a huge asset for a rousing dinner party conversation , glibness can be potentially deadly in work .
I know there 's more to say about this ... and I might be completely wrong here , but I just can't put my finger on it right now ... so I 'll think some more and get back to you ; )

Kathy ,
Why do you " hesitate to suggest this , but joining a toastmasters program could be a big help if you 're struggling to make your point quickly and effectively , especially in front of a group . " ?
Why the hesitation ????
Toastmasters can make a WORLD of difference for people 's communication skills as well as their leadership and self - confidence !
There is also a part of every Toastmasters meeting that helps develop " thinking on your feet " ... it is called TableTopics .
You may already know this , but TableTopics is when you are given a question or topic without any warning or time to prepare and you have to get up in front of the club and give a 1 - 2 minute speech .
The first time you do it is pretty tough .
And it takes a while of watching people who are good at it and trying it again yourself before you start to develop the skill .
In the world of personal development and communications , I think it is safe to say that Toastmasters is one of the world 's best kept secrets !
In case anyone is interested , you can find a club in your area at www.Toastmasters.org !
Hope to see you at a meeting soon !

I 've been dealing with this very subject -- losing battles with arguers -- and I AM [ theatre - ] improvisationally trained !
The hard part comes when someone is MORE trained ( or experienced ) than you in the witty comebacks .
... Case - in - point : many salespeople are trained to argue back with you .
( I had a discussion with a salesman friend about his way of conversing ! )
They will always have a forceful , " non-discussing " way of throwing your discussions , concerns , ideas back into your face .
That ' slap ' of his argument hurts , too .
Others are trained to argue also .
The important thing is to stand your ground .
NOT - arguing may be the best thing you can do for yourself : it removes the power they can use against you !
The difficulty is that in stopping the train of their argument , you may also be avoiding what could be an important mountain both of you must climb together : the compromise .
However , one thing is important : surround yourself with trustworthy people both at work and in home life ; you do n't need ' yes - men ' ( or women ) when what you need is someone who will help you find your authentic voice and opinions .
Practicing your discussion skills in a non-judgmental air can really help you .

As a quick speaker myself ( and occasionally a glib one ) , I tuned into this after taking the Myers - Briggs test with colleagues I really respect .
It 's not just that these people have trouble putting ideas into words , it 's that they work best when they take the time to think an idea through .
To me , it was really important to see that this might not just be speaking skills , but that our problem solving styles differ .
Put another way , the best idea might not ever exist if you do n't give everyone enough time !

In a previous job I was an art director , with several soft - spoken designers under me .
This was at a company where outspokeness was frequently rewarded , and decisions were made during meetings .
The design team felt out of the loop because they could n't get a word in edgewise .
( Geez , it was hard for me and no one ever accused me of being soft - spoken ! )
We developed a habit where quietness worked to our benefit .
Briefly : you sit quietly , listening to all the jawing around the table , while appearing to doodle .
In actuality , you 're taking in all the hot air and distilling the good ideas out of it .
The doodles are really graphical representations ( spider diagrams , thumbnails , Venn diagrams , whatever ) of your good idea ( which is helpfully informed by all the talk thus far ) .
At a certain point in the meeting ( the magic moment is usually when people starts repeating themselves ) , you push your notebook into the center of table and clear your throat .
When someone looks at you , you say , and not in a loud voice : " so here 's the way I see it ... "
( As a capper , you can step up to the whiteboard and start copying your idea up there while people are still talking ) .
This works on lots of levels .
Your idea combines other people 's ideas , so the Big Egos feel like they 're " winning . "
Because you 've been quiet through the meeting , your voice seems louder , and what you say seems more profound ( a sound seems louder when it 's surrounded by silence ) .
You do n't need to be a sharp verbal wit , because your idea is represented visually .
You have an artifact ( the notebook or whiteboard ) , that other people can draw on or rework .
Finally , by waiting until that moment when people start repeating themselves , you turn everyone 's attention to a non-verbal solution , switching on a totally different set of brain activities , which everyone welcomes because they 're getting tired .
In other words : instead of out - witting the wits , make your retiring personality work for you !

I think everyone needs to learn how to communicate clearly .
But it is often about debate and not just persuasion .
You need to learn tools if you are in a confrontational situation with a " persuader " as opposed to an open discussion .
I am a questioner , I do n't necessarily put my own thoughts first , but ask a question that triggers a common response .
It is a great way to de-escalate a " battle " of words and get them to start seeing your point of view .
If you cannot respond though with your own thoughts and a " marketing " type that is just spewing out stuff , listen to them , question them , and then at least you can be clear that THEY do n't have all the answers either .
It is tough , but you have to read a room and the personalities in it and respond to them either with " strength " or compassion or silence or a nod .
It completely depends .

I 'm the glib fast thinking type - married to and in business with ( for 22 years ) a more intuitive , seemingly slower witted , occasionally inarticulate partner whose wisdom and judgement are consistently better and more accurate than my own .

Sometimes , coming to a decision quickly is a result of the group momentum to make a quick decision , not necessarily due to the nature of the situation .
Unless there are life threatening circumstances , very few decisions need to be made on the spot .
A decision to rearchitect the database access for a given software product can probably stand a little think time .
This pressure to decide provides a ripe environment for your glib talkers .
One of the techniques I 've used in the past is the " 24 hour rule " .
This rule basically said the group breaks for 24 hours and then comes back together to make the final decision .
This " 24 hour rule " could be called by anyone in the group whenever we were making a sizable change but where someone felt we had n't covered all of the aspects .
If it felt like we were missing something , chances are we were .
This rule gave people time to back away and think about what they were getting ready to do .
The beauty of this is that it reduces the first mover effect of the fast talkers .
People get to take time to organize , digest and process .
I found it also encouraged better problem solving techniques since people hate meeting a second time .
By changing the pace of the process , you retain more control of the situation .
In the end , the rule saved us several times as people came back to the table with a changed perspective and were able to make better decisions .
I 'd rather take the time to make a good decision once than to make three bad decisions quickly .

I am also a late - articulator and have to deal with glibness constantly .
I have learned this valuable technique : write down a concise statement of the person ’s argument and then share the written statement ( go to the whiteboard and write it out if in a conference room ) .
This process completely changes the nature of the discussion and often removes the glib - sters advantage ; and it may also help you , as it does me , formulate a counter argument .

I looked up glib in the Merriam Webster online dictinary :
1 a : marked by ease and informality : NONCHALANT b : showing little forethought or preparation : OFFHAND c : lacking depth and substance : SUPERFICIAL
2 archaic : SMOOTH , SLIPPERY
3 : marked by ease and fluency in speaking or writing often to the point of being insincere or deceitful
This last one reminded me of much of our political dialogue -- or dueling monologues -- and how important it is to trust one 's gut , and not simply go along with the prevailing hot winds , when considering proposals / arguments made by anyone in power .
Posted by : Joe McCarthy | Apr 5 , 2006 8:04:18 PM
Hey Kathy ,
To use your own phrase ..
I have some concerns , but I need a little time before I can really articulate them .
But I can try articulating now .
:D
Look I agree that mostly the glib win .
But being one of the non glib ones and trying to emulate them I can tell you its extremely difficult to be glib .
So I have a grudging ( or as Roget would say reluctant , unwilling , complaining , resentful ) respect for the glib ones which I think you should have too .
Another thing , you mentioned " Just because someone can think and speak fast on their feet does n't necessarily mean they 're automatically wrong .
The problem is that too often they 're assumed to be automatically right . "
Similarly the one who are n't glib should n't be automatically thought as smart because many a times they are STUPID .

A friend of mine at my first graduate job had a rather good way of dealing with direct questions .
If you asked him a question , where I might go " Hmm ... um ... well ... " while coming up with a response ( thus , I realise now , making me look like a bumbling fool ) , he'd go " Okay - one moment ... " , or " Good question - let me think about that a sec . .. " and possibly hold his index finger up , silencing anyone who wanted to interject before he'd got his answer out .
He'd think for on average at least 10 seconds , and then give a considered , measured reply , no umming , ah- ing or anything like that .
He was a very intelligent and experienced IT consultant , and you know , I never heard him utter a stupid statement or answer .
He never , ever put his foot in it or made a gaffe .

In our team , we 've just adopted a few agile development techniques .
The one most relevant here is Planning Poker
[ http://blog.visionpace.com/2005/12/planning_poker.html ]
Basically you discuss the " story " ( feature to be implemented ) then everyone chooses a time estimate ( marked on a set of cards )
This way , the over confident glib person may estimate 1 day , but the gut feeling guy might think it 'll actually take 5 .
Since the idea is to come to a consensus , this forces everyone to discuss , so the gut feeling person wo n't just get ignored .
Also it lets people get much better at estimating ( and the team at spotting people who always over or under estimate )
We 've only just started doing this , but we 're already seeing it 's value !

I suspect it relates to an introvert / extrovert mix .
Just a thought .
That would hardly be all there is to it , but people who can't immediately express their intuitions tend to be introverts .

The UK equivalent to the Toastmasters is the Association Speakers Clubs [ http://www.the-asc.org.uk/ ] .
I can recommend them as a friendly and safe enviroment where you can learn skills and confidence .
A particularly useful part is the Topics section of the evening where you have to speak for two to three minutes on a subject given to you by the chairman .
Being able to talk fluently and convincingly at a moment 's notice is one of the most useful skills I 've ever learnt .

As a slow person having to confront glibness , I find that there 's a concept of professionalism at stake .
If being professional means having an immediate answer to any question and being able to justify my answer by my own infallibility ( which is the notion of professionalism that glib performances appeal to ) , then I 'm not a professional by that definition and I can't pretend to be .
If being professional means having a systematic way of thinking things through that protects me from my own fallibility , and being able to justify my recommendations by objective criteria rather than an appeal to my own authority , then I am a professional by that definition , and keeping that in mind helps me to deal with glibness .

I 've got a confession to make .
I shoot from the hip .
All the tests , both respected and risible agree : I 'm an activist , a kinaesthetic , you name it , I 'm it ... in spades .
I 'm even South African .
Every cliche applies .
All mouth .
So let me explain .
Talking out loud helps me formulate my thoughts .
Saying them to someone sets my idea up as an Aunt Sally .
It gets the ball rolling .
However , I often find that I revise my ideas further down the line ( because I too , need time to think it through , but I like a starting point ) .
It might be a complete overhaul , it might just be the odd tweak to hone things .
I work well when I have a team of people to bounce things off .
Sometimes that team will include the slow starter , and that 's fine - next day , there 'll be an e-mail , a text message or a phone call and all the objections will be raised and alternative ideas mooted .
The wheels are in motion .
A good team has space for everyone .
If we know that for person A the ideas come thick and fast and they 're on the lips before they 're even coherently in the head , while for person B , there will be that one perfect gem that is the result of cogitation , we make space for both extremes .

Maybe one of A's thick - and - fast ideas is what provides the inspiration for B's more carefully thought out gem .

Tom , Dick , and Harry are sitting around one afternoon and are starting to get hungry .
Tom : " I 'm hungry . "
Dick : " Me too . "
Harry : " Where do you want to go for lunch ? "
Tom : " Let 's go to McDonalds . "
Dick : " I have a bad feeling about McDonalds , but I do n't know why . "
If Harry had to make a decision with no further input , would he be on Tom 's side or Dick 's side ?
For many problems , we prefer a bad solution to no solution .
A good way to ferret out a bad solution is to provide competing solutions .
The competing solution does n't have to be better , it just gets people to discuss which one is better or worse and why .
Asking for time is a great way to save time in the long run .
Set a deadline for when the discussion will continue or the solution will be chosen and try to get a night 's rest in the thinking period .

Kathy ,
I have a good feeling about your post .
And the reason is obvious ...
It 's right ! :-)

As detailed in for example the book " Mapping the Mind , " glibness has a specialized area of the brain dedicated to it -- which drives the point home that it has nothing to do with " intelligence " ( which however it 's defined , most would agree is not localized in the brain ) .
For example , the genetic disorder Williams syndrome is associated with mental retardation paired with extreme glibness .

I am reminded of some comments by a Civil Engineer on presenting proposals at Town Hall meetings and City planning commissions .
She hated presenting when some of the government people were teachers in their day job .
Whether they knew what they were saying or not , or even had anything to say , they usually convinced everyone else to go along with their ideas .
Teachers are the ultimate public speakers , with lots of practice .
So the takeaway here is : if you need to be a better speaker , check out teaching or Toastmasters .
And here is an idea for further research .
What do you do when a group is all quiet go - alongs ?
I 've encountered this before .
It 's a challenge to lead because they wo n't discuss their ideas .
There is just no way to get open consensus .
Worse , they tend to use quiet techniques to get their way ( secret alliances , roadblocking , other nasty things ) .
Can they be turned away from the Dark Side ?

Update : The Iranian Connection
Okay folks , I know you miss this so much ( trying a little irony here ) , but I feel like I have to turn your attention to the latest update of Iranian activity in Iraq .
Just three days after the groundbreaking talks between Iranian officials and U.S. diplomats on Iraqi security , coalition forces ( which is code for TF 145 ) and Iraqi troops nabbed a few more bad guys tied to the Iranian support network for the insurgencyand al Qaeda .
I know there are a lot of readers here who strongly dispute the Iranian connection with Iraq and see it as impossible for a Shiite government to collaborate with the Sunni AQ movement .
But at the very least , when more smoking gun evidence does present itself , the U.S. cant be accused of ignoring the threat .
From MNFI :
Iraqi and Coalition Forces detained two individuals in Sadr City during the first raid .
They are believed to be members of the secret cell terrorist network known for facilitating the transport of weapons and explosively formed penetrators , or EFPs , from Iran to Iraq , as well as bringing militants from Iraq to Iran for terrorist training .
Intelligence reports indicate one of the targeted individuals detained during the operation is suspected of providing facilitation and logistic support for trafficking weapons used in operations against Coalition Forces .
In a separate raid in Khanaqin , Coalition Forces captured a suspected liaison to al - Qaeda in Iraq senior leaders , who assists in the movement of information and documents from al - Qaeda in Iraq leadership in Baghdad to al - Qaeda senior leaders in Iran .
And at todays briefing with coalition commander , Gen. Ray Odierno , there was no flexibility on the claim of Iranian support of the violence :
We still see interference by Iran here in Iraqthey are shipping weapons , money and supplying training for insurgents in Iran .
But he did seem conciliatory toward Syria .
While not denying the continuing flow of insurgents through Syria , Odierno is open to dialogue .
Does he see an opening that the rest of us ( skeptics ) might be missing ?
I think we need to reach out to them and to talk to them

Database myths and legends ( Part 7 ) In this series we 're looking at the myths and legends of the database world ; some turn out to be true , others false .
This myth is about why we use OLAP .
If you follow the Inmon model , you use a relational data warehouse for flexibility and OLAP cubes in the data marts for the speed .
On the other hand , if you follow Kimball , you simply use OLAP in the core data warehouse .
Either way , OLAP is where you get the incredible query response time that we need for a good Business Intelligence system .
So OLAP is all about speed .
OK , let 's get back to basics for a moment .
OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing , was originally very well defined , and is a surprisingly new term .
It first appeared a mere 14 years ago , in a paper entitled Providing OLAP to User - Analysts : An IT Mandate by E F Codd , S B Codd and C T Salley , ComputerWorld , July 26 1993 .
And yes , E F Codd is the Ted Codd , the Father of the relational database .
After the paper was published it gained some notoriety because Codd had undertaken consulting work for Arbour Software ( now Hyperion ) .
This was unfortunate because the paper actively discussed one of Arbour 's products , Essbase .
In the end , Computerworld took the unusual step of retracting the article ; nevertheless this paper clearly marks the start of the term 's use .
A copy is available on line from Hyperion here .
The paper defines 12 rules for evaluating OLAP products which are :
Multi-dimensional conceptual view Transparency Accessibility Consistent reporting performance Client - server architecture Generic dimensionality Dynamic sparse matrix handling Multi-user support Unrestricted cross-dimensional operations Intuitive data manipulation Flexible reporting Unlimited dimensions and aggregation levels
While Codd never directly says OLAP systems should be fast , he is clearly very interested in their performance ( see rule 4 ) .
In addition , almost all OLAP systems do provide a phenomenal increase in performance over relational systems .
So we can argue from this that the myth is true : OLAP is about performance .
But it is clear from reading the paper that Codd also sees the multi-dimensional component of OLAP as essential .
Early on in the paper he says : " This ... multi-dimensional conceptual view appears to be the way most business persons naturally view their enterprise . "
And , as you can see , four of the 12 rules directly refer to dimensions , so OLAP is also about the way users think about , and are allowed to visualise , their data .
We know that speed is important to OLAP , but exactly how important is this multi-dimensional aspect ?
One easy test of the importance of a property to the definition of an object is to imagine the object minus that property .
Does it remain essentially the same object without the property or does the loss turn it into something else ?
Is a robin without a red breast still a robin ?
Are Christians who loses their faith still Christians ?
Is OLAP without multi-dimensionality still OLAP ?
Well , imagine a relational data warehouse that is magically very , very fast .
Users can perform any query they like against it and expect a response time of one second .
Would this still be OLAP ?
We can be certain that the answer here is " no " for the simple reason that there is no need for a new term like OLAP to describe this ; what we have here is simply a very fast relational database .
Apart from the speed , it will suffer all the joys and pains of normal relational databases .
It will be very flexible ( it puts no constraints on the queries that can be posed ) but the users will still find it very difficult to query because , in order to formulate the query , they have to understand the data structure .
Experience suggests that business users find this very difficult .
So , OLAP without the multi-dimensional structure is n't OLAP .
This is true in the real world of 2007 and it was also true in Codd 's original definition of OLAP .
In the paper he says : " OLAP is the name given to the dynamic enterprise analysis required to create , manipulate , animate , and synthesise information from exegetical , contemplative , and formulaic data analysis models . "
In other words , OLAP is more about the data model than the speed .
The problem with the myth is that by focusing on speed it loses sight of what we are trying to achieve in Business Intelligence ( of which OLAP is a subset ) .
We are trying to find information in a mass of data .
Speed alone ( while eminently desirable ) does not provide this ; we also need to layer a framework over the data ( Codd 's multi- dimensional conceptual view ) to provide an interpretation that users can understand .
So , the myth is busted .
OLAP certainly is about speed but it is n't all about speed .
There is much more to analysis than rows per second .
Incidentally , this focus within OLAP on the way in which we think about and view the data is highly relevant to some of the recent discussions on The Register about novel approaches to business intelligence .
Take , for example , Kognitio's WX2 .
Kognitio has developed technology that allows very rapid access to relational data ( just like the example data warehouse discussed above ) .
The technology is fascinating and provides us with another tool that we can add to our armoury of techniques .
It is a great solution for certain classes of problem .
But , since it does n't provide the multi-dimensional conceptual view it can never be considered as a substitute for OLAP .
And , as a final point , albino robins do exist in nature and are still considered to be robins .
As for the non-ecumenical question ; that is probably better left to Father Ted . ®
President Bush joined the debate on Aug. 2 , telling reporters that both evolution and the theory of intelligent design should be taught in schools " so people can understand what the debate is about . "
Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee , the Republican leader , took the same position a few weeks later .
Intelligent design , a descendant of creationism , is the belief that life is so intricate that only a supreme being could have designed it .
The poll showed 41 percent of respondents wanted parents to have the primary say over how evolution is taught , compared with 28 percent who said teachers and scientists should decide and 21 percent who said school boards should .
Asked whether they believed creationism should be taught instead of evolution , 38 percent were in favor , and 49 percent were opposed .
More of those who believe in creationism said they were " very certain " of their views ( 63 percent ) , compared with those who believe in evolution ( 32 percent ) .
The poll also asked about religion and politics , government financing of religious charities , and gay men and lesbians in the military .
Most of these questions were asked of a smaller pool of 1,000 respondents , and the margin of error was 2.5 percentage points , Pew researchers said .
The public 's impression of the Democratic Party has changed in the last year , the survey found .
Only 29 percent of respondents said they viewed Democrats as being " friendly toward religion , " down from 40 percent in August of 2004 .
Meanwhile , 55 percent said the Republican Party was friendly toward religion .
Luis E. Lugo , the director of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , said : " I think this is a continuation of the Republican Party 's very successful use of the values issue in the 2004 election , and the Democrats not being able up until now to answer that successfully .
Some of the more visible leaders , such as Howard Dean and others , have reinforced that image of a secular party .
Of course , if you look at the Democratic Party , there 's a large religious constituency there . "

Interesting voting protocol from Ron Rivest :
Abstract :
We present a new paper - based voting method with attractive security properties .
Not only can each voter verify that her vote is recorded as she intended , but she gets a “ receipt ” that she can take home that can be used later to verify that her vote is actually included in the final tally .
Her receipt , however , does not allow her to prove to anyone else how she voted .
The new voting system is in some ways similar to recent cryptographic voting system proposals , but it achieves very nearly the same objectives without using any cryptography at all .
Its principles are simple and easy to understand .
In this “ ThreeBallot ” voting system , each voter casts three paper ballots ( with certain restrictions on how they may be filled out , so the tallying works ) .
These paper ballots are of course “ voter - verifiable . ”
All ballots cast are scanned and published on a web site , so anyone may correctly compute the election result .
A voter receives a copy of one of her ballots as her “ receipt , ” which she may take home .
Only the voter knows which ballot she copied for her receipt .
The voter is unable to use her receipt to prove how she voted or to sell her vote , as the receipt does n’t reveal how she voted .
A voter can check that the web site contains a ballot matching her receipt .
Deletion or modification of ballots is thus detectable ; so the integrity of the election is verifiable .
The method can be implemented in a quite practical manner , although further refinements to improve usability would be nice .
You may have heard about Wallstrip , the video blog that I ’ve railed against in the past for its lack of originality and its poor management is in the news again .
Last week they were in the NY Intelligencier with one of the worst reviews in new media history .
I did n’t comment on this article to spare Howard Lindzon the shame .
In the past I ’ve questioned the leadership of Howard Lindzon as a new media producer as he often takes cheap shots and does things I ’ve learned the hard way just do n’t work .
Yes , I used to be an uber snarky attack blogger .
In fact I once had an ongoing feud with Loren Feldman , a New York City based ‘ snobishly snarky video producer ’ who is really hilarious .
Recently , in a comment thread Howard called Loren Feldman , “ a putz and a small time thief “ .
Loren and I are good friends and the comment thread got rather heated as Howard took off on some rabid trail of anger lashing out at good people .
Including some of my best friends in the industry .
I ’m no lawyer but I think he crossed some lines , and possibly his intent was to cause harm towards Loren Feldman , and Podtech .
net a company Loren works for .
Here ’s another case when competion gets ugly .
In school we would say , Howard be a good sport .
But this is the real world , and now he faces a tough scathing legal battle that does n’t look good for Wallstrip , or for Fred Wilson , an investor in the startup video company .
Loren has a video up that shares a bit more details on what ’s going on :
Public Disclosure : Howard Lindzon was banned from publishing comments at 901 am after starting fights and making immoral comments toward 901 am staffers .

When people discover a problem with their credit score , they often act rashly , doing things that seem as though they would improve your credit , but actually damage a credit score .
Before we get into the ten mistakes to avoid , let ’s first look at what makes up one ’s credit score , as defined by Fair Isaac :
Although the exact formulas for calculating credit scores are closely guarded secrets , Fair Isaac has disclosed the following components and the approximate weighted contribution of each : 35 % , - punctuality of payment in the past ( only includes payments later than 30 days past due )
30 % – the amount of debt , expressed as the ratio of current revolving debt ( credit card balances , etc. ) to total available revolving credit ( credit limits )
15 % – length of credit history
10 % – types of credit used ( installment , revolving , consumer finance )
10 % – recent search for credit and / or amount of credit obtained recently
Mistake # 1 : Cancelling old credit cards .
15 % of your credit score comes from the length of your credit history .
Thus , cancelling your oldest credit card can often be a mistake .
Also , if you have balances on other cards , cancelling an old credit card can also worsen your debt ratio , which makes up 30 % of your score .
If you do n’t have other sources of credit that are older than seven years , you should not cancel your oldest credit card .
Mistake # 2 : Staying current on “ most ” of your cards .
35 % of your score focuses on punctuality of payment , with only payments that are more than thirty days late affecting your score .
If you ’re going to be late on any cards , make up that payment before it ’s thirty days late .
Do n’t keep up with all but one or two of your cards and let those go later and later ; instead , juggle the cards a bit if you have to , but make sure you are not too late on any one card .
Mistake # 3 : Having too many open lines of credit .
10 % of your score comes from the types of credit used .
If you have a lot of sources of revolving credit ( i.e. , credit cards ) , you can be seen as a credit risk because you have the potential of racking up a lot of debt very quickly .
Do n’t open store credit cards just to get a discount , and if you have any recent store cards , cancel them once they ’re paid off .
Mistake # 4 : Maxing out your cards .
30 % of your score comes from the ratio of your credit card debt and your credit limits .
Thus , if all of your cards are maxed out , your credit score is suffering even if you ’re keeping up with the payments .
Instead of charging and buying more and more , focus on paying down the cards with extra payments .
Mistake # 5 : Avoiding loans and debts .
In the eyes of your credit report , no debt is effectively bad debt .
If you ’re a credit card teetotaler , you should still consider getting one and making an occasional purchase with it .
I have a friend who has one credit card which is associated with his gas station chain of choice .
He uses it just for gas purchases , racks up discounts on it , pays it off in full each month , and it helps him maintain a solid credit score in case he needs a loan .
Mistake # 6 : Requesting a credit limit reduction .
Some people believe that they have too much credit and that they ’re better off with a credit limit reduction .
In fact , the only significant effect a limit reduction has on your credit score is a negative effect on your debt ratio .
Only get a limit reduction if it has a huge psychological value for you ; otherwise , it will hurt your credit score .
Mistake # 7 : Utilizing the first credit counseling service you hear about .
Quite often , the ones that advertise the most are the ones that do the shoddiest job .
Use the FTC ’s advice and find a reputable credit counseling service in your area .
Call several of them from the yellow pages and ask the questions from the FTC page to find ones that seem legitimate , then check with the Better Business Bureau before moving forward .
Remember , your credit score will affect many of your financial moves for years , so do n’t skimp out on your research if you ’re thinking of using a counseling service .
Mistake # 8 : Declaring bankruptcy .
Many people go forward with bankruptcy because they believe it ’s the only way out .
Instead of taking such a drastic measure , seek counseling first with one of the more legitimate sources mentioned above .
Bankruptcy can really decimate your credit score for a very long time .
Quite often , there are better solutions , such as negotiating with creditors and so forth .
Mistake # 9 : Practicing credit card arbitrage .
This game can seriously damage your credit score if you ’re not an expert .
Shy away unless you ’re financially stable and know exactly what you ’re doing ; if you make a mis-step , your credit score could easily be demolished .
Mistake # 10 : Never checking your credit report .
Most people who behave well with their credit just assume that their credit is fine , but sometimes incorrect things can show up on your report .
Visit annualcreditreport.com to get the free report that the United States government guarantees you from the three major agencies .
Do n’t go to freecreditreport.com ; it ’s a rip - off .
In a time when you 're not even allowed to say the word " bomb " in an airport ( hey , it 's for good reason ) , it 's got to be like , really freaking embarrassing to have to run up the jetway at full speed , shoving other passengers out of the way as your flaming laptop explodes on the ground .
( Sound familiar ? )
According to an eyewitness report on the Awful Forums , passersby stared aghast or fled crying terrorist , the ThinkPad ( which was quoted to be an IBM , not a Lenovo ) apparently had a number of death throes as the fire went through various phases , until eventually a United employee busted out the fire extinguisher and laid the laptop to rest .
Apparently the machine 's owner already checked its battery against the recalls and it was not listed -- and why would it be ?
IBM and Lenovo are n't flagged for bad batteries -- yet .
( Sony , we 're looking your direction . )
But the coup de grâce at LAX : onlookers apparently mumbling that " too many viruses on your computer " can lead to this horrendous fate .
How true , indeed .

The return of the Internet Tablet
Nokia N800 Internet Tablet
Manufacturer : Nokia ( product page )
Price : $ 399.99 ( shop for this item )
Many a geek was excited when Nokia announced the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet in late 2005 .
Its form factor , functionality , and price indicated to me that my dream device had arrived .
When I finally purchased one and reviewed it , my dreams were dashed .
While attractive , the Nokia 770 was underpowered , leading to sluggish performance .
The menu navigation was not thought out well , and some of the applications felt unfinished .
Nokia released an OS update — Internet Tablet OS 2006 — in mid-2006 that addressed some of the 770's problems while adding a new on - screen thumb keyboard .
Unfortunately , no amount of code optimization was able to cover up the slow CPU and meager RAM .
With little advance notice , Nokia released the 770's successor at the beginning of 2007 , the Nokia N800 .
Is it powerful enough to rekindle the fires of gadget lust or will it be another heartbreaker ?
Changes
The Nokia N800 retains the same size and form factor as the 770 , but in a slightly smaller package .
It also costs $ 40 more .
The button layout is roughly the same , with the scrollpad , back , menu , and home buttons all on the front .
The power button has been relocated to the top of the unit next to the zoom in , zoom out , and full screen mode buttons .
The right side has the headphone and power adapter jacks along with the stylus .
On the right side is the new VGA camera for video chatting ( more on that later ) .
The bottom features an SD card slot .
That slot is covered by the stand , which is now integrated into the device .
Nokia 's focus on good design is apparent with the N800 , and it's a sexy - looking little gadget .
Inside , the N800 is a slightly different beast than its predecessor .
The 250MHz TI 1710 OMAP CPU has been replaced with another ARM processor , the TI OMAP 2420 , which is clocked at 330MHz .
There 's now 128MB of SDRAM included along with an additional 256MB of Flash RAM .
Expandability has more than doubled over the 770 with the addition of a second memory card slot capable of handling SD , MicroSD , MiniSD , MMC , and the RS - MMC cards used in the 770 .
Like the 770 , the N800 runs the Debian - based Internet Tablet OS , in this case , Internet Tablet OS 2007 .
The Nokia N800 Internet Tablet
Nokia has chosen a slightly different design aesthetic with the N800 , one which I think enhances the look of the device .
The front bezel is now metallic with a speaker grille covering the bottom half of the bezel .
The buttons on the front have been placed closer together , but are still very easy to use .
The whole package weighs in at 7.5oz .
Top view with the stylus .
Power button is on the left with the zoom and full - screen buttons to the right
The bottom of the N800 with the SD slot .
The handle covers the slot when closed
The back of the N800 with the cover removed .
The included 128MB miniSD is installed

The letter was brought from Saddam Hussein 's jail to Jordan
The letter was delivered by the International Committee of the Red Cross , which says it is genuine .
Saddam Hussein is in jail at a secret location as he awaits trial .
" I and my family offer ourselves as a sacrifice for this nation , including dear Palestine and our steadfast , beloved , and wretched Iraq , " he writes .
The ICRC collected the message ...
It was censored by the detaining authorities before being handed over to the ICRC for distribution
Rana Sidani
ICRC spokeswoman
" Life without faith , love and the inherited traditions of our nation is destruction .
" He who sacrifices his property and soul for his nation is but doing a little because this nation deserves much to be done . "
He ends the letter : " Long live Palestine .
Love your nation . "
The letter was taken first to a friend of the former president - who does not want to be identified - before being published in Ad- Dustour and al - Arab al - Yawm newspapers .
Saddam Hussein could be facing the death penalty
" The ICRC has confirmed the authenticity of the message published in the Jordanian media , " said Rana Sidani , spokeswoman for the ICRC's Iraq delegation in Amman .
" The ICRC collected the message .
It was censored by the detaining authorities before being handed over to the ICRC for distribution . "
The letter is believed to be the first sent by the former president to someone outside his family since he was captured by US forces 18 months ago .
Saddam Hussein is facing trial before a special tribunal set up for the purpose .
He could face the death penalty .
He is accused over a 1982 massacre of Shia Muslims , although other charges are expected to follow .

Encoding Divination
divine ( verb ) -- 1 . To know by inspiration , intuition , or reflection .
2 . To guess .
Some of you may remember the days of computing past when seven - bit ASCII and green - on - black terminals were good enough for everyone .
They had to be good enough , because that was all that was available .
( Of course , back in my day we only had one bit to work with , and it was always zero , and our terminals were black - on - black , but you did n't hear us complaining about it , not like kids these days , etc. etc . )
Thankfully the seven - bit ASCII limitation is long gone , and we live in the bright , shiny Unicode present .
The Eighth Bit ... and Beyond !
That brings up the question of how all of those non-ASCII characters should be represented bytewise , which is where encodings come in .
A document fetched via the Web falls under the purview of both the HTTP specification and the specification of the language in which the document is written ( usually HTML , XHTML or XML ) .
Not only is there more than one spec involved , each offers at least one unique way to decide what a document 's encoding is .
It 's no surprise , then , that it is n't a simple process .
It involves a little inspiration , intuition , reflection , and , yes , guesswork .
The flowchart below describes how Nikita divines the encoding of a Web document .
You can click on any white shape ( the diamonds and boxes ) to learn more about that step .
First , some terminology : what I call an encoding is also called a character set .
Some of the specifications that I quote use the latter term .
Also , when I say the HTTP spec I am referring to both HTTP 1.0 ( RFC 1945 ) and HTTP 1.1 ( RFC 2616 ) .
They do n't differ on the subject of encodings , so I can safely lump them together .
This flowchart is also available as a PDF in both
This flowchart is also available as a PDF in both US Letter and A4 format I created the flowchart and PDFs with a terrific program called OmniGraffle .
Media Type
The HTTP Content - Type header defines both the media type and the charset ( encoding ) .
A typical Content - Type header looks like this : Content - Type : text / html ; charset=UTF -8 ; The " charset " portion is optional and is often not present .
Encoding / Charset
As described above , the charset can be specified in the HTTP Content - Type header .
It is optional there , and the HTTP 1.1 spec is very clear about what to do when the charset is missing :
When no explicit charset parameter is provided by the sender , media subtypes of the " text " type are defined to have a default charset value of " ISO - 8859 - 1 " when received via HTTP .
Data in character sets other than " ISO - 8859 - 1 " or its subsets MUST be labeled with an appropriate charset value .
The HTTP 1.0 spec says the same .
The HTML 4.01 specification passes harsh judgement on this portion of the HTTP spec .
It says , The HTTP protocol ( [ RFC2616 ] , section 3.7.1 ) mentions ISO - 8859 - 1 as a default character encoding when the " charset " parameter is absent from the " Content - Type " header field .
In practice , this recommendation has proved useless because some servers do n't allow a " charset " parameter to be sent , and others may not be configured to send the parameter .
Therefore , user agents must not assume any default value for the " charset " parameter .
( emphasis mine )
In practice , when the encoding is n't specified most browsers either guess ( using their own encoding diviniation tricks ) or default to win-1252 which is a superset of ISO - 8859 - 1 .
Since Nikita 's goal is to help you to comply with published specs , she sticks with the HTTP - specified default of ISO - 8859 - 1. BOM ( Byte Order Mark ) A BOM is a control character placed at the absolute beginning of a file that can give user agents a clue as to the document 's encoding .
The BOM is cleverly defined to be inoffensive to most software that does n't make a special effort to handle it , but some programs will still complain or get confused when reading files with a BOM .
One advantage of using BOMs is that they 're still informative even when the file is opened in a non-HTTP context ( for instance , by a text editor ) .
The HTML 4.01 specification mentions BOMs for UTF - 16 - encoded documents in section 5.2.1 .
But it ignores them in section 5.2.2 where it lists a user agent 's priorities for determining the character encoding .
In fact , I can't find any spec that says whether or not a BOM trumps a charset specified in a META http - equiv statement , so my description of the BOM as the second - most authoritative source for the encoding is driven by practical issues and not by a spec .
Content - Type specified in a META http-equiv
The HTML spec makes provisions for specifying HTTP headers inside HTML documents via a META http -equiv element .
In practice , most user agents will read a document 's encoding from a META http - equiv even though support for reading other faux headers specified via META http - equiv is weak .
Here 's an example of this technique : < meta http-equiv= " content - type " content = " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " >
The tricky part to reading the encoding from the document is that the user agent has to know the document 's encoding in order to read it .
This seeming Catch - 22 is mitigated by the fact that the most commonly used encodings are in the ASCII family ( see the discussion of encoding families below ) , so user agents can decode the file piece by piece with ISO - 8859 - 1 or something similar and hope for the best .
Once the user agent finds the META http -equiv , it can stop guessing and decode the file using the correct encoding .
This implies that specifying a non-ASCII based encoding ( such as UTF - 16 or EBCDIC ) via this technique is risky because it relies on the user agents being able to guess the correct encoding in order to be able to parse the document .
Encoding families
An encoding family is a group of encodings which map ASCII characters to the same values using the same per-character width ( e.g. single byte versus double byte ) .
The most familiar encoding family for most of us is the ASCII family , which includes US - ASCII , UTF - 8 , ISO - 8859-1 , ISO - 8859 -2...ISO -8859 -15 , Win-1252 , KOI - 8 , Shift - JIS , and more .
All of these encodings represent the ASCII character set with bytes 0x00 - 0x7 f .
Another family is one I 'll call UTF - 16BE after its most popular member .
According to the W3C , big-endian ISO - 10646- UCS - 2 is also a member of this family .
A third family is EBCDIC , which has a number of different flavors .
All told , there are eight different encoding families , which I further categorize into four superfamilies : Superfamily ASCII ASCII ( includes US - ASCII , UTF - 8 , ISO - 8859-* , Win -1252 , KOI - 8 , Shift - JIS and more )
Superfamily UTF - 32 a.k.a. ucs - 4 UTF - 32be UTF - 32le UTF - 32-2143 ( unusual byte order ) UTF - 32-3412 ( unusual byte order )
Superfamily UTF - 16 UTF - 16be ( includes big-endian ISO - 10646-UCS
-2 ) UTF - 16le ( includes little - endian ISO - 10646-UCS -2 )
Superfamily EBCDIC EBCDIC ( several flavors )
XML files are bound by rules that make it possible to ( sometimes ) divine the encoding by yet another method that makes use of these encoding families .
XML files that contain a declaration must start with the characters < ?xml .
Because these five characters have a different representation in each of the encoding families described above , they serve as a low - quality BOM .
A user agent that wants to parse such a file looks for bytes that represent " < ?xml " in each possible representation .
Once found , this gives enough of a clue to process the first line of the XML file which may contain an exact encoding declaration .
Section F of the XML spec describes the low - quality BOM .
Section F's official title Autodetection of Character Encodings conveys much more confidence than the name of its anchor : " sec- guessing " .
The XML encoding
The encoding of an XML document is often declared at the beginning of the file as defined in the XML specification section about text declaration .
Note : the fact that text / xml documents default to US - ASCII surprises a lot of people ( including me ) , but the HTTP spec is very clear about it .

My name is Anakin Skywalker .
I was born forty - nine years ago , less a day .
I was born a slave , as billions are born slaves .
When I was a child I did not immediately imagine that I deserved freedom , for this was not my mother 's attitude .
Suffering was to be endured .
She admitted a patient hope for less cruel masters , when we were between them .
She taught that if freedom was in our destinies , fate would find us .
We were not starved , and were seldom beaten .
I did n't think it was so bad .
My mother Shmi and I looked out for one another .
When the loathsome Gardulla the Hutt lost us to Watto the junk - dealer I got my first chance to take machines apart and put them back together , and it was amazing .
The more I fixed things the more things Watto gave me to fix .
My mother was also profitable .
It was a happy relationship that more than halfway resembled a family , much like the one Watto had lost years before on Toydaria .
Everything changed after the Mandalorian came .
With a cold manner he made his cruel desires plain .
My mother refused him .
Watto backed her up and the Mandalorian attacked him , casting him about the shop like a sack of meal .
He could not protect her .
I ran out and stuck a knife in the Mandalorian 's thigh .
He struck back at me savagely .
I lay dazed in the corner as he laughed and turned on my mother .
I could not protect her .
I was six .
That is when the dreams began , in which I could fix the mechanisms of life as easily as I could machines .
At night I saw an elaborate tapestry of iridescent threads that connected all things to all others , backwards and forwards through time forever .
To play a song upon its fibres required only the gentlest flexing of my mind , the resonating harmonies describing new patterns in the network of connection that in turn rippled through to the arrangement of real things .
The dreams were incredible .
Like flying .
Like being free .
One night near Boonta Eve I was working to exhaustion to repair Watto 's sponsored racer in time for the next day 's qualifier .
I was so tired I began to dream with my eyes open .
I could see the strands that bound all things with my waking vision , swimming and forking in reaction to my thoughts and movements .
Suddenly the solution to a vexing problem with the starboard thruster was as clear as day -- it was obvious , when one could read between the lines .
And then I dreamed that I wielded a sword of fire , and that I slay any enemy that stood in my path .
I dreamed I was a warrior , and that I could protect
It was better than flying .
I was a hero .
I mentioned the dreams idly to my mother one day .
To my surprise she took the matter very seriously .
" Anakin , " she said , touching my shoulders and looking into my eyes , " has anyone ever told you about the Jedi ?
" I shook my head .
" What 's a Jedi ? " " They are warrior - monks from the Republic .
Their weapons are laser - swords . " " Just like in my dream ! " " Just like in your dream , " she echoed .
" You are a very special boy , Anakin , and I believe that the Force speaks through you . " " What 's the Force ?
" She smiled and closed her eyes for a moment , asking me to do the same .
I closed my eyes .
She said , " Anakin , in the quietest night , without sand - crickets or womp - rats , when the temperature is so perfect you can't even feel your blanket , and everything is still , and your mind is quiet ... even if you seal out every part of the world you feel -- there is still something there . " " Yes , " I whispered .
" That is the Force , Anakin , " she said , putting her hand on my heart .
" And it will never leave you .
It is always there for us .
It is a part of being alive .
" That was a long , long time ago .
It is she , Shmi Skywalker , who haunts my thoughts tonight as I stare out over the night forest of Endor 's moon .
I miss her .
But in some ways she is alive again , for I saw her spectre in my son's eyes , and heard it in his voice .
It was a like physical blow .
Galaxy save me .
My son said , " I know there is good in you .
The Emperor has n't driven it from you fully .
That was why you could n't destroy me , that 's why you wo n't bring me to your Emperor now .
"
He looked out into the forest spread out beneath the landing platform , his back to me .
I ignited his light - sabre , its green glow filling the corridor .
Smooth action , nice gyroscopic response .
I always end up fiddling around with gadgets whenever somebody says something that makes me feel uncomfortable .
" I see you have constructed a new light - sabre , " I said , retracting the blade and turning the handle over in my hands .
" Your skills are complete .
Indeed you are powerful as the Emperor has foreseen .
" I turned away then , my feelings threatening my composure and the stability of my left leg .
I felt Luke 's mind open to my own , reading my heart in a rush of communication I was too slow to interrupt .
His thoughts were flavoured like mine , and my defenses could not discern them .
His mind is mine .
" Comeme , " he implored suddenly .
Through the fabric of the Force I could feel him reaching out to me , his hand open .
It just about broke my heart .
Only Shmi Skywalker knew love that pure , and I felt her spirit stir within him to my horror and shame .
I took hold of the railing , fearing I would fall .
And then I felt the slithering tentacles of Darth Sidious ' mind descend upon my consciousness , encircling my wounded heart and cooling it .
A voice in my thoughts asked me what destiny of chaos I would have the galaxy face if not for the strength of the enduring New Order .
My spirit suffused with a dark light , and my leg began to feel normal again .
I turned around to face my son .
" You do n't understand the power of the dark side .
Iobey my master .
" Luke made his appeal again , stepping up to me and searching my lenses with his eyes .
" I feel the conflict with you , let go of your hate !
" Poor fool , if only he knew .
Innocent as a junior temple youngling , he parroted the dead preachings of an extinct order of loveless charlatans .
If only the difference between dark and light were so simple as not being afraid .
He cannot conceive of the fear he must know if he is to face the burden of the true Force .
It is too late for me .
My hour has come and gone .
Words would gain us nothing .
And I could stand the torment of his gaze no longer .
I ordered Skywalker be flown up to the Death Star without further delay .
" ... My father is truly dead , " said my son as the lift closed .
My leg drooped and I stepped over to the railing again , facing my own dim reflection in the windows .
My throat filled with bile as I considered that I had just lost the faith of the one person in this universe who would forgive me , and whose love could redeem me .
I have just closed the door on my salvation ... My name is Anakin Skywalker , and I am responsible for the death of my mother , because I broke our bond to pursue my ambition .
I am responsible for the death of my wife , the mother of my child , the only woman strong enough and smart enough to win my faith .
I am responsible for the death of Jedi Master Obi-wan Kenobi , who once tried to show me the real meaning of friendship and loyalty .
And then there was Qui -gon Jinn who could have been like the father I never had , but Palpatine stole him from me .
Palpatine !
I think I have always hated him , channeling my jealousy at his power and dignity into a sick kind of devotion .
I wanted him to love me , but he is not really a man with a heart -- whatever daemon rules him has its tonsils deep in the darkest layers of this galaxy .
I know now that my master , Darth Sidious the Emperor Palpatine , means to betray the Sith and subvert the prophecy .
He means to replace me with my son as his prodigal servant .
So armed he means to rule the stars himself , forever .
This job has a glass ceiling .
I should never have been born .
Without me , Palpatine would be lost .
I was essential .
But now I am nothing .
My very life inside this mechanized mockery of a body relies on the raw power of the dark side that is focused through him .
I could not be without his blessing .
And his blessing fails , so I go to join Tyrannus .
I was not strong enough .
I have failed everyone ....
And yet , there is my son with Shmi in his eyes -- a product of love , before the storm .
He is no Jedi , for his passion blows too hot , but perhaps he is not Sith , either .
He is an instrument of change .
He is the catalyst at the centre , the fulcrum on which pivot fates .
To see him is to be blinded by the glory of the Force that orbits him like living netting .
My meditation was interrupted by the scintillating spirit of Qui - gon Jinn appearing at my elbow .
" Anakin , " he called , his voice sounding far away .
" Take heart : the prophecy is fulfilled on the morrow . " " But how ? " I asked , shaking my head .
" How can that be ?
What can I do ? " Qui - gon 's eyes sparkled .
" You will make the right decision , when the choice lies before you . " " Sidious must die , but I can not slay him .
And Luke can not hope to have enough power to do so himself . " " There are different kinds of power , " Qui - gon pointed out .
" You are the Son of Suns .
Nothing can change that , Ani .
Just because you cannot see the path does not mean it is not beneath your feet .
" And with that he faded away , leaving me alone .
The world crept back in .
First crickets , then the buzzing lights of the corridor , the call of a raptor , the rustling leaves .
The living Force undulated around me , my breath carried away to mix with the wind .
I drank deep .
One must never forget to taste the present , the fleeting , sweetest moment you can ever know no matter how many adventures you pursue .
There is nothing like the now , to cleanse you .
Qui -gon was right .
My mother was , too .
The Force has shaped this life of mine , from birth to this holy now .
Every turn in the path has been an instruction in a series of lessons designed to make me the monster I am , to breed my unwilling heart for whatever lies ahead tomorrow .
Qui - gon said I would have a choice .
I cannot fathom it but I have faith .
If he 's right , I need nota slave .
The sun is rising .
Morning birds are singing .
The mist is burning off the trees .
I have already delayed too long .
I must join my son on the Death Star , and bring him before my master .
Come what may .
And so , dear reader , I must bid you adieu .
You have been along with me for much , but you cannot join me on this final journey .
I go now to meet my destiny .

The Magellanic Clouds are irregular dwarf galaxies
Enlarge Image
Astronomers say the Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be gravitationally bound to our galaxy .
If the clouds were satellites of our galaxy , the Milky Way would contain twice as much mass as is thought .
Details of the research were presented at the 209th meeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) in Seattle .
Perhaps they are travellers , just passing through our cosmic neighbourhood
Nitya Kallivayalil , Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
Using the Hubble Space Telescope , a team of astronomers made what it says are the most precise measurements yet of the galaxies ' three - dimensional velocities .
" We found that the velocities of the [ Magellanic Clouds ] are unexpectedly large - almost twice those previously thought , " said co-researcher Nitya Kallivayalil , from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
" Radial velocities " indicate how fast the objects are moving directly towards or away from us .
Precise measurements
These properties are well known for the Magellanic Clouds , and relatively easy to measure .
More difficult to determine are the " proper motions " of the galaxies - their actual motion across the sky ( not towards or away from the Earth ) .
This requires astronomers to take extraordinarily precise measurements over several years .
Both proper motion and radial velocities must be known to calculate the true 3D velocities of the galaxies .
Dr Kallivayalil and her colleagues made two sets of observations two years apart using Hubble .
They calculated precise proper motions for the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds .
Then , they combined the proper motions with the radial velocities .
Mass discrepancy
The researchers say there are two possible explanations for the unexpectedly high 3D velocities of the dwarf galaxies .
The Milky Way could be twice as massive as previously thought : this excess mass , pulling on the clouds , would be required to keep them gravitationally bound .
Alternatively , the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds might not be bound to our galaxy after all .
If previous calculations of the Milky Way 's mass are correct , it does not possess enough mass to hold on to its companions .
In a few billion years , they will escape the clutches of our galaxy .
" The Magellanic Clouds may not be true companions of the Milky Way , " Dr Kallivayalil said .
" Perhaps they are travellers , just passing through our cosmic neighbourhood . "
Furthermore , the team 's measurements suggest the clouds may not be bound to each other .
Their velocities relative to one another are unexpectedly high .
This observation may explain why the two galaxies did not merge long ago .
Homeopathy : The Test - transcript
NARRATOR ( NEIL PEARSON ) : This week Horizon is doing something completely different .
For the first time we are conducting our own experiment .
We are testing a form of medicine which could transform the world .
Should the results be positive this man will have to give us $ 1 m .
JAMES RANDI ( Paranormal Investigator ) :
Do the test , prove that it works and win a million dollars .
NARRATOR : But if the results are negative then millions of people , including some of the most famous and influential in the world , may have been wasting their money .
The events that would lead to Horizon 's million dollar challenge began with Professor Madeleine Ennis , a scientist who may have found the impossible .
PROF .
MADELEINE ENNIS ( Queen 's University , Belfast ) : I was incredibly surprised and really had great feelings of disbelief .
NARRATOR : Her work concerns a type of medicine which defies the laws of science .
WALTER STEWART ( Research Chemist ) : If Madeleine Ennis turns out to be right it means that science has missed a huge chunk of something .
NARRATOR : She has reawakened one of the most bitter controversies of recent years .
PROF .
BOB PARK ( University of Maryland ) : Madeleine Ennis 's experiments can not be right .
I mean it 's , they 're , they 're , preposterous .
MADELEINE ENNIS : I have no explanation for what happened .
However , this is science .
If we knew the answers to the questions we would n't bother doing the experiments .
NARRATOR : It 's all about something you can find on every high street in Britain : homeopathy .
Homeopathy is n't some wacky , fringe belief .
It 's over 200 years old and is used by millions of people , including Presidents and pop stars .
It 's even credited with helping David Beckham get over his foot injury and the Royals have been keen users since the days of Queen Victoria , but it 's also a scientific puzzle .
What makes it so mysterious is its two guiding principles , formulated in the 18th century .
The first principle is that to find a cure you look for a substance that actually causes the symptoms you 're suffering from .
It 's the principle that like cures like .
DR PETER FISHER ( Homeopath to The Queen ) :
For instance in colds and hay fever something we often use is allium cepa which is onion and of course we all know the effects of chopping an onion , you know the sore streaming eyes , streaming nose , sneezing and so we would use allium cepa , onion , for a cold with similar sorts of features .
NARRATOR : This theory that like cures like led to thousands of different substances being used , some of them truly bizarre .
DR LIONEL MILGROM ( Homeopath ) :
In principle you can make a homeopathic remedy out of absolutely anything that 's plant .
PETER FISHER : Deadly nightshade .
LIONEL MILGROM : Animal .
PETER FISHER : Snake venom .
LIONEL MILGROM : Mineral .
PETER FISHER : Calcium carbonate , which is of course chalk .
LIONEL MILGROM : Disease product .
PETER FISHER : Tuberculous gland of a cow .
LIONEL MILGROM : Radiation .
NARRATOR : But then homeopaths found that many of these substances were poisonous , so they started to dilute them .
This led to the extraordinary second principle of homeopathy : the more you dilute a remedy the more effective it becomes , provided it 's done in a special way .
The method homeopaths use to this day is called serial dilution .
A drop of the original substance , whether it 's snake venom or sulphuric acid , is added to 99 drops of waster or alcohol .
Then the mixture is violently shaken .
Here it 's done by machine , but traditionally homeopaths would hit the tube against a hard surface .
Either way , homeopaths believe this is a vital stage .
It somehow transfers the healing powers from the original substance into the water itself .
The result is a mixture diluted 100 times .
LIONEL MILGROM : That will give you what 's called a 1C solution , that 's one part in 100 .
You then take that 1C solution and dissolve it in another 99 parts and now you end up with a 2C solution .
NARRATOR : At 2C the medicine is one part in 10,000 , but the homeopaths keep diluting and this is where the conflict with science begins .
At 6C the medicine is diluted a million million times .
This is equivalent to one drop in 20 swimming pools .
Another six dilutions gives you 12C .
This is equivalent to one drop in the Atlantic Ocean , but even this is not enough for most homeopathic medicines .
The typical dilution is 30C , a truly astronomical level of dilution .
BOB PARK : One drop in all of the oceans on Earth would be much more concentrated than that .
I would have to go off the planet to make that kind of dilution .
NARRATOR : But homeopaths believe that a drop of this ultra dilute solution placed onto sugar pills can cure you .
That 's why homeopathy is so controversial because science says that makes no sense whatsoever .
BOB PARK : There is a limit to how much we can dilute any substance .
We can only dilute it down to the point that we have one molecule left .
The next dilution we probably wo n't even have that one molecule .
WALTER STEWART :
It 's possible to go back and count how many molecules are present in a homeopathic dose and the astonishing answer is absolutely none .
There 's less than a chance in a million , less than a chance in a billion that there 's a single molecule .
NARRATOR : A molecule is the smallest piece of a substance you can have , so for something to have any effect at all conventional science says you need one molecule of it at the very least .
WALTER STEWART : Science has through many , many different experiments shown that when a drug works it 's always through the way the molecule interacts with the body and , so the discovery that there 's no molecules means absolutely there 's no effect .
NARRATOR : That 's why science and homeopathy have been at war for over 100 years .
The homeopaths say that their remedies have healing powers .
Science says there 's nothing but water .
Then one scientist claimed the homeopaths were right after all .
Jacques Benveniste was one of France 's science superstars .
He had a string of discoveries to his name and some believed he was on his way to earning a Nobel Prize .
DR JACQUES BENVENISTE ( National Institute for Medical Research ) : I was considered as , well in French we have a word which says Nobel is nobelisable , which means we can have a Nobel Prize because I started from scratch the whole field of research .
I was the head of a very large team , had a lot of money and so I was a very successful person .
NARRATOR : Benveniste was an expert in the field of allergy , in particular he was studying a type of blood cell involved in allergic reactions - the basophil .
When basophils come into contact with something you 're sensitive to they become activated causing the telltale symptoms .
Benveniste had developed a test that could tell if a person was allergic to something or not .
He added a kind of dye that only turns inactive basophils blue , so by counting the blue cells he could work out whether there had been a reaction , but then something utterly unexpected started to happen .
JACQUES BENVENISTE : A technician told me one day I do n't understand because I have diluted a substance that is activating basophils to a point where it should n't work and it still works .
NARRATOR : The researcher had taken the chemical and added water , just like homeopaths do .
The result should have been a solution so dilute it had absolutely no effect and yet , bizarrely , there was a reaction .
The basophils had been activated .
Benveniste knew this should n't have been possible .
JACQUES BENVENISTE : I remember saying to this , to her , this is water so it cannot work .
NARRATOR : Benveniste 's team was baffled .
They needed to find out what was going on , so they carried out hundreds of experiments and soon realised that they 'd made an extraordinary discovery .
It seemed that when a chemical was diluted to homeopathic levels the result was a special kind of water .
It did n't behave like ordinary water , it acted like it still contained the original substance .
It was as if the water was remembering the chemical it had once contained , so Benveniste called the phenomenon the ' memory of water ' .
At last here was scientific evidence that homeopathy could work .
Benveniste knew this was a radical suggestion , but there was a way to get his results taken seriously .
He had to get them published in a scientific journal .
JACQUES BENVENISTE : A result does n't exist until it is admitted by the scientific community .
It 's like , like being a good opera singer but singing in your bathroom .
That 's fine , but it 's not Scala , Milan or the Met , Met or the Opera at Paris , what - have - you .
NARRATOR : So he sent his work to the most prestigious journal in the world , a journal which for over 100 years has reported the greatest of scientific discoveries : Nature .
SIR JOHN MADDOX ( Nature Editor 1980 - 1995 ) : Nature is the place that everyone working in science recognises to be a way of getting publicity of the best kind .
NARRATOR : Benveniste 's research ended up with one of the most powerful figures in science , the then Editor of Nature , Sir John Maddox .
Maddox knew that the memory of water made no scientific sense , but he could n't just ignore work from such a respected scientist , so he agonised about what to do .
Eventually he reached a decision .
SIR JOHN MADDOX : I said OK , we 'll publish your paper if you ;et us come and inspect your lab and he agreed , to my astonishment .
NARRATOR : So in June 1988 Benveniste 's research appeared in the pages of Nature .
It caused a scientific sensation .
Benveniste became a celebrity .
His memory of water made news across the world .
He seemed to have found the evidence that made homeopathy scientifically credible , but the story was n't quite over .
Benveniste had agreed to let in a team from Nature .
It was a decision he would live to regret .
Maddox set about assembling his team of investigators and his choices revealed his true suspicions .
First , he chose Walter Stewart , a scientist and fraud - buster , but his next choice would really cause a stir : James Randi .
JACQUES BENVENISTE : I looked in my books and I said who are , who is Randi and could n't find any scientist called Randi .
NARRATOR : That was because the amazing Randi is n't a scientist , he 's a magician , but he 's no ordinary conjuror .
He 's also an arch sceptic , a fierce opponent of all things supernatural .
JACQUES BENVENISTE : I called John Maddox and I said what , what is this ?
I mean I thought you were coming with , with scientists to discuss science .
NARRATOR : But Randi felt he was just the man for the job .
On one occasion he had fooled even experienced scientists with his spoon bending tricks .
JAMES RANDI : Scientists do n't always think rationally and in a direct fashion .
They 're human beings like anyone else .
They can fool themselves .
NARRATOR : So Randi became the second investigator .
JAMES RANDI : Astonishing .
NARRATOR : On 4th July 1988 the investigative team arrived in Paris ready for the final showdown .
SIR JOHN MADDOX :
The first thing we did was to sit round the table in Benveniste 's lab .
Benveniste himself struck us all as looking very much like a film star .
JAMES RANDI : I found him to be a charming , very continental gentleman .
He 's a great personality .
He was very much in control .
JACQUES BENVENISTE :
We were quite relaxed because there was no reason why things should not go right .
NARRATOR : The first step was for Benveniste and his team to perform their experiment under Randi 's watchful gaze .
They had to prepare two sets of tubes containing homeopathic water and ordinary water .
If the homeopathic water was having a real effect different from ordinary water then homeopathy would be vindicated .
( ACTUALITY EXPERIMENT CHAT )
As they plotted the results it was clear the experiment had worked .
JAMES RANDI :
There were huge peaks coming up out of it and that was very active results , I mean very , very positive results .
WALTER STEWART :
The astonishing thing about these results is that they repeated the claim , they demonstrated the claim that a homeopathic dilution , a dilution where there were no molecules , could actually have some sort of an effect .
NARRATOR : But Maddox had seen that the experimenters knew which tubes contained the homeopathic water and which contained the ordinary water , so perhaps unconsciously , this might have influenced the results , so he asked them to repeat the experiment .
This time the tubes would be relabelled with a secret code so that no - one knew which tube was which .
JAMES RANDI : We went into a sealed room and we actually taped newspapers over the windows to the room that were accessible to the hall .
WALTER STEWART :
We recorded in handwriting which tube was which and we put this into an envelope and sealed it so that nobody could open it or change it .
NARRATOR : At this point the investigation took a turn for the surreal as they went to extraordinary lengths to keep the code secret .
JAMES RANDI : Walter and I got up on the stepladder and stuck it to the ceiling of the lab .
WALTER STEWART :
There it was taped above us as all of this work went on .
JACQUES BENVENISTE : Sticking an envelope to the ceiling was utterly ridiculous .
There is no way you can associate that with science .
NARRATOR : With the codes out of reach the final experiment could begin .
By now Benveniste had lost control of events .
JACQUES BENVENISTE :
It was a madhouse .
Randi was doing magician tricks .
JAMES RANDI : Yes I was doing perhaps a little bit of sleight - of - hand with an object or something like that , just to lighten the atmosphere .
NARRATOR : Soon the analysis was complete .
It was time to break the code to see if the experiment had worked .
Benveniste and his team were brimming with optimism .
JAMES RANDI : Oh my goodness it was party - time , cracked crabs legs and magnums , literally , of champagne packed in ice .
WALTER STEWART :
We were going to be treated to a wonderful dinner .
The press , many members of the press were there .
JAMES RANDI : John and Walter and I were looking at one another as if to say wow , if this does n't work it 's going to be a downer .
WALTER STEWART : Finally came the actual work of decoding the result .
JAMES RANDI : There was much excitement at the table .
Everyone was gathered around .
NARRATOR : Benveniste felt sure that the results would support homeopathy and that he would be vindicated .
JAMES RANDI : That did n't happen .
It was just a total failure .
SIR JOHN MADDOX :
We said well nothing here is there ?
WALTER STEWART :
And immediately the mood in the laboratory switched , people burst into tears .
JAMES RANDI : It was general gloom .
NARRATOR : The team wrote a report accusing Benveniste of doing bad science and branding the claims for the memory of water a delusion .
Benveniste 's scientific reputation was ruined .
JACQUES BENVENISTE : Everybody believed that I am totally wrong .
It 's simply dismissed .
Your phone call does n't ring anymore .
Just like actresses , or actress that have no , are no more in fashion the phone suddenly is silent .
NARRATOR : For now the memory of water was forgotten .
Science declared homeopathy impossible once more , but strangely that did n't cause homeopathy to disappear .
Instead it grew .
Since the Benveniste affair sales of homeopathic medicines have rocketed .
Homeopathy has become a trendy lifestyle choice , one of the caring , all natural medicines , more popular in the 21st - century than ever before .
Despite the scepticism of science millions of people use it and believe it has helped them , like Marie Smith .
Fifteen years ago Marie was diagnosed with a life - threatening blood disorder .
MARIE SMITH : I was more concerned for me children .
I used to look at them thinking I may , may not be here one day for yous .
That was the worst part of it .
NARRATOR : She 'd tried everything that conventional medicine could offer , including drugs and surgery .
Nothing seemed to work .
Then she tried homeopathy .
She took a remedy made from common salt .
MARIE SMITH : It 's like somebody putting me in a coffin and taking me back out again .
That 's just the way I felt and the quality of my life changed completely .
NARRATOR : Since then Marie has been healthy and she has no doubt it 's homeopathy that 's helped her .
MARIE SMITH : I know it saved my life and it's made my life a lot different , yeah and I 'm just glad I 'm enjoying these grandchildren which I never thought I would do .
NARRATOR : There are thousands of cases like Marie 's and they do present science with a problem .
If homeopathy is scientific nonsense then why are so many people apparently being cured by it ?
The answer may lie in the strange and powerful placebo effect .
The placebo effect is one of the most peculiar phenomena in all science .
Doctors have long known that some patients can be cured with pills that contain no active ingredient at all , just plain sugar , what they call the placebo , and they 've noticed an even great puzzle : that larger placebo pills work better than small ones , coloured pills work better than white pills .
The key is simply believing that the pill will help you .
This releases the powers in our minds that reduce stress and that alone can improve your health .
BOB PARK : Stress hormones make you feel terribly uncomfortable .
The minute you relieve the anxiety , relieve the stress hormones people do feel better , but that 's a true physiological effect .
NARRATOR : Scientists believe the mere act of taking a homeopathic remedy can make people feel better and homeopathy has other ways of reducing stress .
LIONEL MILGROM :
And is there any particular time of day that you will , you 'll , you 'll have that feeling ?
PATIENT : No .
NARRATOR : A crucial part of homeopathic care is the consultation .
LIONEL MILGROM :
The stress that you have at work , is that , are those around issues that make you feel quite emotional ?
PATIENT : No .
LIONEL MILGROM :
The main thing about a homeopathic interview is that we do spend a lot of time talking and listening to the patient .
We would ask questions of how they eat , how they sleep , how much worry and tension there is in their lives , hopefully give them some advice about how to actually ease problems of stress .
PATIENT
I just feel I want to have something more natural .
LIONEL MILGROM : Yeah ...
NARRATOR : So most scientists believe that when homeopathy works it must be because of the placebo effect .
BOB PARK : As far as I know it 's the only thing that is really guaranteed to be a perfect placebo .
There is no medicine in the medicine at all .
NARRATOR : It seems like a perfect explanation , except that homeopathy appears to work when a placebo should n't - when the patient does n't even know they 're taking a medicine .
All over the country animals are being treated with homeopathic medicines .
Pregnant cows are given dilute cuttlefish ink , sheep receive homeopathic silver to treat eye infections , piglets get sulphur to fatten them up .
A growing number of vets believe it's the medicine of the future , like Mark Elliot who 's used homeopathy his whole career , on all sorts of animals .
MARK ELLIOT ( Homeopathic Vet ) : Primarily it 's dogs and horses , but we also treat cats , small rodents , rabbits , guinea pigs , even reptiles , but I have treated an elephant with arthritis and I 've heard of colleagues recently who treated giraffes .
It works on any species exactly the same as in the human field .
NARRATOR : Mark made it his mission to prove that homeopathy works .
He decided to study horses with cushing 's , a disease caused by cancer .
He treated them all with the same homeopathic remedy .
The results were impressive .
MARK ELLIOT : We achieved an overall 80 % success rate which is great because that is comparable with , with modern medical drugs .
NARRATOR : To Mark this was clear proof that homeopathy can't be the placebo effect .
MARK ELLIOT : You can't explain to this animal why the treatment it 's being given is going to ben , to benefit it , or how it 's potentially going to benefit it and as a result , when you see a positive result in a horse or a dog that to me is the ultimate proof that homeopathy is not placebo , homeopathy works .
NARRATOR : But Mark 's small trial does n't convince the sceptics .
They need far more evidence before they 'll believe that homeopathic medicines are anything more than plain water .
JAMES RANDI : I 've heard it said that unusual claims require unusually good proof .
That 's true .
For example , if I tell you that at my home in Florida in the United States I have a goat in my garden .
You could easily check that out .
Yeah , looks like a goat , smells like a goat , so the case is essentially proven , but if I say I have a unicorn , that 's a different matter .
That 's an unusual claim .
NARRATOR : To scientists the claim that homeopathic water can cure you is as unlikely as finding a unicorn .
JAMES RANDI : Yes , there is a unicorn .
That is called homeopathy .
NARRATOR : Homeopathy needed the very highest standards of proof .
In science the best evidence there can be is a rigorous trial comparing a medicine against a placebo and in recent years such trials have been done with homeopathy .
David Reilly is a conventionally trained doctor who became intrigued by the claims of the homeopaths .
He wanted to put homeopathy to the test and decided to look at hay fever .
Both homeopathy and conventional medicine use pollen as a treatment for hay fever .
What 's different about homeopathy is the dilution .
DR DAVID REILLY ( Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital ) :
The single controversial element is that preparing this pollen by the homeopathic method takes it to a point that there 's not a single molecule of the starting material present .
I confidently assumed that these diluted medicines were placebos .
NARRATOR : David Reilly recruited 35 patients with hayfever .
Half of them were given a homeopathic medicine made from pollen , half were given placebo , just sugar pills .
No one knew which was which .
For four weeks they filled in a diary measuring how bad their symptoms were .
The question was : would there be a difference ?
DAVID REILLY : To our collective shock a result came out that was very clear those on the active medication had a substantially greater reduction in symptoms than those receiving the placebo medicine .
According to that data the medicine worked .
NARRATOR : But to be absolutely rigorous Reilly decided to repeat the study and he got the same result .
Then he went further and tested a different type of allergy .
Again the result was positive , but despite all these studies , most scientists refuse to believe his research .
DAVID REILLY :
It became obvious that in certain minds 100 studies , 200 studies would not change the mental framework and so I 'm sceptical that if 200 have n't changed it I do n't think 400 would change it .
NARRATOR : The reason Reilly 's research was dismissed was because his conclusion had no scientific explanation .
Sceptics pointed to the glaring problem : there was still no evidence as to how something that was pure water could actually work .
BOB PARK : If you design a medication to take advantage of what we know about physiology we 're not surprised when it works .
When , when you come up with no explanation at all for how it could work and then claim is works we 're not likely to take it seriously .
NARRATOR : To convince science , homeopathy had to find a mechanism , something that could explain how homeopathic water could cure you .
That meant proving that water really does have a memory .
Then a scientist appeared to find that proof .
Madeleine Ennis has never had much time for homeopathy .
As a professor of pharmacology she knows its scientifically impossible .
MADELEINE ENNIS : I 'm a completely conventional scientist .
I have had no experience of using non-conventional medications and have no intention really of starting to use them .
NARRATOR : But at a conference Ennis heard a French scientist present some puzzling results , results that seemed to show that water has a memory .
MADELEINE ENNIS :
Many of us were incredibly sceptical about the findings .
We told him that something must have gone wrong in the experiments and that we did n't believe what he had presented .
NARRATOR : He replied with a challenge .
MADELEINE ENNIS : I was asked whether , if I really believed my viewpoint , would I test the hypothesis that the data were wrong ?
NARRATOR : Ennis knew that the memory of water breaks the laws the science , but she believed that a scientist should always be willing to investigate new ideas , so the sceptical Ennis ended up testing the central claim of homeopathy .
She performed an experiment almost identical to Benveniste 's using the same kind of blood cell .
Then she added a chemical , histamine , which had been diluted down to homeopathic levels .
The crucial question : would it have any effect on the cells ?
To find out she had to count the cells one by one to see whether they had been affected by the homeopathic water .
The results were mystifying .
the homeopathic water could n't have had a single molecule of histamine , yet it still had an effect on the cells .
MADELEINE ENNIS :
They certainly were n't the results that I wanted to see and they definitely were n't the results that I would have liked to have seen .
NARRATOR : Ennis wondered whether counting by hand had introduced an error , so she repeated the experiment using an automated system to count the cells , and astonishingly , the result was still positive .
MADELEINE ENNIS : I was incredibly surprised and really had great feelings of disbelief , but I know how the experiments were performed and I could n't see an error in what we had done .
NARRATOR : These results seemed to prove that water does have a memory after all .
It 's exactly what the homeopaths have been hoping for .
PETER FISHER :
If these results become generally accepted it will revolutionise the view of homeopathy .
Homeopathy will suddenly become this idea that was perhaps born before its time .
LIONEL MILGROM : It 's particularly exciting because it does seem to suggest that Benveniste was correct .
NARRATOR : At last here is evidence from a highly respected researcher that homeopathic water has a real biological effect .
The claims of homeopathy might be true after all .
However , the arch sceptic Randi is unimpressed .
JAMES RANDI : There is so many ways that errors are purposeful interference can take place .
NARRATOR : As part of his campaign to test bizarre claims Randi has decided to put his money where his mouth is .
On his website is a public promise : to anyone who prove the scientifically impossible Randi will pay $ 1 m .
JAMES RANDI : This is not a cheap theatrical stung .
It 's theatrical , yes , but it 's a million dollar 's worth .
NARRATOR : Proving the memory of water would certainly qualify for the million dollars .
To win the prize someone would simply have to repeat Ennis 's experiments under controlled conditions , yet no - one has applied .
JAMES RANDI :
Where are the homeopathic labs , the biological labs around the world , who say that this is the real thing who would want to make a million dollars and are n't doing it ?
NARRATOR : So Horizon decided to take up Randi 's challenge .
We gathered experts from some of Britain 's leading scientific institutions to help us repeat Ennis 's experiments .
Under the most rigorous of conditions they 'll see whether they can find any evidence for the memory of water .
We brought James Randi over from the United States to witness the experiment and we came to the world 's most august scientific institution , the Royal Society .
The Vice - President of the Society , Professor John Enderby , agreed to oversee the experiment for us .
PROF .
JOHN ENDERBY : ... but they 'll , of course as far as the experimenters are concerned they 'll have totally different numbers ...
NARRATOR : And with a million dollars at stake James Randi wants to make sure there 's no room for error .
JAMES RANDI : ... keeping the original samples , so I 'm very happy with that provision .
I 'm willing to accept a positive result for homeopathy or for astrology or for anything else .
I may not like it , but I have to be willing to accept it .
NARRATOR : The first stage is to prepare the homeopathic dilutions .
We came to the laboratories of University College London where Professor Peter Mobbs agreed to produce them for us .
He 's going to make a homeopathic solution of histamine by repeatedly diluting one drop of solution into 99 drops of water .
PETER MOBBS : OK , now I 'm transferring the histamine into 9.9 mmls of distilled water and then we 'll discard the tip .
NARRATOR : For comparison we also need control tubes , tubes that have never had histamine in them .
For these Peter starts with plain water .
PETER MOBBS : In it goes .
NARRATOR : This stage dilutes the solutions down to one in 100 - that 's 1C .
We now have 10 tubes .
Half are just water diluted with more water , the control tubes , half are histamine diluted in water .
These are all shaken , the crucial homeopathic step .
Now he dilutes each of the tubes again , to 2C .
Then to 3C , all the way to 5C .
PETER MOBBS :
The histamine 's now been diluted ten thousand million times .
Still a few molecules left in there , but not very many .
NARRATOR : Then we asked Professor of Electrical Engineering , Hugh Griffiths , to randomly relabel each of our 10 tubes .
Now only he has the code for which tubes contain the homeopathic dilutions and which tubes contain water .
HUGH GRIFFITHS : OK , so there 's the record of which is which .
I 'm going to encase it in aluminium foil and then seal it in this envelope here .
NARRATOR : Next the time - consuming task of taking these solutions down to true homeopathic levels .
UCL scientist Rachel Pearson takes each of the tubes and dilutes them down further - to 6C .
That 's one drop in 20 swimming pools .
To 12C - a drop in the Atlantic .
Then to 15C - one drop in all the world 's oceans .
The tubes have now been diluted one million million million million million times .
Some are taken even further down , to 18C .
Every tube , whether it contains histamine or water , goes through exactly the same procedure .
To guard against any possibility of fraud , Professor Enderby himself recodes every single tube .
The result is 40 tubes none of which should contain any molecules of histamine at all .
Conventional science says they are all identical , but if Madeleine Ennis is right her methods should tell which ones contain the real homeopathic dilutions .
Now we repeat Ennis 's procedure .
We take a drop of water from each of the tubes and add a sample of living human cells .
Then it 's time for Wayne Turnbull at Guys Hospital , to analyse the cells to see whether the homeopathic water has had any effect .
He 'll be using the most sophisticated system available : a flow cytometer .
WAYNE TURNBULL : Loading it up , bringing it up to pressure .
Essentially the technology allows us to take individual cells and push them past a focused laser beam .
A single stream of cells will be pushed along through the nozzle head and come straight down through the machine .
The laser lights will be focussed at each individual cell as it goes past .
Reflected laser light is then being picked up by these electronic detectors here .
NARRATOR : By measuring the light reflected off each cell the computer can tell whether they 've reacted or not .
WAYNE TURNBULL :
This is actually a very fast machine .
I can run up to 100 million cells an hour .
JAMES RANDI : Whoa .
NARRATOR : But to be absolutely rigorous we asked a second scientist , Marian Macey at the Royal London Hospital , to perform the analysis in parallel .
Our two labs get to work .
Using a flow cytometer they measure how many of the cells are being activated by the different test solutions .
Some tubes do seem to be having more of an effect than others .
The question is : are they the homeopathic ones ?
At last the analysis is complete .
We gather all the participants here to the Royal Society to find out the results .
First , everyone confirms that the experiment has been conducted in a rigorous fashion .
MARION MACEY : I applied my own numbering system to the ...
RACHEL PEARSON : ...5 , 5.4 millimolar solution ...
WAYNE TURNBULL : ... we eventually did arrive at a protocol that we were happy with .
NARRATOR : Then there 's the small matter of the million dollars .
JOHN ENDERBY : James , is the cheque in your pocket ready now ?
JAMES RANDI : We do n't actually carry a cheque around .
It 's in the form of negotiable bonds which will be immediately sep , separated from our account and given to whoever should win the prize .
NARRATOR : We asked the firm to fax us confirmation that the million dollar prize is there .
JOHN ENDERBY : OK , now look , I 'm going to open this envelope .
NARRATOR : Now at last it 's time to break the code .
On hand to analyse the results is statistician Martin Bland .
JOHN ENDERBY : 59 .
NARRATOR : We 've divided the tubes into those that did and did n't seem to have an effect in our experiment .
JOHN ENDERBY : 62 .
NARRATOR : Each tube is either a D for the homeopathic dilutions , or a C , for the plain water controls .
JOHN ENDERBY : 52 and 75 were Cs .
NARRATOR : Rachel Pearson identifies the tubes with a C or D .
If the memory of water is real each column should either have mostly Cs or mostly Ds . This would show that the homeopathic dilutions are having a real effect , different from ordinary water .
There 's a hint that the letters are starting to line up .
JOHN ENDERBY : Column 1 we 've got 5 Cs and a D. Column 3 we 've got 4 Cs and a D , so let 's press on .
148 and 9 , 28 and ...
NARRATOR : But as more codes are read out the true result becomes clear : the Cs and Ds are completely mixed up .
The results are just what you 'd expect by chance .
A statistical analysis confirms it .
The homeopathic water has n't had any effect .
PROF .
MARTIN BLAND ( St. George 's Hospital Medical School ) :
There 's absolutely no evidence at all to say that there is any difference between the solution that started off as pure water and the solution that started off with the histamine .
JOHN ENDERBY :
What this has convinced me is that water does not have a memory .
NARRATOR : So Horizon has n't won the million dollars .
It 's another triumph for James Randi .
His reputation and his money are safe , but even he admits this may not be the final word .
JAMES RANDI : Further investigation needs to be done .
This may sound a little strange coming from me , but if there is any possibility that there 's a reality here I want to know about it , all of humanity wants to know about it .
NARRATOR : Homeopathy is back where it started without any credible scientific explanation .
That wo n't stop millions of people putting their faith in it , but science is confident .
Homeopathy is impossible .
When Apple Computer Inc. opened its first Apple retail store in 2001 in a shopping mall in McLean , Va. , critics saw the initiative as an expensive , dubious gamble .
But as Apple prepares to take the wraps off its latest , most ambitious store yet -- on New York 's Fifth Avenue , opposite the Plaza Hotel and Bergdorf Goodman -- there are few doubters left about Chief Executive Steve Jobs 's retail strategy .
On Friday evening , five years after opening its first store , Apple will unlock the doors to a subterranean store that sprawls ...

The switching of the poles can be studied in a tub of molten metal .
Poles apart : our planet 's field flips every now and then — though no one knows why .
NASA
Every few hundred thousand years or so , the Earth 's north and south magnetic poles switch places .
No one knows what triggers these geomagnetic field reversals , but a team in France has now reproduced them in the lab .
Michaël Berhanu of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and his co-workers have spun enough molten sodium to fill a small bathtub in a copper cylinder at many revolutions per second .
This provided a rough simulation of the Earth 's spinning core of molten iron1 .
Electrical currents that are produced spontaneously in these swirling liquid metals set up a magnetic field in a process known as dynamo action .
The same principles are used in industrial dynamos to create electricity , by moving metal wires through a magnetic field .
Although it has been known for some time that turbulent motions in the Earth 's core create the geomagnetic field this way , the details of how that happens still are n't clear .
In particular , geomagnetic reversals remain puzzling .
Our magnetic poles have , in the past , faded away and then re-emerged upside down .
These events are recorded in magnetic sedimentary rocks , which reveal the strength and direction of the prevailing field when it was formed .
But no one knows why the reversals occurred when they did .
In a spin
To try to understand this behaviour , scientists have in the past attempted to make an artificial geodynamo in the laboratory .
In 2000 they succeeded partly , when a team working at Riga in Latvia span a cylinder of molten sodium and found that it generated a magnetic field by dynamo action2 .
But this field stayed static — it did n't flip like the Earth's .
Ca n't do this at home : not everyone has the apparatus to spin liquid metal .
École Normale Supérieure
The experiment done in France is very similar .
It consists of a cylindrical chamber filled with liquid sodium that is stirred by two iron plates at each end , rotating in opposite directions .
Sodium is used because it is highly electrically conducting , relatively lightweight , and melts at just 98 °C .
The spinning disks make the molten metal highly turbulent , which generates a field aligned with the rotation axis of the chamber .
When the disks were spun at equal but opposite rates , this field stayed constant .
But if the rotation rates were different , the behaviour was more complex , says Stéphan Fauve , group leader at the École Normale Supérieure .
" This means that there is overall rotation of the entire contents , " he says , " which mimics the spinning of the Earth " .
Under these conditions the magnetic field switches polarity apparently at random , typically every minute or so .
It happens just as it happens to the Earth , with the field declining slowly to zero and then reappearing quickly in the opposite orientation3 .
They find that one field orientation persists more often than the other , presumably because of a bias introduced by the Earth 's magnetic field .
ADVERTISEMENT
The reversals seem to happen when the energy needed to spin the driving disks — which varies because the turbulence of the liquid produces a variable amount of friction — is lower than average .
Whereas some theories of geomagnetic reversals have postulated that they are triggered by events outside the core , such as changes in the sluggish , convective circulation of the Earth 's mantle , Fauve says that their experiment shows such nudges are n't necessary to induce a reversal .
" We do n't need any external trigger , " he says .

Easy , right ?
If you 're using Azureus or
Torrent , you 'll want to make sure that you have a default download directory set so that you do n't have to confirm the directory before the download begins ( after all , the whole point is automation , right ? ) .
To do this in Azureus , go to Tools -> Options ->
Files , then check the box labeled " Save to default directory . "

The very simple method given above should work easily for the nearly 30 popular television shows currently pre-loaded in Ted , but for those shows that are n't automatically populated , or to get a little more specific , I 'll show you how to find and setup your own feeds .
Creating custom TV torrent feeds for Ted
There are definitely times when it 's useful to create your own feeds - say , for example , you wanted to download new episodes of your favorite show in an iPod - compatible video format , but iTunes does n't offer it .
Advertisement
In order to add such a show to Ted , you 'd need to find a torrent site that allows you to create custom feeds - TorrentSpy is great for this , since it allows for a lot of advanced search techniques .
For the purpose of demonstration ( and demonstration only ! ) , I 'll show you how to add a feed of iPod - compatible episodes of CSI to Ted .
First , go to TorrentSpy and select Preferences .
Set Sort Results to Newest / Date .
Then go to Advanced Search and select Handheld as a category and iPod as the section .
Now enter " CSI " as your search term and you 're ready to get your feed .
In your search results , you should see a link that says " RSS Feed for These Results . "
Copy and paste that link into the RSS feed section of Ted 's new show dialog .
Advertisement
Then just name your feed ( I called mine " CSI ( iPod ) " ) , enter in the current episode , and click Save .
If there 's a new show available , Ted will automatically grab it .
Easy , no ?
If you 're having trouble narrowing your feed down , you can add search terms to either TorrentSpy or to the Advanced tab of the new show settings in Ted .
The cool part about Ted 's Keyword search is that it lets you use search operators like !
( not ) , & ( and ) , and | ( or ) .

Yes , that 's right - you do n't have to infringe !
For example , why not take this ease - of - subscription opportunity to keep up - to - date with PBS 's freely - distributed NerdTV ?
Here , I 'll make it easy for you - copy and paste this feed into Ted .
After you 've set up your recordings with Ted , you may not have a system quite as simple and powerful as a home - brewed DVR , but what you do have is a pretty good substitute .
DVR or not , it 's time you make TV bow to your will , on your schedule .

I 'm not that familiar with Ruby libraries , but I get the impression that like Python the Next Step for Ruby will be accomplished on top of the language , not as an extension to it .
If you know of something that belongs here , please comment .
( Note : I 'm not including tool - like libraries or application frameworks in these lists -- that way lies aesthetics ; a valid thing to argue over , but not here please . )
There are a few libraries that I think are notable for Python , because they address core programming techniques ; things that might be language extensions in other , less dynamic languages .
They are also notable because they are n't part of the Python core , for better or worse .
In many cases Ruby equivalents exist , but may not be as mature ( most of the reference projects have been in development in Python for many years ) .
For both languages the libraries are very important to their utility .
It 's difficult to list all the differences , but in most ( nearly all ? ) areas Python has more complete library support , in terms of pure functionality .
At the same time , Perl is probably better than either ; but you only need Good Enough libraries for your application .
Ruby may provide that , depending on your application .
And no system provides the perfect libraries for everything , so it is always a tradeoff .
I would love if Parrot created an environment where Python , Ruby , Perl , PHP , and other open source languages happily coexisted and shared a basic infrastructure .
It does n't have to mean 100 % transparency between languages for it to be useful and successful .
But at this point it 's hard for me to believe Parrot will catch up to other competing runtime environments .
Ruby and CPython ( CPython being the name of the " normal " Python implementation ) perform roughly the same .
Ruby itself does not have a virtual machine , acting instead as an interpreter ( the YARV project intends to add a VM to Ruby ) .
At the same time , the Python VM is nothing very special -- while certain routines have been heavily optimized ( like hash tables and the sorting algorithm ) the VM itself is unexceptional .
Benchmarking is hard and unrewarding , but perhaps this is an interesting comparison .
Ruby has tainted strings with various associated settings for running code in a restricted environment .
Python had the rexec module , but it was insecure and removed some time ago .
No one is working on a Python replacement .
Python could be seen as more powerful because of multiple inheritance .
But I think inheritance is n't that important anyway , so it 's not a feature I would put much weight in .
Mutliple inheritance is mostly distinct from mix-ins in that it is resolved at call - time , where mix-ins are resolved at class - definition - time .
Which is better ?
I do n't really care .
You can do these in Python just like in Ruby -- classes can be easily modified after they were defined .
In Python you can also use multiple - inheritance .
For some reason people do n't do either that often in Python .
I think it 's mostly cultural .
Ruby has some ability to modify objects in ways Python does n't ( Python makes many objects and classes immutable by convention and implementation ) .
For instance , you cannot add methods to Python 's object or str ( string type ) .
Any clever uses of the ability to modify base types in Ruby are , I think , misguided ; Python 's immutable base types mean that there are fundamental abstractions and capabilities that all Python users and libraries can rely upon .
Anything else is handled with functions and protocols , which are much more isolated .
Modifying fundamental types makes interoperability very hard .
Of course , no one is forcing you to do that in Ruby , so wise programmers can avoid such things .
Also , Python 's use of functions that optionally call magic methods makes it easier to add backward - compatible functionality .
For instance , at one time comparisons ( like a < b ) only called __cmp__ method ( which returns - 1,0,1 ) ; now they call a more specific method ( like __lt__ for less - than ) and fall back on __cmp__ .
This has happened many times over the life of Python , but you 'll only notice that when you start defining your own magic methods .
While there is a uniformity to Ruby 's technique , Python 's technique also has some advantages .
One is that functions are isolated and contained in a namespace ; methods / attributes in Ruby and Python do not .
Python 's magic methods do n't have a namespace , but in practice they are less likely to clash with other methods because of the distinction between " magic " and " not - magic " .
Fundamentally the " root " Python object is nearly empty ; it defines nothing and does nothing .
It did n't even have a name in the past ( now it is object ) .
In Ruby there is a base object Object , which has lots of methods , and those methods embody these protocols .
Python uses functions to the same effect .
Some people really dislike the __method__ attributes .
I think this is mostly an aesthetic concern , and aesthetic concerns do not relate to the " power " of a language , hence their absense from this essay .
Many idioms in Python are achieved with algorithmic protocols instead of relying strictly on methods .
For instance , len( ) is a function which calls a specific protocol :
Both languages allow you to subclass built - in classes as well as user - defined classes .
Very old comparisons criticize Python because this was not possible at one time ( pre -2.0 ) .
However , from a message - passing perspective it's not an important feature anyway -- focusing on types and inheritance is an implementation concern .
Also , built - in types have always been objects in Python .
They are not special values like Java 's ints , there is no " boxing " and " unboxing " nonsense .
Objects should not be confused with types or subclassing .
In both languages everything is an object .
In Python you ask an object for attributes , and those attributes may be bound functions .
Though the perspectives are different , the functionality is ultimately the same .
What you ask objects for is different in the two languages .
In Ruby you ask objects to do something .
There are no exposed attributes , just methods .
Some Python programmers get in a tizzy because functions are not first - class in Ruby ( there is no functions , just messages called " methods " ) .
This is n't really fair -- the basic concept ( deferred execution ) is present in the form of blocks .
Both languages are better understood as message - passing than class - based OO .
That is , instead of being focused on types and classes , you have " objects " and you ask those objects for things .
Classes are an implementation detail .
This is a typical feature of dynamically typed systems , and an important basis for metaprogramming .
Sometimes Ruby is called " more OO " than Python .
I do n't think this has much basis .
I get the impression that a lot of Ruby 's metaprogramming is done through runtime source generation and eval ( at least in Rails ) .
This is possible in Python , but uncommon .
I think this is mostly cultural , though things like whitespace sensitivity in Python are non-starters for code generation .
Many Python programmers ( myself included ) look down on code generation , adding to this cultural disinclination .
More common in Python is metaprogramming through decorators or descriptors .
I do n't know what other techniques Ruby has .
In Ruby I believe you can call class methods as part of the class definition ; these methods effect class definition .
Things as basic as getters and setters are implemented using this .
In Python the class does n't exist until the class statement has been fully evaluated , so you can't do this ; instead the metaclass has to act on the class based on attributes you defined .
Things like PyProtocol 's advise ( ) function simulate the Ruby process , but only with great effort .
In both languages you can run code on a class when it is created .
In Python this requires specific recipes implemented in the metaclass , which I believe has kept people from using this technique more often .
Many of Rails ' most - touted features use metaprogramming .
In a general sense all of these things can be achieved in Python , though the techniques are usually quite different .
Both Python and Ruby have strong support for metaprogramming .
This is a major differentiation from language like PHP , which though also a dynamically typed language does not have many metaprogramming abilities ( short of code generation ) .
Python has native Unicode objects , with very full support for everything Unicode implies .
Ruby does not have Unicode objects , only the ability to translate encodings , storing all strings as bytes .
From what I can tell the translation ( iconv ) relies on operating system libraries .
I expect this leads to significant portability concerns , though I do n't really know .
Ruby supports continuations .
Python does not ( except in Stackless again ) .
Continuations are not widely used in real applications in either world , but they do open up the possibility for things like Borges ( how exactly Cherry Flow works in the absence of Stackless I 'm not sure ) .
One notable use of continuations in Ruby is for breakpoints in debuggers .
Microthreads can be used for massive concurrency ( thousands of independent contexts of execution ) .
In Python this can be accomplished with generators ( somewhat awkwardly ) or in the future with coroutines ( less awkwardly ) .
Python OS - level threads can be used to handle concurrency well when some threads are blocking on external sources ( disk access , network IO , waiting on a socket , etc ) .
Multiple processes can be used to the same effect in both languages .
Python does support preemptive OS threads .
Because of the GIL ( Global Interpreter Lock ) , processor - bound Python applications cannot make use of multiple processors by using threads .
This is sometimes seen as being equivalent to Ruby 's thread situation : it is not .
The GIL detracts from one feature of threads : utilization of multiple CPUs .
It is still very viable to use threads to handle concurrency in Python .
Ruby threads also do not block on I/O , though other C extensions often will block .
Ruby does have non-OS threads , which are not preemptive .
These are like Stackless ' microthreads .
Unfortunately Stackless is a dead - end at this time , and microthreads are not available in mainstream Python .
PEP 342 addresses some of the use - cases for microthreads ( and in the process some of the issues with Twisted - style callbacks , I think ) .
I do n't know if microthreads are used to any great effect in Ruby .
Sometimes Python and Ruby are considered equivalent here .
They are not .
Ruby , to my knowledge , does not support OS ( preemptive ) threads , or if it does it is buggy ( or " experimental " ) and most code is not threadsafe .
Long ago Python functions were not " closures " , in that they did not have access to the variables defined in enclosing scopes .
That has n't been true for several years , though it is still frequently seen in comparisons .
Another case where Ruby uses blocks is resource finalization , where in Python you currently use try : finally : ( using functions and callbacks is almost never done for finalization in Python , simply because it is too awkward ) .
Ruby is n't particular more powerful in this way , but it does make it easier to do the Right Thing ( cleanup properly ) , where Python makes it easier to do the Wrong Thing ( forget to cleanup ) .
Python is addressing this with PEP 343 .
Ruby was part of the motivation for the semantics and syntax of PEP 343 , though ultimately the result is n't that similar .
There 's nothing wrong with that : naming the function is not onerous ; defining it before it is passed to atexist .
register is not backwards .
However , outside of asynchronous code -- which uses this callback style very heavily -- this is not a big problem in Python .
Many places where Ruby uses blocks , Python uses for loops , and it is not syntactically any worse for it ;
Python 's iterators and generators are every bit as general as Ruby 's collection interface .
In other cases where callbacks are used Python does n't feel nearly so awkward .
For instance , consider the atexit , module where you register callbacks to be called when the process quits :
This is trully annoying for the Twisted people , who have to write things in reverse because of it -- this is because Twisted ( and asynchronous event - driven programming in general ) does things like do_this ( when_you_are_done_do=next_step ) , where the do_this function calls next_step ( ) when it finishes .
In Python next_step has to be a function , and ( ignoring the syntactically awkward lambda ) the function will have to be defined before you make that call .
So even though do_this is called first , then next_step called after , you have to define next_step before you use it .
Ruby blocks usually the first topic when judging the two languages .
Syntactically Ruby is better in this respect ;
Python 's functions are not as convenient as Ruby 's blocks , though they are mostly equivalent in functionality .
This was originally written August 2005 .
I 'm a Python programmer , feel free to infer bias .
At the same time , I do n't know enough about Ruby to make many negative assertions ( to identify something that Ruby is missing ) --
I know what is in Python , but I do n't know enough about Ruby to claim an equivalent does n't exist there .
As a result this post probably seems rather defensive of Python , because I do know enough to correct some of the inaccuracies about Python that I 've seen in many other comparisons .
Corrections or opinions ?
Comment below .
There are different opinions on the relative power of Ruby and Python .
I 'm not much more authoritative than other resources ( though I 'm not less authoritative either ; most comparisons between the two languages are flawed ) .
Ultimately I do n't believe there are many ( any ? ) places where one language is more " powerful " than the other ( and not just in the " they are both Turing complete " sense ) .
There 's a lot of content in this article , some of which I 'm not 100 % sure about .
I 'll try to fold in any corrections provided , and note the updates in this comment .
2005 -08 - 17 : Updated per Seo Sanghyeon 's comments to note Ruby 's Safe , distutils C compilation , and Ruby 's rdoc .
I 'll probably put some of his other comments into a " VM " section .
2005 -08 - 21 : Updated per Florian Gross 's comments :
Ruby threads are preemptive for I/O ; utility of continuations for breakpoints ; source code generation might just be common in Rails ; that Psyco is not alone in concept , but alone in terms of maturity ..
Noted projects : ruby - contract , rubyscript2exe , Exerb , Ruby Numeric alternatives .
Changed some of the finalization commentary in Ruby Blocks ; PEP 348 and Ruby blocks are more similar than I originally realized when I first wrote this .
Added section on " Performance & Environment " .
Also added table of contents .
Added link to benchmark in aforementioned section .
2005 - 08 - 29 : Added a note to the intro , that my asymmetric knowledge of the two languages can actually lead to a pro-Ruby bias to the comparison .
Fixed commenting .
I would like to comments three points .
First , about threads , the use of Python GIL makes OS threads not that different from Stackless threads .
Let say that if you deal only with Python code there wo n't be any differences at all as in both case it is the Python interpreter who decides when a context switch will occure ( in one case byu releasing the GIL , in the other by actually switching the current thread ) .
There are two situations where you 'll see some differences .
First , if you use some extension library performing long tasks without accessing any Python function , it can release the GIL , allowing a true multi- threading , even multi-processor computation .
Second , if you have to interface Python with some other library ( like , say , Qt ) you can use Qt threads and , along with that , Qt cross - thread message system .
Second , about multiple inheritance .
Python syntax does allow for multiple inheritance and it does work with pure - Python objects .
However , it does not work ( in CPython ) with built - in objects ( try deriving from both str and dict ) .
As Python 's main force is the possibility to extend it with efficient languages and that you can seemingly replace a full - Python object with a built - in object , probably as a required optimisation , multiple inheritance is bad practice as it would forbid you to replace a full - Python object with an extended one .
Until CPython resolve this problem , I will consider Python not being able to handle multiple inheritance .
At last , about OO .
Just to say that I really do n't care if a language is 100 % OO , whatever that might mean .
The main reason is : no two person has the same feeling about what " 100 % OO " is !
Another is : if the language is efficient and " just work " , who cares if it 's 100 % OO or 0 % OO or whatever ???
Nevertheless , I agree with your comments about OO and Python , I found it very interesting !
# Harbort
There are two situations where you 'll see some differences .
First , if you use some extension library performing long tasks without accessing any Python function , it can release the GIL , allowing a true multi-threading .
Do you realize that " Some extension library " includes any file operation , any socket operation , and in general , any blocking system calls ?
CPython 's fileobject.c and socketmodule.c is full of Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS /Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
to enable this .
# Seo Sanghyeon
At last , about OO .
Just to say that I really do n't care if a language is 100 % OO , whatever that might mean .
I care a lot .
For instance , if Python classes were not objects ( but syntactic constructs or something , like in Java ) that would be awful .
If I had to worry about boxing , that would be awful .
If Python is n't 100 % class based , no problem .
Smart OO programmers know that OO is not the same thing as classes .
Python is 100 % object based , and that 's really really important .
IMHO , that makes it substantially more OO than Java .
# Ian Bicking
Well , my point was more about : what does it add to get the " 100 % OO " label ?
IMHO , nothing !
Even more : " 100 % OO " might means ( and apparently mean ) different things to different people .
I really do n't care about the label !
But I do care about the language coherency ...
In Python everything you manipulate is seen as object ( at least syntacticaly ) and that 's enough for me .
But if someone feels it is not enough to be " 100 % OO " , well , he might be right , but I do n't care !
That 's all I wanted to say ... # anonymous Ruby is 102 % OO then .
# anonymous Examples please ?

The entire language was built from the ground up using OOP concepts .
IMHO that makes it more oop than just about anything else .
Every aspect of the language can be manipulated including the object " Class " which can be manipulated on the fly as it's created .
It makes the language very easy to learn because so much of the language is polymorphic .
Got a file handle , try the put method .
Got a standard out handle , try the put method .
Got a network socket , try the put method .
. . . you get the idea .
Working with ruby I feel like I need less of a reference than other languages .
Once I get used to a particular class hierarchy I understand that most of the inherited methods are available for all classes in that tree .
I had a python stint and really liked the language , but feel that Ruby code is more expressive .
I know that is cosmetic or semmantic which you seem to be trying to avoid .
I think if I were defending python I would avoid them as well . :)
In all seriousness tho , python is great . . . ruby is great .
It 's all about enjoying what you do and if python makes you happier than ruby then that 's what you should do .

Being addressed with YARV .
I think this is one of the factors that do n't actually make much of a difference .

Debunk " Python lacks real GC " myth .
( Cyclic GC was there ... since 2.0 ! )
Agreed , writing Ruby extensions is a lot easier than writing Python ones .
This comes with a downside of course : Ruby 's conservative GC is n't guaranteed to collect all objects .
( There might be things on the stack which look like object references , but are n't . )
There 's plans for having a generational GC in Ruby 2 .
This ought to help quite a bit with performance if done right .
Jython and IronPython need to be mentioned .
I do n't know much about JRuby .
JRuby seems stable .
It 's being used in jEdit for making a lot of magic work magically .
Pretty cool stuff .
There 's a lot of Ruby .
NET implementations and I 'm working on one of them ( getting sponsored by Google 's Summer of Code ) -- you can eventually expect a break through in that area , but it might still take some time .

Ruby comes with Ripper in the development branch AFAIK .

Python will probably never get " Ruby blocks " or continuations or full - featured AST manipulation .
Guido avoids these very powerful and very general solutions .
Guido would rather give a few 20 % solutions that cover 80 % of the use cases .
Iterators and generators are good examples of this .
They are only 20 % as powerful and general as blocks and continuations , but they cover 80 % of the " real - live " use cases .
Also , Python strives for readability .
I feel the existance and popularity of Ruby has been a net positive for Python , because it keeps programmers who do n't greatly value readability away from our Python codebases .

Ruby also wants to be readable , but does n't enforce this by limiting the language .
I will agree that Perl style variables are ugly , but well written Ruby code is just as pretty as Python one IMHO .
# Florian Gross
I 'd go further than this .
" Readability " has as much to do with symmetrical constructs as it does algolishness .
I do n't believe that it 's a larger hurdle for an algol - family programmer to grok blocks than it is for them to grok list comprehensions or lambdas .
And I think it 's a smaller hurdle for them to grok blocks than it is for them to grok both list comprehensions and lambdas .
Ruby readability is also greatly enhanced by its perl heritage .
The lack of =~ and similar is what prevent python from succeeding perl years ago .
You may call these things sugar , but these are all Turing compatible languages so at the end of the day it 's all sugar .
# Peter Merel
I love when people talk about turing compliance ;) .
The argument that any languages that are Turing compliant must be equivalent is IMO very misunderstood , by this reasoning there is no difference between any two languages ( besides syntax ) .
This simply is n't true , take for example C++ and Java , both are Turing compliant and both are OO , however there 's a big difference in what you can do with them .
Another example ?
How about Lisp and Java , both are Turing compliant yet the list of things Java can't do is longer than my arm , one example being closures .
Taking this into account obviously not all languages are equal so I would love very much for people to stop throwing Turing compliance about in this way :) .
Last one , how about Python and Lisp .
I read above that Python has full support for lexical closures now however I 'd like to point out that this is n't exactly true as Paul Graham pointed out in the article below .
As an illustration of what I mean about the relative power of programming languages , consider the following problem .
We want to write a function that generates accumulators -- a function that takes a number n , and returns a function that takes another number i and returns n incremented by i. ...
In Common Lisp this would be ( defun foo ( n ) System Message : ERROR /3 ( < string > , line 12 ) Unexpected indentation .
Unexpected indentation .
( lambda ( i ) ( incf n i ) ) )
System Message : WARNING /2 ( < string > , line 13 ) Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
...
If you try to translate the Lisp / Perl / Smalltalk / Javascript code into Python you run into some limitations .
Because Python does n't fully support lexical variables , you have to create a data structure to hold the value of n .
And although Python does have a function data type , there is no literal representation for one ( unless the body is only a single expression ) so you need to create a named function to return .
This is what you end up with : def foo(n ) : System Message : ERROR /3 ( < string > , line 16 ) Unexpected indentation .
Unexpected indentation .
s = [ n ] def bar( i ) : System Message : ERROR /3 ( < string > , line 18 ) Unexpected indentation .
Unexpected indentation . s [ 0 ] += i return s [ 0 ]
System Message : WARNING /2 ( < string > , line 20 ) Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
return bar System Message : WARNING /2 ( < string > , line 21 ) Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
Python users might legitimately ask why they can't just write def foo(n ) : System Message : ERROR /3 ( < string > , line 23 ) Unexpected indentation .
Unexpected indentation .
return lambda i : return n += i System Message : WARNING /2 ( < string > , line 24 ) Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
or even def foo(n ) : System Message : ERROR /3 ( < string > , line 26 ) Unexpected indentation .
Unexpected indentation .
lambda i : n += i System Message : WARNING /2 ( < string > , line 27 ) Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
Block quote ends without a blank line ; unexpected unindent .
and my guess is that they probably will , one day .
( But if they do n't want to wait for Python to evolve the rest of the way into Lisp , they could always just ... )

Arguing over which is the most OOP language is somewhat silly in itself :) .
OOP is not an abstraction that suits every task and yet it 's used everywhere now – with varying results of course .
I 've read a lot of code written using OO and it instantly occurs to me that the same task could be accomplished with less work and while maintaining the same amount of modularity WITHOUT all the extra work of writing classes for types and defining methods , attributes etc.
OOP is good for some things and truly horrible for others – I wish the world would realize this .
All in all though they 're both good languages , personally I like Ruby more .
I used Python for 4 years [ think it was my 4th or 5th language ] and by the end just found it way to restricting to bear :) .
If you have n't already you should learn both , hell you should probably learn every language that crosses your path anyway but still .
Learn Ruby if your a Python user , learn Python if your a Ruby user and then you 'll be better equipped to judge both languages .
That and you 'll learn useful concepts that may carry over ?
Enjoy guys , Mark . # Mark Smith Umm ...
What ?
Python 2.3.5 ( # 2 , Nov 20 2005 , 16:40:50 ) >>> def f( n ) : ... return lambda x : n + x ... >>> inc5 = f( 5 ) >>> inc5( 10 ) 15 >>>
In which way is n't that lexical closure ?
Oh , you mean the fact .
Of course it does , but it does n't matter .
that ints are immutable in Python ?
Or the fact that names are just that in Python : names for objects , rather than references to slots ?
That does n't have anything to do with closure .
It 's just the way assignments work in Python .
Lisp requires you to declare names , distinguishing assignment from binding .
Python does n't .
Is Lisp 's way of doing things different ?
Yes , it is .
Is it better ?
I do n't think so .
Why do I think so ?
Your example is clearly much more elegant in Lisp than it is in Python , after all .
But that 's not the point .
A Python programmer would n't use functions to represent incrementors : they would use objects ( ignoring the fact that , up to now , I have n't needed an accumulator in my whole life , ever ) .
In the context of object - orientation , Python 's assignment behaviour makes a lot more sense than Lisp's .
Stating that Lisp deals with functions more elegantly than Python does is n't a valid point , because it does n't matter .
It 's like saying that a webcam is n't well suited for typing text : true , but not very interesting .
By the way , anonymous procedures will probably disappear from Python at some point anyway .
If you really think that Python converges towards Lisp , you 're probably wrong .

How did that happen ?

This simply is n't true , take for example C++ and Java , both are Turing compliant and both are OO , however there 's a big difference in what you can do with them .
I think you misunderstood Peter 's post .
He was n't saying that all these languages are turing complete and , therefore , equal .
In fact , he was implying the opposite of that !
Please read his post again ...
He was implying that Pythonistas attack PERL's =~ operator by calling it syntactic sugar .
He defended PERL by pointing out that the whole syntax of the language boils down to syntactic sugar in the face of Turing completeness .
You see , he was using Turing completeness to compare the features of the language that we like to syntactic sugar to show that the =~ operator is more than just sugar .
It is a legitimate feature of a language that gives it an advantage over languages that lack it .
So , in the end , he 's saying that Turing completeness does n't make all languages equal ... # Id Kong
One thing about python is that it only evaluates variable bindings when the code is run .
So it 's quite possible to write something like : def step1 ( ) : do_something (next=step2 ) def step2 ( ) : do_something_else( ) step1 ()
With the actual steps appearing in the right order in the code .
I 'd debate that modifications to base classes like Object or Class in Ruby are across the board misguided .
Sometimes , being a clever little bugger is just what 's called for .
As for Ruby libs : unit / test .
Like manna from god damned heaven .
Is there anything special about unit / test ?
We all have unit testing libraries ; they are important , but I 'm leaving out lots of important things that do n't distinguish one language from the other .
Re : modification of base classes .
I imagine modification of Object could be necessary at times .
This is the flip side of Python 's magic methods -- where you can build defaults and other rules into the function that then optionally calls magic methods , in Ruby ( presumably ? ) you would create an implementation in Object that gets specialized as necessary .
That 's certainly the norm in Smalltalk , though I think there are some serious reason's to be concerned by how that effects the larger process and the many users of Object .
From the opposite end CLOS handles the same thing with generic functions , with substantially better decoupling ; in Python people are pushing in that direction with adaptation and generic functions , though that kind of development is not the form .
Along these lines , the experimental Javascript 2.0 spec adds namespaces to methods , mitigating the issues of adding methods to other classes .
An interesting way to address the problem .
# Ian Bicking Disclaimer : Read this post with the knowledge that I really only know enough about Ruby to be dangerous .
Hmm , no I do n't think there 's anything particularly standout about test / unit .
I just really REALLY like unit testing and I think I did n't understand what you meant about notable libraries .
Oh , actually , now that I think about it , optparse is pretty sweet and I 've never really seen anything like it other languages I 've used ( though I 'm not really up on Python , so it may have something similar ) RDoc here : http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/index.html
Back to Object mods :
Well , you know , it 's not too hard to do change localization in Object with the alias method .
Like : alias : meth , :old_meth def meth ... end and then when you 're done with being a clever bugger : alias : old_meth , : meth and Bob 's your Uncle , back to normal .
Not sure what you 're talking about with CLOS and adaptation and generic functions or JavaScript 2.0 as I 'm not up on that ( in fact , I 'm probablly not in a position to be talking about language features at all as it's certainly not my specialty ) .
I do n't think popping Object open and changing it around is the flip side of Python Magic Methods though .
Read the following section with the knowledge that I am no Ruby expert and know only of Python from mythical tales of its courage in battle :
From what I 've used of Ruby , it would seem that the actual flip side of Python " magic methods " is just using some standard method names , like " to_s " or " each " that behave like they should for the Object they 're inside of .
I think the " magic " is typically accomplished with mixins , Enumerable being the example used in the Pickaxe where you define " each " to get a bunch of the iterators and " <= > " if you want the rest ( I think defining " <= > " and including Enum also gives you Comparable , but you might need to add it explicitly ) and then if you want a special version of one of the methods the mixin adds , you just go ahead and change it .
I 'm gonna shut up now because if I keep talking , I 'm probablly going to misrepresent something and start a flamewar .
# Danno
Oh , actually , now that I think about it , optparse is pretty sweet and I 've never really seen anything like it other languages I 've used ( though I 'm not really up on Python , so it may have something similar ) .
http://docs.python.org/lib/module-optparse.html -- need I say more ?
optparse existed in Python under name of Optik since 2001 : http://optik.sourceforge.net/ and given apparent similarities in API , I even doubt whether Ruby one is clone of Python one .

I know neither Python nor Ruby at this point in my life , nor do I know PHP .
I 'm a pretty strong Perl programmer for general processing , although I 've never built anything complicated , like a web application , in Perl .
I have decided to learn Ruby , for two reasons : I also want to learn web application programming , and Ruby on Rails looks too good to pass up , and A couple of interesting applications in computer music , like gridflow , are Ruby - based .
I do n't really look for " power " in a language .
I look for code readability , a simple and stable core , and portability .
I have to admit that I prefer " strong typing " and languages with compilers that prevent you from making lots of mistakes -- in that respect , I think Ada is king of the hill .
I like the discipline to be built into the language and not supplied externally with processes and CASE tools .
But I also realize that most programmers I need to work with wo n't touch a language like that with a ten - foot pole .
The " new " languages -- Perl , Python , Ruby , PHP , etc. -- seem to be where the action is .
Ruby , to my knowledge , does not support OS ( preemptive ) threads , or if it does it is buggy ( or " experimental " ) and most code is not threadsafe .
This is getting addressed in the Sydney project and might get merged back to Ruby ( The YARV author wants to support native threads .
YARV is the VM that will be merged with Ruby for 2.0 ) .
See http://blog.fallingsnow.net/articles/category/Sydney
Python OS - level threads can be used to handle concurrency well when some threads are blocking on external sources ( disk access , network IO , waiting on a socket , etc ) .
This is usually also true for Ruby because it carefully uses non blocking constructs to implement IO .
Continuations are not widely used in real applications in either world , but they do open up the possibility for things like Borges ( how exactly Cherry Flow works in the absence of Stackless I 'm not sure ) .
They might not be the most popular thing , but note that Rails comes with support for breakpoints which depends on continuations .
Python has native Unicode objects , with very full support for everything Unicode implies .
Ruby does not have Unicode objects , only the ability to translate encodings , storing all strings as bytes .
From what I can tell the translation ( iconv ) relies on operating system libraries .
I expect this leads to significant portability concerns , though I do n't really know .
Ruby has minimal Unicode support -- this only means that it is possible for Ruby to recognize UTF8 characters instead of treating them as their bytes .
This is planned to get improved in Ruby 2.0 .
In Ruby I believe you can call class methods as part of the class definition ; these methods effect class definition .
Oh , and note that I had trouble submitting this posting because my last name contains a German umlaut -- this is one of the things that usually work with Rails applications . :)
And note that in this case class methods are no exception .
They are just methods defined on your class object ( or one of its ancestors ) .
I get the impression that a lot of Ruby 's metaprogramming is done through runtime source generation and eval .
This is possible in Python , but uncommon .
I agree with you in that this is bad style .
Ruby has the abilities that allow you to do dynamic things without introducing yourself to code injection and hard to debug errors .
I 'm not sure why DHH decided to go this way in Rails , but it is probably because it was started a while ago -- it could have been that eval ( ) was just the fastest way of getting it to run .
I think work is being done on replacing eval ( ) by more specific constructs in Rails .
Some Python programmers get in a tizzy because functions are not first - class in Ruby ( there is no functions , just messages called " methods " ) .
In Ruby you can still do method = 1.method ( :+ ) ; method.call(5 ) and it will do the right thing .
But I understand that you were really talking about obj.foo being a method invocation instead of a property lookup .
I 've written a bit of code to emulate the Python behavior at http://flgr.0x42.net/method-dict.rb
Also ,
Python 's use of functions that optionally call magic methods makes it easier to add backward - compatible functionality .
For instance , at one time comparisons ( like a < b ) only called __cmp__ method ( which returns - 1,0,1 ) ; now they call a more specific method ( like __lt__ for less - than ) and fall back on __cmp__ .
I 'm not sure if I get this argument .
In Ruby you can just override < by whatever you think is the best behavior or implement < => ( similar to __cmp__ ) and include Comparable and be done .
There is no reason for the language to change the behavior of < so there wo n't be any backwards compatibility trouble either .
If I 'm missing something feel free to correct me .
I think this is mostly an aesthetic concern , and aesthetic concerns do not relate to the " power " of a language
This is not entirely true .
Aesthetics will influence feature use .
This is used to good effect in Ruby -- globals try to look ugly , for example .
Any clever uses of the ability to modify base types in Ruby are , I think , misguided ; Python 's immutable base types mean that there are fundamental abstractions and capabilities that all Python users and libraries can rely upon .
This is an important part of Ruby and one that gives a lot of power to the user .
Want to read a File in chunks of N bytes ?
Add File#read_chunks_of ( ) and you are ready to go .
Think that there should be a way of detecting elements that appear multiple times in an Enumerable ?
Add Enumerable # find_collisions and you are done .
You are right in that the effect of open classes on stability has not been researched yet , but for Ruby it seems to work out fine so far -- good extensions get used a lot and spread .
Bad ones are just ignored .
There has been talk of introducing selector namespace ( which would allow for locally scoped modification of other classes ) but it is not yet certain how that feature will be implemented and how it will work in detail .
Ruby has the Safe module for running code in a restricted environment .
Ah , this is built - in functionality , not a module .
Formal interfaces ( Zope and PyProtocols ) ; both also include the adaptation of objects
This is the very thing I tried exploring with http://ruby-contract.rubyforge.org/
which does typing via run -time unit testing .
It also handles type adaption , method signatures and a few other features you would expect .
Pyrex and ctypes for integration with external libraries ( both languages support SWIG well )
There 's Ruby - DL which is part of Ruby 's standard library .
It allows you to wrap C libraries in Ruby in a very straight - forward way .
This is also been ( ab)used for http://rubyforge.org/projects/evil/
which uses Ruby - DL to get access to Ruby 's internal object structure which allows it to implement multiple inheritance , obj.class= and similar things in pure Ruby .
It has the name for good reasons , though .
py2exe and py2app for distribution of complete applications ( both languages are ameniable to normal distribution methods on Unixy systems )
http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/index.html and http://exerb.sourceforge.jp/index.en.html -- there is also various other utilities that do similar things .
Some of them just gather all the source code into a single file , others convert . tgz archives into Ruby scripts etc .
Numarray and scipy for dealing efficiently with large ( typically homogeneous ) datasets
http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/~masa/ruby/index-e.html and a lot more at http://sciruby.codeforpeople.com/sr.cgi/InterestingProjects
Psyco for various runtime optimizations
Hehe , Ruby 's mostly still working on this .
Keep an eye on http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby2c/ and the YARV effort , however .
Anyway , I think it shows that you tried to give both languages a chance and the conclusion that the two languages are very similar and will become even more similar in the future is one I will agree with .
Personally , I 'm mostly using Ruby over Python because the language gives me control when I tell it that I really need it -- Python seems to be more of the " the one way we thought it " mindset .
Let 's hope that we can continue to steal lots of good ideas from each other in the future !
Oh , and down with PHP while we 're at it !
Hi Florian ; I 'll try to fold some of your comments back into the document , but a couple clarifications :
They [ continuations ] might not be the most popular thing , but note that Rails comes with support for breakpoints which depends on continuations .
This would probably be possible in Python with threads , where you halt the thread with the breakpoint , and spawn another thread to take over the response .
The scalability issue is n't really a problem in this case ( as it would be if you were using continuations for something other than debugging , as in Borges ) .
Certainly easier to implement with continuations , though .
As an aside , I 've never actually liked breakpoints ...
In Ruby you can still do method = 1.method ( :+ ) ; method.call(5 ) and it will do the right thing .
But I understand that you were really talking about obj.foo being a method invocation instead of a property lookup .
I 've written a bit of code to emulate the Python behavior at http://flgr.0x42.net/method-dict.rb
True ; but I think it 's important to still emphasize that the real equivalency is n't that Ruby can act kind of like Python , but that the same things can be accomplished with it .
Of course , now that I look more closely at Ruby blocks , they do n't act like I thought they did ; they are n't really like Smalltalk blocks ( unless you use lambda ) .
Sigh ...
I guess I 'm still unsure what the equivalent idiom is .
( It took me a long time to figure it out , all considered ; this document goes more deeply into blocks than the other things I found . )
I 'm not sure if I get this argument .
[ about __cmp__ and __lt__ in Python ]
This is a specific issue that came up with Python ; in some ways it might be considered a flaw of Python 's magic methods , because Python initially used the ( seemingly ) clever technique of using __cmp__ for all of < <= > >= .
Later people wanted to distinguish between these operations .
All objects did n't grow __lt__ methods ( which in turn would call __cmp__ ) , but instead the protocol ( the series of methods that are tried ) were put into Python ( since the operators are a base part of Python ) .
But no particular case comes to mind where this kind of logic could n't be put into methods of Object ... of course , not in Python since there is no extensible base class .
This is an important part of Ruby and one that gives a lot of power to the user .
Want to read a File in chunks of N bytes ?
Add File#read_chunks_of ( ) and you are ready to go .
I accuse you of class - think ! ;)
I have lots of file - like objects that are n't files .
A read_chunks_of ( file ) function will work great on any file - like object ; File#read_chunks_of ( ) will only work on actual File ( or subclass ) objects .
Class - think breaks duck typing .
Extending classes is also hard to keep track of ; one of the most important aspects of Python namespaces is how reversable they are , so you can track where stuff comes from .
There has been talk of introducing selector namespace ( which would allow for locally scoped modification of other classes ) but it is not yet certain how that feature will be implemented and how it will work in detail .
People who consider these issues in Python are using adaptation now .
I 'm not entirely sold on adaptation , especially the extensive way Zope 3 is ( ab ) using it , but it does deal with that issue .
For instance , lets say you are making a CMS , and you want to add all sorts of methods to files that deal with workflow , parsing , etc -- you are using files as one of many basic content types .
You could simply add those CMS content methods to the file class .
But with adaptation you would make a wrapper that has the methods you want ( and only the methods you want ) , and register the wrapper as handling things with the file interface .
That means it will work with anything with the file interface ( not just the file class ) , and other people can make other wrappers for other kinds of objects .
And the whole thing is introspectable , and implies semantics in addition to signatures .
This way you do n't get collisions , you get objects that really are what you want them to be ( CMS content objects , not files posing as CMS content objects ) , but you also can use them as their " real " type ( if you make sure to adapt them back to I File ) .
I think adaptation makes sense .
But I also see places where adaptation is being used as generic functions ( multi- dispatch ) , and that 's a kludge .

Certainly easier to implement with continuations , though .
As an aside , I 've never actually liked breakpoints ...
Oh , ruby - breakpoint uses continuations for implementing Binding .of_caller .
This is necessary because a call to breakpoint ( ) should spawn an IRB shell at the right point with the caller 's context .
It is quite involved and a very specific situation , but it shows that continuations can be useful even outside of traditional flow control .
If you never actually liked breakpoints you should IMHO still have a look at this at http://ruby-breakpoint.rubyforge.org/
-- it is quite different to traditional stop and step debugging .
Of course , now that I look more closely at Ruby blocks , they do n't act like I thought they did ; they are n't really like Smalltalk blocks ( unless you use lambda ) .
Lots of experiments with that as well .
Ruby 1.9 did support variable = { puts ' Hello World ! ' } ; variable ( ) for a while , but I think that this really does belong more into languages that have method calls as field access plus call like Python and JavaScript .
Not that I dislike it -- I think both models have interesting unique benefits .
I accuse you of class - think ! ;)

Oh , sorry .
This was my error .
I should have said File. read_chunks_of which is similar to File.read -- in that case there is no trouble with reusability .
You still raise a valid point , though , and perhaps MixIns should be used even more in Ruby when adding new functionality .
For instance , lets say you are making a CMS , and you want to add all sorts of methods to files that deal with workflow , parsing , etc -- you are using files as one of many basic content types .
You could simply add those CMS content methods to the file class .

Yup , this is similar to ruby - contract -- but still , I think that wrappers are not always the best solution to problems .
If a good implementation of selector namespaces can be found I think it is besser for solving this specific problem .
( Even though it has not been a serious problem so far . --
I guess it is part of the Ruby mindset that being tolerant is usually a good idea , even if it might mean that you can step onto others toes . )
# Florian Gross [...]
I think that this [ bound methods ] really does belong more into languages that have method calls as field access plus call like Python and JavaScript .
Incidentally Javascript does n't really have this .
It was most confusing to me as a Python programmer .
Bob Ippolito described the situation well .

In practice most Python programmers get by just fine when they do stuff that risks name collision .
Some people say it 's just because the applications are small and reuse not that common ; and it 's people with an eye to big systems ( like Zope 3 people ) that are pushing for more isolation .
I 'm still not sure if it 's easier just to deal with problems when they occur , instead of trying to avoid all possible conflicts .
Especially in an open - source ecosystem -- when all code is open to change , and there is no " my code " and " not my code " -- I think problem - avoidance is n't as important as intelligent and cooperative problem - solving .
And of course we both have the option to monkey patch ( fix the code in - process , instead of on - disk ) .
# Ian Bicking
In my opinion Ruby is sexier but also more dangerous .
My 2 year old python code is easier to understand and maintain than my 2 year old ruby code ....
Since when can a programming language be sexy ?
The readability of code has a lot to do with the author 's grasp of the language as well .
You can write nasty code with any language , but Java is one of the few system that enforces nasty structure : Python : for i in range ( 6000 ) : x={} for j in range ( 1000 ) : x[j ] =i x[j ]
Java : import java.util .* ; public class test { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 6000 ; i++) { Map x = new HashMap( ) ; for ( int j = 0 ; j < 1000 ; j++ ) { Integer I=new Integer ( i ) ; Integer J=new Integer(j ) ; x.put ( I , J ) ; x.get ( I ) ; } } } } # Eric Radman Java 5.0 : import java.util .* ; public class
Test { public static void main ( String ... args ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < 6000 ; i++) { Map < Integer , Integer > map = new HashMap < Integer , Integer >( ) ; for ( int j = 0 ; j < 1000 ; j++ ) { map. put ( i , j ) ; map.get ( i ) ; } } } } But I 'm not sure what you 're getting at since this code does n't actually do anything .
# Brian Slesinsky
Perhaps my post disproves my own point to some .
I think the only thing I demonstrated was that it requires a lot more characters to write a program in Java that does nothing vs. a script in Python that does nothing .
My problem is that I assume the virtue of Python code is self - evident , and it's not , because it 's a matter of perspective .
I suspect that Perl appears to be insane to most Java programmers , but it does n't seem all that strange after writing a few things in Ruby .
# Eric Radman source
Here 's the ruby version , for completeness 6000 . times do |i| x = Hash. new 1000 . times do |j| x[ i ] =j puts x [ i ] #

From the Cherry Flow wiki page referenced : " The only catch is the back and refresh buttons wo n't work unless you run Stackless or Statesaver . " So , how does Cherry Flow work without Stackless ?
It does n't really .
Please forgive my uninformedness :
Is it possible to NOT distribute source of a web application in either python / pythonpaste / django or ruby / rails ( sort of like Java 's byte - code - only WARs ) ?
I 'm thinking of prototyping a webapp in one of these languages but do n't want to deliver my newbie code .
Thanks in advance for any reply .
It is possible to distribute the PYC files ( bytecode ) or PYO ( bytecode with docstrings stripped ) , but just as Java bytecode is hella easy to " decompile " pyc / pyo is trivial to get back into readable code blocks .

At the the beginning of this year it seemed as if everyone was complaining about how many frameworks are available for Python , and now as Python junkies are evaluating Ruby they have been touting the large number of libraries as one of Python strengths .
I understand the frustration with multiple frameworks , but the available options are also a big reason I 'm still using Python .
In some ways I like Ruby as a language more , but the range of libraries give me a more control .
Who knows ... as far as mass adoption is concerned , the framework or the available libraries may have more impact that the specific virtues of languages with as much synergy as Python and Ruby .
About OO : Ruby has the public , protected and private restrictions , while Python has n't ( even if private members can somewhat be __faked ) .
I 'm fairly new to Python ( 9 months or so ) , but there are two things I have found particularly frustrating .
I 'm curious to hear if Ruby has done better .
The GIL makes it difficult or impossible to control thread priority .
Debugging tools are weak , especially tools for debugging multithreaded programs .
Thanks for the great article !
Some ideas : I think Python 's property ( ) syntax is unwieldy compared with Ruby 's for the same functionality , which may be the reason there are so many getters and setters in Python code that could have been properties .
Concerning Ruby code blocks : I have some ideas where requiring named functions can be quite tedious in addition to asynchronous code .
Function actions in SCons .
The equivalent Rake syntax embodies this well : task : sometask do # ... end
I 've got code that repeats except for a place in the middle .
Instead of : def func ( ) : # ... skeleton_code ( params , func ) I could write : skeleton_code ( params ) do # ... end Assuming I name ' skeleton_code ' wisely , this is a readability gain .
Practically anywhere lambda is used , a stronger mechanism to pass a code block could be useful .
I agree it should n't be abused - even lambda 's limited power is abused too often .
I feel that naming close_db_resources in your example serves a great purpose - documentation - but I often find myself naming functions with no gain .
AFAIK , Python does not have lexical closures / scoping which function in the " usual " ( e.g. lisp , javascript ) or intuitive manner .
Lexically closed variables are read - only .
See http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_frm/thread/cf66057c1f9a9141/
for examples and details .
I can not speak about Ruby on this point , though I have been lead to believe that its closures are the " usual " kind .
Cheers !
Lexically closed variables are read - only .
Wrong .
Lexically closed names are read - only .
That 's because Python does n't distinguish between assignment and binding .
Ruby seems to do , though .
I actually find this counter - intuitive , as both assignment and binding use the same syntax .

Nice article !
One very important thing I miss in your article , however , is a comparison of documentation .
Good language and library documentation is as much a part of a language as its most common interpreter or its standard library itself , which you do address .
Finding your way in a language may actually depend a lot more on the actual docs available than on any " principle of least surprise " or whatever .
Only after using both Python and Ruby for various projects , I realised how important this is - coming partly from a PHP background .
No matter how ugly PHP as a language might be , its documentation , both in terms of quality of content as ease of use / accessibility , is way ahead of both Ruby 's and Python's .
I personally find the python documentation extensive , but very very messy .
A list of dict methods is here , things about how lists work is there , and please look underneath the table for string methods , thank you .
Oh and if you look in a totally different place , you 'll find that there are also global functions operating on strings , with the same names .
Naturally , we did not make a link between these two places .
To my experience , Ruby performs better here , having a very decent , but maybe a bit concise , reference for built - in classes and modules that is up to date .
Its standard library is , i believe , documented even worse than Python's , though ( but at least a bit more functionality is considered built - in ) .

One big difference is overriding or extending built - in type objects .
You mentioned the case of an operator , but like you said , that is n't a big deal .
But how about overriding existing , or adding new , str methods ?
You can't tell me that is n't useful !
In Ruby : class String def validate ( ) if ( self.include ? ( ' ' ) ) return false return true end end end puts (' This should have no spaces'.validate ( ) ) >> false In Python ( just a PoC ) : def validate ( ) : if ( ' ' in self ) : return False return True str.validate = validate print ( ' This should have no spaces'.validate ( ) ) >>
TypeError : ca n't set attributes of built - in / extension type ' str '
Do n't get me wrong - I like Python .
I use it alot ( in fact , these days , more often than Ruby ) .
I just wish it let me setattr on built - in objects .
# MonkeeSage Well .
Writing documentation for PHP is simpler that for Python or Ruby as PHP is only a collection of functions in a single namespace .
Not talking down to PHP in any way with that .
But it 's limited structure is quite simple to document .

Update : Christian has further suggested the British Psychological Society magazine The Psychologist .
All issues older than 6 months are completely free and the forum has a section where students can post questions about psychology or advertise their availability for work experience etc .
Christian is not an entirely disinterested party as he does work for the magazine , but as I do n’t , and regularly use it myself , I ’d certainly recommend checking it out .
The practice of practical psychology
As well as keeping up with other people ’s research , you ’re likely to getting to grips with some of your own .
Research , experimental design and data analysis are often the most challenging parts of the course for new students .
These sites might help with that challenge .
Experiments in Psychology
Free software that allows you to take part in some of psychology ’s classic experiments as a way of learning about experimental design and analysis .
Windows only unfortunately , but an interesting package nonetheless .

ARTNATOMY : overview
ARTNATOMYA is a Flash interactive english / spanish tool .
It is intended to facilitate the teaching and learning of the anatomical and biomechanical foundation of facial expression morphology .
The primary goal is to provide the student and those interested , a convenient reference tool , facilitating familiarity and experimentation with the underlying anatomical structures using correct biomechanical representation of the different facial expressions .
The task of the professor is also facilitated by the use of an expandable animated image ( employing a projector connected to the computer ) , in addition interaction ( controlled by the professor or students ) is multifunctional , since the different levels and independent functions allow connection of the application contents to any educational program , providing real time delivery of examples to the student .
If John G. Roberts Jr. is confirmed as William H. Rehnquist 's successor on the Supreme Court , the country will have not only a new chief justice but also a new political entity : the Roberts Court .
We speak easily of the Rehnquist Court or the Warren Court , managing to identify those complex institutions with a single individual .
But how does a chief justice put his stamp on the court ?
At a political moment that is as polarized as any in recent memory , many Americans crave a court that , unlike the current White House and Congress , will follow a moderate path , and they are looking anxiously to Roberts 's ideology for hints about the court 's direction .
A chief justice 's judicial philosophy is important ; but at the end of the day he has only one vote among nine .
The most effective tools that a chief justice has at his disposal for shaping a court have less to do with his ideology than with his temperament , which shapes his personal skills as a cajoler , diplomat and unifier -- in other words , as a boss for an unusually independent group of prima donnas .
Throughout history , the chief justices who have been best able to preserve the court 's reputation and legitimacy have been those with the most judicious dispositions .
A chief justice 's responsibilities are mostly procedural and organizational ; it's his prerogative , when he is in the majority , to write the opinion for the court or to assign the opinion to a justice he believes will reflect his legal views , as part of his broader efforts to build consensus behind the scenes .
John Marshall , who served from 1801 to 1835 and is widely considered the greatest chief justice in American history , was especially deft in exercising these powers .
Marshall took office without judicial experience ( in fact , 11 of the 16 chief justices have been appointed to the court without previously serving on it as associate justices ) , but like John Roberts , he had a reputation for an ability to argue both sides of an issue , for his bipartisan friendships and , above all , for a lack of pretense and a good nature .
( " I love his laugh -- it is too hearty for an intriguer , " wrote his friend and colleague Joseph Story . )
Marshall 's skill in establishing convivial personal relations among his fellow justices helped him to cement the court 's authority at a vulnerable moment in its early history .
Recognizing the virtues of leading with a light touch , Marshall wore a simple black robe rather than the scarlet and ermine that were traditional at the time .
And he insisted that his colleagues room together in the same boarding house , so that they could discuss cases over glasses of his excellent Madeira .
As a result of his sensitivity to the views of his political antagonists ( with the notable exception of Thomas Jefferson , whom he detested ) , Marshall was able to steer the court toward a middle ground and to speak for a unanimous court on the most divisive issues of his age .
Does your SQL statement have a WHERE clause ?
Is SELECT DISTINCT being used properly ?
Are you using UNION instead of UNION ALL ?
Are your stored procedures prefixed with ' sp_ ' ?
Are all stored procedures referred to as dbo.sprocname ?
Are you using temporary tables when you do n't need to ?
SELECT COLUMN1 , COLUMN2 , COUNTOFCOL3
FROM A_TABLE A
INNER JOIN ( SELECT COUNT( COLUMN3 ) AS COUNTOFCOL3 , COLUMN2
FROM B_TABLE B
INNER JOIN C_TABLE C ON B.ID = C.ID ) ON A.ID = B.ID
Are you using Cursors when you do n't need to ?
Derived tables
Sub-queries
CASE statements
Multiple queries
Temporary tables
Are your Transactions being kept as short as possible ?
Is SET NO COUNT ON being used ?
Are you using IN or NOT IN when you should be using EXISTS or NOT EXISTS ?
SELECT A_TABLE .COLUMN1
FROM A_TABLE
WHERE A_TABLE .COLUMN2 NOT IN ( SELECT A_TABLE2.COLUMN2
FROM A_TABLE2 )
SELECT A_TABLE .COLUMN1
FROM A_TABLE
WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT A_TABLE2.COLUMN2
FROM A_TABLE2
WHERE A_TABLE .COLUMN2 = A_TABLE2.COLUMN2 )
Do you have a function that acts directly on a column used in a WHERE clause ?
SELECT A_TABLE .LASTNAME
FROM A_TABLE
WHERE SUBSTRING ( FIRSTNAME , 1,1 ) = 'm '
SELECT A_TABLE .LASTNAME
FROM A_TABLE
WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE = 'm % '
Where you have a choice of using the IN or BETWEEN clauses
SELECT A_TABLE.NAME
FROM A_TABLE
WHERE A_TABLE .NUMBER IN ( 100 , 101 , 102 , 103 )
SELECT A_TABLE.NAME
FROM A_TABLE
WHERE A_TABLE .NUMBER BETWEEN 100 AND 103
Are you doing excessive string concatenation in your stored procedure ?
Have you checked the order of WHERE clauses when using AND ?
Locate the least likely true AND expression first .
This way , if the AND expression is false , the clause will end immediately , saving time .
If both parts of an AND expression are equally likely being false , put the least complex AND expression first .
This way , if it is false , less work will have to be done to evaluate the expression .
Have you checked that you are using the most efficient operators ?
=
> , >= ,
LIKE
<>
A colleague of mine has been looking at SQL Server performance , and come up with a great set of tips ( mostly gleaned from this website ) : I know this sounds obvious , but do n't retrieve more data than you need .
However , less obvious is that even if your SELECT statement retrieves the same quantity of data without a WHERE clause , it may run faster with one .
Again , pretty obvious , but using SELECT DISTINCT where no duplicate records are being returned is an unnecessary performance hit .
If you are getting duplicate records , first double check your table joins as this is often the cause and only use the DISTINCT clause if you really need it .
A UNION statement effectively does a SELECT DISTINCT on the results set .
If you know that all the records returned are unique from your union , use UNION ALL instead , it is much quicker .
Any stored procedures prefixed with ' sp_ ' are first searched for in the Master database rather than the one it is created in .
This will cause a delay in the stored procedure being executed .
When calling a stored procedure you should include the owner name in the call , i.e. use EXEC dbo.spMyStoredProc instead of EXEC spMyStoredProc .
Prefixing the stored procedure with the owner when executing it will stop SQL Server from placing a COMPILE lock on the procedure while it determines if all objects referenced in the code have the same owners as the objects in the current cached procedure plan .
Although there is sometimes a benefit of using temporary tables , generally they are best eliminated from your stored procedure .
Do n't assume that retrieving data multiple times is always less efficient than getting the data once and storing it in temporary table as often it is n't .
Consider using a sub-query or derived table instead of a temporary table ( see examples below ) .
If you are using a temporary table in lots of JOINS in you stored procedure and it contains loads of data , it might be beneficial to add an index to your temporary table as this may also improve performance .
An example of a derived table instead of a temporary tableCursors of any kind slow down SQL Server 's performance .
While in some cases they are unavoidable , often there are ways to remove them from your code .
Consider using any of these options instead of using a cursor as they are all faster :
If you are use SQL transactions , try to keep them as short as possible .
This will help db performance by reducing the number of locks .
Remove anything that does n't specifically need to be within the transaction like setting variables , select statements etc .
By default , every time a stored procedure is executed , a message is sent from the server to the client indicating the number of rows that were affected by the stored procedure .
You can reduce network traffic between the server and the client if you do n't need this feature by adding SET NO COUNT ON at the beginning of your stored procedure .
If you are using IN or NOT IN in a WHERE clause that contains a sub-query you should re-write it to use either EXISTS , NOT EXISTS or perform a LEFT OUTER JOIN .
This is because particularly the NOT IN statement offers really poor performance .
The example below probably better explains what I mean : e.g .
This SQL statement : Could be re-written like this :
If you apply a function to a column used in the WHERE clause of your SQL statement , it is unlikely that the SQL statement will be able to make use of any indexes applied to that column .e.g . Could be re-written :
Use the BETWEEN clause as it is much more efficiente .g.
This SQL statement : Should be re-written like this :
Where possible , avoid doing loads of string concatenation as it is not a fast process in SQL Server .
If you have a WHERE clause that includes expressions connected by two or more AND operators , SQL Server will evaluate them from left to right in the order they are written ( assuming that no parenthesis have been used to change the order of execution ) .
You may want to consider one of the following when using AND : Often you do n't have much of a choice of which operator you use in your SQL statement .
However , sometimes there is an alternative way to re-write your SQL statement to use a more efficient operator .
Below is a list of operators in their order of performance ( with the most efficient first ) .
David Brent would never approve .
' Brainstorming ' , the buzz term used by executives to generate ideas among their staff , has been deemed politically incorrect by civil servants because it is thought to be offensive to people with brain disorders .
Instead staff at the Department of Enterprise , Trade and Investment ( DETI ) in Belfast will use the term ' thought - showers ' when they get together to think creatively .
A spokeswoman said : ' The DETI does not use the term brainstorming on its training courses on the grounds that it may be deemed pejorative . '
Sources inside the department said there was concern that the term would cause offence to sufferers of epilepsy as well those with brain tumours or brain injuries .
But the Campaign for Plain English complained that the decision had ' reached the point of real ridicule ' .
John Wild , its spokesman , said : ' You do sometimes wonder if some people have n't got anything better to do with their time .
Do they just sit down and search out enough words until eventually they can say , " I can make that out to be politically incorrect " ?
' Of course there are certain terms that should be deemed out of bounds but then sometimes things go too far . '
The move follows that of the Welsh Development Agency , responsible for promoting business in Wales , which ran a series of courses last year to teach staff to be more politically correct .
' Brainstorming ' was on its list of banned words , as well as ' nit - picking ' and ' manila ' , because of their origins in the slave trade .
The WebInno group featured two main presenters .
The first was for a product to let business people use mobile devices to learn about other business people they were going to meet .
I was more interested in the device that projected the cell phone image than in the presentation .
Plum , the second presentation , won me over when the presenter showed how it could be used to " collect " web pages not just as URLs , but as a snapshot / archive , avoiding link rot .
I started thinking about all the different ways that was useful and did n't pay much attention to the rest of the presentation .
I 'm sure the " official " bloggers will give details .
Schmoozing was definitely the high point of the evening .
With shutterfly desupporting its c4p program , I had been looking for a replacement service that will ease printing of independently - hosted photos .
I had even asked around .
It seemed nobody wanted our money .
I met someone from digibug .
They want our money .
PHP
Gallery is already planning on using them in their next release .
Having been busy with non-print improvements , I probably would n't have found out about digibug for a long time had I not gone to WebInno .
Ned Batchelder introduced himself , and I asked what he was working on .
He showed me Tabblo .
The service officially launches May 15 , but some information about it already leaked out .
Ned talked about how popular photo - sharing services do n't work with text well , and how working with photos on popular blog sites leaves much to be desired .
( I could n't agree more ; that 's what motivated ourdoings.com . )
He showed me how you could choose a layout , drag photos onto it , and put text in the empty spaces .
No Flash player required , all JavaScript .
Families / groups can collaborate to build a tabblo .
You 'll be able to order posters ( and I expect other memorabilia ) based on your tabblo .
They 'll render an image of a tabblo that you can post to a blog , but in my mind the memorabilia are the real selling point of tabblo , which is important because that 's where their revenue will come from .
Easy / fast online storytelling with large numbers of photos is the emphasis of ourdoings.com , so tabblo is n't exactly a competitor .
But it 's good to at least know of another site in the telling - your - story - with - photos space .
Other useful feedback : I should have business cards .
I called myself the world 's worst marketer , and one venture capitalist agreed .
Another , after a two - minute tour of ourdoings.com , said it had " a lot of meat , but no sizzle . "

My idea for adding sizzle is to have an online , self - run demo that 's easy to jump into .
New users would see the compelling features without going through the register / login process , and have the opportunity to make their experimentation permanent at the end .
Still , this does n't require Web 2.0 technology , bright colors , or rounded corners .
But I 'm looking for the solution to fit a problem , not looking for a problem to fit a solution .
Despite the great usefulness of the schmoozing part of the program , I do think the demos could be a few minutes longer and include time for group Q/A and discussion .
This would be an adjustment , not a major change .
Overall , I think the WebInno group has put together a great forum .

Conversational writing kicks formal writing 's ass
If you want people to learn and remember what you write , say it conversationally .
This is n't just for short informal blog entries and articles , either .
We 're talking books .
Assuming they 're meant for learning , and not reference , books written in a conversational style are more likely to be retained and recalled than a book on the same topics written in a more formal tone .
Most of us know this intuitively , but there are some studies to prove it .
Your sixth grade English teacher warned you against writing the way you talk , but she was wrong .
Partly wrong , anyway .
Then again , we are n't talking about writing the way you talked when you were 12 .
Or even the way you talk when you 're rambling .
What most people mean when they say " write the way you talk " is something like , " the way you talk when you 're explaining something to a friend , filtering out the ' um ' , ' you know ' , and ' er ' parts , and editing for the way you wish you 'd said it . "
So why are n't more technical books or articles written this way ?
One computer book author ( who hates my books ) sent me an email saying , " With your books , you want people to have fun " ( he said it like that was a bad thing , but that 's a different issue ) .
" But with my books , I have a reputation as a consultant to think about , and I want people to have the impression of , ' listen carefully , because I 'm only going to say this once . ' "
Whatever .
I 've talked about the danger of writing a book from the perspective of what it will do for you vs. what it means for the user in How to write a non-fiction bestseller .
Unless the book is a reference book , where precision matters over understanding , and the writing is meant to be referred to not read and learned from , there are almost NO good reasons for a tech book to be written in a formal ( i.e. non-conversational ) style .
Much of the time , it 's an indication that the author is thinking way too much about himself , and how he will be perceived .
( Or she , of course , but to be perfectly sexist here -- this does seem to be more of a guy thing -- the " I 'm more technically serious than thou " phenomenon . )
Sometimes it 's simply because so many technical books are written that way , and it 's just conventional inertia ( " if the other books are written like that , and they sell , this must be the way it 's done " ) .
Other times , it 's the author 's of way of showing respect for both the topic and the reader - - a valid goal , but an ineffective ( and unneeded ) approach .
And now we know that it 's usually wrong , and users / readers are starting to fight back against painfully dry books , no matter how technically pure the content .
A study from the Journal of Educational Psychology , issue 93 ( from 2000 ) , looked at the difference in effectiveness between formal vs. informal style in learning .
In their studies , the researchers ( Roxana Moreno and Richard Mayer ) looked at computer - based education on botany and lightning formation and " compared versions in which the words were in formal style with versions in which the words were in conversational style . "
Their conclusion was :
" In five out of five studies , students who learned with personalized text performed better on subsequent transfer tests than students who learned with formal text .
Overall , participants in the personalized group produced between 20 to 46 percent more solutions to transfer problems than the formal group . "
They mention other related , complimentary studies including :
" ... people read a story differently and remember different elements when the author writes in the first person ( from the " I / we " point of view ) than when the author writes in the third person ( he , she , it , or they ) .
( Graesser , Bowers , Olde , and Pomeroy , 1999 ) .
Research summarized by Reeves and Nass ( 1996 ) shows that , under the right circumstances , people " treat computers like real people . "
So one of the theories on why speaking directly to the user is more effective than a more formal lecture tone is that the user 's brain thinks it's in a conversation , and therefore has to pay more attention to hold up its end !
Sure , your brain intellectually knows it is n't having a face - to - face conversation , but at some level , your brain wakes up when its being talked with as opposed to talked at .
And the word " you " can sometimes make all the difference .
One striking part of the Moreno / Mayer study is how similar the actual content was .
Here 's the before and after example from the beginning of the lesson they studied :
Formal
" This program is about what type of plants survive on different planets .
For each planet , a plant will be designed .
The goal is to learn what type of roots , stem , and leaves allow the plant to survive in each environment .
Some hints are provided throughout the program . "
Conversational
" You are about to start a journey where you will be visiting different planets .
For each planet , you will need to design a plant .
Your mission is to learn what type of roots , stem , and leaves will allow your plant to survive in each environment .
I will be guiding you through by giving out some hints . "
And from another perspective , consider what former Wired editor Constance Hale wrote in Sin and Syntax :
" The second - person pronoun ( you ) lets the author hook the reader as if in conversation .
Call it cozy .
Call it confiding .
You is a favorite of the Plain English folks , who view it as an antidote to the stiff impersonality of legalese and urge bureaucrats to write as if speaking to the public ... "
She goes on to give a pile of great examples .
We believe one of the biggest mistakes is to dismiss the things that work in teaching younger people by saying that they somehow do n't work for adults .
That 's wrong .
At the highest level , anyway .
Obviously the implementation of a kid's learning book and one for adults will be different , and different subjects often require dramatically different approaches , but at the core , virtually all brains learn the same way -- through emotional response ( which in turn triggers the brain to pay more attention and possibly record to long - term storage ) .
And engaging in a conversation has the potential to turn up the emotional gain much more than a dry , lifeless text or lecture .
If your brain had a bumper sticker , it would say :
I heart conversation .

So true .
I do n't have a reference but there was a study at least 25 years ago that took some college level textbooks in various courses and rewrote them to target young kids ( grade school / junior high , IIRC ) .
The books were used and the kids were tested on their knowledge of the material and it compared to the results of the college students .
I recall a conversation I had with a teaching guru at the time and one of the hurdles that came up with this was that the publishers did n't think that they could continue charging the outrageous amounts that they do for such " easy " textbooks ( both in terms of their greed and because people would n't be as willing to part with as much money as for the convoluted , formal versions ) and that authors resisted that suggestion because if it was n't formal enough then they would n't e.g. , get the same recognition from their bosses / peers ( in the academic publish - or - perish world ) .
Posted by : John D. Mitchell | Sep 6 , 2005 5:00:16 PM
I could n't agree more with your post .
Thanks for making this necessary point !
Could the reason we prefer a more conversational style is because it's more authentic than using nothing but $.50 words , in addition to all your other excellent points ?
That 's my take anyway .
Posted by : Phil Gerbyshak | Sep 6 , 2005 9:12:30 PM
Maybe that 's why so many people do n't feel somehow quite * trained * in a thing unless they 've gone on some horribly expensive 3 day plus course , and had a teacher there engaging them in conversation about the subject ?
Even if they 've read and worked through the tutorial books , bought the reference manuals , and even done some genuine work with the technology , until they 've had a full - on session of a number of days conversing with ( hopefully ) an expert in the subject while doing the thing at the same time , it 's not quite sunk in .
Posted by : Matt Moran | Sep 6 , 2005 11:13:15 PM
Well we do and engage in conversations through out the day .
I 've attended courses where formal talk made it suck so bad that I forgot it all .
Infact I wanted to leave right away .
But I 'm seeing ( Lemme remember aahh yeah read a book last week about Google AdSense ) and this guy was doing so much of conversation that I began to wonder if he had anything * special* to tell .
Well as I reached the last page I realized that he did n't .
That sucked too .
It 's hard to train people / write books when you 're a " stuck up formal " story teller BUT beware of " I do n't know my stuff so I 'll just kid " .
What I personally do ( when I teach / train ) and expect from new - age writers is simple :
o Make sure we 're ALL having fun
o Don't forget to put people to work
o Keep it in " WorkShop " mode ( I gave a little English lesson to a local school a few months back , it was a sort of a marathon and was 10:30 in the night , the kids were so excited , so was I !
I hear parents still talk about it )
o Keep it fun but also exciting help watch everyone ( when I mean everyone it also includes you ) grow / learn new things
o In IT related courses DON'T just show examples , but exersizes and be able to demostrate stuff .
Bottom line is you have to address to all parts of Human Brain .
Not too boring and not too much fun .
I personally prefer to keep my style a little unpredictable this way I can play on the general mood that the class has ( I had to learn it the hard way when I taught / trained staff on board ships regarding safety / fire drills / boat drills , and the staff knew exactly what to expect ) .
That way I can slowly work on making them get interested .

To be honest , I was totally against your argument when I read the first two sentences .
I changed my mind when I realized there was a difference between good conversational writing and the rambling , unfocused blogs and forum posts I often encounter .
I totally agreed with you by the time you got to the planets example .
From my own life , I am currently reading Sophie 's World and I find the conversational style makes an introduction to philosophy much more palatable .

Matt : " Maybe that 's why so many people do n't feel somehow quite * trained * in a thing unless they 've gone on some horribly expensive 3 day plus course , and had a teacher there engaging them in conversation about the subject ? "
IME , there 's a couple of key facets to that .
A big one is that people learn by experience .
The in - person training tends to give more chances for real experience to take place .
Another facet is that having an " expert " available to talk with changes how people perceive the information .
This is part of the " you get out what you put in " sentiment .
I.e. , for some people , putting out the time / effort and money to go to an expensive class ups ( at least slightly :-) their level of commitment / intensity and that changes what they are able to get out of the experience .
On the more skeptical side , I find that people carry a lot of conscious and unconscious expectations about what " training " has to look and act like .
I.e. , if it does n't look " formal " enough , it can't be serious , educational , etc .
So , people look for those psuedo - signals to distinguish and select e.g. training even though we know those signals are n't trustworthy and those training styles are n't nearly as effective in terms of the students ' actually learning .

" Much of the time , it 's an indication that the author is thinking way too much about himself , and how he will be perceived . "
Grady Booch , in a nutshell .
Ugh .
His name has become a byword among my programmer friends for pompous , unreadable deskweights .
It reads like your most full - of - himself professor only _dreamed_ of sounding like .
And after you spend the time to decode a few paragraphs , you cry " Is THAT all you meant to say ! ? "
So many words , so little content .
You can tell that he 's thinking about his image every time he sits down to write .
Posted by : Tom Biggs | Sep 7 , 2005 9:27:46 AM
This ties in nicely with your previous post ....
Often it 's the editors that impose the formal style .
My first book for Wiley ( The Notes and Domino Programming Bible ) was done in the personal style ( eg. " you should always remember that you have to ack before you oof ..... " ) .
For my second book ( The XML Programming Bible ) , the editor decided that the personal style was too informal and wrong , a battle I fought but did not win .
So was forced to rewrite the text to formal ( " developers should always remember that they have to ack before they oof ..... " ) was my compromise .
Later , after I submitted my final draft , it was apparently decided that the personal style was OK , and the text was rewritten to the personal style .
Unfortunately , the twits who did the rewriting did n't proofread their obvious 2 - minute global search and replace .
The result : unreadable sentences like " you should always remember that they have to ack before they oof ..... " ) .
For anyone who had to suffer thouygh these sentences you have my sympathy , but it was n't my fault .....
Posted by : Brian Benz | Sep 7 , 2005 10:20:02 AM
I think I 'm in agreement with the psychology , but not the rejection of formal forms .
Normally things are formalized so that a process is complete .
You need to prove mathematical statements .
You need to argue your politics with rigour , avoiding staw men , and so forth .
But I 'd agree with making the process human , being direct , introducing anecdotes , and a pinch of humour , to make the process more memorable .
I actually found the " botany learning scenario " clearer in the formal format .
The second one focussed too much on the game , and when it introduced a mission , in terms of the gameplay it was a pointless mission .
If the mission had been to educate future colonists , then learning would be implicit and would have made more sense .
But it was not really a mission within the game at all .
I 've read that people follow documentation better if it is task oriented , The task was clear in the formal version .
I think one can introduce directness , mnemonics etc without losing rigour .
But then , I do n't think you are advocating rejection of rigor : the structure of the entry has a clear {beginning , middle , end} and there 's lots of citations in it .
And well - structured writing is also based on how the brain works : it is to get around the fact that brains are pretty sloppy at this sort of thing most of the time .

Posted by : Jennifer Apple | Sep 7 , 2005 11:10:47 AM
A colleague pointed this article out because he knows I detest the use of ' you ' in technical documentation .
I am still not persuaded .
The use of ' you ' is always redundant in technical documents .
A guide or manual is always directing someone to do an action .
In conversation , one never says , " You do this .
Now , you do that . "
They might say , " You should do this . "
Then I would argue that the use of ' should ' is not appropriate either .
Either ' do ' or ' do n't do ' or ' consider before doing ' .
I 'll agree that a less formal style may be more effective at engaging a reader 's interest , but I do not believe the notion that ' friendly ' documentation is a trend to follow .
I do n't go to Morton 's to get hamburger , and I wo n't write technical documentation aimed at a 6th grader ( unless it 's for the Marketing side of the house , and then all bets are off ) .

The Moreno and Mayer study had psychology students as the subject population , and most certainly cannot be generalised beyond that population .
Furthermore , many universities enforce psych studencts to be part of ' subject pools ' for the first year or two , so the population may well be very junior students .
Ccombine this with the fact that the expansion of student numbers over recent years has been so great that many of these students may not have even got into university a few years ago .
The relevance of this ?
It 's quite possible that the population studied could have been people who had never even read whole books before ( Frank Furedi 's good on this ) .
It could be that the reason a conversational style was more effective for them was just that they were not particularly accustomed to or skilled at self - directed reading for study purposes ( also , if you look at the original study , the effects were only slightly significant for reading as opposed to listening ) .
My ( untested ) hypothesis : skilled , active readers use critical self - talk all the time when reading and do n't need to be patronised by the writer .
It 's all about the specific audience you 're writing for .
Posted by : noisyjazzman | Sep 10 , 2005 7:25:38 AM
I do think it 's * very * dependent on the audience , true .
And I did make the point ( perhaps not clearly enough , given your comment ) that the * implementation * of a book for an adult is going to look and feel different from a book geared toward someone younger ( and vary with the topic as well ) .
But wow -- " conversational " does not necessarily mean " patronizing " !
And while I doubt this was your intention ( and you do bring up a valid point about the study ) , your comment comes close to insulting the nearly quarter - million programmers who are choosing our books .
Our readers * are * software engineers , or at the least -- computer programmers with an interest in applying reusable patterns to solve complex problems .
Our readers are indeed " skilled , active readers " and quite capable of learning from a more traditional academic text -- they simply choose * not* to , when given a choice .
Our readers kick ass : )
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Sep 10 , 2005 7:31:58 PM
I certainly did n't mean to insult your readers or books .
A conversational tone is often entirely appropriate ( even for intelligent adults ! ) , and a formal one often unnecessarily stuffy .
But academics , for example , are constantly being leaned on these days by bureaucrats to make their content ' relevant ' for the sake of ' inclusion ' , where what they actually mean is that they want the content dumbed - down in order to ensure students / customers are not challenged .
It is simply true to the nature of many types of content that they * should * try to challenge readers , and one means for this sometimes is to use complex language , as distanced as possible from the corporate / populist culture de jour .
All I really am saying is that studies such as this do n't imply that much marvellous writing ( often ' formal ' compared to corporate writing ) ought to be changed in any way .
If they * are * so taken ( and you just have to see the explosion in crappy Powerpoint to see that it is likely to happen ! ) then it may amount to condescension .
Horses for courses , and all that .
Posted by : noisyjazzman | Sep 10 , 2005 11:12:49 PM
To Kathy 's point ( in comments two above this one ) - I think people that have the Head First Patterns book probably have the hard bound original GoF title as well .
They probably had the GoF book first .
Now , for those of you who do n't know the GoF Patters book ( GoF = gang of four - the cute name everyone has come up with to refer to the four authors ) is a hard bound , very academic and somewhat inaccessible tome .
It 's brilliant and people struggle through it because it 's brilliant .
But it 's kind of like reading Chaucer or Beowolf - it 's a lot of work just to get to the message , then you have to digest the message .
The Head First treatment presents the patterns as the Gof book but it makes it fun and easier .
In a comment to another post a reader said that they wanted a Head First Biology book for their daughter .
I think this is a good example - image Head First Differential Equations , Linera Algebra , Quantum Physics , Statistical Analysis .
This would change everything .
It 's not that readers of Head First can't learn the other way - we 're just bright enough and open minded enough to realize that other ways might be more efficient .
If you read Head Fisrt ( really read , not flip through ) and feel patronized then you might have some bigger issues .

I probably will never read the books as I no longer work in IT nor do much programming these days .
But I 'm quite happy to take your word for it that they 're find and appropriate .
There are many beautifully - written books of effortless simplicity .
But I would say that anyone who finds the GoF books hard to read has a problem !
' Education ' is n't about efficiently stuffing knowledge into a brain for instrumental purposes .
It 's about availing oneself of the best of our civilisation .
Anyone of normal who has made the attempt to do so would be able to read the GoF books without problems .

The Washington Post is reporting today that the FBI lied to a secret tribunal of Federal Judges authorized to issue search warrants in national security cases :
FBI agents repeatedly provided inaccurate information to win secret court approval of surveillance warrants in terrorism and espionage cases , prompting officials to tighten controls on the way the bureau uses that powerful anti-terrorism tool , according to Justice Department and FBI officials .
The errors were pervasive enough that the chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , Colleen Kollar - Kotelly , wrote the Justice Department in December 2005 to complain .
She raised the possibility of requiring counterterrorism agents to swear in her courtroom that the information they were providing was accurate , a procedure that could have slowed such investigations drastically .
A internal FBI review in early 2006 of some of the more than 2,000 surveillance warrants the bureau obtains each year confirmed that dozens of inaccuracies had been provided to the court .
The errors ranged from innocuous lapses , such as the wrong description of family relationships , to more serious problems , such as citing information from informants who were no longer active , officials said .
10 Ways of Being a Geek Makes you More Attractive
1. Smart is the new sexy and surely no one can deny it .
2 . It ’s hip to be a geek .
Everyone should forget the stereotype of thick glasses , hiding their faces behind their laptops , an obsession with star trek , and avoiding eye contact .
Time has changed : geeks are often fashionable , hip individuals who are very aligned with the trends of their own generation .
And the glasses make them geeky boys hella sexy .
3 . You geek out on more than just your computer .
Geek has more than just a book and video games collection .
Ever seen the movie collection of a film geek ?
Ever seen the body of a fitness geek ?
They can be more than smoking hot .
The tenacity of someone like us , when applied to hobbies outside computers and the like , can yield impressive results .
4 . Geek humor .
It ’s quite a shame if you do n’t understand their jokes .
Geek humor is the best humor .
This is perhaps biased opinion , but I ’ve never laughed as hard as I have while reading some of the random , funny things that came out of geek culture .
“ A web designer is filling out a form : Age : 31 Height : 5 ’9 ” Eye color : # 008000 ”
5 . You listen to good music .
Geek and rock sound like an incompatible couple .
A geek who rocks ?
Guess what ?
They do work out great and fit perfectly .
Geeks have access to tools that allow us to hear music that extends well beyond the top 40 radio .
Want the entire discography of Aphex Twin by tomorrow afternoon ?
Ask a geek .
Not only do they listen to good music , they can find just about anything you ’re looking for in a heartbeat .
6 . You make good money .
If there ’s one stereotype about geeks that usually rings true , it ’s that they rarely have trouble earning a decent income .
Genius gets paid well .
Are n’t Bill Gates , Mark Zuckerberg the two obvious living proof ?
And you all know how much they made , right ?
Find me a developer or a doctor has no money .
I dare you .
7 . You fix stuff .
Everyone loves a handyman , especially one that can fix one of the most frustrating devices ever conceived : a personal computer .
Computer problem , your fridge does n’t work ?
Call your geeky man immediately and show him some love for the night .
8 . You ’ve got your stuff going on .
Who can stand a clingy boyfriend and wo n’t give you some quality alone time ?
You ’ll never meet a geek who runs out of things to do , they ’ve got lots of hobbies and interests and are more than happy to dive headfirst into one of those when they ’ve got some spare time .
In other words : they wo n’t rely on you to give them a life .
Ca n’t get enough of independent and creative men .
9 . You ’re very articulate .
Your geeky men never stop surprising you with his incredible intelligence .
Compulsively reading a few hundred RSS feeds a day yields a vocabulary that could put most college English majors to shame .
10 . You ’re passionate .
When a geek is interested in something , they become completely involved in it entirely .
This intense passion can extend to many areas of a geek ’s life , not just computers , and hobbies .
And furthermore , imagine when he has his eyes all over you .
That is the basis on which the advocates of US primacy have always defended its legitimacy .
Paul Wolfowitz 's famous Defence Planning Guidance paper of 1992 talked about the need for the US to " account sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established economic and political order " .
Far from being the conceit of neoconservative intellectuals , faith in the benign effect of US power was shared by Republicans and Democrats alike .
Things look very different today .
The intervention in Iraq has strengthened the very forces of extremism and violence it was meant to weaken , with the result that we are in much greater danger .
The Bush administration continues to drag its heels on the environment and prevent the action needed to meet an even greater threat in the form of climate change .
The US 's unwillingness to address its $ 764bn trade deficit and its determination to continue consuming beyond its means is responsible for global economic imbalances that threaten meltdown and worldwide depression .
Instead of acting as a provider of global public goods , the US looks more like a global free rider , using its power selfishly and irresponsibly to the detriment of the greater good .
A common mistake is to see this as a reflection of the American character , rather than as the inevitable consequence of unrestrained power .
The truth is that any other nation in the US 's position would do the same and probably much worse .
Dominant powers are always prone to trampling on the interests and rights of others .
The problem with US hegemony is that it 's hegemonic , not that it 's American .
As Vladimir Putin pointed out in a speech at the weekend ( an extract of which was published on these pages ) , the unipolar model is inherently flawed because it concentrates power in ways that are unhealthy and undemocratic .
Very true , but how strange to hear it from the lips of the Russian president .
In each of the criticisms he levelled at the US , more or less the same could be said about the government he leads .
Putin deplores America 's conduct of the war on terror , but the brutality of his assault on Chechnya makes the abuses at Guantánamo look mild by comparison .
The bullying of Russia 's neighbours through energy cut - offs , trade embargoes and the sponsorship of local insurgencies shows scant regard for the high - minded diplomatic principles espoused in his speech .
And when it comes to ripping up treaties and ignoring international law , Putin has little to learn from Bush .
He refuses to accept Russia 's obligations as a signatory of the Energy Charter Treaty , for instance , and prefers the unilateral use of energy dominance for geopolitical and commercial advantage .
Putin's only real objection to a unipolar world order is that Russia is not the unipole .
In every other respect his foreign policy doctrine is similar to the neoconservative approach he purports to oppose .
Anyone who takes his concern for democratic standards seriously has n't been paying enough attention to the erosion of political and civil rights under his leadership .
Britain , along with the rest of Europe , certainly needs a strategy for creating a more balanced and legitimate distribution of global power , but it should n't be one that follows Jacques Chirac 's efforts to offset US influence through big power summitry with an authoritarian Russia .
It must be one that is true to Europe 's democratic values .
Of course , the concept of power balancing is in itself controversial .
For some , such as Tony Blair , the suggestion that US power needs to be balanced is evidence of anti-Americanism .
But his alternative of seeking influence in Washington has been given more than a fair wind , and he has precious little to show for it .
There is an alternative that allows Europe to pursue an effective power balancing strategy without resort to the cynical realpolitik of old , and it has been made possible by the remarkable political transformations of the last three decades .
Almost two - thirds of the world 's population , accounting for three - quarters of nation states , now live under democratic rule .
It is those states collectively that form the body of legitimate world opinion and must be mobilised .
US policymakers have marginalised the United Nations on the grounds that universal membership confers power and legitimacy on despots and tyrants .
But what was striking about the debate on Iraq was the fact that most world democratic opinion was opposed to America 's approach .
The objective of power balancing must be to ensure it is brought to bear more effectively in future .
India will , on current trends , overtake China to become the world 's most populous country by the middle of the century .
Unlike China , it is an established democracy and ought to be a natural ally in any attempt to create a more balanced and democratic world order .
Another priority should be South America , where the democratic gains of the last 20 years have been as great as those of eastern Europe .
Its regional trade blocks , the Andean Community and Mercosur , are in the process of merging to form a South American Community of Nations modelled on the EU .
With a population of 361 million , there are plans for a single market , a common currency and a common foreign policy .
Around these three poles - Europe , India and South America - it would be possible to galvanise a new global democratic sentiment that rejects unipolarist assumptions without being antagonistic towards the US .
The end of American primacy is coming , whether Washington likes it or not .
The choice is between a bipolar system in which it faces an authoritarian and increasingly confident China , or a multipolar order in which it can share the challenges of global leadership with other centres of democratic power .
The shift from unipolarity to a democratic multipolarity should be our common project of the 21st century .

Google has defended the integrity of its news service after it emerged that reports filed by the British National party are being listed as sources on its website .
In the week that the leader of the British National party , Nick Griffin , appears in court on charges of inciting racial hatred after being secretly filmed by a BBC documentary team , the BNP 's news reports are being listed on Google News alongside those from organisations such as the BBC and Reuters .
One article , written by the BNP 's south - east England " correspondent " about the trial of six men accused of murdering 16 - year - old Mary - Ann Leneghan , is the first news source listed when searching under the dead girl 's name .
The article , which accused the BBC of double standards in not reporting the colour of the defendants in the case , is listed ahead of reports from the BBC , Reuters , Channel 4 , the Times and the Telegraph .
Its prime position will mean that many Google users will be directed to the BNP 's website by virtue of having clicked on the first headline that is listed .
Other articles listed on the search engine giving the BNP 's take on recent news - written by the far - right party " correspondents " - include a man arrested for making homophobic remarks , and support for the BNP among Christians .
But a spokeswoman for Google said today that its job was not to act as censor , and that its automated search services could not screen results .
The company acknowledges that a search may result in a " link to sites that some people find objectionable , inappropriate , or offensive " but that it assumes no responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results .
But it said that if any illegal content was linked to in its index the web pages in question would be removed from the Google site .

There 's a reason I write about dominionism -- not just on the political threat , but the real threat inherent in these groups by virtue of many of the hardline " spiritual warfare " dominionists being in essence abusive Bible - based cults .
I know all too well about the danger these groups present -- not just for the country , but for the kids themselves .
I in fact live with it everyday .
You see ... I was once one of those kids like in " Jesus Camp " myself .
I 'm a survivor of the same " Third Wave " ( aka " Joel 's Army " ) dominionist movement that spawned the camp depicted in " Jesus Camp " .
I even remember in my youth attending a day - camp program run by the dominionist church I escaped -- one that was very much like " Jesus Camp " , in fact .
To this day I have serious issues trusting people and have had to undergo therapy for complex PTSD ( yes , kids who grow up in this stuff go through literal shellshock , in some ways worse than Gulf War or Vietnam veterans -- because they never had anything " before the war " to go back to ) , and have socialisation issues to the point people have wondered if I did n't have Asperger 's Syndrome .
I 've compared the experience of growing up in these groups to something akin to growing up in a pit filled with zombies -- all of which are trying to zombify you , and grab onto you as you try to climb out the slick , jagged walls ... and that 's assuming you decide to at all , because you 're taught all your life that even with the horrors in the pit that Outside is Much , Much , Much Worse .
Most of us who 've escaped discovered either people " in the pit " were lying about Outside , or we had a caring person from Outside tell us what it 's really like ( usually kind of a mix of both ) ; more and more , these kids are being isolated from ever having contact with people from Outside till they 're well in their twenties or even beyond that .
Even when you 've been in a public school and had some contact with the outside world -- much less the situation these kids are growing up in ( with dominionist correspondence - schooling sold as " homeschooling " , dominionist alternatives to Scouting like the Royal Rangers and Missionettes and Heritage Girls , not even allowing them to be friends with non-dominionist neighbours , etc. ) -- the impact of things once you 're Outside ( at least speaking from the perspective of someone who escaped ) is not unlike that of a kid raised by wolves ( or zombies ) .
You have to almost literally relearn everything about being human all over again almost from the cradle -- that 's something I 'm still doing and probably will be playing catchup with the rest of my life , to be honest .
I still kick myself in the ass all too much over the shitty things I did as a dominionist " God Warrior " kid ( even though I really did not know better -- how could I ?
I was raised in a dominionist cult that thought everything else was evil and that we'd be going to war with the Russians and they'd be raptured up before the nukes started flying ! ) .
I try to educate people on the mindset of these groups because people really do n't understand what goes on in the heads of dominionists -- and most of them are in a mix of hatred ( of their critics , who are seen as children of the devil ) and fear ( of the outside world in general ) .
One of the crappier incidents I remember that I did -- and to this day I kick myself over it , and if the guy who this happened to is reading this , my deepest apologies -- anyways , one time in 5th grade , I had made a comment that was in fact seen as socially acceptable by the dominionist group that raised me ... that I hoped that " godly people took over and did to the atheists what Hitler did to the Jews " .
Unbenownst to me , there was a Jewish student in the room .
When the teacher ( rightfully so ! ) ripped me a new one , I got panicked -- but not because I had literally ( and , ironically , innocently - - remember , I was taught this was a Good Thing by the group I ended up walking away from ! ) advocated genocide of every atheist in the US -- but because I thought I 'd insulted a Jew and thus permanently damned myself for insulting one of " God 's chosen people along with those baptised in the Holy Ghost " .
Nowadays , I realise how what I did was horrifically wrong .
I had no concept then , though , and would n't for quite some time -- and , I suspect , the " Jesus Camp " kids are in the same damn boat as I was in .
Only they do n't have a fifth - grade teacher to tell them that it was wrong .
. . .
One of the first things that led to me starting to break away was hearing people in my own church condemn the Christian metal band Stryper as " satanic " .
Now , I was a fan of the band Stryper back then .
( It was one of the few hard - rock bands someone thoroughly inculcated in dominion theology could listen to without risking one 's soul - - or so I thought at the time . )
I knew they did literal altar calls and tossed out Bibles at concerts .
I knew Stryper was about as far from " devil music " as one could get .
That little chink started opening up more chinks .
Eventually my religiously - inspired " bad behaviour " ended up getting me put in a psych ward for a month for " depression " ( and now , I realise in retrospect and my therapist does as well , that it probably was the result of the coercive religious practices in the group I left ) .
That month of isolation away from dominionist programming was like a Prague spring in a way -- I learned that listening to secular music would not instantly damn me to hell , among other things .
I learned that people who were n't dominionists were actually human .
I learned soon from a high school teacher -- and if you are reading this somewhere , I 'd love to thank you for this -- that the Equal Rights Amendment did n't say what dominionists claimed it said -- it said nothing about merging the Boy and Girl Scouts or making women become lesbians .
I learned that Ozzy Osbourne 's " Suicide Solution " was in fact saying alcoholism was a form of suicide -- a message the group I left would have actually agreed with -- from the same teacher .
I began to realise something was broken , too , during the televangelist scandals .
My folks had taken us to Heritage USA ( the old theme park that Jim and Tammy Bakker ran ) as sort of a dominionist alternative to taking us to Kings Island or Disney World ; in my teenhood I started realising that these were far from the men of God they claimed to be .
I made the mistake of mentioning this to my mother once .
She first thundered that I was not to judge a " man of God " ; when I questioned whether they were men of God at all she accused me of being demon possessed , attempted an impromptu exorcism by smearing Wesson oil on my head whilst ranting in tongues , then went on a two - hour harangue reading from the Bible on how I was apparently damned , had better change my ways or I 'd go to hell , had better " start flying right " , and that if I did n't she would have deacons come to our house to perform an Assemblies - style " deliverance service " on me .
All because I did n't toe the line anymore .
( This pattern would be repeated quite often in my youth as I spoke up more for myself .
There were times I thought seriously that I would have to run away from home for my own personal safety . )
Until I was in college , though , I just thought my parents were somewhat abusive -- I did n't realise what went on in my home , the " beating of kids till they cried " , the claim I was full of Satan ... I did n't quite realise that was n't normal , largely because my folks largely prohibited me from going to other people 's houses ( especially overnight ; literally , to visit a friend , my mother pretty much almost had to have a full background check on their parents ) .
I never went to my high school prom because I knew my folks would never allow me to go -- because it was co-ed and they had rented out a hall overnight .
I also had at least one college choice denied me outright by my folks because the college offered co-ed dorms .
I finally began to realise something was severely broken in the church I walked away from was through involvement on net.abuse issues on the Usenet group alt.religion .
scientology in the early 90's ( the Scientologists were doing their best to wreck the group , which was being used as a support group for ex-Scientos ) .
Using some of the checklists of " coerciveness " that had been posted by exit counseling groups , I realised the group I walked away from would fit the criteria .
In my research on dominionism since ( which I have done , in part , to help along my own recovery from the scars of spiritual abuse ) ... I am becoming increasingly convinced that ( especially among the pente / charismatic groups involved in dominionism , possibly increasingly so even among the Southern Baptists ) part of the reason people are having such poor success in debating dominionists is because they do not realise they are in essence dealing with someone who is in a coercive religious group .
Dominionist groups , especially those into " spiritual warfare " ( crossreference Marguerite Perrin on " Trading Spouses " for an example of this in action -- I honestly wish I could say it's an extreme example , but in some dominionist groups her behaviour is sadly typical ) , have an entire system designed to isolate their members from " mainstream reality " and to essentially create a dominionist " group - think " .
Speaking from my own experiences as a former dominionist ( having been raised in it ) , here are some of the things that my church has done to pretty much prevent any outside influences :
a) Taught explicitly that everyone outside the group is evil , possibly even in league with Satan , and that Satan may even be " working through them "
b) Taught that criticism of the group was " blaspheming against the Holy Spirit " and criticism of members or the church was answered with " touch not mine annointed " or " thou shalt not judge a man of God "
c ) Taught that demons were the cause of all hardship and illness ( including diseases ; genetic diseases along with multigenerational poverty were termed " generational curses " and even colds and flu were the result of " solidified demonic corruption " ) and that these could be cured by " naming it and claiming it " as well as donations of up to fifty percent of income to the church
d ) Taught that " doorways to Satan " could open up and cause " demonic oppression " by things as innocuous as peace symbols ( which they preached were Satanic ) , Nike shoes , and Pokemon (! ) ( yes , they literally teach that if kids had Pokemon stuff they'd be demonised ; they also do book burnings of Harry Potter books for the same reason , and even criticised C. S. Lewis ' " Chronicles of Narnia " because it was fantasy )
e ) Taught people to not associate with " unsaved " people unless for the purpose of conversion , and even distributed " Christian Yellow Pages " to this effect ( which required a fundamentalist statement of faith to be signed before they 'd list someone )
f ) Ran their own TV and radio " godcasting " network ( now focusing largely internationally ; see here ) and told people that literally all media outside from the church was Satanic
g ) Handed out voter 's guides from the AFA and a predecessor group ( Freedom 's Heritage Forum ) telling people explicitly whom to vote for ( by the way , a deacon of the church is the state head of the AFA )
h ) Taught explicitly that deceptive tactics are perfectly permissible in an attempt to convert someone ( and yes , this is denomination wide ; I 've documented over 40 separate " front groups " used for various forms of targeted prosyletising by the Assemblies , including targeting other churches )
i ) Taught people could literally be hexed into conversion by essentially cursing these people in the name of Christ to be miserable and even suicidal unless they converted
j ) Taught that involuntary exorcism of people who were LGBT , not dominionists ( and openly critical of the group ) , and so on were perfectly permissible ( I will never be able to come out safely to my parents that I 'm bisexual or that I 've always felt like a man in a woman 's body as a result ; it would literally be a death sentence in my case )
Now , I wish this were not a terribly large church , or a terribly politically active or important church .
I wish this was an abberation .
Unfortunately , a church deacon at the very church I walked away from is head of the Kentucky AFA ( one of our two main dominionist groups here -- the other is in Lexington and is the state FotF frontgroup ) , essentially has been at the center of the dominionist movement in the state for the past thirty years , and is busy setting up a multi-station " godcasting " network on shortwave radio ( yes , most of the annoying religious broadcasters on shortwave radio are affiliated with High Adventure Ministries , which is a front group of the very AoG church I walked away from ) .
It 's also a major stop on the Assemblies " traveling preacher " circuit , is the second largest church in my home state ( with anywhere from 7000 to 17,000 in attendance , depending on whose figures you believe and whether a " revival meeting " is in progress there ) , and no less than Oliver North has been at the church preaching that the Reds were the Antichrist so he pushed the Iran - Contra arms deal as a mission from God (!)
It was also one of the first of the so - called " Third Wave " churches promoting the " Joel 's Army " stuff I 've written about -- the same stuff that " Jesus Camp " teaches to little kids -- and was pushing this stuff all the way into the 1960s .
Also , sadly , this view is also not atypical -- John Ashcroft 's " eccentricities " like being annointed with Wesson oil (! ) are typical teachings in those churches , and practices at Ted Haggard 's New Life Church are very similar to the tactics of " deliverance ministry " preached at the church I walked away from .
And even more frightening , they are getting more and more control of the government -- to the point that someday , they could eventually force us walkaways back at gunpoint -- or kill us " just like Hitler did to the Jews " - - or , worse yet , start a war that kills everyone .
. . .
One of the things I still have nightmares over to this day -- and modern political events do n't help at all with this -- is of Cold War sermons regarding the Final Battle .
You see , they would preach that Russia ( back then the USSR ) was the literal country of Satan and its leader was the Antichrist .
And at the very end of things , Russia would use some Middle Eastern country -- Iran was quite frequently mentioned -- and would launch an invasion of Israel after having nuked Jerusalem .
The US would begin a nuclear exchange with the Russians after that , which would end up with the US and Israel against the rest of the world in a nuclear Mother of All Wars to be centered on Megiddo Hill .
Of course , all the True Believers would be raptured up first .
And they'd have a heaven - side seat to watch everyone else burn in literal nuclear hellfire .
And the sick and sad thing was that they welcomed this .
The preacher almost seemed to be in orgiastic joy over the fact that in 1984 the relations between the US and USSR had worsened to such a point people were thinking nuclear war was a very real possibility .
I did n't know then that they were pulling this stuff out of the Scofield Reference Bible ( along with their support for young - earth creationism and a lot of other bizarre things ) and that the reference in the Scofield bibles were actually from Tsarist Russia -- back when the Russian secret service was doing progroms against its Jewish population and printing things like The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion to justify them .
I know that now , but I still have nightmares about how the whole church was so damned happy that literally the rest of the world was going to be nuked and they were finally going to Get Theirs Against All Those Non-Dominionist Heathens .
The fact that we could end up going into a nuclear war with Iran does n't help my nerves any at this ... nor does the fact that , even to this day - - fully 12 years after the Berlin Wall fell -- they still claim that Russia is " Gog " and that Boris Yeltsin is part of a grand Satanic conspiracy .
. . .
Some have even asked how we can persuade dominionists to , well , not be dominionists .
The problem is that -- because dominionism is , at its core , a spiritually abusive movement with political aspirations it is n't that simple at all ... because you have to fight the programmed mindset .
I am posting this info in the hope that people -- in particular , experts in the psychological field ( I know we have at least one on the board ! ) will be able to give suggestions .
I also post this in the hope people realise the difficulty us walkaways have had in getting out -- and maybe our success stories will give people hints on how to stop the hijacks from occuring .
One thing that is difficult to explain to people who have never been involved in a coercive religious group is just how people get " stuck in " and refuse to leave .
What people do n't tend to realise is that most coercive groups -- be they dominionist groups or some other flavour of coercive group ( such as Scientology , the Moonies , etc. ) -- have as part of the coercion in and of itself various " thought stopping " techniques and other forms of coercion that literally prevent the person from questioning the group at all .
( In fact , that 's how we can define dominionism as a coercive religious movement , especially in its " spiritual warfare " and " premillenarian dispensationalist " flavours . )
A writer from the Ex -Pentecostals walkaway support board -- who also has written a book on his experiences called " Letters from an Ex - Pentecostal " -- has written possibly one of the best descriptions of the coercive mindset and just what people - - both people fighting dominionism , and people fighting the coercive tactics used in dominionist groups -- face :
( as a side note , this is concerning spiritually abusive pente and neopente groups involved in the dominionist movement )
When confronting a Pentecostal , one must remember that Pentecostals are stuck in a mental thinking loop that prevents them from thinking in the normal sense about anything relating to religion .
They have designed an enormous list of code words designed to trigger thinking patterns in a particular way .
Think of it as a computer program or a computer virus .
When you hear the words " reprobate " or " backslider " or any other code words , they are designed to trigger a particular thought pattern .
Another phrase that comes to mind is " touch not mine anointed ! "
The last one triggers thoughts of incapacitating terror at the thought of questioning the pastor about anything .
Also , there are particular gestures that are designed to trigger certain thoughts like the tightening and closing of the eyes followed by something like " Woo , I feel something in this place , let 's pray for that guy right now ! "
And , so it is .
It is hard to even speak about religion to these Pentecostals stuck in the mental traps because the minute you try to question them , those code words , and those gestures come into their imaginations , without even them hearing them or seeing them , and these things short - circuit the mental processes to the point where they cannot hear the words you are saying .
The mind is stuck and has something like a computer virus .
Often , it takes a tremendous effort to break these people from this state of self - hypnosis .
Sometimes it takes a dramatic event for them to begin to question .
Sometime the pastor betrays them so deeply , they go through terror , depression , and many other things that are so unbearable that they have to begin to question the system .
The services are designed to nurture these thought systems and loops that they cannot break out of .
All the emotional things that go on from excitement to terror , to grieving , to anything with extreme emotions - all this contributes to the deadening of the mind to thinking outside of the particular mind set .
Their minds are stuck .
They do not know this .
You can tell them this and often , they do not understand what you are telling them because their thoughts are stuck in a short circuit .
Sometimes we have to spend many years or months trying to figure out a way to break within a particular person 's mind to break it out of the shorted - loop .
Each of us has a lot of work to do if we are to do this .
Each case is different , and I suspect that there is a particular KEY to each person to break them out of the loop .
It just might take a long time to find the Key to break the code and delete the looping control loop of their mind 's software programs , in a manner of speaking .
So , do not ever be surprised that you cannot communicate with these people .
It is part of the design of the system to keep them trapped in the mental control loops triggered by words , gestures , music or whatever a local preacher can design .
The pastor does not do this deliberately as in , " How can I design a system to keep them trapped , " but he simply does it by trial and error in Darwinian fashion as to what works with a particular person and congregation and what does not .
This is how it works .
And whatever system of controls survives the experimentation is what survives in the same way as animal species survive in the process of natural selection in the Survival of the Fittest .
The better the system design , the harder it will be to break
them out of the mental loops .
In other words , coercive tactics practiced in dominionist groups literally set the mind in an " infinite loop " if any criticism of the group occurs .
( THIS is why you end up with , at best , people accusing you of being " anti-Christian " and occasionally going on " God Warrior " rampages .
I now know it 's pretty much impossible to discuss things with my mom on these things because of this . )
In my case , the " key " was realising that I was being lied to -- which was first " put in the lock " by hearing people condemning Christian metal bands , and " turned " by realising this was just the start of a whole series of lies .
This is also the reason I am not sure dialogue is even possible directly with dominionists ; you are not so much arguing with a person as with an entire system of thought reform .
I can certainly agree with the author 's observation that each person who is a successful walkaway from dominionist groups tends to have something specific that leads them to walk away ; in my case , it was the discovery I was being lied to ( and it 's the dishonesty and subterfuge that STILL is one of the things that galls me the most about dominionism , to be perfectly honest -- among many , many other things ) .
I 've posted a brief example of code words particularly used in pente and charismatic dominionist groups , many of which act as " stop words " or " start words " in the community ; many of the " code words " that have been documented in use by dominionists are also " thought stopper " words .
Among other things , when dominionists talk about the " homosexual agenda " -- that is literally a " thought stopper " phrase that dominionists use to essentially get their members to not only go into two - minute hates about everything related to LGBT folks -- but there 's the spiritually abusive preaching that literally teaches that gays are the servants of the devil himself and out to molest their kids ( playing on fear and the need for a Great Enemy ) , plus other coercive tactics that teach that church leaders and other " men of God " ( including fellow dominionists ) are never to be questioned , combined with teachings in many churches that claim reading any info non-approved by the church or even doing business with non-dominionists will " open doorways for Satan " in one 's life and cause one to become hopelessly insane , penniless , oh , and damned literally to Hell ...
THAT's what goes through the dominionist 's head when he hears AFA leaders ranting about gay people .
Unless and until you luck upon that one " Key " that causes them to start to question - - it 's difficult to even talk to them .
I 'd say nearly impossible .
( This is also the specific reason children are being isolated almost from birth , " homeschooled " via dominionist correspondence courses , sent to " Christian alternatives " to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts , and sent to dominionist colleges -- it is incredibly hard for someone raised from birth in a coercive religious group and never having had any exposure to anything outside of it till in their twenties to walk away .
It is in some ways comparable to someone being raised by wild animals nearly all their life and then discovering human society ; if one is younger , one has a better chance of adapting to human society ( though you are n't ever going to be COMPLETELY normal about things ) as opposed to finding human society in their twenties .
I am reminded of a part of the tall tale of Pecos Bill ( whom is often spoken of as being raised by coyotes till he was a young man ) ... in many versions of the story , Bill 's brother finds him and ends up in a furious debate with Pecos Bill , Pecos Bill firmly believing he was a coyote till his brother pointed out he did n't have a tail and his brother pointed out the identical Lone Star tattoo on them .
( And just like Pecos Bill , you pretty much have to learn to behave in society some twenty years late , with the rough difficulty of learning to live among humans when you 've spent your whole life among coyotes . )
The trick with dominionists is that they have been explicitly taught that people who point out they " do n't have tails " are in fact in league with the Devil .
Xenu.net , a site that focuses on coercive tactics within Scientology but is a good info source re coercive tactics in general , notes the following definition of a coercive religious group :
Every cult can be defined as a group having all of
the following 5 characteristics : 1 ) It uses psychological coercion to recruit , indoctrinate and retain its members
2 ) It forms an elitist totalitarian society
3 ) Its founder leader is self - appointed , dogmatic , messianic , not accountable and has charisma
4 ) It believes ' the end justifies the means ' in order to solicit funds or recruit people
5 ) Its wealth does not benefit its members or society
The coercion I know of too well -- they alternate between keeping you scared of everything -- even your own mind -- and driving you into " two minute hates " .
( In the group I left , if you harboured doubts about the group you were seen to be the victim of " demonic oppression " by " demons of doubt " because you'd " left open doorways for Satan in your life " ; the cure was always a " deliverance " service , often being forced to confess your sins in front of a 4000 - 10,000 seat audience , and isolating yourself even further from Outside and getting more involved in the dominionist group . )
This of course has the effect of keeping you both scared and petrified .
:P
Growing up in that from birth tends to cross your wires rather permanently ( which is why , to this day , I still have PTSD and anxiety problems a full seven years after escaping ) .
Most of you know of the totalitarian aspects , at least a bit .
( It 's not the same as , well , living in the Pit , but you get an idea .
Growing up in it , you do get a horror of things after escaping -- because you know they want to convert dominionist totalitarianism de facto into de jure -- and believe ( and are petrified ) that if they do n't hijack the government that God is going to revoke their status as " chosen people " .
I 've also noted the total lack of accountability ( generally , the pastor is the supreme ruler of the church and exerts control through the deacons or " shepherding " group leaders ) .
To doubt or to oppose the pastor in these groups is a dangerous thing indeed -- it labels you as The Enemy to those in the pit , and they 'll try to " exorcise " you , assassinate your character , and rip you down .
The " by any means " should also be obvious to people by now -- with use of church infiltrations .
And , well ... the televangelism industry has since its beginning been run by these people and about every 20 - 30 years or so a major scandal breaks out .
Anyways , this is why I write .
Hopefully we can stop more people from being hurt .

More Aperture Dirt
Last week when I wrote “ Aperture Dirt ” , regarding Think Secret ’s scoop regarding the dispersal of the Aperture development team and the future of Aperture , I emphasized that the sources for my own information were second - hand .
Since then , I ’ve heard from additional sources at Apple , including a first - hand source : one of the developers from the original Aperture engineering team .
For obvious reasons , these sources have all requested anonymity .
So , here ’s what I ’ve learned :
No one from the original Aperture engineering team was fired or removed from the team .
Yes , most members of the original engineering team left the project — but they did so on their own volition .
Why ?
Because of what can only be described as spectacularly bad management .
Every one of these engineers easily found other work .
One left the company , the rest found positions elsewhere at Apple .
The single biggest management problem was a “ Mythical Man-Month ” disaster .
“ The Mythical Man-Month ” is , of course , the title of Fred Brooks ’s seminal work on software engineering management , the basic premise of which is that , as Wikipedia says , “ Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later . ”
It is astounding that there are software engineering managers who are either unaware of the Mythical Man-Month theory , or who are but believe it does n’t apply to their project .
But in the case of Aperture , the product team grew from about 20 to 150 in just a few weeks , comprising about 100 engineers , 40 QA people , and the rest manager types .
And not surprisingly , this is precisely when things went from bad to worse with regard to the quality of the product .
The 130 additional members were never meant to be permanent members of the Aperture team — they were borrowed talent from other “ Pro app ” product teams and were added during the homestretch of the Aperture 1.0 development cycle in an ill - considered effort to ship faster .
Aperture ’s current engineering team was assembled before the original team left .
Aperture was never without an engineering team , and the product ’s future was never in jeopardy .
Now , before you suggest that of course a member of the engineering team is going to blame the management , allow me to add this : I ’ve heard from two additional sources that the only person from the Aperture team who was fired from the company was the engineering manager .
The project manager also left the company , after being “ fired ” from the Aperture product team .
Not a single engineer was fired .
This additional information mostly clarifies what I wrote last week .
More importantly , however , it largely contradicts much of Think Secret ’s original report , which is heavily slanted against Aperture ’s engineering team .
E.g. Think Secret ’s lead sentence alone :
Apple recently asked the engineering team behind its Aperture photo editing and management software to leave , Think Secret has learned .
is simply not true , and unfairly besmirches the reputations of what all of my sources regard as a group of very good engineers .
I ’ll leave any conclusions regarding the identity of Think Secret ’s sources to your imagination .
Nov. 2 , 2006  -- Come Tuesday , more than 80 percent of American voters will use electronic voting machines to cast their ballot in the Nov. 7 midterm elections .
One - third of those precincts will be using the technology for the first time .
If the primaries and test runs of the machines are to be any indication , Election Day could be teetering on the edge of disaster .
" I think it 's going to be a train wreck , " said Freddie Oakley , an election supervisor near Sacramento , Calif .
Oakley was stunned when she tested her county 's new electronic voting machines and the audio instructions for the visually impaired came out in Vietnamese .
" Vietnamese is a great language , very beautiful and musical , " Oakley said , " But we are not persuaded that we have a ton of Vietnamese - speaking blind voters . "
The glitch has been fixed -- she hopes -- but election officials nationwide are concerned about how these machines will actually work in their moment of truth amid technical glitches and machine malfunctions that have already surfaced .
In Texas , some electronic ballots were counted up to six times , adding 100,000 erroneous votes to final tallies .
In Maryland , machines experienced screen freezes and missing memory cards .
Sixteen states using these machines do not require a paper receipt , making a traditional recount impossible .
Governor Advises Use of Paper Absentee Ballots
Maryland Gov. Bob Ehrlich , a Republican up for re-election , is so concerned he 's advising the state 's voters to turn to paper absentee ballots .
" When what this country is all about -- democracy , secure and safe and accurate vote -- is at risk , which it is in Maryland 2006 , " Ehrlich said , " you just err on the side of safety . "
After the Florida fiasco in 2000 , Congress established the U.S. Election Assistance Commission in 2002 to prevent future election disasters .
The commission 's chairman , DeForest Soaries , resigned last year in disgust , saying that lawmakers were never serious about election reform and rushed electronic voting , untested , to polling locations .
" We spent $ 2.5 billion helping to upgrade voting when , in fact , we are less prepared to guarantee voters that the machines will actually work . "
Soaries said .
A New Twist on Political ' Hacks '
The biggest fear , Soaries says , is that election computers could be tampered with by hackers .
An experiment at Princeton University gave substance to that fear when it took a team of computer scientists mere seconds to break into the widely used Diebold AccuVote - TS touch - screen machine and introduce a virus that changed the vote count .
" We do n't know what happens inside these machines , " said Princeton computer science professor Edward Felten , who led the experiment .
" We , as citizens , are not allowed to know . "
Diebold called the Princeton study " unrealistic and inaccurate . "
After a machine demonstration on " Good Morning America " last week , Diebold 's director of marketing Mark Radke emphasized the accuracy of the machines .
" The equipment has been tested by federal agencies , by independent agencies , " Radke told Diane Sawyer .
" And each and every touch - screen unit … is also tested before every election to make sure it 's operating correctly and accurately . "
Diebold is also demanding that HBO pull a documentary premiering tonight that claims their machines can be easily manipulated to influence election results .
The 85 - minute film " Hacking Democracy " follows citizens across the country who demonstrate vulnerabilities of the machines .
Diebold , whose machines account for 40 percent of the market , believes the film contains " significant factual errors . "
Though late in the process , in the short term , voters have been encouraged by election officials to insist machines are tested and to check their precinct machines for the option of a paper receipt .
In the long term , experts say , the federal government needs to establish a national voting standard and make state requirements regarding functioning machines and paper receipts in the event of a recount .
The Moskva - a landmark for decades - is being rebuilt
A ton of World War II explosives has been found at the site of the landmark Moskva Hotel in central Moscow .
The find has been linked to Soviet plans to blow up key buildings if Nazi German troops reached the city .
Construction workers were laying the foundations for the new Moskva Hotel when they came upon the crates of TNT , which have now been removed .
Experts say there were no detonators and the explosives had decomposed so there was no danger of an explosion .
The explosives were packed into 20kg crates .
The site lies just beyond Red Square and the Kremlin 's walls .
Russian NTV said the hotel had been mined in case Hitler 's troops had taken Moscow .
The German forces made it to the outskirts in 1942 , but Russian troops stopped them pushing into the centre .
The Moskva was the first hotel to be built in Moscow after the 1917 communist revolution .
A replica is being built in its place .

Welcome to the Haskell Performance Resource , the collected wisdom on how to make your Haskell programs go faster .
Introduction
One question that often comes up is along the general lines of " Can I write this program in Haskell so that it performs as well as , or better than , the same program written in some other language ? "
This is a difficult question to answer in general because Haskell is a language , not an implementation .
Performance can only be measured relative to a specific language implementation .
Moreover , it 's often not clear if two programs which supposedly have the same functionality really do the same thing .
Different languages sometimes require very different ways of expressing the same intent .
Certain types of bug are rare in typical Haskell programs that are more common in other languages and vice versa , due to strong typing , automatic memory management and lazy evaluation .
Nonetheless , it is usually possible to write a Haskell program that performs as well as , or better than , the same program written in any other language .
The main caveat is that you may have to modify your code significantly in order to improve its performance .
Compilers such as GHC are good at eliminating layers of abstraction , but they are n't perfect , and often need some help .
There are many non-invasive techniques : compiler options , for example .
Then there are techniques that require adding some small amounts of performance cruft to your program : strictness annotations , for example .
If you still do n't get the best performance , though , it might be necessary to resort to larger refactorings .
Sometimes the code tweaks required to get the best performance are non-portable , perhaps because they require language extensions that are n't implemented in all compilers ( e.g. unboxing ) , or because they require using platform - specific features or libraries .
This might not be acceptable in your setting .
If the worst comes to the worst , you can always write your critical code in C and use the FFI to call it .
Beware of the boundaries though - marshaling data across the FFI can be expensive , and multi-language memory management can be complex and error - prone .
It 's usually better to stick to Haskell if possible .
Basic techniques
The key tool to use in making your Haskell program run faster is profiling .
Profiling is provided by GHC and nhc98 .
There is no substitute for finding where your program 's time / space is really going , as opposed to where you imagine it is going .
Another point to bear in mind :
By far the best way to improve a program 's performance dramatically is to use better algorithms .
Once profiling has thrown the spotlight on the guilty time - consumer (s ) , it may be better to re-think your program than to try all the tweaks listed below .
Another extremely efficient way to make your program snappy is to use library code that has been Seriously Tuned By Someone Else .
You might be able to write a better sorting function than the one in Data .
List , but it will take you much longer than typing import Data .
List .
We have chosen to organise the rest of this resource first by Haskell construct ( data types , pattern matching , integers ) , and then within each category to describe techniques that apply across implementations , and also techniques that are specific to a certain Haskell implementation ( e.g. GHC ) .
There are some implementation - specific techniques that apply in general - those are linked from the General Implementation - Specific Techniques section below .
Haskell constructs
General techniques
The most important thing for a beginner to keep in mind is that Haskell programs are evaluated using lazy evaluation , which has many advantages , but also drawbacks when it comes to performance .
The rule of thumb is that if you really want to have explicit control over the evaluation , then you should try to avoid it .
Benchmarking libraries
The Criterion library is used often to generate detailed benchmark results .
Compiler specific techniques

Sharing conduit values leads to memory leaks .
Make sure to disable the full laziness optimization in the module with your top - level calls to runConduit or ( $ $ ) .
Similar considerations apply to other streaming libraries and indeed any Haskell code that uses lazy data structures to drive computation .

And many alternatives , with discussion , on this wiki : Benchmarks Game and on the old Haskell wiki ( in the Web Archive )
There are ~100 slides on High - Performance Haskell from the 2010 CUFP tutorial on that topic .
Specific comparisons of data structures
Ropes
For modifying very long strings , a rope data structure is very efficient .
The rope package provides these .
Data .
Sequence vs. lists
Data .
Sequence has complexity O ( log ( min ( i , n - i ) ) ) for access , insertion and update to position i of a sequence of length n .
List has complexity O( i ) .
List is a non-trivial constant - factor faster for operations at the head ( cons and head ) , making it a more efficient choice for stack - like and stream - like access patterns .
Data .
Sequence is faster for every other access pattern , such as queue and random access .
See the following program for proof :
import Data .
Sequence insert_million 0 sequence = sequence insert_million n sequence = insert_million ( n - 1 ) ( sequence |> n ) main = print ( Data .
Sequence . length ( insert_million 1000000 empty ) )
$ ghc - O2 -- make InsertMillionElements.hs && time ./InsertMillionElements +RTS -K100 M 1000000 real 0m7.238s user 0m6.804s sys 0m0.228s
insert_million 0 list = reverse list insert_million n list = insert_million ( n - 1 ) ( n : list ) main = print ( length ( insert_million 1000000 [ ] ) )
$ ghc - O2 -- make InsertMillionElements.hs && time ./InsertMillionElementsList +RTS -K100 M 1000000 real 0m0.588s user 0m0.528s sys 0m0.052s
Lists are substantially faster on this micro-benchmark .
A sequence uses between 5/6 and 4/3 times as much space as the equivalent list ( assuming an overhead of one word per node , as in GHC ) .
If only deque operations are used , the space usage will be near the lower end of the range , because all internal nodes will be ternary .
Heavy use of split and append will result in sequences using approximately the same space as lists .
In detail :
a list of length n consists of n cons nodes , each occupying 3 words .
consists of cons nodes , each occupying 3 words .
a sequence of length n has approximately n/( k - 1 ) nodes , where k is the average arity of the internal nodes ( each 2 or 3 ) .
There is a pointer , a size and overhead for each node , plus a pointer for each element , i.e. n( 3/( k - 1 ) + 1 ) words .
Additional Tips
January 20 , 2007 — jao
Gentle reader Marc Donner has sent me an email sharing one of his favorite emacs hacks :
( global - set - key [ f10 ] ' start - kbd - macro ) ( global - set - key [ f11 ] ' end - kbd- macro ) ( global - set - key [ f12 ] ' call-last-kbd-macro )
Yes , I could type C-x ( to start the macro and C- x ) to end the macro and C-x e to execute the macro , but that requires that my fingers be more nimble than they really are .
Particularly because ( and ) are shifted keys .
This way I can start a macro with a single button push , finish it with another , and then repetitively run it by pressing a third button over and over .
As it happens , Emacs 22 comes with the functionality Marc assigns to his F12 key built - in : press just e right after executing the macro the first time , as many times as you need .
There ’s also the possibility of using a numerical prefix to specify how many times the macro should be executed ( as in M - 10 C- x e to execute it ten times ) , and passing zero as the prefix will keep on ( re ) executing it until the end of the buffer is reached .
One can also achieve macro re-plays with the command repeat , bound by default to C-x z .
repeat works quite a bit like Vim ’s ‘.’: it , well , repeats the most recently executed command , and keeps repeating if you keep pressing z .
So , instead of C-x e e e e e ... , one can C-x e C- z z z z ... .
Not as convenient , but this works in Emacs 21 , and , besides , repeat is an interesting command on its own .
Saying that keyboard macro recording is a useful Emacs feature would be an understatement .
You can record almost any Emacs operation and , therefore , keyboard macros can automate quite non-trivial tasks .
For instance , i’ve just used them a couple hours ago to generate C function body stubs from their declarations in a header file .
Just for the fun of it , here ’s a screencast :
Note how you ’re not limited to a single buffer , and how we use generic operations ( like searching for next space to kill and yank the function ’s return type ) .
It ’s also important to left the cursor in the right position for the next execution of the macro .
At first you ’ll make little mistakes , but fear not : you can actually edit the last recorded macro with kmacro - edit - lossage ( Emacs 22 only ) .
Just type C - xC - kl and you ’ll be teletransported to a * Edit macro * buffer where you can edit your last keystrokes and record them as needed .
Nifty , no ?
As you get used to macros , you ’ll surely discover many other tricks , but you can speed up your learning by means of the excellent pages KeyboardMacros and KeyboardMacrosTricks in the Emacs wiki .
( One of my favourite tricks is using Elisp in macros to dynamically change what gets inserted ) .
This Linux Journal article by Jesper Pedersen is also a good way to get you started as a power macro user .
Happy recording !
Diplomati v Ljubljani zavijajo z očmi tudi pri vprašanju , kako bodo preostali ministri vodili 26 kolegov iz EU skozi težavne teme , kakršna je reforma subvencij v kmetijstvu .
Tako je britanski tednik The Economist ocenil pripravljenost naše vlade na predsedovanje EU .
In kaj o tej oceni menijo nekateri imenovani , politiki in poznavalci priprav na predsedovanje ?
Ministra Dimitrija Rupla kritika ugledne revije ni vidneje prizadela .
" Avtorja , ki je napisal članek , ne poznam .
Pri meni se ni oglasil , " je odgovoril na vprašanje Dnevnika , kako komentira navedbo The Economista .
Časnik avtorjev člankov sicer ne podpisuje ; kredibilnost besedilom zagotavlja celotno uredništvo .
" Ne verjamem , da gre za resno analizo , " je povedal Rupel .
" Za svoje delo smo dobili veliko pohval .
Napovedovanje , kako bo s predsedovanjem leta 2008 , se mi zdi malce nenavadno . "
Ocene tujih diplomatov
Edward Lucas , novinar Economista , ki je avtor članka , je včeraj za Dnevnik komentiral Ruplov odziv : " Slovenijo redno obiskujem že dvajset let in verjemite mi , da sem dobro obveščen . "
Lucas navaja kot svoje vire tuje diplomate , ki so v stikih z Ruplom .
" Povedali so mi , da je nekoliko grob in da njegovo ravnanje z ljudmi ni najboljše .
Seveda pa svojih virov nikoli ne razkrijem . "
Lucas je še povedal , da je z ministrom Ruplom v dobrih odnosih .
" Spoznal sem ga leta 1986 , ko je bil še profesor . "
Predsednik vlade Janez Janša pisanja The Economista ni želel komentirati .
Na naše vprašanje , ali vendarle razmišlja o zamenjavi katerega od ministrov , na katere opozarja časnik , pa smo v njegovem kabinetu dobili odgovor , da bo premier , če se bo odločil za zamenjave , o tem pravočasno obvestil javnost .
Bolje prej kot kasneje
Na to , ali so ocene v The Economistu o posameznih ministrih pravilne , nam včeraj ni odgovoril niti evropski poslanec Borut Pahor ( SD ) .
Je pa povedal , da je vlada z izvolitvijo v parlamentu prevzela tudi vso odgovornost za predsedovanje EU .
Opozicija bo - tako kot v drugih državah - z vlado pri tem nekoliko bolj kooperativna , vendar to ne zmanjšuje odgovornosti , ki jo ima na plečih vlada .
" Pri izbiri ministrov je bilo od vsega začetka treba upoštevati tudi ta izziv , " je poudaril Pahor , ki bi sam sicer na marsikaterem položaju raje videl katerega drugega ministra , kar pa je normalno , kot je dodal , saj sedanji ministri niso njegov izbor .
Pravi , da pravočasno opozarja , da ima predsednik vlade še leto dni časa , da premisli , ali bi v luči predsedovanja vendarle koga zamenjal .
" Morda na organizacijskem področju stvari tečejo tako , kot morajo , se pa z izzivom predsedovanja premalo ukvarjamo , " je še razmišljal prvak SD .
Evropski poslanec Lojze Peterle ( NSi ) se trenutno mudi v Džakarti in članka v The Economistu še ni prebral .
Ko smo mu prebrali del , v katerem novinar ocenjuje vladne kadrovske potenciale , je bila njegova ocena : " Zanimivo . "
Vendar pa zadeve zaradi odsotnosti v zadnjem času premalo pozna , da bi jih lahko komentiral .
Toda po njegovem prepričanju je bolje , da premier , če meni , da bi bilo treba na kadrovskem področju kaj narediti , to stori prej kot kasneje .
Ruplov predhodnik na ministrskem položaju Ivo Vajgl pa ugotavlja , da " The Economist ni edini , ki opaža nekatere specifičnosti v značaju slovenskega zunanjega ministra " .
Dodal je , da mora " predsedujoča država EU zelo dobro poznati evropsko politiko in interese ter jih mora biti sposobna zastopati in interpretirati tudi v odnosu do tretjih držav .
In tega se bo moral držati tudi Dimitrij Rupel . "
Sicer pa svetovalec v uradu predsednika države ocenjuje , da je pisanje The Economista glede slovenskega predsedovanja utemeljeno .
Vprašanje pa je , ali ima vlada še dovolj časa , da nekaj najbolj šibkih točk pri vodenju predsedovanja odstrani .
A step forward for the minimum wage increase this afternoon , as the Senate cleared the logjam of the Republican filibuster that had been preventing the UpperdownvoteTM .
But just how craven was Republican opposition to a fair day 's pay for an honest day 's work ?
Well , apparently the tax breaks they demanded in exchange for the wage hike did n't quite do the trick .
Sure , that 's what Republicans will point to as the " real reason " they caved ...
The vote Tuesday emphasized how Senate passage of the bill depends on the tax package to attract Republican votes .
The White House has also signaled that Bush wants tax breaks in the legislation .
But it was n't until Harry Reid issued this warning that things changed :
" If cloture is not invoked , we 're through with minimum wage , " warned Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) before the vote , in a clear sign to Republican Senators that he will not allow them to use a minimum wage filibuster to stall having to vote on the pending Iraq war resolutions .
Now , was it a clear sign to Republicans that they would n't be allowed to use this filibuster to stall votes on Iraq ?
Or was it an allusion to this ?
Senate Democrats on Tuesday vowed to block pay raises for members of Congress until the minimum wage is increased .
" We 're going to do anything it takes to stop the congressional pay raise this year , and we 're not going to settle for this year alone , " Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said at a Capitol news conference .
Either way , cloture suddenly passed by a vote of 87 - 10 .
We report , you decide .
P.S. Get a load of this headline , courtesy of Reuters :
US Republicans clear way for minimum - wage rise
Given what actually happened here , including a 12 - year Republican moratorium on even considering a minimum wage hike , is this just the ultimate in lickspittle journalism , or what ?
In what universe do the jackasses who filibustered the minimum wage until their own pocketbooks were threatened deserve even the brief illusion of credit ?
A Post By : Darren Rowse
Digital Photography School reader ( Trish ) asks :
“ I love your new site and wondered if you could write something about travel photography .
I ’m heading to Europe for a four week trip in June and I was wondering if you had any advice for how I should prepare in order to get the best digital photos .
I ’ve got a Canon Digital Rebel XT and was thinking I might buy an extra lens to go with my 18 - 55 mm kit one .
Do you have any advice on what sort of lens to buy ?
Any other travel photography tips you could give me would be great . ”
Thanks for the feedback and question Trish .
I ’ll attempt to answer your lens question first and then will write a few more posts on Travel Photography over the coming weeks .
Which Lens is best for Travel Photography ?
This is actually a question I ’ve thought long and hard about having gone on several overseas and interstate trips over the past few years .
The answers that I ’ve come up with have varied from trip to trip considerably and have depended upon a number of factors including the length of the trip , the nature of the trip , my current ‘ favorite ’ lens and my current phase of photography ( I tend to go through phases where my style in photography changes a bit ) .
A lens can make or break you in terms of image quality .
I constantly advise people to get the best one that they can afford as an upgrade in lens will usually lead to much greater improvements in image quality than an upgrade in camera body .
The main considerations that you ’ll probably want to consider when buying a lens for travel include :
Weight – unless you ’re lucky enough to be traveling first class and with your own personal porter to haul around your camera kit you probably will need to limit your lens choice to a couple of lenses simply because of the size and weight that they take up in your bags .
I am lucky enough to own 5 Canon SLR lenses at present and am always tempted to pack each one because they are all ideal for some scenario or another – however if I did ( and if I included an external flash , tripod , filters , spare batteries , charger etc etc )
I ’d end up with a fully loaded and very heavy camera bag .
The risk of everything getting stolen , the strain it takes to lift it on those long days of traveling and the fact that the more lenses you take the more time you spend changing lenses and the less time you enjoy your trip has taught me to take the ‘ less is more ’ approach .
Versatility – travel photography presents you with a unique challenge that many other types of photography do not in that the situations that you might like to photograph can vary incredibly over your trip .
Depending upon your destination and the type of shots you take you ’ll probably a lens ( or combination of them ) that is versatile and gives you a range of focal lengths .
So if taking just one a zoom with a wide range might be best or if you ’re able to take more than one a combination of different lengths could be worth while .
On my last trip ( to Turkey ) I had days where I was shooting paintings in low light in caves ( flash not permitted ) , to taking shots at sunrise of landscapes from hot air balloons , to shooting shots of my wife in front of buildings ( tourist style ) , to shooting dancing scenes in the evening .
The variety of lighting conditions , distance to subjects and other requirements means you need to be prepared for literally anything .
As a result a lens that is as versatile as possible in terms of zoom size and speed can be well worth investing in .
Lens Speed – one of the factors that I hear many travelers complaining about after a trip is that once the sun went down their photo quality also went down .
Depending upon your destination , low light situations are common when traveling .
Galleries or ancient buildings where you ca n’t shoot with a flash , dinners at night etc all present photographers with real challenges which can be helped by investing in the ‘ fastest ’ lens you can afford .
The speed of a lens is signified by the number that usually appears after the ‘ f ’ on the lens ( it ’s aperture ) .
For example – the 18 - 55 mm lens that is usually bundled with a Digital Rebel XT has an aperture of f/3.4- 5.6 .
This means at the 18 mm focal length the aperture is f/3.5 and at the 55 mm focal length it has a maximum of f / 5.6 .
The lower the number the more light the lens allows to hit your image sensor and the faster shutter speed you ’ll be able to shoot at ( ie the lower the number the faster the lens ) .
When shooting in low light a fast lens is a real advantage .
Other Factors –
Of course there are other factors to consider – not the least of which is cost .
As I say above , invest more into your lenses if possible as the improvements to photos are often made in this area .
Having said that , just because you ca n’t afford a pro lens does n’t mean you ca n’t take great shots .
Other factors will include the type of shots you tend to take ( ie if you are into macro shots you might want to invest in a macro specific lens , if you ’re going to sporting events you might want something with extra length etc ) .
So which lenses do I recommend ?
I ’ve avoided the question for long enough now so let me run through a few options for Canon DSLR owners ( I ’m sure there are equivalents for other brands ) .
As I ’ve said above , when I travel these days I tend to take 2 lenses – one is a versatile zoom which will cover a range of focal lengths and the other is a light weight , small and fast prime lens ( a prime lens is one with a fixed focal length .
Prime lenses are traditionally good quality and faster than zooms ) .
Of course the two lenses I talk about below are based upon my own budget , photographic style and preferences .
I ’ve added a few other alternatives into the mix which others might consider .
Let me start by saying that this lens is not cheap – in fact it ’s one saved up for and have only just purchased .
However if your budget will stretch you might want to look at this one .
I list it here for a number of reasons :
• it ’s image quality is renowned as one of the best zoom lenses going around .
This is an ‘ L ’ series lens which is a ‘ luxury ’ or Pro level .
• focal length is wide and will cover a variety of situations and needs
• while f/ 4 is n’t super fast it will do you fine in many lighting situations – especially anything shot in daylight .
It ’s f/4 across all focal lengths so it is faster than the 18 - 55 mm at full extension .
• this lens has Image Stabilization ( IS ) which will allow you to handhold shots at up to 2 stops faster than normal ( this means in low light you can slow your shutter speed a couple of stops without suffering camera shake ) .
Of course for every positive there is a negative and this camera ’s include :
• Weight / Size – this is not the lightest lens going around and by the end of a day of it hanging around your neck you ’ll know about it
• Price – the weight it adds to your neck will be taken from your wallet – it ’s not cheap
• Speed – as I say above , f/ 4 is ok , but it ’s not the fastest option going around .
Alternatives to the 24-105 mm f/4L IS
A couple of alternatives come to mind .
• Canon EF 24-70 mm f/2.8L USM
– in the same price league and with similar quality and weight , but faster ( aperture of 2.8 across all focal lengths ) , without image stabilization , shorter zoom range .
So if you ’re shooting at low light a lot ( especially moving objects which IS wo n’t freeze ) and you do n’t mind loosing the top end focal length it might be an option .
• Canon EF 28-135 mm f/3.5-5.6 IS
USM – this is a much more affordable option but you do sacrifice image quality ( as you ’d expect ) .
It has a longer focal length , still has Image Stabilization and at 28 mm is faster than the 24 -105 mm ( but is slower at the other end of the zoom ) .
It ’s also a bit lighter and smaller .
I ’ve owned this lens for a while now and have usually included it in my kit when traveling .
It ’s images are not as good as my L series lenses but it ’s a good general purpose lens .
Lens 2 – Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens
Whereas my last suggestion was very expensive this one is at the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of cost and is one of the most affordable lenses you ’ll find in the Canon range when you consider the quality of the images it produces .
While this lens is not much to look at in terms of size , weight or even construction it is significantly faster than any of the other lenses mentioned above at f/1.8 .
This will allow you to shoot at quite low light levels , especially if you up your ISO ( remember you get grain at higher ISO ) .
I use this lens when I do n’t want to lug the other one around with me ( I leave it locked up at the hotel ) , especially at night .
The Positives for this lens are :
• Speed – f/1.8 is the fastest lens I ’ve currently got in my collection .
It ’s great indoors especially when a flash is not allowed or appropriate .
• Weight / Size – you can fit it in your pocket easily and will hardly know it ’s there – perfect for taking out at night or when you need to travel especially light
• Price – last time I looked on Amazon it was just over $ 100 USD
• Quality – while it ’s no ‘ L ’ Series lens many argue that when you consider it ’s price it ’s one of the best quality lenses going around on a ‘ dollar to quality ratio’ .
• Focal length – although you ’re limited to one focal length it is a useful one .
I find it works well with portraits and in getting in nice and close for tightly framed shots of things in street - scapes etc .
On the downside of this lens :
• Focal length – it is a handy length for some shots but not having a zoom can be frustrating if you ’re used to that .
It ’s also a little too long for landscapes ( especially on non full frame cameras where it ’s the equivalent of an 80 mm lens .
• Build Quality – this lens can be a little hard to take seriously when you first pick it up because it ’s so light that it feels like a toy .
It ’s quite ‘ plasticy ’ .
It is also a reasonably noisy lens and not the fastest at focussing in low light .
Alternatives to the 50 mm f/1.8
The following lenses are alternatives to the 50 mm f/1.8 in terms of their speed and size
• Canon EF 50 mm f1.4 USM – if the focal length is right but you ’re a bit put off by the quality of the f /1.8 lens you might want to spend a bit more ( actually it ’s more than 4 times more ) and get it ’s faster big brother – the f /1.4 version .
Once again it ’s small , light and takes sharp pictures .
Despite it being more expensive it ’s still quite reasonably priced and is significantly better in terms of quality of build and image .
While I love my f/1.8
I wish I ’d spent a little more and got this one instead .
• Canon EF 28 mm f/1.8 USM – worth considering also when using a non full frame camera is a wider angle lens like this 28 mm one ( equivalent of a 45 mm lens ) .
In many ways this one has a very similar feature list to the f /1.4 lens .
It ’s small , light , fast and not too expensive .
• Canon EF 20 mm f/2.8 USM – go even wider angle with a 20 mm lens .
It ’s not as small as either of the 50 mm lenses but is still small enough and gets some very positive reviews .
Other L Series lenses that you might want to consider :
If money is no object and you do n’t mind lugging around extra gear here are a few more ‘ L’ Series lenses that I know friends take with them .
They ’re not cheap or light but the results are stunning .
• Canon EF 17 - 40 mm f/4L USM or the Canon EF 16 - 35 mm f/2.8L USM – two wider angle zoom which would match well with the 24 -105 mm lens .
The 16 - 35 mm is especially useful as a faster lens .
These lenses are great for portrait and landscape work .
I own the 17 - 40 mm lens and it is a lens I ’d strongly consider taking away ( it ’d be my number 1 above if I had n’t just bought the 24 - 105 mm and if weight was n’t an issue I ’d take it in addition to the other two every time ) .
• Canon EF 70-200 mm f/2.8L IS USM or the Canon EF 70 - 200 mm f/4L USM – if you think you ’ll need some extra length on a zoom I ’m a big fan of the 70 - 200 mm range .
Of course the 2.8 version is faster and great for lower light situations .
Couple these with one of Canon ’s lens extenders and you will add even more length .
Keep in mind that these are sizeable lenses to travel with and because they are both white they can draw attention to you and could make you a target for people who might want to take them off your hands .
Travel Photo Source
One more for Consideration
Lastly I have one friend who swears by the Canon EF - S 10 - 22 mm f/3.5-4.5 USM when he travels .
He ’s a big landscape shooter but also loves getting in close to people for wide angle portraits .
His shots are always interesting and so this could also be a good option as it ’s not a huge or weighty lens and it wo n’t break the bank as much as an L - Series lens .
As I think about it this would probably compliment the 24 -105 mm lens nicely in terms of focal length as it ’d give you an almost unbroken range ( apart from 22 - 24 mm ) from 10 mm to 105 mm .

DUI Cases Thrown Out Due to Closed - Source Breathalyzer
Really :
Hundreds of cases involving breath - alcohol tests have been thrown out by Seminole County judges in the past five months because the test ’s manufacturer will not disclose how the machines work .
I think this is huge .
( Think of the implications for voting systems , for one . )
And it ’s the right decision .
Throughout history , the government has had to make the choice : prosecute , or keep your investigative methods secret .
They could n’t have both .
If they wanted to keep their methods secret , they had to give up on prosecution .
People have the right to confront their accuser .
And people have the right to a public trial .
This is the correct decision , and we are all safer because of it .

“ Consumers do n’t expect a slowing economy , ” said Richard T. Curtin , who heads the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan .
“ According to consumers , we are going to improve . ”
Given the parallels , perhaps it is not surprising that the economy is providing the same sort of political ammunition as it did 10 years ago .
“ Profits are up for our companies , but where are the wage increases ? ” asked Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , in an online conversation with voters last month , after announcing that she intends to run for president .
“ Where are the , you know , the benefits that should accrue to hard - working Americans ? ”
Wage increases have , indeed , been slow in coming .
In December , 61 months after the economy started to grow , the wages of production and other nonmanagement workers were barely 1.7 percent higher , after inflation , than when the economy hit bottom in November 2001 .
Most of those gains came in the last few months .
But many people have forgotten that , initially , the expansion of the 1990s was also called a “ jobless recovery , ” and then a “ joyless ” one , when employment started growing but real wages did not .
In April 1996 , 61 months into that growth cycle , the hourly wages of nonmanagement workers were actually worth 0.4 percent less , after inflation , than when the expansion began .
“ Now this is a real economic slowdown , ” Mr. Dole said on a campaign stop in Florida in October of that year .
“ And I might say , it ’s disastrous news for American workers and businesses and even worse news for low - and moderate - income Americans who have been squeezed and squeezed and squeezed by lower wages and higher taxes in this administration . ”
Advocates on each side insist that government policy was crucial to steering the economy .
Gene B. Sperling , a former economic adviser to Mr. Clinton , argued that his administration ’s efforts to cut the budget deficit were instrumental in bringing down interest rates and improving investors ’ confidence in the economy .

Why a flounder ?
Downloads A Degree in Brick Science
A number of us out here in the Real World have been appalled at the quality , if such a word can even be applied , of bright young undergraduate Computer Science students .
In my teaching , I find people who are essentially functionally illiterate in their profession .
What should a graduate be expected to know ?
Certainly , how to create and manipulate a linked list , how to set and clear bits in a value .
They should know the syntax of whatever languages they claim to be proficient in .
I teach courses in which " knowledge of the C language " is a prerequisite .
In some cases , I fully believe the prospective students interpret this " Can spell the name of the language , with only an occasional error " .
A student was stuck on a problem in writing a piece of code .
I said , " well , in that case you would have to write something of the form ' if condition then ...' and only do the computation if the condition holds " .
This seemed obvious .
A few minutes later I looked over his shoulder , and he had typed , in a C program if condition then and was trying to decide what to write next !
void AddToList ( Item * p ) { if ( head == NULL ) head = tail = p ; else { tail -> next = p ; tail = p ; } }
One student had serious problems with this .
It would n't compile .
This is because I had pre-supplied them with a prototype function
void AddToList ( Item * data ) { //... your code here }
Of course , you can probably guess what happened : he copied the text directly from my example , and could n't figure out why the symbol p was undefined .
By far the worst was a woman who worked at the Software Engineering Institute .
She was a brand - new hire from CMU , one of the top- rated computer science schools in the country , or perhaps the world .
She had written
printf ( " The value is %d , " value ) ;
and the compiler was giving her a syntax error .
I spotted it ( can you ?
Go take a look ... ) in seconds .
So I said to her , " you transposed the comma and quote mark " and walked away .
A few minutes later as I passed back she told me it still would n't compile .
So I saw the same error , and said " You have to put the comma outside the quote mark " .
She looked at me , and in perfect sincerity said " But the comma always goes inside the quote mark ! " .
I started to explain to her that no , it was a parameter separator and had to go outside the quote mark , and she interrupted me to insist the code was syntactically correct .
Everyone knows the comma belongs inside the quote mark !
Why , her English teachers had downgraded her text when she put the comma outside the quote mark !
I made some remark about she was clearly too stupid to know how to breathe , and I was certainly not going to waste my time explaining C syntax to a CMU B.S. in Computer Science .
I did my best to get her removed from any place that might put her in actual contact with a computer , but there was no one with the taste or intelligence to get rid of her .
But I managed to avoid her the remainder of my time there .
She once wrote a program we were all supposed to use ; it was so bad it would have been an embarrassment to my nephew when he was 12 ; he had been programming two years at that point ( he graduated in 2003 with a degree in computer graphics ) .
Peter Viscarola , in his " Peter Pontificates " column in the OSR newsletter , has similar observations .
He talks about interviewing prospective candidates who had two semesters of Operating Systems and could n't explain synchronization .
Who had two semesters of Operating Systems and had not written a single line of code during that time .
I know someone at Microsoft whose test to prospective new hires was " Insert this item into a linked list in sorted order " .
Of the 27 prospects , exactly one , a woman working on her PhD , was able to do it at all .
I have at least some idea of what is going wrong .
The Brick Science Major
Imagine that there was a Brick Science major in a university .
What would it look like , if it were modeled after most Computer Science programs ?
In the freshman year , we teach the students about bricks .
The kinds of bricks .
The sizes of bricks .
The purposes of bricks .
Plain bricks , glazed bricks , outdoor bricks , paving bricks , fire bricks .
Each exam tests their knowledge of specific kinds of bricks and what they are used for .
In the sophomore year we introduce them to Brick Theory .
How bricks are made .
What goes into the mix .
The effects of impurities in bricks , both negative ( defective bricks ) and positive ( coloration ) .
We teach them the chemistry of bricks .
The proper firing temperatures for different kinds of bricks .
They learn how to analyze brick performance ( breaking strength , water permeability , robustness and other considerations in Analysis of Bricks ) .
They finally understand why some bricks come with three little holes in them ( they knew about the existence of these in their freshman year , but not why they are present ) .
In the junior year we explain about how mortar puts bricks together .
Since they now have more background , in two semesters we start with basic mortar theory and work down to optimum blends of mortar for various purposes .
They learn about curing time .
They learn about brick - mortar combinations .
They learn about pointing , and why it is necessary .
They know how to determine the bonding strength by measuring the forces that are required to split two bricks that have been mortared together .
In the senior year we introduce them to systems .
We talk about the costs of field deployment of brick - mortar systems , including installation and maintenance , long - term issues such as system robustness under weather , salt , and other stress conditions .
And we have a senior project .
Each group of students gets to build a three - block - high , six - block - wide wall , using bricks and mortar of their choice , and explain why they made these choices .
They graduate .
They have a B.S. in Brick Science .
Their first assignment : " Build a decorative brick wall " .
At this point they realize , or should realize , how little they have actually learned .
They have never built anything larger than 18 bricks .
They do n't know that trick all bricklayers use , of stretching a cord so all the bricks are level along the 100 ' wall .
They certainly would n't have any idea about the modern approach , which is a laser that " paints " a line across the bricks .
They do n't know how to deal with wind forces on a tall wall .
Nobody told them about footers or frost lines .
They do n't even know how to use one of those bricklaying hammers to split a brick in two .
And they have n't the foggiest idea about aesthetics , so they do n't know what " decorative " really means .
In the building trades , there is training , but this is just a preparation for " apprenticeship " .
That lasts several years , under the tutelage of experienced bricklayers .
Only after a certain skill set is demonstrated is the individual promoted from " apprentice " to " journeyman " ( or to be politically correct , " journeyperson " ) .
When a level of serious expertise is achieved , the person becomes a " master " .
All too often , junior programmers are treated as if they are experienced , and are abandoned .
I 've spent a lot of time mentoring junior people , and it is an absolutely necessary part of one 's professional responsibility .
But before they are worth mentoring , they have to be functionally literate .
With a few notable exceptions ( such as the SEI hire ) these are not learning - challenged people ; these are people with Bachelor 's degrees from often major universities .
If they do n't know the basics of their profession , it is either their fault , or the fault of the programs they go through .
A bricklayer is expected to be physically capable of doing the work , and able to perform tasks such as adding and subtracting , using a ruler , and knowing which end of the trowel you hold and which end you dip in the mortar .
That SEI new hire was , relative to her claimed profession , incapable of recognizing a brick .
Everything else was more sophisticated than that .
When I told this story to a friend of mine , Kevin Nolish , a senior engineer at Marconi , he said " No , the one difference between your story and reality is that it is more likely the foreman puts his arm around the new hire 's shoulder , points him to a pile of lumber , and says " Go forth and build " . "
What about other schools who have a more " application - oriented " curriculum .
It is simple .
The program works like this :
In their freshman year , they are told about paving bricks .
An entire year is devoted to how to use paving bricks .
In their sophomore year , they learn how to make entrance porches out of paving bricks .
In their junior year , they learn how to make sidewalks out of paving bricks .
In their senior year , they learn how to make driveways out of paving bricks .
This is very complex , because they have to deal with supporting a heavy weight .
The post - graduation scenario is the same .
This is like the schools that offer a " computer science " major in which all the programming for four years is done in exactly one of Pascal , C , FORTRAN , BASIC , Visual Basic , Java , COBOL , or whatever ( the language changes with the current language fad ; the problems remain ) .
If you ask the students what a " finite state machine " is , they look at you blankly .
Tell them their algorithm is n2 and they glaze over .
They would not recognize an NP - hard problem or a unsolvable problem if one came up and bit them on the ankles .
They have probably never done a team project , or written a program larger than 1000 lines .
Perhaps not that large .
The self - taught bricklayers go down to the local home improvement center , buy a sack or two of some kind of mortar , a trunkload or two of some kind of brick they find on sale , and go home and build the wall .
The good ones buy a good " how - to " book about bricklaying .
Most of them read it .
Some of those try to understand it .
A couple of them actually do .
None of these people , in any of the above scenarios , are actually exposed to a professional bricklayer .
When the wall collapses , or buckles , in the first Spring after it is constructed , people like me are called in to rebuild it .
Sometimes people complain when I am acerbic about semi-random piles of bricks more - or - less held together by something approximating mortar .
True story : we once had an interviewee for a job who seemed a little below threshold .
My associate asked him " What is the largest program you 've ever written ? "
He proudly said " 800 lines ! "
The previous weekend I had written 2500 lines of code .
That included several hours off to go to a symphony performance .
I am in the habit of referring to " trivial 10,000 line programs " which has a tendency to shock whatever students I 'm talking to .
Most of them think of a 5,000 line program as a massive work .
Most of my serious programs run around 100,000 lines ; some are up to about 250,000 .
I once wrote 100,000 lines of code in one year .
My coworker , who was also running the business end of the company , only wrote 70,000 .
The program had been almost 80,000 lines in February , when I was hired .
It was 238,000 at the start of March the following year ( the numbers do n't quite sum up because we also threw some modules away .
He worked in a nearly - totally - disjoint set of modules from the set I worked in , so we could easily account for who - wrote - what ) .
He was a completely self - taught programmer who wrote some of the most elegant code I had ever seen .
He was an artisan who programmed ( he actually was an artisan , having done a lot of fancy woodworking before he went back to school to major in CS ) .
[ In the 5 days preceding my writing this essay , I 've written 4470 lines of source code .
My billable time was 31 hours .
That 's 144 lines / hour ( Japanese Programming Productivity Standard ) , not including the 28 - page reference manual to go with it which I wrote during the same period on the same billing time .
The Japanese Productivity Standard allows me to count the lines of existing libraries I can reuse .
If I deduct the 1038 lines of existing library I used , that 's 3,423 lines , or 110 lines / hour of real productivity .
This is slower than my usual standard because this had to be utterly beautiful " reference code " , had to be compilable on at least three different platforms ( NDA forbids me from saying what the other two are ) and I sweated over it , and we did at least one nontrivial revision that involved throwing away a few hundred lines to simply the task , once we had the correct model .
At one time , the industry productivity standard was 5 lines per hour , with a " super- programmer " able to write 20 lines / hour of deliverable code .
And that was without full testing and documentation . ]
I 've worked on projects involving 20 - 30 programmers , producing production code which had to be used by many other people .
Concepts such as unit testing , checkout / checkin , build integrity , etc. are critical here .
It is the responsibility of the senior people to train the junior people .
It is the responsibility of the universities and colleges to prepare them for that training .
This means teaching them how to reason about programs , and how to learn .
Everything else is just syntax .
Give me a programmer who knows how to reason about programs , and I can teach him / her the syntax of the language in a short time .
I do n't have to explain why a construct makes sense , only how to implement it in the language / environment of choice .
And I can explain how to maintain modularity , abstraction , and build well - structured programs without having to explain why it is a good idea .
The hardest problem is teaching people how to reason about programming as an art form .
Recently , I was asked to comment on a piece of Windows code .
It has to rank as among the most incompetently - written pieces of code I had ever seen .
It would not make sense in any language , on any platform , in any environment .
My comment was that I had stopped reading it after four lines , because it was clear in those four lines that the code was unsalvageable .
Nothing else would matter .
It was followed a few days later by an even worse example from the same programmer .
The poster asked how he could convince his manager the author of this code was just taking up space .
I commented that it was worse than that .
Someone who is just taking up space has no net productivity .
This person was incredibly dangerous because he was not just taking up space ; he was actively causing serious damage .
A person so incompetent that the only possible service to society was to keep him as far as possible from any compiler .
" How could code this bad pass a code review ? " I asked .
And then said " You do have code reviews , do n't you ? " , knowing perfectly well the answer was " No " .
No sane organization could have passed code like this .
The deficiencies of this programmer would have been made obvious , nearly instantly .
It would be clear that the only solutions were either to get this person trained , or get rid of him .
Code reviews are important .
There is no code that cannot be improved by a code review .
I especially include my own code .
I 've had to do code reviews for clients , as I train their programmers to take it over .
I find bugs .
I find poorly - coded algorithms .
My code always improves as a consequence of a code review , and it is really good code to start .
The improvements are usually minor changes , but they are nonetheless improvements .
And the programmers I 'm training always learn something new and useful .
No construction foreman in his right mind would charge a brand - new Brick Science major with the task of building a decorative brick wall without making sure the person was properly trained , and would carefully supervise the person .
And would probably not be polite about really stupid design decisions ( " What do you mean , ' What 's a footer ? '
Where in the $ %#! did you learn how to build a wall ? " )
Yet programming managers regularly assume that their new Computer Science majors are competent to program .
I have found this is rarely true .
Most of them are almost literate ; some of them can program a linked list without their lips moving ( I 'm not kidding : see my earlier comment about a roomful of CS majors , none of whom knew how to build a linked list ) .
Some of the code I 've seen in production would not survive a code review .
Imagine if a building could be built without any form of building inspection to certify that it was safe .
I 've had to go down to the courthouse and apply for a building permit to do home improvements .
I had to provide plans .
I 'm experienced enough to know that I have no idea how to build a deck , or reinforce a building , but I know how to hire people who do .
If I were going to make my career as an architect , I 'd sure find the best people to learn from .
[ True story : one day I went down to buy a building permit .
The person ahead of me in line was being heavily grilled by the person behind the counter about things like shear strength of the connection of his deck to his house , load - bearing of the floor of the deck , etc .
I kept thinking " I 'm doomed .
I ca n't answer any of that ! "
My turn came .
I presented my plans .
The person behind the counter picked up my plans , looked at the embossed " Registered Professional Architect " seal down in the lower corner , looked at me and said " That will be $ 15 " .
That was it .
The plans cost me $ 400 .
Worth every penny . ]
One reason that I consider myself a good programmer is that I learned from some of the best .
And for that matter , some of the worst ( as in " I would never build anything that shoddy " ) .
But certainly the good things I learned was from programmers more experienced and tasteful than I was ( especially in my 20s ) .
By the time I was in my 30s , I was good , and I 've been trying to become better all the time .
I read a lot of code .
I see a lot of good ideas .
I try to make them my own .

It 's official .
It is now completely impossible to find things on the web using a search engine .
Try this out .
Go to Google and see if you can find a
cheap hotel in new york
What comes up ?
Any hotels ?
Not really .
Just page after page of spammy affiliate sites that promise to find you great deals , but will really just send you off to other affiliate sites .
Click along and you 'll fall down this black hole of non-content and Google Ads with no hope of ever finding a real website where you can book a cheap hotel in New York .
I blame this phenomenon on Google 's Pagerank algorithm and its reliance on link counts .
The quickest way to get to the top of the rankings is to produce tons of empty pages all across the web , all linking back to your thing .
So you get this huge global competition to see who can produce the most useless content and shove it out onto the web .
Everybody knows it 's not really content , but the game is to fool the search engines into indexing it anyway .
Let this strategy play itself out for a few years and you get the Internet in its current state .
21,800,000 pages all wanting to tell me about cheap hotels in New York .
Only 1 of which is Expedia.com ( and it 's not in the top 30 . )
It 's a lot like the state of professional boxing in the ' 80s .
You had this kid who could fight , so you 'd put him in against some guys you thought he could beat and he'd get some ranking points for himself .
Then you 'd find some highly ranked fighters who were on their way out and let him fight them , boosting his ranking some more .
Then you 'd get some other kids that were n't really all that good to start with , but you 'd boost their rankings in the same way until they had enough points to put in against your guy .
He 'd beat them easily and get even more points for himself .
This would go on for a few years , with your kid steadily climbing the rankings without ever really fighting anybody good , since everybody you put him in against had had their ranking inflated by the same means .
Finally , there comes the day when he 's earned himself a title shot .
What happens ?
Mike Tyson knocks him out in 18 seconds and that 's the last you ever hear about him .
( And Don King pockets another $ 20 Million . )
So maybe that 's what Google needs , the SEO equivalent of the Tyson fight .
If your site manages to weasel its way into the top 5 for a given keyword , you get some real people to put eyes on the thing and see if it can hang with the competition .
That way , people like you and me would never have to sift through search engine results from www.dealz-4-hotelzz.pl just because they managed to link spam their way up the rankings .
ps .
I 'm in no way guilt free in this area .
Before writing this today , I spent the morning trolling around editme.com and picking up a couple high - ranking domains from them ( travel.editme.com and wus.editme.com ) , which I am now using for shady SEO practices ...

“ IF A person walked in tomorrow and requested a uterine transplant , I am cautiously optimistic that we could be successful . ”
So says Giuseppe Del Priore , of New York Downtown Hospital , who has approval for such a transplant from the hospital ’s review board .
He has potential donors lined up , and is interviewing women who would like to receive a donated uterus .
Thousands of women with perfectly good ovaries but lacking a functioning uterus would be interested .
If a uterus transplant was carried out tomorrow , it would only be the second ever .
Would it be safe ?
The first was in Saudi Arabia …
Or just read the following : This is a guy born with a M on his hand .
His power : to blow perfect bubble rings underwater .
On TV .
In Japan .
Throughout 2005 , my clients — contractors of all trades , fabricators , and suppliers — have watched housing continue on its tear .
Housing demand seems insatiable .
Residential , commercial , and public works contractors are busy all across the U.S.
When housing subdivisions and condominium complexes are built out , commercial and public works projects often follow .
Strip malls , supermarkets , restaurants , and department stores are constructed to serve these new population centers — much to the delight of the commercial construction trades .
With these new population centers comes the " need " for new public schools and other public infrastructure .
Public works contractors get a piece of the action as well .
Most of my clients are quite busy and turning nice profits .
However , during a recent business trip , a common theme emerged in meeting after meeting .
My customers are seeing severe shortages in building materials and quality labor .
Many are outright stating that the heady pace of construction is simply unsustainable .
In turn , some of the more seasoned contractors are predicting a bust — but they just do n’t know when ; yet I will hazard a guess .
In my meeting notes , I found that contractors were running into shortages of the following ( pre and post - Hurricane Katrina ) :
Certain dimensional lumbers
Concrete
Labor
Oriented strand board
Plumbing supplies
Plywood
PVC pipe
Quality architectural designs and plans ( indicating a strained architectural labor pool )
Roofing materials
Steel
Of these shortages , the one causing the most frustration pertains to a dearth of quality labor .
Contractors , frequently , have little choice but to load their construction budgets with ample overtime pay in order to keep quality ( and often shorthanded ) crews together for the duration of a project .
One client quipped : " This constant battle for labor and materials ca n’t go on forever .
Things have to cool down sooner or later .
But when ? "
As to precisely when the bust will occur , this is not knowable .
As to why boom turns into bust , only the Austrian Theory of the Trade Cycle provides the intellectual framework allowing one to understand the boom - bust cycle .
What we will find , as explained by Roger Garrison , is that central banking is at the epicenter of the business cycle .
Dr. Garrison provides the following explanation in the Mises Institute ’s fabulous book The Austrian Theory of the Trade Cycle :
The Austrian theory of the business cycle emerges straightforwardly from a simple comparison of savings - induced growth , which is sustainable , with a credit - induced boom , which is not .
An increase in saving by individuals and a credit expansion orchestrated by the central bank set into motion market processes whose initial allocational effects on the economy ’s capital structure are similar .
But the ultimate consequences of the two processes stand in stark contrast : Saving gets us genuine growth ; credit expansion gets us boom and bust .
Undoubtedly , the current American housing boom has not been built upon a foundation of savings — keeping in mind that , presently , America has a negative savings rate .
This boom has been fueled by the Federal Reserve ’s aggressive creation of money and credit .
Correspondingly , the federal funds rate hit a low of 1 % in June of 2003 — about the same time the housing boom began to accelerate .
Since money and credit can be created out of thin air , yet building materials and other resources cannot , does it not stand to reason that relentless credit creation would lead to resource shortages ?
Of course , the answer is " yes " — and Austrian economists know this .
Accordingly , Roger Garrison covers this issue in his excellent book Time and Money : The Macroeconomics of Capital Structure :
In sum , credit expansion sets into motion a process of capital restructuring that is at odds with the unchanged preferences and hence is ill - fated .
The relative changes within the capital structure were appropriately termed malinvestment by Mises … The boom is unsustainable ; the changes in the intertemporal structure of production are self - defeating .
Resource scarcities and a continuing high demand for current consumption eventually turn boom into bust .
It is not often one finds an economic theory that describes reality — and Austrian theory does so magnificently .
In fact , from the labor and materials shortages my clients have described , it would seem the bust phase of the business cycle is nearly upon us .
Tom Barrack , widely considered to be among the world ’s greatest real estate investors , wittingly or not , has an Austrian perspective as to why the United States ’ real estate / housing boom will soon come to an end .
He stated the following , about real estate , in a recent Fortune article : " There ’s too much money chasing too few good deals , with too much debt and too few brains … .
That ’s why I ’m getting out . "
Tom Barrack certainly understands the dangers of high - octane credit expansion .
Yet , what about the inevitable resource scarcities caused by the Federal Reserve ’s accommodative credit policy and how will this affect the housing bubble ?
In the following excerpt , from this article , Mr. Barrack hits the ball out of the park :
…he sees the bubble deflating soon .
Barrack thinks the catalyst will be a trend that few others are talking about , a steep rise in the price of building materials and labor .
“ Construction costs have spiked 30 % in the past nine months , ” he says .
The reasons : shortages of labor and materials like lumber because of the building boom , and increases in the price of oil , needed to produce everything from plastic piping to insulation to shingles .
The slump will show up first in speculative hot spots like Miami and Las Vegas , he says , where condo developers are preselling their projects for what look like big profits .
When they actually build the units over the next year or two , he predicts , they will end up spending more than the units are now selling for .
At that point , says Barrack , the developers will try to raise prices .
“ But most of these buyers are speculators , ” he says .
“ They will either sue the developers to get the original prices or get their deposits back and walk away . ”
The developers will then put the units back on the market , and the glut of vacant condos will drive prices down .
“ It ’s the busted deals caused by construction costs that will cause a turn in the market , ” he predicts .
To be sure , the severe construction labor and materials shortages , seen throughout the U.S. , signify the housing boom is nearing its end .
Not surprisingly , Austrian economic theory predicted such shortages would emerge before boom turns to bust .
For good measure , let ’s throw in the following housing affordability and financial - stress factors into the fray — which also point to the impending demise of the housing bubble :
The average American household has $ 10,000 of credit card debt and , due to pressures brought to bear by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , minimum payments are now doubling .
Soaring energy prices are going to make for financially punishing heating bills this winter — McMansions are energy hogs .
The Federal Reserve just raised the fed funds rate to 4 % .
Hence , there should be no surprise that mortgage interest rates are at 15 - month highs .
Price inflation is much higher than Uncle Sam ’s Consumer Price Index suggests — just go to the gas station and to the grocery store .
The ratio of house prices to rental values is at an all - time high .
The ratio of house prices to disposable income is highly elevated .
But what about my promise to hazard a guess as to the timing of the bust ?
After all , Tom Barrack indicated that he sees enough busted deals materializing , over the next year or two , to bring about a downturn in the real estate market .
In order to make a reasonable prediction , I am going to bring into the mix a September 2005 Federal Reserve discussion paper titled House Prices and Monetary Policy : A Cross -Country Study .
Per this discussion paper ’s abstract : " This paper examines periods of pronounced rises and falls of real house prices since 1970 in eighteen major industrial countries , with particular focus on the lessons for monetary policy . "
Here is what I found to be most interesting : " House price booms are typically preceded by a period of easing monetary policy , with policy rates bottoming out about the same time that house prices take off , about three years before house prices peak . "
Considering the fed funds rate did not bottom out , at 1 % , until June of 2003 ( and remained at 1 % , until June of 2004 , before being ratcheted upwards ) one could reasonably surmise house prices will peak somewhere between June of 2006 and June of 2007 — and then , of course , will break downwards ( for the reasons mentioned above ) .
With a plausible timeframe in hand , I am predicting the housing bubble will begin to burst within the next 14 months — perhaps by around December of 2006 .
Ultimately , we have a housing boom built on credit ( and not savings ) which has lead to labor and materials shortages and has lead to overleveraged consumers .
This is why I see a bust — as indicated by accelerating mortgage defaults and a general decline in housing prices — commencing well before June of 2007 .
To close , always remember Austrian theory allows us to know there will be a central bank - induced bust .
As to timing , I am only providing an educated guess .

U.S. , Iran share interests in Iraq , Khatami says NEW YORK  Former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami said Monday that U.S. forces should remain in Iraq until that country 's fragile government can assume greater control .
In an interview here during his first trip to the United States since leaving office a year ago , Khatami said , " We can't leave this newly formed government at the mercy of terrorists and insurgents . "
Khatami is a moderate Islamic cleric who was president from 1997 to 2005 .
By law , he could not seek a third consecutive term .
He was succeeded by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a hard - line fundamentalist .
Despite the change in the leadership , Khatami said that Iran is not the enemy of the United States and that the two countries share strategic interests in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Khatami said Iran , which is predominantly Shiite , did n't provide weapons to Iraqi Shiites while he was in power .
He said he doubts that the current leadership is doing so , as has been charged by U.S. officials including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
" No one will benefit as much as Iran from peace and stability in Iraq , " he said .
Addressing the issue that is creating the most tension between Iran and the international community , Khatami urged the Bush administration and his own government to resolve the dispute over Iran 's nuclear program through negotiations .
While not directly criticizing his successor , Khatami noted that when he was in office , Iran suspended efforts to make nuclear fuel and agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Iran has reversed both policies in the past year and rejected an Aug.
31 United Nations deadline to either suspend its uranium enrichment program or face sanctions .
" Sanctions are to the detriment of Iran , " Khatami said .
" Sanctions — and , even worse than that , military action — will only serve to complicate the issue , not solve the problem . "
He criticized both Ahmadinejad and President Bush for using intemperate language that has heightened tensions .
" A politician must conduct himself at the highest level of etiquette and diplomacy , " Khatami said , when asked about Ahmadinejad 's comments threatening Israel and denying the Holocaust .
Khatami said he hoped Bush 's use of the term " Islamic fascism " to describe countries such as Iran " is a misquote .
It would be unfortunate that a president of the great nation of America would use words in such an irresponsible way . "
Khatami spent the weekend in Chicago , where he told a conference of U.S. Muslims that the U.S. - led war on terrorism is increasing violence and Muslim hatred for the West .
He attends meetings at the U.N. today and Wednesday , then flies to Washington to speak at National Cathedral .
Khatami , 62 , now heads a group called the International Center for Dialogue Among Civilizations , based in Tehran and Geneva .
He said he was devoting his time to trying to increase understanding among nationalities , religious and ethnic groups .
He described his visit as private and said he had not sought to meet U.S. officials .
Several U.S. politicians and interest groups criticized the State Department for giving Khatami a visa .
Sen. Rick Santorum , R - Pa. , called Khatami " one of the chief propagandists of the Islamic fascist regime . "
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Khatami was eligible to visit as a private citizen .
Khatami visited New York three times as president but was never allowed to go outside New York .
Asked his impressions of the country so far , Khatami said he was happy to have the chance to travel with fewer restrictions but that to see America fully would require " much more time . "
Enlarge By M. Spencer Green , AP Mohammad Khatami speaks at an Islamic center Saturday in Streamwood , Ill .
The former Iranian leader urged Muslims to engage in dialogue with people of all faiths .
What makes people different may not just be their different genes , but how many copies they have of each one , and how many stretches of DNA are “ missing ” .
Two separate studies of the human genome have revealed an unsuspected amount of variation between people in the number of copies of genes they have .
Such variations appear to involve as much as 12 % of our DNA , and raise questions about what constitutes a “ normal ” genome .
Originally , the differences between individuals were thought simply to be the result of mutations , whereby single bases in a DNA strand change , which can cause small changes in the proteins the DNA codes for .
Then in the 1990s scientists discovered that people also differed in the number of copies of genes they had , with large chunks of one person ’s DNA being duplicated or deleted when compared to another ’s .
Extra copies of identical genes can even cause disease with no mutation involved ( see Genomics : We are all numbers ) .

What is normal ?
How much of this duplication and deletion occurs is not clear , but now two separate groups of researchers have found that it involves more of the genome than anyone suspected .
Stephen Scherer at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto , Canada , and colleagues sought out differently deleted or duplicated chunks of DNA in the two complete human genome sequences so far produced .
They discovered that nearly 24 million nucleotides are involved in such “ copy number variants ” ( CNVs ) .
They conclude that adding this kind of variation to the single - base mutations we already knew about means “ significantly more variation exists between humans than was previously estimated ” .
As personalised genetic sequencing becomes more common , they say , questions will be raised as to whose genome will be considered “ normal ” .
Immense contribution
Meanwhile , Matt Hurles at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge , UK , and colleagues compared genomes from 270 people in four ethnic groups : Yoruba in Nigeria ; European descendants in the US ; Han Chinese in Beijing ; and Japanese in Tokyo .
They measured the number of copies of genes by looking at how well chunks of the genomes bonded to each other .
They found 1447 CNVs , covering about 12 % of the human genome .
“ One of the real surprises of these results was just how much of our DNA varies in copy number .
We now appreciate the immense contribution of this phenomenon to genetic differences between individuals , ” says Hurles .
“ Each one of us has a unique pattern of gains and losses of complete sections of DNA . ”
“ This research paper will change forever the field of human genetics , ” says James Lupski at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in the US , an independent CNV expert .
Now , when seeking genetic causes for diseases , scientists will have to look , not just for mutations , but for CNVs , he says .
The new data have been placed in the public domain to help researchers do this .

How are these for alarming statistics :
With more students than ever applying to college — a full 1.2 million more last year than in 2000 — not even flawless SAT scores can open doors at Harvard , which rejects one in four applicants with a perfect 2400 .
Is your kid ranked first in his class ?
So are some 36,000 others : Last year , Penn and Duke rejected about 60 percent of the valedictorians who applied .
If you know anyone in high school ( or preschool ) you ’re already aware that the annihilative admissions climate has spawned a new hyperspecies : the college super - applicant .
But do so many hours spent filling in practice circles or hunching over petri dishes really work ?
We recruited some of the area ’s most credentialed college hopefuls , who gamely volunteered to have their grade - point averages , standardized test scores , after - school pursuits , and academic awards reviewed by Katherine Cohen , CEO and founder of IvyWise , a school - admissions consulting company .
Cohen assessed their strengths and weaknesses and made a guess where each student will get in .
She stresses , however , that this is only a partial picture ; she ’d need to see transcripts , essays , AP course load , and written recommendations to make an accurate evaluation .

She ’s not doing random community service to collect hours .
There is one red flag , which is that she stopped gymnastics this year .
Apparently , her school dropped the program ; this should be footnoted on her résumé so she does not appear to be a quitter .
She has a shot at Harvard depending upon what she wants to pursue ; she ’s in the range of their typical applicants . ”

Cheney ’s independent operation — Part II
On Monday , we talked about the Office of the Vice President refusing to cooperate with a government directory known as the “ Plum Book , ” which lists government employees .
Federal agencies have to comply by listing staffers in the directory , but Dick Cheney ’s office claimed an exemption for itself , arguing that the “ Vice Presidency is a unique office that is neither a part of the executive branch nor a part of the legislative branch . ”
In other words , employees of the three branches of the federal government have to give staff lists for the Plum Book , but the OVP apparently believes it ’s not part any of the three branches .
At the risk of sounding overdramatic , it ’s one of those horrifying arguments that makes me worry about the integrity of our constitutional system .
And as it turns out , Cheney ’s OVP keeps using it .
An important legal ruling is pending over Vice President Cheney ’s refusal to disclose statistics on document classification and declassification activity .
The Information Security Oversight Office , which is responsible for the policy and oversight of the government ’s security classification system , has asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to direct Cheney ’s office to disclose these statistics .
Cheney ’s office provided the information until 2002 but then stopped doing so , J. William Leonard , the director of ISOO , told U.S. News .
At issue is whether the office of the vice president is an executive branch entity when it comes to supporting the activities of the president and the vice president .
The reporting requirements for disclosing classification and declassification activity fall under a presidential executive order .
“ Basically the definition says that any entity of the executive branch that comes into possession of classified information is covered by the reporting requirements , ” says Leonard .
“ I have my understanding of what the executive order requires , and I ’m going to the attorney general to ascertain if my reading of the executive order is correct . ”
However , Megan McGinn , Cheney ’s deputy press secretary , says the vice president ’s office is exempt .
“ This matter has been thoroughly reviewed , ” McGinn told U.S. News , “ and it has been determined that reporting requirements do not apply to the office of the vice president , which has both legislative and executive functions . ”
At the risk of sounding intemperate , this is insane .
Cheney ’s office seems to have declared itself some kind of fourth branch of the government .
It ’s legislative , it ’s executive , it ’s accountable to no one .. it ’s the super branch .
In this particular case , the executive branch is required to disclose statistics on document classification and declassification activity to the Information Security Oversight Office .
It ’s about accountability and oversight , two words that seem to send shivers down Cheney ’s spine .
The OVP ’s creative constitutional interpretation leads it to a convenient conclusion , keeping secret their efforts to keep things secret .
Or , more accurately , how much stuff they keep secret .
“ No secrets would be revealed , only statistics , ” says Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists , who urged ISOO to obtain the compliance of the vice president ’s office last May .
“ But the office of the vice president is resisting even that minimal level of accountability . ”
If the attorney general determines that Cheney ’s interpretation of the executive order is right , Leonard says it would be the final answer .
“ That ’s it for me , ” says Leonard .
ISOO is a component of the National Archives and oversees the security classification programs both for the government and the security industry .
Leonard reports to the archivist of the United States and is required at least annually to submit a report to the president about the government ’s classification programs and significant classification and declassification activities .
I know ISOO is a fairly obscure agency , it ’s late on a Friday afternoon , and this may seem like trivia , but it ’s a serious constitutional question , which could have key political consequences .
Cheney is basically taking a “ it depends on what the meaning of ‘ executive branch ’ is ” approach to federal law .
Stay tuned .
Between now and 2015 , Wood Mackenzie expects some Cdn$ 125 billion to be spent in the oil sands sector , representing a 42 % increase on its early 2006 forecast for the same period ( Cdn$ 88 billion ) .
Wood Mackenzie 's analysis finds that the significant increase in costs is largely due to labour shortages and increased material costs , which have created a hyper - inflationary environment within the oil and gas industry in Alberta .
...
Conor Bint , Upstream Research Analyst for Wood Makenzie said ; " Marginal economics have always been a concern for companies operating in the oil sands , breakeven prices are high and rates of return relatively low in comparison with conventional projects , particularly for mining projects . "
Wood Mackenzie estimates that mining projects have an average breakeven price of US $ 28 / bbl and IRR of just 16 % .
Rates of return are more favourable at the less capital intensive in - situ projects , averaging around 22 % . ...
In its latest analysis of Canada 's oil sands assets , Wood Mackenzie finds that capital costs per peak flowing barrel have increased by some 55 % since the beginning of 2005 , putting pressure on returns on investment in an area where project economics are already considered relatively marginal .
The report concludes that costs are set to continue increasing , which leads to the question of how long the current pace of development can be sustained .
Bint said ; " Companies in the oil sands will have to control capital expenditures going forward to ensure that project breakeven prices do not exceed current levels in order to remain profitable . " ...
Wood Mackenzie 's report states that Canada 's proven oil reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia , at around 179 billion barrels .
Of this , around 97 % or 174 billion barrels is attributed to oil sands .
Currently , output from oil sands stands at around 1 million barrels a day , accounting for approximately 35 % of total Canadian production .
However , based on projects that Wood Mackenzie considers commercial , this is forecast to increase to around 4 million barrels per day or 89 % of total Canadian production in 2020 .
The bitumen that is produced from the oil sands has a more complex molecular structure than crude oil .
It contains too much carbon and too little hydrogen , and must go through a costly upgrading process .
The end product is so - called synthetic oil that can be moved through pipelines and refined into gasoline and other products .
In a separate study entitled Unconventionals - The Hidden Opportunity Wood Mackenzie 's examines the location , size and key issues associated with developing Unconventional Hydrocarbons around the world .
The study signals increasing reliance on hard - to - develop sources of energy such as the Canadian oil sands and Venezuela ’s Orinoco tar belt .
Looking to the future , they say that by 2025 unconventional oil is expected to supply more than 20 % of global demand .
The are are environmental concerns , and high water and natural gas use associated with these operations .
The oil companies work under strict environmental guidelines requiring that they run relatively eco-friendly operations and reclaim land as they finish mining .
There is now talk of building nuclear power plants to supply the energy needs of the oil sands .
The U.S. favors an energy policy that obtains more oil from friendly Canada rather than from volatile parts of the world .
According to this report Canada - which in 2005 replaced Saudi Arabia as the single - largest supplier of energy to the U.S. - will continue that position over at least the next two decades , thanks to the multi-billion dollar oil sands developments in Alberta .

THE AMERICAN PRISON CAMP at Guantanamo Bay is on the southeast corner of Cuba , a sliver of land the United States has occupied since 1903 .
Long ago , it was irrigated from lakes on the other side of the island , but Cuban President Fidel Castro cut off the water supply years ago .
So today , Guantanamo produces its own water from a 30 - year - old desalination plant .
The water has a distinct yellow tint .
All Americans drink bottled water imported by the planeload .
Until recently , prisoners drank the yellow water .
The prison overlooks the sea , but the ocean cannot be seen by prisoners .
Guard towers and stadium lights loom along the perimeter .
On my last visit , we were escorted by young , solemn military guards whose nameplates on their shirts were taped over so that prisoners could not identify them .
Very few outsiders are allowed to see the prisoners .
The government has orchestrated some carefully controlled tours for the media and members of Congress , but has repeatedly refused to allow these visitors , representatives of the United Nations , human rights groups or nonmilitary doctors and psychiatrists to meet or speak with prisoners .
So far , the only outsiders who have done so are representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross -- who are prohibited by their own rules from disclosing what they find -- and lawyers for the prisoners .
I am one of those lawyers .
I represent six Kuwaiti prisoners , each of whom has now spent nearly four years at Guantanamo .
It took me 2 1 / 2 years to gain access to my clients , but now I have visited the prison camp 11 times in the last 14 months .
What I have witnessed is a cruel and eerie netherworld of concrete and barbed wire that has become a daily nightmare for the nearly 500 people swept up after 9/11 who have been imprisoned without charges or trial for more than four years .
It is truly our American gulag .
Advertisement
On my most recent trip three weeks ago , after signing a log sheet and submitting our bags to a search , my colleagues and I were taken through two tall , steel - mesh gates into the interior of the prison camp .
We interviewed our clients in Camp Echo , one of several camps where prisoners are interrogated .
We entered a room about 13 feet square and divided in half by a wall of thick steel mesh .
On one side was a table where the prisoner would sit for our interviews , his feet shackled to a steel eyelet cemented to the floor .
On the other side were a shower and a cell just like the ones in which prisoners are ordinarily confined .
In their cells , prisoners sleep on a metal shelf against the wall , which is flanked by a toilet and sink .
They are allowed a thin foam mattress and a gray cotton blanket .
The Pentagon ’s files on the six Kuwaiti prisoners we represent reveal that none was captured on a battlefield or accused of engaging in hostilities against the U.S.
The prisoners claim that they were taken into custody by Pakistani and Afghan warlords and turned over to the U.S. for bounties ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 25,000 -- a claim confirmed by American news reports .
We have obtained copies of bounty leaflets distributed in Afghanistan and Pakistan by U.S. forces promising rewards -- “ enough to feed your family for life ” -- for any “ Arab terrorist ” handed over .
The files include only the flimsiest accusations or hearsay that would never stand up in court .
The file on one prisoner indicated that he had been seen talking to two suspected Al Qaeda members on the same day -- at places thousands of miles apart .
The primary “ evidence ” against another was that he was captured wearing a particular Casio watch , “ which many terrorists wear . ”
Oddly , the same watch was being worn by the U.S. military chaplain , a Muslim , at Guantanamo .

When I first met my clients , they had not seen or spoken with their families for more than three years , and they had been questioned hundreds of times .
Several were suspicious of us ; they told me that they had been interrogated by people who claimed to be their lawyers but who turned out not to be .
So we had DVDs made , on which members of their families told them who we were and that we could be trusted .
Several cried on seeing their families for the first time in years .
One had become a father since he was detained and had never before seen his child .
One noticed his father was not on the DVD , and we had to tell him that his father had died .
Most prisoners are kept apart , although some can communicate through the steel mesh or concrete walls that separate their cells .
They exercise alone , some only at night .
They had not seen sunlight for months -- an especially cruel tactic in a tropical climate .
One prisoner told me , “ I have spent almost every moment of the last three years , and eaten every meal , here in this small cell which is my bathroom . ”
Other than the Koran , prisoners had nothing to read .
As a result of our protests , some have been given books .
Every prisoner I ’ve interviewed claims to have been badly beaten and subjected to treatment that only could be called torture , by Americans , from the first day of U.S. captivity in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
They said they were hung by their wrists and beaten , hung by their ankles and beaten , stripped naked and paraded before female guards , and given electric shocks .
At least three claimed to have been beaten again upon arrival in Guantanamo .
One of my clients , Fayiz Al Kandari , now 27 , said his ribs were broken during an interrogation in Pakistan .
I felt the indentation in his ribs .
“ Beat me all you want , just give me a hearing , ” he said he told his interrogators .
Another prisoner , Fawzi Al Odah , 25 , is a teacher who left Kuwait City in 2001 to work in Afghan , then Pakistani , schools .
After 9/11 , he and four other Kuwaitis were invited to dinner by a Pakistani tribal leader and then sold by him into captivity , according to their accounts , later confirmed by Newsweek and ABC News .

On Aug. 8 , 2005 , Fawzi , in desperation , went on a hunger strike to assert his innocence and to protest being imprisoned for four years without charges .
He said he wanted to defend himself against any accusations , or die .
He told me that he had heard U.S. congressmen had returned from tours of Guantanamo saying that it was a Caribbean resort with great food .
“ If I eat , I condone these lies , ” Fawzi said .
At the end of August , after Fawzi fainted in his cell , guards began to force - feed him through tubes pushed up his nose into his stomach .
At first , the tubes were inserted for each feeding and then removed afterward .
Fawzi told me that this was very painful .
When he tried to pull out the tubes , he was strapped onto a stretcher with his head held by many guards , which was even more painful .
By mid-September , the force - feeding had been made more humane .
Feeding tubes were left in and the formula pumped in .
Still , when I saw Fawzi , a tube was protruding from his nose .
Drops of blood dripped as we talked .
He dabbed at it with a napkin .
We asked for Fawzi ’s medical records so we could monitor his weight and his health .
Denied .
The only way we could learn how Fawzi was doing was to visit him each month , which we did .
When we visited him in November , his weight had dropped from 140 pounds to 98 pounds .
Specialists in enteral feeding advised us that the continued drop in his weight and other signs indicated that the feeding was being conducted incompetently .
We asked that Fawzi be transferred to a hospital .
Again , the government refused .
Advertisement
When we saw Fawzi in December , his weight had stabilized at about 110 pounds .
The formulas had been changed , and he was being force - fed by medical personnel rather than by guards .
When I met with Fawzi three weeks ago , the tubes were out of his nose .
I told him I was thankful that after five months he had ended his hunger strike .
He looked at me sadly and said , “ They tortured us to make us stop . ”
At first , he said , they punished him by taking away his “ comfort items ” one by one : his blanket , his towel , his long pants , his shoes .
They then put him in isolation .
When this failed to persuade him to end the hunger strike , he said , an officer came to him Jan.
9 to announce that any detainee who refused to eat would be forced onto “ the chair . ”
The officer warned that recalcitrant prisoners would be strapped into a steel device that pulled their heads back , and that the tubes would be forced in and wrenched out for each feeding .
“ We ’re going to break this hunger strike , ” the officer told him .
Fawzi said he heard the prisoner next door screaming and warning him to give up the strike .
He decided that he was n’t “ on strike to be tortured . ”
He said those who continued on the hunger strike not only were strapped in “ the chair ” but were left there for hours ; he believes that guards fed them not only nutrients but also diuretics and laxatives to force them to defecate and urinate on themselves in the chair .
After less than two weeks of this treatment , the strike was over .
Of the more than 80 strikers at the end of December , Fawzi said only three or four were holding out .
As a result of the strike , however , prisoners are now getting a meager ration of bottled water .
Advertisement
Fawzi said eating was the only aspect of life at Guantanamo he could control ; forcing him to end the hunger strike stripped him of his last means of protesting his unjust imprisonment .
Now , he said , he feels “ hopeless . ”
The government continues to deny that there is any injustice at Guantanamo .
But I know the truth .
If you take a look at the CIA World Fact book , you ’ll see that Turkey ’s top exports include apparel , foodstuffs , textiles , metal manufactures , and transport equipment .
What the United States government does n’t know , or does n’t want you to know , is that Turkey tops the world in a commodity not listed here : comedies .
In our ongoing quest to discover the greatest comedies of all time , I decided to take a look at what IMDB had to say .
IMDB does have an official list of the top 50 comedies , but I wanted more .
Many lists include 100 movies , so I went to the Advanced Search and searched for all movies in the genre “ comedy ” , with at least 1000 votes , excluding TV movies , TV shows , and direct - to - video releases .
The first thing I noticed is that IMDB ’s search is broken , apparently “ ignore TV series ” really means “ litter the results with lots of TV series . ”
The next thing I noticed is something even the CIA could n’t discover : Turkish dominance of the top 3 comedies of all time .
At number 1 , with a rating of 9.2 , is Babam Ve Oglum ( 2005 ) , also known as My Father and My Son .
At number 2 , with an 8.9 rating , is Tosun Pasa ( 1976 ) , with Hababam sinifi ( 1975 ) just a notch below at 8.8 .
The Turkish dominance is finally interrupted by Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) at the number 4 spot .
I have never seen any of these films , or any Turkish comedies for that matter .
But these are n’t just simple flukes – they each have more than 1000 votes , and it ’s hard to see why they are not included in the official top 50 .
What makes these films so funny ?
Let ’s take a look as a memorable quote from Tosun Pasa :
Saban : [ Scared ]
Who are you ?
Real Tosun Pasha : Ibrahim Pasha from Cairo is in your order , Sir !
Saban : [ Seriously ]
Who made you a pasha , sir ?
Real Tosun Pasha :
It was with your order , Pasha !
Saban :
So I made you a pasha , Mr. Ibrahim ?
Real Tosun Pasha : Yes , Pasha !
Saban : [ Mockingly ]
Hey Ibrahim , are you Seferoglus ’ pasha ?
Real Tosun Pasha : Sorry , you lost me , sir .
Saban : [ Laughs ]
Come on Ibo , you ca n’t fool me !
Ha ha ha heh… heh …
Hmm .
Perhaps there is a cultural divide .
You see , pasha is a title granted within the Ottoman Empire .
It was an honorific originally limited to military commanders but later used for civilians as well .
Pashas rank above beys and Aghas but below khedives and viziers .
There have been a number of important Pashas , for example Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt put down a rebellion of Wahhabis in Arabia and later fought in the Greek War of Independence .
He was the adopted son of Muhamad Ali , though few people know that since it was left out of the film .
Let ’s take a look at the plot summary for Babam Ve Oglum :
Sadik is one of the rebellious youth who has been politically active as a university student and became a left - wing journalist in the 70′s , despite his father ’s expectations of him becoming an agricultural engineer and taking control of their family farm in an Aegean village .
On the dawn of September 12 , 1980 , when a merciless military coup hits the country , they cannot find access to any hospital or a doctor and his wife dies while giving birth to their only child , Deniz .
After a long - lasting period of torture , trials , and jail time , Sadik returns to his village with 7 - 8 years old Deniz , knowing that it will be hard to correct things with his father , Huseyin . ( source )
Now that sounds funny .
I can only imagine the death - during - childbirth scene takes place in fast - motion with a “ Benny Hill ” soundtrack , much like the examples Mr. Wallz has uncovered .
I kid .
Actually , all three of these movies sound pretty interesting , and if I ever finish my thesis , I ’ll try tracking them down .
I do have to suspect , though , that their high ranking is due in part to a small , but sizable Turkish minority on IMDB who very passionately love their domestic film industry .
Has anyone seen any of these three ?
Any Turks or Cypriots out there care to clue me in ?
I ’d like to know : what ’s so funny about Turkey ?

最小完全ハッシュ関数の作り方
■順列型の最小完全ハッシュ関数
０から４までの５個の数字が下のように並んでいる場合を例にして説明します。
５個の数字の並べ方は ５！通り ありますので５！( =120 ) 通りの並べ方の総てに対して 0から119 までの数値を一意に割り付けることが目的となります。
３４１０２
ここでは左側から順に数字を見ていくことにします。最初の数字は３で残りの数字の個数は４個ですね。
この 残れさた数字の個数分の総順列数 は ４ ！ ですが、この数量を 基数 と言います 。
つまり左端の数字が何であるかを完全に識別する為に
最低限必要な基本となる重み のことです。
従って先ず最初の数字３に基数である４！を掛け算してはじき出します。
[ ３ ] ４１０２ → ３＊４ ！
次に左から２番目の数字ですが、ここから先はとても注意が必要です。
２番目の数字は４で残りの数字の個数は３個です。残りの数字の個数が３個なので基数は３！になります。つまり基数が変化します。この基数の変換が
無駄なハッシュ値領域を作らない 最小完全ハッシュ値を得る為の重要なポイントです。
そしてさらに重要なポイントは、先ほどの様にして４＊３！をはじき出すのは間違いだということです。
実際の数字そのものに基数の３！を掛けるのではなくて [ ４１０２ ]
の４個の数字の中で４という数字が 何番目に小さな数字かという順位 に着目しなければならないのです。
０位から数えて数字４の順位は ３ 位 であるという考え方をして３＊３！をはじき出すのが正解なのです。
そうしてやらないと現在以降のはじき出す数値が前回の基数であった
４ ！に収まらなく なるのです。
[ ３４ ] １０２ → ３＊４！ ＋３＊３ ！
以下同様にして 、
[ ３４１ ] ０２ → ３＊４！＋３＊３！＋１＊２ ！
[ ３４１０ ] ２ → ３＊４！＋３＊３！＋１＊２！＋０＊１ ！
[ ３４１０２ ] → ３＊４！＋３＊３！＋１＊２！＋０＊１！+０＊０！
この計算結果は９２でこれが ３４１０２ の最小完全ハッシュ値となります。
では次に、この考え方に基づいた最小完全ハッシュ関数の具体的な作り方に移ります。
階乗計算を毎回実行するのは無駄があるので、先ず
階乗値テーブル を作っておきます。 /* 階乗値テーブル */ int FACTOR [ 5 ] = { 24 , 6 , 2 , 1 , 1 } ; 面倒なの は 「 何番目に小さな数字かという順位 」 を求める部分です。しかし、これにはとてもうまい方法が考案されています。
「 着目している数字よりも大きな数字が、 まだ残っている数字群の中 にあればその値を １つ減ずる 」という処理をして行くと実際の数字がおのずと 順位の値に変化 してくれるというのです。
[ ] ３４１０２
[ ３ ] ３１０２ ←２番目の数字４は３より大きいので１つ減ずる。
[ ３３ ] １０２
[ ３３１ ] ０１ ←５番目の数字２は１より大きいので１つ減ずる。
[ ３３１０ ] ０ ←５番目の数字１は０より大きいので１つ減ずる。
[ ３３１００ ]
あとは単純に３＊４！＋３＊３！＋１＊２！＋０＊１！+０＊０！＝９２の計算をすることになります。
最後の項の値は必ずゼロ になることを考慮してこのようなプログラムが書けます。
/* 順列型の最小完全ハッシュ関数 */ int ChangeNumber ( int table [ ] ) { int i , j , hash = 0 , work [ SIZE - 1 ] ; for ( i=0 ; i < SIZE - 1 ; i++) work [ i ] = table [ i ] ; for ( i=0 ; i < SIZE - 1 ; i++) { hash += work [ i ] * FACTOR [i ] ; for ( j=i+1 ; j < SIZE - 1 ; j++ ) if ( work [ i ] < work[j ] ) work [ j ] --; } return hash ; } ■組合せ型の最小完全ハッシュ関 数
５個の中から２個を選ぶという設定で数字が下のように並んでいる場合を例にして説明します。
５個の中から２個を選ぶ組合せは 5 Ｃ 2 通り ありますので 5 Ｃ 2 ( =10 ) 通りの総ての選び方に対して 0から9 までの数値を一意に割り付けることが目的となります。
１０１００
先ほどと同様にして左側から順に数字を見ていくことにします。
先ず最初の位置の基数を考えます。ここがゼロであったとすれば 残りの組合せは 4 Ｃ 2 となります。
つまり、これだけの数値の幅を確保しておく必要があるということなのでこれが最初の位置の基数値になります。
そしてここが１なのでここで 4 Ｃ 2 をはじき出します。
[ １ ] ０１００ → 4 Ｃ 2
２番目の数字は０なので考える必要はありません。３番目の数字は１なのでここでの基数を考えます。
この位置で確保しておく必要がある数値の幅は
2 Ｃ 1 なのでその基数である 2 Ｃ 1 をはじき出します。
[ １０１ ] ００ → 4 Ｃ 2 ＋ 2 Ｃ 1
残りは総て０なのでここで計算は終りとなります。
この計算結果は８でこれが １０１００ の最小完全ハッシュ値となります。
順列型よりも基数が動的に変化するのでちょっと理解しにくいかも知れませんが手続きは順列型よりずっと簡単です。
プログラムも n Ｃ r の値を格納したテーブル PASCAL [ n ] [r ] を用意しておくとこのようになります。
/* 組合せ型の最小完全ハッシュ関数 */ int ChangeNumber ( int table [ ] ) { int i , n , r , hash = 0 ; n = SIZE - 1 ; r = 2 ; for ( i=0 ; n >= r && r > 0 ; i++,n--) if ( table [i ] ) hash += PASCAL [ n ] [r --] ; retuen hash ; } ここでfor文の終了判定式ですが、n < r は残りが総 て１で、r == 0 は残りが総て０である場合を意味します。
つまり選択の余地が無くなった時点で計算は終了します。判りにくければこのfor文を、 for ( i=0 ; i < SIZE ; i++,n--) としても同じ結果になります。
ところで、 n Ｃ r の値を格納したテーブル名が何 故PASCAL なのかと言うとこのテーブルの中身は パスカルの三角形 ( ２項定理の係数 ) そのものになっているからです。ちなみに、このテーブルは足し算だけで作ることが出来ます。
/* nＣr値テーブル */ int PASCAL [ 5 ] [ 3 ] = { 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 1 , 4 , 6 } ; ホームページへ戻 る １１パズルの最長手数解へ戻る
The right field of vision was quicker at detecting colours than the left
University of California researchers tested the hypothesis that language plays a role in perception by carrying out a series of colour tests .
They found that people were able to identify colours faster in their right visual field than in their left .
The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study said it was because the right field is processed in the brain area responsible for language .
The theory that language impacts on perception forms part of the Whorf hypothesis , which states there is a systematic relationship between the grammatical categories of the language a person speaks and how that person both understands the world and behaves in it .
Previous studies have tended to look for a simple yes or no answer to the question
Aubrey Gilbert , report co-author
For example , speakers of English judge colours that straddle the green / blue boundary as less similar than speakers of Tarahumara , a language spoken in Mexico which does not have separate words for the colours .
The researchers thought that if language was to have this affect it would only do so on the right of their visual field because of the way the brain handles language .
They asked 13 people to identify a colour on a square among a group of other squares all of which were the same colour .
In one test the squares were all shades of blue , with one square being a different shade .
In the second test there was two colours used , blue and green .
The participants were quicker in the second test at identifying the different colour square when it was in their right field of vision - to the right of their head .
There was no difference in speed in the first test , suggesting because the colours had a different name in the second test the mind was able to identify the colour more quickly when it was seen in a certain field of vision .
To reinforce the findings , the team carried out the tests again but asked the participants to silently rehearse an eight - digit number in a bid to interfere with the language function of the brain .
The results showed that the differences between the two field decreased .
The researchers said the findings supported the Whorf hypothesis , but only in the right visual field .
Report co-author Aubrey Gilbert said : " Previous studies addressing the possible influence of language on perception have tended to look for a simple yes or no answer to the question .
" Our findings suggest a more complex picture , based on the functional organisation of the brain . "

I was just reading David Berlind talking about Tim Bray ’s use of Linux over the past couple of weeks ( he ’s going back to the Mac ) .
I know what keeps me on Apple and Microsoft OS ’s , though , and it might not be what you expect .
What keeps me from using Linux ?
Three things : readability .
Fonts .
Aesthetics .
Geeks do n’t think they matter .
But at Gnomedex I could always pick the one or two Linux users out of the crowd instantly .
Why ?
Their fonts looked ugly and were n’t as readable .
Maryam ’s new Mac ’s fonts are blurry compared to Windows too , but they still are a HUGE advance over anything I ’ve seen on Linux .
Why is this ?
Because font designers like Matthew Carter do n’t work for free .
One typeface might cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop .
Even millions .
Hinting fonts takes a LOT of technology ( Microsoft has at least two teams that I know of working on font and reading technologies ) .
It gets even worse if you ’re Chinese or Russian or Japanese ( I hear there ’s a few people living in those countries ) .
Why ?
Their font families take longer to develop and are harder to do .
When I visited Bill Hill ( his team developed ClearType and commissioned most of the fonts you see in Microsoft ’s default pack on Windows ) he was raving about his team ’s work .
Why is this important ?
Name the # 1 thing you look at most on your computer screen .
For me it ’s the characters on the screen .
If one OS has better looking characters than another ( Windows Vista has a whole set of new fonts coming ) then that OS will win with most users who are n’t geeks .
This is the # 1 reason why Linux has n’t seen any significant adoption on the desktop / laptop yet .
Fix that problem and you ’ll see a serious third competitor for everyday consumers .
But the problem is that Matthew Carter ( and other typographers like him ) do n’t do their work for free .
That means Apple and Microsoft will win this game .
The best fonts win .
Oh , and Microsoft , you better hold onto Bill Hill .
If he goes to Google then I ’ll know Google is building an OS .
Bill told me that the guy who decided to invest in fonts on Windows was another Bill .
You might have heard of him .
I think that decision will turn out to be the smartest “ keep Windows important ” move Gates ever made .
You probably saw the article on Open Source in the Economist , " Open , but not as usual " .
If you did , you read it and probably sighed .
The premise of the article is that the very openness of the Open Source method is its worst vulnerability , particularly as attempts are made to extend the method beyond software , and as the title implies , that Open Source is changing to become more like proprietary .
It is also another attack on Wikipedia .
My , there 's been a lot of anti-Open Source mileage out of that .
I have news for you .
Wikipedia is not an Open Source project .
It 's a cousin , maybe .
But it 's an entirely different kettle of fish , as I 'll explain .
This is the part in the article that got me sighing :
The open - source method has vulnerabilities that must be overcome if it is to live up to its promise .
For example , it lacks ways of ensuring quality and it is still working out better ways to handle intellectual property .
But the biggest worry is that the great benefit of the open - source approach is also its great undoing .
Its advantage is that anyone can contribute ; the drawback is that sometimes just about anyone does .
This leaves projects open to abuse , either by well - meaning dilettantes or intentional disrupters .
Constant self - policing is required to ensure its quality .
First of all , Open Source , for example the Linux kernel , has never been anything but controlled by Linus .
At the bottom , anyone can contribute , true .
But there is a definite sieve - like process as the code moves up through various lieutenants until it finally gets to Andrew Morton and Linus .
Anyone can comment on the code , offer fixes , or something better .
But the thing is , Linus has always been there at the top , with total veto power .
It has never been a free - for - all .
You know that .
I know that .
So why does n't the Economist ?
Instead , the article goes on to assert that the Wikipedia method leads to chaos and so Open Source needs to tighten up , and more , that it now realizes it and is .
What poppycock .
And of course , there is the obligatory reference to SCO , and the usual misinformation :
The question of accountability is a vital one , not just for quality but also for intellectual - property concerns .
Patents are deadly to open source since they block new techniques from spreading freely .
But more troubling is copyright : if the code comes from many authors , who really owns it ?
This issue took centre stage in 2003 , when a company called SCO sued users of Linux , including IBM and DaimlerChrysler , saying that portions of the code infringed its copyrights .
The lines of programming code upon which SCO based its claims had changed owners through acquisitions over time ; at some point they were added into Linux .
Heh heh .
Not exactly .
IBM was n't sued for using Linux .
It was sued for contributing code to Linux .
SCO mainly is suing IBM by means of a theory of contract , as best as anyone can make out , a ladder theory by which somehow the contract can be interpreted in a novel way so that any code IBM writes , if it ever touches UNIX SystemV , or if it is kind of similar to methods and concepts in Unix , can then be controlled by SCO , even if there is no SystemV code or derivative code in it .
Nice work if you can get it .
Here 's SCO 's Second Amended Complaint if you want to try to figure it out yourself .
And by the way , when code is written by many authors , they all own the part they individually wrote .
Is that hard to grasp ?
No need to travel to Delphi to get that puzzle solved .
Each author holds the copyright to his own piece of code .
That 's the Linux kernel setup .
Think of it like a collection of short stories .
Each author holds copyright in his story , and the editor might hold a copyright in the collected work .
In other projects , say under the GNU umbrella , the Free Software Foundation might hold the copyright .
In other projects , a foundation set up around a specific project might .
SCO certainly tried to assert copyright claims , although at one point it swore up and down it had n't , but the judge in the case was not impressed with their evidence .
Their copyright claims had to do with continuing to distribute AIX after SCO allegedly terminated their license .
Look at the Complaint , and you 'll see that in the Fifth Cause of Action .
I know .
That does n't match what SCO said in the funny papers .
But read the court filings for yourself , and you 'll see .
Copyright is more of a problem only because they do n't have any Unix patents to sue over .
Copyright is a problem * for* SCO , however , because Novell has asserted in a blazing Answer with Counterclaims that Novell owns the copyrights , not SCO .
Should that get established , SCO is ... well , pretty much a dead duck .
And DaimlerChrysler was n't sued for copyright infringement .
There was only one cause of action , breach of contract .
AutoZone was , but when push came to shove , it turned out it was really about them switching from Unix to Linux , and SCO asserting they used SCO 's shared libraries to make the switch , something AutoZone denied .
The judge in that case said that SCO 's claims against AutoZone would be completely undermined if Novell wins .
If you wish to check my accuracy , and by all means do , here 's SCO 's complaint against DaimlerChrysler , which the Economist forgot to mention SCO lost in all significant parts in 2004 .
It was an embarrassing rout .
The last little bit might get resurrected someday , but if it is , here 's what the Order dismissing the complaint without prejudice on stipulation says will happen : IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that , in the event Plaintiff The SCO Group , Inc. refiles its claim for breach of contract for Defendant DaimlerChrysler Corporation 's alleged failure to respond to the request for certification in a timely manner , Plaintiff shall pay Defendant 's costs and reasonable attorneys ' fees incurred in the instant action in defending against that claim only , from and after the entry of this Court 's August 9 , 2004 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant DaimlerChrysler Corporation 's Motion for Summary Disposition , as a condition precedent to pursuing any such refiled action .
SCO tried to appeal the August order , but it was dismissed .
Nobody is quaking in their boots over DaimlerChrysler .
It stands for the proposition that you can sue anybody over any foolishness you please , as long as you do n't mind having good men everywhere burst out laughing at you .
Daimler Chrysler had n't used Unix for almost a decade , something SCO apparently did n't bother to check before litigating .
And here 's the complaint against AutoZone , which is moribund , to be resurrected only after IBM is decided and only worth resurrecting if Novell loses too , neither of which anyone I know and respect is expecting .
You can read this transcript of a court hearing in the case to learn about the real issue , the libraries .
If you wish to read all the documents in the case , just go to our Legal Docs page and help yourself .
Here 's the DaimlerChrysler collection .
And here 's Autozone .
And here 's IBM .
And here 's Novell .
I 'm pointing out all the mistakes in the Economist article , not to be mean , but just to say that if Wikipedia had made as many errors , there would be anguished cries of inaccuracy and calls for reform of the Wikipedia process .
When the mainstream media makes huges errors of fact , nobody even remarks on it .
Except for Groklaw .
It 's our calling , you might say .
I 've been writing Groklaw now daily since May of 2003 , carefully and laboriously chronicling and correcting all the mainstream media 's mistakes in their reporting on the SCO litigation , and I have n't run out of material yet , have I ?
What does that tell you about accuracy in journalism done the old - fashioned way ?
Actually , I can tell you a little story about the Economist article , because the reporter on this story contacted me in January and interviewed me in preparing this article .
So you can't say he made mistakes because he did n't know about Groklaw or had no idea where to turn for raw material on SCO .
You can't even say that no one told him before his article was published that he was making mistakes in his overall concept .
Here 's the rest of the story .
In January , I got an email from the Economist , asking to interview me : I 'd be keen to chat with you briefly about the issue of how benefits of open - source entail inherent vulnerabilities that need to be addressed ( eg , Wikipedia and accountability / accuracy ) .
I read your piece in the O'Reilly book " Open Sources 2.0 " and thought it might be good to chat briefly .
I noticed that he was laboring under some wrong ideas , and looking at the finished article , I notice that he never wavered from his theory , so I do n't know why I even bothered to do the interview .
But I requested that he send me questions by email , which I 'd gladly answer .
Here are two of his questions pertinent to this article and the answers I sent back : * When you realized you needed to establish some controls to remedy the threat of well - meaning poor - performers or intentional disrupters , where did you go to find models for what to do ?
If it was the open source software community 's practices , please explain the parallels regarding how they police their contributors with respect to how you do ....
PJ : I analyzed it somewhat like this : what will work without violating principles we share ?
Many readers suggested an official comment policy , so we wrote one together .
That made it easier to implement , because we all agreed , as we learned from experience .
I rarely have to do anything , because others immediately spot disruption attempts .
But I also was influenced by a paper I 'd read , whose name I forget , that compared the effectiveness of the Linux development process as a pyramid , with Linus at the top .
He 's at the top because it's his project and because others respect his skill and ability .
The paper pointed out that at the bottom of the pyramid , there are no barriers to entry , however .
Anyone can contribute code and ideas .
But then there is a filtration process , whereby everyone evaluates the code / idea in public , and then lieutenants implement or not , so that Linus sees the discussion , but the code sent to him is n't sent by just anyone in the world .
There is a merit test first .
I decided I 'd do it that way too .
It helps me , because time is always at short supply , and it helps me because over time , you learn who is trustworthy and effective and willing and you can rely on their judgment .
But one person has to be willing to be the bad guy and say NO when it 's necessary , and the vision is that person 's responsibility to move forward by making tactical decisions .
And in a project that involves a specialty , you can't have a democratic process where it 's one man , one vote .
The Linux development process does n't work that way , because some people are better at coding than others , and some are more interested in the project sticking to what it set out to do .
Others come along with ideas to extend the project to suit their ideas , or what their business wants , and sometimes they 're fine ideas , but they do n't work to push the project where it 's trying to go .
It requires folks in decision - making roles who get that and are willing to lop off ideas that lead to dead ends .
Also , in a legal project , you are more constrained , by the law , for one thing , and because not everyone understands the law equally .
*
If you were to make any recommendation to Wikipedia with respect to overcoming the controversy it faced in terms of inaccurate information , what would it be ?
I view the Wikipedia story somewhat differently .
In my view , the false report , which was intended as a joke in the first place , not a malicious act , was fixed , the victim received an apology , the joker lost his job , and the whole world learned that it was not true information .
Could a defamation lawsuit get you more than that ?
Well , money maybe , but if your concern is your reputation , the Wikipedia event was a template in fixing things right .
In contrast , I was , in my opinion , defamed by several articles in the professional media .
I believe it's all part of SCO 's strategy ( and friends ' ) to destroy Groklaw 's and my reputation , so folks wo n't believe what we publish .
In one case , a journalists ' professional group sent a letter to Forbes pointing out factual flaws in their article .
The letter was not responded to in any way that I ever heard about , no correction was ever published , no apology was forthcoming , and no one was disciplined .
So I ask , which is worse ?
The way Wikipedia handled an injustice ?
Or the way the mainstream press does ?
One 's only relief with the latter is to bring a lawsuit against the mainstream press , if they do n't fix it themselves , yet the bottom line with Wikipedia is : if you see a mistake about yourself , you really can just fix it yourself .
Obviously , I made no dent in his theory of the article , that Wikipedia is flawed because anyone can work on it and that Wikipedia is an example of problems in Open Source .
My view is that Wikipedia is n't an example of Open Source precisely because there is no Linus at the top .
Here 's a very clear and accurate description of how the Linux kernel is developed , from a 2004 article in InfoWorld by Paul Venezia : Decisions on what features and patches are incorporated into the official kernel are generally preceded by much debate among kernel developers , but are ultimately made by the kernel maintainer , a central authority who shoulders the brunt of day - to - day maintenance , as well as the responsibility for official kernel releases .
Given the size and scope of the kernel , neither the maintainers nor Linus Torvalds himself can fully know and understand every portion of the kernel .
To alleviate this , several unofficial kernel subsystem maintainers are entrusted to keep a watchful eye on their chosen sections of the code and to contribute validated patch sets to the maintainer for inclusion in the next release .
New releases of the stable kernel are vetted through a release candidate process , during which kernel patches are tested by the community .
In addition to release candidate kernels , patches for stable and unstable kernels are distributed by a select few core developers , such as Alan Cox and Andrew Morton .
These patches usually contain experimental code that hasnt been officially introduced into the source by Torvalds , as well as bug fixes or hardware support likely to be incorporated into the next release .
While the kernel maintainers are responsible for the kernel under their care , Linus Torvalds still runs the show .
So , as you can see , the title of the Economist article should have been " Open , as Always . "
Nothing about the role Linus plays in running the show has changed .
And Wikipedia is n't run like that at all .
For what Wikipedia is , though , it certainly works at least as accurately as the mainstream press , as the Economist article , I think , amply evidences .
So what do we do with the mainstream press ?
Just keep trying to educate them , I guess .
And when we read what they write , I think it 's wise to reserve judgment on any conclusions we see .
It might be true .
Then again , it might be completely wrong information , as the SCO info in the Economist was and is .
Funny thing .
He could have just asked me , and I could have shown him the legal documents .
So I think there is no excuse .
This is n't an attack on anyone , by the way .
I am sure he is as nice a guy as you can find .
The problem is the process .
There is a shocking lack of accuracy in the media .
I 'm not at all kidding .
Wikipedia has its issues too , I 've no doubt .
But that is the point .
It has no greater issues than mainstream articles , in my experience .
And you do n't have to write articles like this one either , to try to straighten out the facts .
Just go to Wikipedia and input accurate information , with proof of its accuracy .
If you would like to learn about Open Source , here 's Wikipedia 's article .
Read it and then compare it to the Economist article .
I think then you 'll have to agree that Wikipedia 's is far more accurate .
And it is n't pushing someone 's quirky point of view , held despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary .
If I wrote an article pointing out this many mistakes in a Wikipedia article , it would set off an orgy of antiWikipedia articles , I 'm sure , all of which would use the errors as " proof " that the system does n't work .
Well , folks , what is good for the goose is good for the gander .
Neither system is without flaws , peculiar to its own methodology .
Errors crop into anything humans write , no matter how many or how few are involved , because we are humans .
Experts make mistakes too .
And sometimes folks put a little spin on the ball , consciously or unconsciously .
That 's why Groklaw always provides urls to proofs , so you can check for yourself and make sure of the facts with your own eyes .
If I make a mistake , I want you to find it , and the more of you there are looking , the more likely it is you will find the correct information so errors can be corrected .
If truth is the goal , that 's the only way to think .
" She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny , " said King .
" She had been tracked down by the zeitgeist - the spirit of the times . "
The reality was somewhat different .
Parks was no victim .
The zeitgeist did not track her down ; she embodied it .
She had a long history of anti-racist activism and had often been thrown off buses for resisting segregation .
Far from being a meek lady in need of a foot massage she was a keen supporter of Malcolm X , who never fully embraced King 's strategy of non-violence .
" To call Rosa Parks a poor , tired seamstress and not talk about her role as a community leader and civil rights activist as well , is to turn an organised struggle for freedom into a personal act of frustration , " writes Herbert Kohl in his book She Would Not Be Moved .
The story of collective struggles is all too often filtered through the experience of an individual .
In a bid to render the account more palatable and popular , the personal takes precedence over the political .
As a result the story may reach a wider audience ; but by the time they receive it , the agendas and the issues involved have often become distorted - to the detriment of both the individual and the movement .
The story of Cindy Sheehan , the 48 - year - old woman whose son Casey was killed in Iraq in April 2004 , is one such example .
Until late last week , Sheehan was camping outside President George Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , demanding to see the president .
" I want to ask him , why did my son die ? " she told the Guardian .
" What was this noble cause you talk about ?
And if the cause is so noble , when are you going to send your daughters over there and let somebody else 's son come home ? "
Sheehan , who has met the president once before and was not impressed , had planned to stay at what became known as Camp Casey for the whole of August but had to leave on Thursday because her mother became sick .
With the help of PR consultants she was packaged as a grieving Everymother who wanted answers .
Capturing the public imagination , over the past two weeks she has been a regular feature on US cable and network news , the letters pages and newspaper editorials .
In turn , she has re-energised the anti-war movement .
On Wednesday , thousands of people across the country attended 1,627 vigils in solidarity with her cause .
Her popularity has made her a prime target for the right .
One commentator on Rupert Murdoch 's
Fox channel branded her a " crackpot " ; Christopher Hitchens derided her for " spouting piffle " and lambasted her protest as " dreary , sentimental nonsense " .
Talk - radio king Rush Limbaugh said her story " is nothing more than forged documents - there 's nothing about it that 's real " .
The backlash continued this weekend with the launch of a " You Don't Speak for Me Cindy " tour heading for Crawford with the support of rightwing talk radio hosts , to set up a pro-war camp .
The focus on Sheehan 's personal loss is indeed problematic .
Bereavement , in and of itself , confers neither knowledge nor insight - only a particular sensibility that might lead to both and a compelling personal narrative through which to articulate them .
To define her as a mournful mother , while ignoring that she is a politically conscious , media - savvy campaigner , which she has been for quite some time , does neither her nor her cause any favours .
Indeed , those who focus on Sheehan 's woes , whether they support or attack her , miss the point entirely .
Had she come to Crawford at Easter , she would most likely have gone unnoticed .
The reason she has struck a chord is not because of the sorrow that is personal to her but because of the frustration she shares with the rest of the country over Iraq .
That is also why the right have attacked her so ferociously and so personally .
But unlike the Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in his swift boat , Sheehan will not be blown off course quite so easily .
The public mood in America is shifting consistently and decisively against the war and Bush 's handling of it .
Gallup has commissioned eight polls asking whether it was worth going to war since the beginning of the year : every time at least half have said no .
For the first time , most people believe the invasion of Iraq has made the US more vulnerable to further attacks .
The number of those who want all the troops withdrawn remains a minority at 33 % - but that is double what it was two years ago , and still growing .
The reason Sheehan has become such a lightning rod is because that mood has found only inadequate and inconsistent expression in Congress .
It has been left to her to articulate an escalating political demand that is in desperate need of political representation .
This marks not only a profound dislocation between the political class and political culture but a short circuit in the democratic process .
The mainstream has effectively been marginalised .
This is not particular to the US .
In Britain , the view that there was a link between Iraq and the London bombings was shared by two - thirds of the population , but the handful of politicians who dared to mention it were shouted down in parliament and vilified in the press .
In Germany , all the main parties support the labour market reforms that will cut welfare entitlements and reduce social protection , even though most of the population do not .
But what many " centre - left " politicians regard as electoral expediency is actually becoming an electoral liability .
Evidence exists that support for more radical stances is there if only they had the backbone to campaign for it .
In Germany , a new leftwing party combining ex-communists and disaffected Social Democrats is attracting 12 % in polls and could yet rob the right of an outright victory next month .
This month , in a congressional byelection in southern Ohio , Paul Hackett , a marine reservist who recently served in Iraq , stood for the Democrats on an anti-war platform .
In a constituency where the Republicans won with 72 % of the vote nine months ago , Hackett branded Bush a " chicken hawk " .
He won 48 % , turning a safe seat into a marginal .
Sadly , such examples are all too rare .
Sheehan has revealed both the strength and the weakness of the left .
We have a political agenda that can command considerable mainstream support ; yet we do not have a political leadership willing or able to articulate those agendas .
We wield political influence ; we lack legislative power .

The portable monitors are quite popular right now .
This is because they help a lot with various applications while on the move .
It is always important for you to have one as you never know when you might have to use .
The best portable monitor has to be lightweight and portable at the same time . [… ]
As a consumer you are probably aware that you can insure virtually everything you buy .
Any electronic device big or small , cell phones , kitchen appliances or even your pet can be insured .
While we do spend considerable amounts of money on these items they are essentially worthless when compared to life itself .
So , with life insurance resources abound , why are so many people spending hundreds of dollars every year insuring material items yet leaving themselves completely uninsured ( or at least under insured ) when it comes to their life ?
Insuring the Unimportant
Part of this behavior comes down to how we think about life itself .
By nature we live in the here and now .
Thinking about the future is difficult and it is clearly easier to contemplate short - term issues .
So when you go to the store and finally upgrade to that new big - screen TV you ’ve been saving up for we naturally want to protect what we worked hard to obtain .
When the salesman explains the 3 - year extended warranty for $ 60 you do n’t think twice .
I mean , who wants to deal with the manufacturer ’s warranty or possibly end up with a loss when it breaks the day after the warranty is up ?
These near - term fears will trigger the purchase of this sense of security .
The same goes for even smaller items such as cell phone insurance .
Even with a low premium of 4 or 5 dollars a month this can become costly .
If you have a spouse or kids with phones it can certainly amount to over $ 100 annually to protect insignificant depreciating assets .
The reasons to insure your phone are simple .
These small devices are prone to being dropped , left in a pocket while doing the laundry and being lost or stolen among other things .
Given our attachment to these devices we certainly do n’t want to be inconvenienced by being without our phone so this insurance appears to have a value .
Your Most Important Asset
Ask anyone what their most important asset is and probably 9 times out of 10 the answer will be their home .
People think of assets as tangible things , things that cost a significant amount of money and are required to live comfortably .
Understandably we have insurance on these things , and it is even required by law in some instances .
That being said , the home is a very important asset but it is not the most important in most cases .
When you ca n’t easily put a price tag on something it is difficult to view its true value .
Unless you live off of a trust fund or stay at home because your spouse earns all of the income , your life , more specifically your ability to earn an income is your most important asset .
It is your income that pays the mortgage , buys food for the table , provides for your children and essentially allows you to exist .
What happens when this asset suddenly disappears ?
Well if you are single , live alone and have no kids you are in a position there will be little financial impact .
But if you are married , own a home , have debt or kids the situation is far less appealing .
Imagine for a moment that you and your spouse each earn $ 40,000 per year , you have a $ 150,000 mortgage , typical car payments and a few thousand in consumer debt .
Now imagine that something tragic happens and you die in an accident .
As if losing a loved one was n’t bad enough , can your spouse now keep up with the bills ?
With half of the income gone can the loved one left continue to pay the mortgage , vehicles and keep food on the table without sacrificing something ?
If you left nothing behind you put your spouse in a very difficult position .
It could result in selling the home , vehicles or even sacrificing quality of life due to your death .
Your Options
Many people will easily spend a few hundred dollars every year buying insurance or extended warranties on the things we buy .
As important as it seems at the time , ultimately they are worthless in the grand scheme of things .
That is n’t to say you should n’t protect the things you buy , but more important is to understand that insuring these things should not compromise your ability to insure your most important asset .
The cheapest and first place you should look is with your employer .
If you have benefits through your employer then you likely receive some basic life and disability insurance automatically .
It may not be much , maybe only the equivalent of one year of salary but it is a start .
Employers also generally make it possible to purchase additional insurance on this group term policy at a very affordable price .
Often you can increase your coverage to 4 times salary for less than $ 10 per pay period ( if paid bi-weekly ) .
If your employer does n’t offer any of these benefits you can still obtain basic term insurance that is very affordable .
I wo n’t use this time to discuss the various calculations you can do to determine how much insurance you need or expand on the different types of policies , this topic is meant to get you in the right frame of mind when it comes to what is important in your life and what you may be overlooking .
Nobody likes to think about the unpleasant consequences of death , nor does anyone enjoy spending money on something that has the potential to never be used .
But the consequences of being under insured could effectively ruin the lives of your spouse , children or family .
So before you worry about protecting that $ 500 iPhone or new video game console take a moment to think about the things that really matter and make sure you are n’t brushing aside what ’s truly important .

Israeli troops went in before dawn on Sunday
Army vehicles which entered Nablus early on Sunday surrounded several buildings including two main hospitals .
The Israelis say they aim to counter " terrorist threats " in Nablus .
The Palestinian Authority has condemned the incursion , which is one of the biggest Israeli operations the West Bank has seen in recent months .
Nablus governor Kamal al - Sheikh demanded the Israelis lift the hospital blockade , to allow medical staff to carry out their work .
Main routes into the city have been closed , witnesses say .
Schools and a university in Nablus have been closed in response to the raid .
There are reports of bulldozers piling up rubble on main roads , making them impassable .
Explosives laboratory
About 100 vehicles including bulldozers went into Nablus early on Sunday .
An Israeli army spokesman said troops used rubber bullets and tear gas against Palestinians throwing rocks and cement blocks .
The army said two of its soldiers were slightly wounded by an explosive charge .
At least eight Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets , hospital sources said .
Soldiers announced over loudspeakers that a curfew would be enforced in the centre of Nablus , which is home to about 30,000 people .
The raid came a day after troops discovered an explosives laboratory in the town , a spokeswoman said .
The Israelis are searching for eight Palestinians said to be from the al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigade , which is linked to Fatah , the political party of the President Mahmoud Abbas .
" Israeli forces in Nablus are acting against a broad terrorist infrastructure in order to prevent terrorist activity originating from the city , " the army said in a statement quoted by Reuters news agency .
It did not say how long the army operation would last .
Question
Is it weird to use a Lolita look everyday ?
I 'm afraid my friends will overreact if I do .
Community Answer
It 's not the norm , no , but that does n't make it weird .
Because Lolita kei is so different from what most of the people in the world are wearing , people might find you novel and might even stare , but as long as your clothing suits the place where you 're going ( e.g. , do n't wear Lolita to the beach or rock climbing lessons ) , the temperature , and the dress code , you should be able to wear what you want .
Let your friends know how much you like the style and why you 're feeling nervous , and start out wearing your cords only with people and at places you 'll feel comfortable doing so .
The University of California at Berkeley is being sued for running a website for school teachers called Understanding Evolution .
Anti-evolutionists claim that the site breaches the American constitution on the separation of church and state because it links to religious organisations which believe faith can be reconciled with Darwin 's theory of evolution , reported the website Inside Higher Ed today .
The University of California is already under legal attack for its refusal to certify high school courses on creationism and " intelligent design " as meeting its entry requirements for admission .
Meanwhile , supporters of evolution are using the same first amendment : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion " to combat the spread of creationism and intelligent design in schools .
In a landmark trial over the teaching of evolution , creationism and " intelligent design " in American schools , lawyers for the Dover area school board in Pennsylvania this week began presenting their case for making intelligent design part of the curriculum .
Michael Behe , a professor at Lehigh University , Pennsylvania , yesterday told the federal court in Harrisburg that intelligent design - which holds that life is so complex it must have had a creator - was based on science and was not a religious doctrine .
Eleven parents of students at a Pennsylvania high school are suing the Dover school board on the grounds that its new policy of introducing intelligent design in the classroom violates the US constitutional separation of church and state .
The federal trial over teaching theories of human origins , which has echoes of the famed Scopes Monkey trial of 1925 , when lawyers squared off in a Tennessee courthouse over the teaching of Darwin 's theory of evolution , entered its fourth week .
The case marks the first time that teaching intelligent design has been challenged in court and is being closely watched in at least 30 states where similar initiatives to dilute the teaching of evolution are being considered .
Berkeley has responded to requests from schools for materials to explain evolution .
The lawsuit has been brought by Jeanne Caldwell , a California parent whose husband , Larry , is a lawyer , an anti-evolution activist , and the founder of a group called Quality Science Education for All .
Mr Caldwell told Inside Higher
Ed that by linking to religious groups ' statements in favour of religion , Berkeley was " taking a position on evolution and attempting to persuade minor students to accept that position . "
He said it was the " height of hypocrisy for this to be coming from people who claim that they are trying to keep religious instruction out of science class . "
He said links should have been included to religious groups offering non-evolution views .
Roy L. Caldwell , ( no relation ) a professor of integrative biology and director of the Museum of Paleontology at Berkeley , said the website was designed to help teachers - especially those who may feel pressure because of the current attacks on evolution - to explain the science behind evolution .
The information about religious groups was strictly factual , he said .
Michael R. Smith , the assistant chancellor for legal affairs at Berkeley , said that the university would defend the lawsuit " with vigor and enthusiasm " and pointed out that the first amendment also enshrines the right to free speech .

BBC News , Chicago
In a classroom on Chicago 's north side , nutritionist Bindi Desai points at a sign of an obese man holding a hamburger with a pained expression on his face .
How much is in a serving ?
" And guess what happens ? " she asks .
" Inside his body there are lots of problems . "
At a table , a dozen or so refugees - most of them from Africa - sit and nod .
Some smile and chat among themselves .
They appear to get the picture .
This workshop on how to eat American food responsibly is part of an Illinois state - funded programme to improve the nutrition of refugees who are being re-settled in the land of plenty .
" First we are most concerned about whether they will understand how to eat American food , " says Shana Willis , with the non-profit refugee resettlement agency Heartland , one of the project co-ordinators .
" They did not only not understand how to eat American food , but they went immediately to the junk food and it was then that we realised , this is going to have a much more important impact than we anticipated . "
Culture shock
One of the major challenges for organisers is to change the way the refugees think about food .
Many of the new arrivals suffered from malnutrition and came from places where food was scarce .
I have been here just a few months and its very disorientating ...
Where will I find dates to break my Ramadan fasting ?
And , where do I get halal goat meat ?
Refugee at the workshop
And there is plain culture shock .
" I have been here just a few months and its very disorientating , " says one man through a translator .
" Where will I find dates to break my Ramadan fasting ?
And , where do I get halal goat meat ? "
In mid-western Chicago , the answer is not obvious .
During the workshop Ms Desai holds up a plastic prop of a piece of broccoli .
" How many vegetables do you eat in the day ? " she asks the class .
One man says something quietly .
" He eats nothing ! " exclaims one woman , giggling - " He eats no vegetables ! "
" Oh - oh , " says Ms Desai .
Shopping tips
She asks the class how much pasta is in a serving .
One man puts out his whole arm and points to his wrist .
When they first come , there is a lot of hoarding - more than they need ...
So I tell them it wo n't run out - in fact it will spoil
Bindi Desai
" If you only eat one time , maybe the arm is okay . "
Aside from presenting the workshops , Ms Desai pays home visits to help steer the refugees towards smart shopping .
" When they first come , there is a lot of hoarding , " she says .
" More than they need . "
" So I tell them it wo n't run out - in fact it will spoil , " she explains .
Ms Desai weeds through their cupboards , encouraging the beans , pasta and vegetables and discouraging the junk food .
But teaching shopping tips sometimes is not enough .
Many of the refugees are living in Chicago 's poorer neighbourhoods and they can have difficulty finding healthy food .
So Ms Desai also organises grocery store tours .
She says she sees evidence in the cupboards that her lessons are making a difference .
Learning
Organisers say the project has been so successful with African populations arriving in the United States , that it will be expanded to incorporate other refugee groups , with renewed funding from the state .
Back at the workshop , Ms Desai is wrapping up .
" Did you learn anything ? " she asks .
One man raises his hand .
" Eat too much food and you get fat , " he says .
" That 's right , " says Ms Desai .
Another man joins in and says : " Salt not good .
Sugar not good .
Oil not good .
Fat not good .
Blood pressure , heart problems .
Yup , Yup . "
Ms Desai laughs and says : " Very good .
You 're learning our slang . "
In these days of multispeed , titanium - framed , shock - absorbed mountain bikes , it was no ordinary bicycle .
It had a modest three speeds and a hub brake .
It weighed 56 pounds because its frame had been reinforced against fractures , and its spokes had been thickened to cope with the rugged terrain , according to a Web posting by Mr. Stücke ( http://bikechina.com/ct-heinzstucke1z.html).

It had an extra set of handlebars so Mr. Stücke could modify his riding position to ease shoulder pain .
It had crossed the Syrian desert to set a personal record of about 200 miles in 12 hours " with the help of strong tailwinds . "
It had been to high altitudes in India and Tibet , across Afghanistan ( in 1978 ) and above the snow line in the mountainous African kingdom of Lesotho , not to mention below street level in the rutted tracks of less elevated Africa .
Friends and supporters had donated cash to keep him going .
Even Haile Selassie , the emperor of Ethiopia who died in 1975 — " whom I had the honor to meet " — was listed as a donor of $ 500 .
" All that matters to me is traveling on my bike , " Mr. Stücke , 66 , told the BBC .
" That bike has sentimental value .
In the past I have cycled up to 100 kilometers a day on it . "
That 's about 62 miles .
The police were concerned at the bike 's disappearance .
Constable Paul Jones even went through the police lost - property store and found a bike to lend him .
But Mr. Stücke never abandoned hope that his trusty two - wheeler would be returned .
" I expected it to be found , because it's not a flashy one , it 's not an expensive one , " he said .
And it was .
An unidentified person found it abandoned in a park .
And it was handed back to him , to his relief .
" Hallelujah , praise the Lord — I have got my beautiful bike back , " Mr. Stücke told reporters .
" Is there any other bike like this in the world ?
It 's the one thing I have to have for my life and my livelihood .
Now I can rejoice and my journey can continue . "

Sidney Blumenthal provides a poignant analysis in The Guardian :
People are mixing supplements , herbs and over - the - counter medications and prescription drugs to cure themselves of ills , unaware that they could be making themselves sicker , says George Grossberg , M.D. , director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at Saint Louis University .
Dr. Grossberg is about to change all that .
He is the co-author of a new book , " The Essential Herb - Drug - Vitamin Interaction Guide , " which is a comprehensive listing of what various herbs and supplements do , possible side effects and how they might interact with other medications and foods .
" People think if it does n't require a prescription , it 's got to be safe , and that 's not true .
There could be life - threatening effects . "
Dr. Grossberg first became interested in the topic after a routine six - month visit with a patient he had successfully treated for depression .
He had been seeing the patient for four or five years , and asked if the man was dealing with any new health problems .
The patient mentioned that he was scheduled to go in for cystoscopy in a couple weeks because there had been blood in his urine .
The procedure involves inserting the pencil - thin tip of a probe through the urethra , up to the bladder to detect the cause of the problem .
The patient had undergone thousands of dollars of MRIs and CAT scans of his lower abdomen and pelvis , which had not revealed the reason for the bleeding , and the test was the next diagnostic step .
Dr. Grossberg asked if the patient had changed anything – perhaps had started taking a new medication .
No new medicine .
Then the patient 's wife pulled from her purse a vial containing a supplement she had purchased from the health food store to enhance memory .
Both husband and wife had started taking the herbal memory enhancer , which largely contained ginkgo biloba
" One of the side effects of ginkgo biloba is an increased risk of bleeding .
He had no awareness of this .
I told him to stop taking the herb and get rechecked before having cystoscopy .
The bleeding stopped , and he did n't need the test . "
Dr. Grossberg ticks off other common herbs that people take without realizing their side effects or how they might interact with medications .
St. John 's wort sometimes is taken for anxiety and depression .
Those who also are taking antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications , such as Prozac , Zoloft or Paxil , should beware .
Mixing St. John 's wort with these medicines can cause serotonin syndrome -- with symptoms that may include agitation , rapid heart beat , flushing and heavy sweating -- that may be fatal .
Dong quai , which some women take for menstrual disorders and to ease symptoms of menopause , has been linked to cardiovascular problems , such as irregular heart rhythm and low blood pressure .
If a patient takes the herb along with an antihypertensive drug , her blood pressure could plummet , putting her at risk of stroke .
Some people take echinacea , which enhances the immune system , for the common cold .
However , those who also take Lipitor , Celebrex and Aleve face an increased risk of liver damage .
Echinacea also can be harmful for those who have multiple sclerosis , diabetes , HIV infections or allergies .
Dr. Grossberg and his co-author Barry
Fox make it clear that they 're not anti-herb or anti-medicine .
" There just are a lot of things people can take that have a lot of bad interactions .
And on some level it makes sense for them to think that what they 're doing is safe .
They associate natural remedies with nature and think if the supplement was n't safe , they could n't pick it up without a prescription .
" Hopefully this will get them to think more about it so they look before they leap .
People can look up what they 're thinking of taking and see if there 's efficacy .
And they should always talk to their doctor about everything they 're taking . "
Many doctors do n't know much about herbal remedies , which have been used as medications for thousands of years .
" When I trained , there was nothing like this in our medical education , " says Dr. Grossberg , who graduated from medical school in 1975 .
" The younger doctors are more likely to know this than older doctors . "
Elderly people , he says , use herbal remedies and do n't always tell their doctors and pharmacists .
They should .
" A lot of our older patients are buying herbals and botanicals .
In addition , while those over 65 represent about 14 percent of the population , they consumer 40 percent of over - the - counter medications , " he says .

Imagine that you are blindfolded and told that the food you are about to eat is ice cream .
It turns out to be chicken liver .
Or imagine that you think you are diving into warm water but instead it turns out to be near - freezing .
This is pretty much what it is like to be governed by Republicans , and there is no better case in point than George W. Bush .
He , like all Republicans since the 1920s , campaigned as a shrink - the - government man .
More incredibly to recall , he blasted the “ nation - building ” of Bill Clinton and insisted that the US needed a “ humble ” foreign policy .
What we got instead is , well , what we got , is the polar opposite .
The man who wailed over Bill Clinton ’s big government has made Clinton ’s spending record look great by comparison .
The guy who decried " nation - building " has decided that bombs and tanks are a great means to inspire a wholesale upheaval in the Gulf region .
What ’s interesting here is what motivates big - government Republicanism .
The party itself has no strong investment in the public sector as it currently stands , apart from the prison bureaucracy and the military .
Most civil servants and teachers and postal workers support the Democrats , knowing full well who is buttering their bread .
Republicans , essentially , see the public purse as something not to conserve but to rob and give to those who do vote Republican .
Thus is the government contracted out — and vastly so .
Thus are religious charities eligible for public funding .
Thus are private schools encouraged to get on the dole .
Thus are industrialists eligible for every privilege one can imagine .
Heck , if you are big enough and powerful enough , the Republicans might even start a war on your behalf .
This gets very expensive indeed , even more expensive than old - fashioned , reformed - minded , repair - the - schools , renew - the - cities , make - the - government - work social democracy !
And you know how the left says that the Republicans care nothing for your privacy or for individual rights ?
The Republicans seem to be living up to a caricature of their reputation .
Anyone who questions whether the FBI ought to be permitted to tap your phone or read your email , or whether the CIA ought to be able to lock people up forever without a formal charge , is denounced as a leftist .
Where have Republican grassroots been ?
Here we find disgrace .
They were charmed by Bush going into all this , and they have not ceased to be loyal .
Yes , along the way — this always happens — some of the rank - and - file become irritated that Bush is n’t doing more to stand up to the Democrats .
But a Republican White House always , always , always knows how to deal with this problem .
The prez sets up a 15 - minute meeting with " conservative leaders " at which they fawn all over him .
They then report back to their minions that the president is a great guy and needs our support .
Most people comply since they fear the devil Democrats more .
As for foreign policy , my goodness , the rank and file are gullible in the most ghastly way .
These people went from scorning Clinton ’s exertions in Somalia to calling anyone who does n’t support the war on Iraq a traitor to America itself .
The display of Nazi - style jingoism has been nearly unbearable .
The flag is worshipped as a holy object , the national anthem is treated as a sacred hymn , every character in a military costume is canonized , and the president himself is exalted as a godhead incarnate .
Now we know — because we are living through it — the stuff of which fascism is made .
We could go on .
But rather than decry the hypocrisy , lies , and unrelenting bamboozlement , it would be more productive to examine the underlying social theory that leads Republicans to campaign one way and govern another .
Elsewhere we discussed how the Democrats believe in a conflict - based model of society , with their imagined society consisting of groups of warring tribes ( men v. women , blacks v. whites , etc. ) .
In the same way , the Republicans imagine that the social order is rife with conflict , but a conflict of a different sort .
Republicans believe that all of society , whether your town , the nation , or the whole world , is divided between those who adhere to the law and those who are inclined to break it .
These they define as good guys and bad guys , but it is not always true since the law these days is not the law written on our hearts but rather the rules as laid down by state masters .
But this seemingly important point is completely lost on the Republican mind , since they believe that without the state as lawmaker , all of society and all of the world would collapse into a muddle of chaos and darkness .
This view they get from Hobbes .
Not that the average buyer of Ann Coulter ’s books reads political philosophy .
They rather accept a popular version of the fundamental anti-liberal idea : society is a wreck without Leviathan .
This is why they celebrate the police more than merchants , why they think that war deserves more credit than trade for world prosperity , why they call drafted killers for the state the " greatest generation , " whereas the pioneers of the 19th century are merely historical curiosities .
In short , their meta- understanding of politics bypassed the liberal revolution of the 18th century and embraced the anti-liberal elements of the Enlightenment .
Up with Hobbes , down with Locke : that is their implied creed .
Liberty is fine but order , ORDER , is much more important , and order comes from the state .
They ca n’t even fathom the truth that liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order .
That thought is too complex for the Manichean mind .
Now , it is true that Republicans tend to be better on issues of welfare , environmentalism , social legislation and the like .
They reject egalitarianism , more or less , and have no strong beef with business .
But none of this matters in the defense of liberty because they are intellectually wedded to the state in the most fundamental way .
They believe that it and not voluntary cooperation is the source of order in society , and what they fear more than anything is revolution .
Freedom , to them , is not a right but something conferred as a reward for good behavior .
It is a curiosity that these same people tend to herald the Declaration of Independence .
This was a revolutionary document that postulated that government was the source of disorder , and imagined that society could be forged in absence of the state .
The replacement government under the Articles of Confederation was a government in name only , and like the anarchy that Republicans fear more than anything else .
I once heard a leading Republican intellectual , a respected figure with lots of books on everyone ’s shelves , express profound regret when the Soviet Union was falling apart .
The problem , from this person ’s perspective , is that this led to disorder , and order — meaning control even by the Soviet state — is the fundamental conservative value .
That about sums it up .
Even communism is to be tolerated so long as it keeps away what they dread more than death : people within their rights doing whatever they want .
But these days we see all around us how liberty generates order and how this order is self - sustaining .
We live in private communities .
We see the glorious world of the web .
We benefit daily , hourly , minute - by - minute , from an order that is not imposed from without but rather generated from within , by that remarkable capacity we have for pursuing self - interest while benefiting the whole .
Here are the great mystery and majesty of social order , expressed so well in the act of economic exchange .
Republicans by contrast live intellectually in a world long past , a world of warring states and societies made up of fixed classes that fought over ever - dwindling resources , a world unleavened by enterprise and individual initiative .
They imagine themselves to be the class of rulers , the aristocrats , the philosopher kings , the high clerics , the landowners , and to keep that power , they gladly fuel the basest of human instincts : nationalism , jingoism , and hate .
Keeping them at bay means keeping the world of their imaginations at bay , and that is a very good and important thing for the sake of civilization .

Each day , thousands of pieces of intelligence information from around the world -- field reports , captured documents , news from foreign allies and sometimes idle gossip -- arrive in a computer - filled office in McLean , where analysts feed them into the nation 's central list of terrorists and terrorism suspects .
Called TIDE , for Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment , the list is a storehouse for data about individuals that the intelligence community believes might harm the United States .
It is the wellspring for watch lists distributed to airlines , law enforcement , border posts and U.S. consulates , created to close one of the key intelligence gaps revealed after Sept. 11 , 2001 : the failure of federal agencies to share what they knew about al - Qaeda operatives .
But in addressing one problem , TIDE has spawned others .
Ballooning from fewer than 100,000 files in 2003 to about 435,000 , the growing database threatens to overwhelm the people who manage it .
" The single biggest worry that I have is long - term quality control , " said Russ Travers , in charge of TIDE at the National Counterterrorism Center in McLean .
" Where am I going to be , where is my successor going to be , five years down the road ? "
TIDE has also created concerns about secrecy , errors and privacy .
The list marks the first time foreigners and U.S. citizens are combined in an intelligence database .
The bar for inclusion is low , and once someone is on the list , it is virtually impossible to get off it .
At any stage , the process can lead to " horror stories " of mixed - up names and unconfirmed information , Travers acknowledged .
The watch lists fed by TIDE , used to monitor everyone entering the country or having even a casual encounter with federal , state and local law enforcement , have a higher bar .
But they have become a source of irritation -- and potentially more serious consequences -- for many U.S. citizens and visitors .
In 2004 and 2005 , misidentifications accounted for about half of the tens of thousands of times a traveler 's name triggered a watch - list hit , the Government Accountability Office reported in September .
Congressional committees have criticized the process , some charging that it collects too much information about Americans , others saying it is ineffective against terrorists .
Civil rights and privacy groups have called for increased transparency .
" How many are on the lists , how are they compiled , how is the information used , how do they verify it ? " asked Lillie Coney , associate director of the Washington - based Electronic Privacy Information Center .
Such information is classified , and individuals barred from traveling are not told why .
Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) said last year that his wife had been delayed repeatedly while airlines queried whether Catherine Stevens was the watch - listed Cat Stevens .
The listing referred to the Britain - based pop singer who converted to Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam .
The reason Islam is not allowed to fly to the United States is secret .
So is the reason Maher Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian , remains on the State Department 's consular watch list .
Detained in New York while en route to Montreal in 2002 , Arar was sent by the U.S. government to a year of imprisonment in Syria .
Canada , the source of the initial information about Arar , cleared him of all terrorism allegations last September -- three years after his release -- and has since authorized $ 9 million in compensation .
TIDE is a vacuum cleaner for both proven and unproven information , and its managers disclaim responsibility for how other agencies use the data .
" What 's the alternative ? "
Travers said .
" I work under the assumption that we 're never going to have perfect information -- fingerprints , DNA -- on 6 billion people across the planet .
. . .
If someone actually has a better idea , I 'm all ears . "
' Thousands of Messages '
The electronic journey a piece of terrorism data takes from an intelligence outpost to an airline counter is interrupted at several points for analysis and condensation .
President Bush ordered the intelligence community in 2003 to centralize data on terrorism suspects , and U.S. agencies at home and abroad now send everything they collect to TIDE .
It arrives electronically as names to be added or as additional information about people already in the system .
The 80 TIDE analysts get " thousands of messages a day , " Travers said , much of the data " fragmentary , " " inconsistent " and " sometimes just flat - out wrong . "
Often the analysts go back to the intelligence agencies for details .
" Sometimes you 'll get sort of corroborating information , " he said , " but many times you 're not going to get much .
What we use here , rightly or wrongly , is a reasonable - suspicion standard . "
Each TIDE listee is given a number , and statistics are kept on nationality and ethnic and religious groups .
Some files include aliases and sightings , and others are just a full or partial name , perhaps with a sketchy biography .
Sunni and Shiite Muslims are the fastest - growing categories in a database whose entries include Saudi financiers and Colombian revolutionaries .
U.S. citizens -- who Travers said make up less than 5 percent of listings -- are included if an " international terrorism nexus " is established .
A similar exception for the administration 's warrantless wiretap program came under court challenge from privacy and civil rights advocates .
Information Sharing
Every night at 10 , TIDE dumps an unclassified version of that day 's harvest -- names , dates of birth , countries of origin and passport information -- into a database belonging to the FBI 's Terrorist Screening Center .
TIDE 's most sensitive information is not included .
The FBI adds data about U.S. suspects with no international ties for a combined daily total of 1,000 to 1,500 new names .
Between 5 and 6 a.m. , a shift of 24 analysts drawn from the agencies that use watch lists begins a new winnowing process at the center 's Crystal City office .
The analysts have access to case files at TIDE and the original intelligence sources , said the center 's acting director , Rick Kopel .
Decisions on what to add to the Terrorist Screening Center master list are made by midafternoon .
The bar is higher than TIDE 's ; total listings were about 235,000 names as of last fall , according to Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine .
The bar is then raised again as agencies decide which names to put on their own watch lists : the Transportation Security Administration 's " no-fly " and " selectee " lists for airlines ; Consular Lookout and Support System at the State Department ; the Interagency Border and Inspection System at the Department of Homeland Security ; and the Justice Department 's National Crime Information Center .
The criteria each agency use are classified , Kopel said .
Some information may raise a red flag for one agency but not another .
" There 's a big difference between CLASS and no-fly , " Kopel said , referring to State 's consular list .
" About the only criteria CLASS has is that you 're not a U.S. person .
. . . Say 'a Mohammed from Syria . '
That 's useless for me to watch - list here in the United States .
But if I 'm in Damascus processing visas . . . that might be enough for someone to . . . put a hold on the visa process . "
All of the more than 30,000 individuals on the TSA 's no-fly list are prohibited from entering an aircraft in the United States .
People whose names appear on the longer selectee list -- those the government believes merit watching but does not bar from travel -- are supposed to be subjected to more intense scrutiny .
With little to go on beyond names , airlines find frequent matches .
The screening center agent on call will check the file for markers such as sex , age and prior " encounters " with the list .
The agent might ask the airlines about the passenger 's eye color , height or defining marks , Kopel said .
" We 'll say , ' Does he have any rings on his left hand ? ' and they 'll say , ' Uh , he does n't have a left hand . '
Okay .
We know that [ the listed person ] lost his left hand making a bomb . "
If the answers indicate a match , that " encounter " is fed back into the FBI screening center 's files and ultimately to TIDE .
Kopel said the agent never tells the airline whether the person trying to board is the suspect .
The airlines decide whether to allow the customer to fly .
TSA receives thousands of complaints each year , such as this one released to the Electronic Privacy Information Center in 2004 under the Freedom of Information Act : " Apparently , my name is on some watch list because everytime I fly , I get delayed while the airline personnel call what they say is TSA , " wrote a passenger whose name was blacked out .
Noting that he was a high - level federal worker , he asked what he could do to remove his name from the list .
The answer , Kopel said , is little .
A unit at the screening center responds to complaints , he said , but will not remove a name if it is shared by a terrorism suspect .
Instead , people not on the list who share a name with someone listed can be issued letters instructing airline personnel to check with the TSA to verify their identity .
The GAO reported that 31 names were removed in 2005 .
A Process Under Fire
A recent review of the entire Terrorist Screening Center database was temporarily abandoned when it proved too much work even for the night crew , which generally handles less of a workload .
But the no-fly and selectee lists are being scrubbed to emphasize " people we think are a danger to the plane , and not for some other reason they met the criteria , " Kopel said .
A separate TSA system that would check every passenger name against the screening center 's database has been shelved over concern that it could grow into a massive surveillance program .
The Department of Homeland Security was rebuked by Congress in December for trying to develop a risk - assessment program to profile travelers entering and leaving the United States based on airline and financial data .
Kopel insisted that private information on Americans , such as credit - card records , never makes it into the screening center database and that " we rely 100 percent on government - owned information . "
The center came in for ridicule last year when CBS's " 60 Minutes " noted that 14 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were listed -- five years after their deaths .
Kopel defended the listings , saying that " we know for a fact that these people will use names that they believe we are not going to list because they 're out of circulation -- either because they 're dead or incarcerated .
. . .
It 's not willy - nilly .
Every name on the list , there 's a reason that it's on there . "
Recently I wrote an article for the 2007 Direct Marketing News ' Essential Guide to Lists , Database Marketing and Data Services .
The article was about how the Web 2.0 phenomenon was changing how companies interacted with their customers and prospects .
It was a short article that only touched at the surface of changes , but it was pretty well received .
I received a couple of nice emails from folks who read it and thought it was interesting .
And then I got this email from someone who basically wanted me to hire them to do public relations work .
I really have no problem with this , as I use this strategy from time to time if I run across something that makes sense for me to approach .
And when I do this , I try to make sure up front that I make a positive statement about whatever it is they wrote about , spoke about or presented on .
It shows that I 've at least did a little homework and paid some attention to what they did .
This just makes good sense .... and I 'm not even in public relations .
So here 's what I get from the PR person who wants me to hire them based off of the contact he 's initiating with this email .....
Hi Brent :
Seeing your article in the DM News Guide to Lists & Database Marketing , I wanted to drop you a line and introduce myself .
As a public relations consultant specializing in the database marketing & CRM space , I deal with marketing services and numerous industry publications every day .
As a matter of fact , I helped create and placed two articles in the same Guide in which your article appeared .
This was the opening paragraph .
You do n't need to see the rest and I did n't either as I pretty much stopped reading after that .
Well typically that would have been it for me but I did check the rest of the email just to see if my assumption was correct .
And it was .
This person only talked about themselves and what they 've done in the past .
What set me off in the first place was how it was pretty apparent to me that this person did n't even take the time to read my article .
He " saw " it , but he definitely did n't read it .
If he had , and if he really wanted my business , do n't you think he would have complimented me before going full bore into his sales pitch ?
My co-host Michael Thomas refers to this as the " nice tie " approach , where you find something to compliment your intended target on before hitting them up .
This person , who claims to be a public relations specialist , did n't even give me a nice tie before singing their own praises ( and anyone who knows me knows I could really use a nice tie ) .
Needless to say , I did n't reply to the email .
In fact I 'd probably hire Terrell Owens ' old PR lady before hiring this person , and we know what kind of job she did under fire .
It reminded me of that Seinfeld episode where George asks Jerry to act like his former employer and be a reference for the job he 's going for as a latex salesman .
George has the company call Jerry 's house , but instead of Jerry answering the phone Kramer does and totally screws it up for George .
George , in the bathroom , here 's Kramer messing it up and comes tearing out of the bathroom with his pants down around his ankles , then falls face first right at Jerry 's feet .
Jerry looks at George , and says those famous words .... " and you want to be my latex salesman ...... "
And this person what to be my public relations consultant .......
To me , it 's just another tragic case of customer relationship mis-management .
Please learn from this before sending that next email out .
And also learn how to say and spell " Nice Tie ! "

Reporter , BBC programme Al Qaeda : Turning the Terrorists
In the fight against the international terrorist threat in Indonesia , one man has become an invaluable ally .
Nasir Abbas explains why , after men he trained carried out the Bali bombing in 2002 , he decided to change sides .
Nasir Abbas is also in demand from intelligence agencies overseas
For many years Nasir Abbas was one of the most wanted jihadis in South East Asia .
He was a member of al - Qaeda 's regional affiliate , Jemaah Islamiya ( JI ) .
The Malaysian trained the Bali bombers in Afghanistan , established a jihadi training camp - Camp Hudabiya - in the dense jungles of Mindanao in the southern Philippines , and rose to become the head of JI 's military training division , known as Mantiki Three .
He was close to some of the most notorious militants in the region and brother - in - law of Mukhlas , the mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings .
Those he trained and those he knew went on to operate not just in South East Asia , but in other parts of the world .
Military academy
Mr Abbas seems an unlikely jihadi .
He is quietly spoken , well - mannered and seemingly gentle , belying the fearsome reputation acquired over the years .
I asked Indonesia 's top anti-terrorist police officer , General Ansyaad Mbai , how he used to regard his adversary .
" He was a very dangerous man because he was one of the key figures in JI , " he said .
I felt responsible , in front of God , to stop all these bad deeds
Nasir Abbas
" It included individual combat training , small arms and weapons training and basic knowledge about explosives , " he said .
Did he train people to kill ?
His reply gave a hint of why he eventually underwent such a remarkable transformation .
" I train people for war , for battle , " he said .
" We are killing for defence .
We are fighting for our right .
And we are not attacking civilians but soldiers . "
Innocent lives
According to Mr Abbas ' philosophy of jihad , it is acceptable to fight and kill foreign forces occupying Muslim countries like the Soviets in Afghanistan , the Americans in Iraq or the Philippine army occupying ancestral Muslim lands in Mindanao , but killing innocent civilians - men , women and children - is forbidden .
Wednesday 13 September 2100 BST on BBC Two TV trail ( 31 secs )
This is the philosophy of modern violent jihad outlined by Palestinian Abdullah Azzam , acknowledged to be the " father " of modern violent jihad .
With this distinction in mind , the 2002 Bali bombings in which 202 civilians died , made Mr Abbas think again about the organisation to which he had belonged for almost a decade .
When he discovered that his former students , whom he had trained in Afghanistan in the early 1990s , were responsible , he was deeply shocked .
" I feel sorry , I feel sin , " he said , " because they used the knowledge to kill civilians , to kill innocent people . "
It was only when he was arrested six months later in April 2003 , that Mr Abbas finally decided to put his past behind him .
Switching allegiance
As he was taken off for interrogation , he feared the worst .
" I believed that the police were very cruel and used torture to get their answers , " he said .
His ultimate test of allegiance came when he gave evidence in court against the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiya
But Mr Abbas was in for a surprise .
He was treated with civility and Muslim respect .
He was also surprised that so much was known about him and was puzzled as to how his interrogators knew .
He was arrested one evening and kept silent until the following morning .
Then he decided to talk and help the police , because he thought it was God 's will .
He said he felt " responsible , in front of God , to stop all these bad deeds . "
From that point on , Mr Abbas tried to persuade his former comrades that their interpretation of the Koran was wrong .
He urges them to " return to the right path of Islamic teaching . "
But he did much more than that .
He actively assisted the police in tracking down and arresting some of his former comrades and felt no guilt in doing so .
On trial
His ultimate test of allegiance came almost two years after his arrest when he gave evidence in court against the alleged spiritual leader of JI , Abu Bakar Ba'asyir .
Mr Ba'asyir was charged with conspiracy in connection with the 2002 Bali bombing .
There was a near riot in court when Mr Abbas gave evidence that Ba'asyir had personally made him the leader of Mantiki Three and had attended a passing out parade of Mr Abbas ' graduates at Camp Hudabiya .
Ba'asyir was given a two - and - half year prison sentence .
High risk
Mr Abbas continues his work today .
Last week another JI member against whom he gave evidence , Mohamed Cholily , was sentenced to 18 years for involvement in the 2005 Bali bombing .
And earlier this year he provided police with information that helped them track down Azahari Bin Husin , JI 's master bomb maker , who made the 2002 Bali bombs .
The jihadi who turned has every intention of carrying on .
The problem for the police is keeping him alive as he has made so many enemies .
JI 's Noordin Top , now the most wanted man in Indonesia , has made no secret of what he would do to Mr Abbas should he ever get his hands on him .
Mr Abbas believes
God will protect him .
Al - Qaeda : Turning the Terrorists was broadcast on Wednesday , 13 September , 2006 at 2100 BST on BBC Two .
Four people were seriously injured today when a series of huge explosions ripped through an oil terminal .
They were among 36 hurt in the blasts , which rocked the Buncefield depot near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire , police said .
The force of the blasts could be heard up to 40 miles away as flames shot more than 200 feet into the sky .
Hertfordshire police chief constable Frank Whiteley said detectives are treating the incident as an accident .
The first blast happened just after 6 am at the fuel terminal in Leverstock Green , Herts , close to Junction 8 of the M1 .
The depot - which holds huge stocks of various fuels - also supplies aviation fuel for Heathrow and Luton airports .
Mr Whiteley said 100 police officers are at the scene alongside more than 100 firefighters .
He said it was the largest fire he'd ever seen .
More explosions are expected at the scene but Mr Whiteley stressed that the fire is under control and should not spread to a larger area .
The public are being advised to stay indoors and not go near the immediate area of the blasts .
Anyone concerned about the blasts should ring the Casualty Bureau on 0800 - 096 095 .
Those calling from overseas should call 020-7158 0125 .
If anyone is feeling unwell they are advised to call NHS Direct on 0845 4647 .
Fire crews are putting plans in place for several days of work .
Mr Whiteley said : " All indications at this stage are that this was an accident .
However , clearly we will keep an open mind until we can confirm that for certain . "
As a result of operations at the scene , it was anticipated that there would be further explosions today , and he wanted to reassure the public that this was nothing untoward .
He said it was believed there were around 36 casualties , of whom four were more serious .
A plume of smoke above the site was moving slowly eastwards .
" This cloud , not least because it does contain heavy smoke , is an irritant , and would certainly make people who inhale it potentially cough , potentially irritate the eyes , and potentially feel nauseous .
" Our strong advice is to keep out of the plume of smoke , and if the windows of your house have been blown out or are damaged , we would suggest you should evacuate yourself somewhere safer .
" People should stay indoors , close your windows , and watch the news for updates . "
Howard Borkett - Jones , medical director of the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust , said that a total of 36 people had been treated at the Hemel Hempstead general hospital for injuries from the explosions .
Of those , he said 34 had minor cuts and bruises and all had been treated and discharged from the Accident and Emergency department .
One patient had been transferred to Watford general hospital for " respiratory support " and one had been admitted to the Hemel Hempstead General and was under observation .
He said the hospital was running effectively as normal but that extra capacity was available to cope with any " escalation " .
" We have thoroughly prepared plans for major incidents of this nature and we regularly test them out . "

These are photos of different underground parts of Moscow by Russos .
He makes official photos for Moscow Subway System so he often visits different underground places in Moscow that cannot be accessed by a regular person .
He is fond of HDR post - processing of the photos so they look like a little bit overprocessed but still very cute .
And did you know that some Russian governmental offices copy design of their websites from Nazi German propaganda posters ?
See examples in our next post .
When I log into the beta of the new Lord of the Rings game , the first thing I do is pick my race .
I decide I 'm going to be a dwarf : stolid , not so great with magic , but a superb brawler .
The idea of being a slightly hotheaded man of the earth appeals to me .
And pretty soon I 'm engrossed in the task of trying out various big , honking noses .
That 's when it suddenly hits me that this is a really weird , yet central part of online gaming : obsessing about your racial identity and appearance .
I do n't mean " weird " in that it 's unusual .
Indeed , every online game begins with you carefully poring over a bouquet of races and picking your favorite .
It 's completely normal .
No , what 's weird is that this is crazily , dementedly out of step with how I act in my everyday world .
In the real world , defining someone by his or her race is considered a classically illiberal act .
But in games , racism – making snap judgments about someone based solely on their skin and ethnic identity – is absolutely central to gameplay .
I admit this might seem like a " whoa , dude " stoner epiphany .
But the reason it came to mind is because I 'm playing a Lord of the Rings game , and J.R.R .
Tolkien basically invented the idea of fantasy race - based worlds .
The people in Middle Earth were rigidly defined by their race .
Hobbits were sensible , if unvisionary ; elves were austere and aloof ; orcs were unreservedly evil .
It ai n't where you 're at – it 's where you 're from .
Mostly .
Indeed , Tolkien 's obsessive devotion to race has provoked decades of blistering debates about whether his archetypes were thinly veiled allusions to real - life nationalities – complete with rankings of which ones rocked and which ones sucked .
The hobbits seemed like the stolid , sensible Victorian English folk that Tolkien adored ; the goblins , with their evil technological genius , could be any scary European enemy army , like the second World War Germans .
And the orcs , with their Indo - Asian features ?
Ahem .
" I 'm not going there , " said Jeffrey Steefel , the executive producer of the Lord of the Rings online game , with a laugh when I called him to talk race .
Of course , you could argue that game designers adopted racial classifications for entirely different and more benign reasons .
It was n't , as with Tolkien , a way to meditate on human nature .
It was just a great way to ensure diverse gameplay .
Having different races in a game allows for a range of characters with different abilities :
Dwarves have endurance , elves have magic , orcs have brute force .
From a game - design perspective , dividing the world in races is much like dividing chess into six differently powered pieces .
So on this level , you could ask , is the weirdly blatant nature of race in games a big deal ?
Maybe not .
Except that races inside games often seem to reflect , in a creepy way , some of our most regrettable biases about race in real life .
For example , when World of Warcraft first came out , players were amused , stunned or both to discover that the evil trolls spoke in ... Jamaican accents .
Aaron Delwiche , a game academic at Trinity University , asked his student Beth Cox to analyze all the " emotes " in World of Warcraft – the spoken greetings or hand gestures Blizzard pre-programmed into each race .
She found that Trolls were " disproportionately more likely to make violent or sexual statements , " Delwiche notes .
( Some of their sentences were even scripted in Ebonics : " You going to axe me out ? " says the female Troll when you hit the " flirt " command . )
In the same way , the " good " alliance characters tended to employ Western , Christian - like symbols , while the evil horde had totems and shamanistic magic .
" Clearly , there 's something interesting happening there , and it's not just coincidence , " Delwiche adds .
There 's evidence , too , that players bring their own racial biases into the game .
When Nick Yee , a game academic at Stanford University , polled World of Warcraft players in 2005 , he found that while there were nine possible races to choose from , a significant majority – more than half of women and almost half of men – chose to play as the two most " white - looking " and " pretty " races in the game : Humans and elves .
These racial preferences are so powerful that they 've actually warped and bent the gameplay in curious ways .
Yee discovered that the people as humans and elves tended to be newbies , whereas the " evil " characters – like Orcs – were played by younger , more hard - core gamers .
The two things were related :
It turns out that the whole reason experienced gamers picked " evil " characters is because they were sick of dealing with noobs , and wanted to get away from them .
They picked a race that seemed intimidating and scary precisely because they wanted to be intimidating and scary , pretty much the way the death - metal kids at my high school crafted fashion and music to drive the preppies far away .
It throws to an even deeper and stranger question :
Does the race that you play as affect your behavior in in the game ?
Yee suspects it can , in possibly subconscious ways .
In a new experiment he recently conducted , people who played with " pretty " avatars in an online game were more likely to confide in other players than those who chose intimidatingly mean - looking ones .
( He controlled to ensure this was n't just a matter of self - selection – i.e. , inherently reserved people voluntarily picking uglier avatars . )
The virtual skin you wear , it seems , can affect how you treat other people .
" So you start to think , what does it mean to be in that avatar for 20 hours a week ? " he asks .
( If you want to read a truly spectacular debate on this subject , check out the sprawling thread " The Horde Is Evil " over at Terra Nova . )
Now , this obviously is n't a simple issue .
The identities we pick online are not simple reflections of our real - life personas .
On the contrary , most pundits have assumed that online worlds are more like identity sandboxes – places we can screw around with different ways to be .
I 've run into " good " elves that were total jerks , undead villains who behaved in wonderfully altruistic ways and plenty of mincing hottie blood elves who turned out to be balding , middle - aged , married Ohio businessmen .
Online games are our refuge from the linear politics of the real world , right ?
I 'd still like to think so .
Though as I sit here tweaking my dwarf 's nose , I admit I 'm starting to wonder .
Am I playing this character , or is it playing me ?

Offshore Wind Turbine Farms : Ambitious and Beautiful .
There is nothing like the promise of readily available and bountiful energy in our resource - strapped world .
Based on data determining that average wind speeds at sea are higher than on land , the modern offshore wind farms promise to be exceptionally energy efficient .
When the weather is calm they also look fetchingly beautiful :

But when the seas are rough , the graceful structure is put to the test , and it's not a fact that every turbine will survive :
The Horn ’s Reef project , located 14 kilometres off Denmark ’s West coast in the North Sea , is located in some of Europe ’s roughest waters .
( source article )
“ There are other offshore wind parks in the world but everybody agrees that Horn ’s Reef is the first ’ real ’ offshore wind park because of its size and its placement in the North Sea .
So far , all other offshore parks have been placed close to land in protected waters “ says project manager Jens Bonefeldt .
“ The North Sea is considered to be one of the roughest stretches of water in the world . ”
Floating wind turbine .
It is now possible to build offshore wind parks
at sea depths of 200-300 meters .
8 to 10 meter waves are expected at the site
( not counting nasty " global warming " storm surprises )
Some failed turbine structures ( source here ) :
- One of the turbines failed in spectacular fashion following a lightning strike , the blades disintegrated , hurling debris at speeds approaching 200 mph .
- A whole blade weighing over a tonne became detached from the VESTAS turbine .
- The pictures above show a spectacular failure of a turbine during a storm in Lichtenau , Germany ( Thanks to Wilfred Heck for supplying these photographs ) .
Many Hollywood thrillers show a helicopter chase through the forest of such giant windmills .
The havoc produced by the flying blades is usually quite spectacular ...
Huge wind farms may be a dream come true , but it's also a challenge to designers and engineers , demanding a combination of experience and new thinking .
CONSTRUCTION OF THE OFFSHORE WIND FARM
In 2002 the world ’s largest offshore wind farm was constructed at the Danish west coast .
The Horns Rev wind farm is sited 14 - 20 km into the North Sea , west of Blåvands Huk , and represents the first phase in the Danish Government ’s ambitious plan - to have wind turbines with a total capacity of 4000 MW in Danish waters before 2030 .
Thanks to Gunnar Britse , photographer ( all rights reserved ) , we can witness the grandiose operation of setting up a forest of windmills at various Dutch ( and Swedish ) offshore locations :
" The world ’s first major offshore wind power plant has since December 2002 produced enough energy to run 150,000 Danish households .
Eighty 2.0 MW turbines from the world ’s leading wind turbine manufacturer Vestas are sited across an area of 20 sq. km . " ( source )
With the Horns Rev project it will be possible to determine whether or not the Danish Government ’s ambitious energy plan is feasible .
And whether or not the long - bladed Goliaths will survive the harshest of North Sea storms .

While doing the research for my recent posts on tuition fees , I came across something from the Canadian Federation of Students called ' Myth or Fact : A guide to common myths about the importance of reducing tuition fees ' ( 9 - page pdf ) .
Here 's an extract :
MYTH : “ Tuition fee freezes unnecessarily subsidise the cost of postsecondary education for those who can afford it . ”
FACT : Disgraced former Ontario Premier Bob Rae and conservative researcher Alex Usher promote this fallacy in order to popularise the notion that a “ one - size - fits - all ” tuition fee ( also known as regulation ) is obsolete .
Instead , Rae and Usher champion fully deregulated tuition fees cushioned by a tuition fee waiver for a tiny sliver of the population .
The argument is this :
• every student ( poor , rich , or in - between ) pays roughly the same tuition fee and receives equal benefit from freezes and reductions ;
• low - income Canadians are under - represented in universities ;
• low - income Canadians pay taxes that support public universities and colleges ; therefore
• low - income families are subsidizing the participation of higher income families .
The facts do not support Rae ’s and Usher ’s tuition fee campaign ...
[ E] conomist Hugh MacKenzie recently examined the issue and found no evidence that low tuition fees result in a net transfer of resources from low - income households to high - income households .
As polemics go , it 's not particularly compelling : the ' myth ' is ascribed to people who are described as ' disgraced ' and ' conservative ' , and it is countered by an unsupported assertion that someone has disproved it elsewhere .
But I was curious enough to try to track it down , and I eventually came across a paper with the title " The Tuition Trap " ( 31 - page pdf ) .
Chart 5 from this paper presents data that are consistent with the stylised facts from this post :
University students are twice as likely to come from the top income quartile than from the lowest income quartile - which means that twice as much public money will go to tuition subsidies for students from high - income families .
Here is Hugh Mackenzie 's explanation for why this is okay :
[ T ]he fact that young people from high - income families are overrepresented in the student population and young people from low - income families are underrepresented does not mean that subsidizing tuition from general government revenues results in poor families subsidizing rich families .
One cannot make that claim without knowing the distribution of the taxes levied to provide the subsidies .
We know from other studies that overall , provincial taxes are distributed approximately in proportion to income [ see this post - ed ] .
This means that income groups in Ontario contribute to general revenue roughly in proportion to their share of total income ...
Referring to chart 5 , where an income quartile group ’s share of the college and / or university student population is greater than its share of the total income of all families with children , a tuition subsidy paid for from general government revenues amounts to a net income transfer in favour of that group .
Where an income quartile group ’s share of the college and / or university student population is less than its share of total income , a tuition subsidy paid for from general government revenues amounts to a net income transfer from that group to other groups .
The first and second quartile groups ( incomes below $ 56,800 ) make up a larger proportion of the student population than of family income .
Subsidized tuition provides a net transfer in favour of families in the lower half of the income distribution .
Families in the third income quartile account for roughly the same share of students and of income .
There is essentially no cross-subsidy either in favour of or against families in the third income quartile .
The fourth ( highest ) quartile accounts for a smaller proportion of college and university students than it does of total income , so the highest - income 25 per cent of families in effect subsidizes tuition of the lowest - income half of families , through their contributions to the tax system .
Given the overall pattern , one would expect that families in the top half of the third quartile would be underrepresented among students relative to their share of income , and that families in the bottom half of the third quartile would be overrepresented among students relative to their share of income – producing a rough balance within the quartile .
This means that , to the extent that tuition does pose an economic barrier to college and university participation by people from lower - income families , substituting tuition for public funding will tend to reduce the net transfer from higher - income families to lower - income families ; replacing tuition with increased public funding will tend to increase the net transfer .
More than 60 per cent of families with children are net beneficiaries of the transfer inherent in subsidizing tuition from general government revenues .
The claim that subsidized tuition amounts to an unfair , regressive income transfer from poor families to middle - and upper - income families is simply not true .
My original point about the regressive nature of the tuition subsidy did not take the tax system into account : I deemed it regressive because it spent more money on students from families with high - incomes than it did on low - income students .
To my mind , a progressive system would direct more money to low - income students .
The effect of bringing the tax system into the analysis is to greatly lower the progressive bar .
In order for a program to conform with this new standard for progressive policies , all you have to do is make sure that the benefits are distributed in a way that is less unequal than the underlying income distribution .
This is a remarkably easy test to pass - even George W. Bush 's tax cuts satisfy this criterion .
Although free tuition does satisfy this incredibly weak definition of progressive , it just does n't pass the smell test :
It was another War - A - Go - Go on Hannity & Colmes last night ( 9/1/06 ) with two guests with the same opinion – that every day we delay either military action against Iran or effecting regime change ( or maybe both ) , the US comes closer to being attacked by a nuclear bomb .
Just in case that did n’t get the message across , the screen read “ Only one option ? ” and “ Time to attack Iran ? ” throughout the discussion .
One of the guests was a new - to - me FOX News foreign affairs analyst named Alireza Jafarzadeh .
It turns out Mr. Jafarzadeh is the former spokesperson for what the US State Department deemed a terrorism group allied with Saddam Hussein .
With echoes of former US pal Ahmed Chalabi , so useful to the Bush Administration during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , now so discredited ( for giving US secrets to Iran , for one thing ) , Jafarzadeh is a former dissident who left his home country before the 1979 revolution .
Also like Chalabi , Jafarzadeh seems to have quite a colorful , some might say shady past .
To quote from Answers.com :
Jafarzadeh 's name first appears in the media in a Houston Chronicle article dated December 24 , 1986 , where he is described as a spokesman for the MEK ( Mujahedin-e Khalq ) .
In the article he denied US State Department claims the MEK was a terrorist organization responsible for the assassination of at least six Americans in Iran .
Jafarzadeh was the public spokesperson for the National Council of Resistance of Iran until its office in Washington was closed by the US State Department in 2002 on the grounds that it was a front group for the MEK , by then listed as a terrorist organistion .
A 2002 article in National Review , said : A 1994 State Department report indicates that the Mujahedin has trained and fought alongside Iraqi troops on a number of occasions , and that " Saddam Hussein has been one of [ its ] primary financiers , providing weapons and cash totaling an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars . "
... The Mujahedin's Washington spokesman , Alireza Jafarzadeh , attempts -- unconvincingly -- to distance the group from its past .
He says , for example , that the group assassinated Americans in the 1970s because it had been taken over by radicals ; in fact , U.S. intelligence indicates that Massoud Rajavi , the group 's leader , was in firm control at the time .
Jafarzadeh also claims that the 1979 U.S. - embassy takeover was a Khomeini scheme to test his supporters , and that the Mujahedin had to either " endorse [ it ] entirely " or take a vague and " very calculated " decision to sign on ; Jafarzadeh claims the group took the latter .
But in fact , on the day of the takeover , the Mujahedin issued a statement : " After the shah , it 's America 's turn . "
And when the hostages were released , the group boasted that it was " the first force who rose unequivocally to the support of the occupation of the American spy center . "
Still , the group continues to find naive supporters like Congressman Edolphus Towns , Democrat of New York .
He says , " I think they could replace [ Iran 's mullahs ] , I really do . "
Experts on Iran scoff at this claim .
Dealey , Sam . ‘ A Very , Very Bad Bunch ' : An Iranian group and its surprising American friends . "
National Review 54.5 ( March 25 , 2002 ) : NA .
Student Edition . ( found via Infotrac )
Note : National Review is the same publication where Rich Lowry , subbing last night for Sean Hannity , is employed .
But Jafarzadeh 's past never seemed to give Lowry a moment 's pause .
None of Jafarzadeh 's background was disclosed to the FOX News viewing audience who , I suspect , would find it of great interest that a former Hussein - connected terrorist is now being paid by the same news network that never tires of recounting the horrors of the Hussein regime .
Alan Colmes did an excellent job of confronting Jafarzadeh and the other guest , FOX News military analyst Gen .
Thomas McInerney , with what Colmes called the “ ginning up of emotions ” over Iran .
Colmes said , “ Yes , they ’re continuing their program but according to the IAEA , it is so miniscule , that it can only be used for energy , it can not be used for anything else .
The report this week said they found no proof of a weapons program and that they ’re complying with inspections to allow the agency to inspect its uranium work . "
With more similarities to the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , Jafarzadeh ratcheted up the fear factor about mushroom clouds .
“ It 's not usable ( for weapons purposes ) now , but once Iran has the ability ( Colmes interrupted to say that it would be 8 – 10 years away before Iran would have the capability to make a nuclear bomb . )
No , absolutely not .
Once you have the ability to enrich uranium to peaceful level , which is 5 % , you ’re only weeks away from being able to enrich it further to 80 % and use it for the bomb .
So it ’s the ability that is extremely crucial to be able to enrich uranium . ”
He added , “ All ( the Iranians ) are doing , using the negotiations to buy time while the program has been progressing . ”
He also said “ The regime is a lot bolder , a lot more defiant , ” than when it began its program .
Nobody questioned why that should happen when our invasion of Iran was supposed to produce the opposite result .
Home Felleisen : How to Design Class Hierarchies
My talk will instead present a novel approach to the first - year programming curriculum .
Specifically , I will explain how a functional semester ideally prepares students for the true essence of object - oriented programming according to Alan Kay : the systematic construction of small modules of code and the construction of programs without assignment statements .
Experience shows that these courses prepare students better for upper - level courses than a year of plain object - oriented programming .
Initial reports from our students ' co-op employers appear to confirm the experiences of our upper - level instructors .

We discussed this approach ( FP as an introduction to OOP ) before .
This presentation is from FPDE 2005 .

The No S Diet , also known as the " Grandma Diet , " the " Why Did n't I Think of that Diet , " and the " No $ Diet " is a program of systematic moderation I invented for myself that seems to work for similarly minded people .
No funny science or calorie accounting involved , just a few simple and mnemonic tricks for building sustainable " good enough " eating habits .
There are just three rules and one exception :
No Snacks
No Sweets
No Seconds
Except ( sometimes ) on days that start with " S "
That 's it .
Do that and you 'll probably lose most if not all of your excess weight .
For subtle pyschological reasons I go into below , you 'll probably start eating better as well as less .
And you 'll enjoy eating a whole lot more .
How could something this simple possibly work ?
Precisely because it 's simple -- or rather , following the Einsteinian dictum , " as simple as possible , but not simpler . "
For all its folksy charm , there 's a lot of serious , practical wisdom packed into those 14 words .
Read on if you need more convincing ...
There 's a No S Diet book out -- published by a real publisher that you 've actually heard of .
Buy it from Amazon.com , Barnes and Noble , Penguin or your local bookstore .
Non-US
No S Dieters can find the book at amazon.co.uk ( United Kingdom ) , amazon.de ( Germany ) , amazon.ca ( Canada ) , angusrobertson.com.au ( Australia ) , and amazon.jp ( Japan ) .
You can also get eBook versions for your Kindle , Palm or sony eBook reader .
Or try your local library .
While it 's true that the book does n't contain any Secret Information I do n't freely give on this website , I do think it has some added value : it 's more grammatical , more in depth , more tightly organized , and more portable .
And , of course , it 's a much appreciated " thank you . "
Why are other diets so lousy ?
Most diets today can be divided into two categories :
Pseudoscientific forbidden foods diets that pretend that you can go on being a glutton as long as you confine your gluttony to a particular class of foods while completely excluding others ( no agreement on what these particular kinds of foods are , of course ) .
Diets that require you to be a full time calorie accountant .
The forbidden foods diets are patent nonsense .
They contradict one another , go in and out of fashion every ten years , and never seem to gather any serious scientific support .
You wo n't stick with one of these because not being able to eat whole categories of food is a real drag .
At the outset , it might seem worth it to trade pasta for unlimited steaks ( or vice versa ) , but it gets old fast .
And it might even make you sick .
It 's funny that these diets masquerade as scientific , because psychologically they rely on the most primitive magicism : magic potion foods that are good for you and can be gorged on with impunity , and cursed poison foods that corrupt with a mouthful ( carbohydrates and fat are the two biggies , alternating roles ) .
They pretend that you do n't have to do the hard work of fundamentally altering your habits .
" It 's not your fault , " they say , " it 's the food 's fault !
Just eat this other magic food instead ... "
It 's so temptingly flattering and easy .
Alas , it is n't true and does n't work , and in the final analysis it is n't even flattering .
The calorie accounting diets are time consuming and joyless .
You wo n't be able to stick with one of these because it will make you miserable .
Besides the sheer tedium of compliance , if you come to think of food as fuel , a mere quantity , you 'll come to loathe it -- and your number crunching - munching self .
The situation is complicated a little by hybrids ( i.e. , counting taboo food units -- the worst of both worlds ) and fluff .
Horrified scientists occasionally publish sober descriptions of what the ideal human lab rat should eat , but these fail so miserably as prescriptions that they 're not even worth considering .
The truth is , pretty much any diet will lose you weight if you stick with it .
The problem is n't how to lose the weight .
The problem is how to stick with the diet .
According to the FDA , 95 % of dieters fail to do this for more than a few months at a time .
You need a diet that acknowledges this grim statistic and targets the real culprit : not your belly , but your mind .
Why is this diet so much better ?
Because it is simple , sustainable , and you are n't really depriving yourself of anything .
You do n't have to sacrifice anything -- not time , not health , not money , not any delicious thing .
No pleasure is denied , just unobtrusively delayed and contained .
Served up on the platter of limited opportunity , each pleasure becomes even more enjoyable than it was before .
There are no magic potions and there are no poisons .
You are targeting just the culprit , just the bad habit of overeating itself .
Ask yourself if you can imagine staying on a particular diet for the rest of your life .
If not , do n't bother starting , it 's a waste of time and will .
That 's much too rational and straightforward .
Come on , REALLY , why is this diet so much better ?
You would n't take diet advice from a fat person , why take it from a fat book ?
Weighing in at just 14 words , the No S Diet is the ultra featherweight of diet plans .
( Yes , I know , I 've now written a book myself -- but it's a wee little thing .
You can easily read it in a day .
And of course , for the bare essentials of the system , all you need is the cover . )
Is there any scientific evidence that this diet works ?
Absolutely none .
But I 'm not aware that I have any competition in this regard .
It is more or less how billions of thin people around the world have eaten for millenia , if that counts for anything .
Is there a cheesy testimonials page like all other diets have ?
( relatively ) New !
Yes !
Right here .
See the bulletin board for a more balanced ( if less concise ) view .
How do you pronounce " No S Diet ? "
It 's a pun , you can pronounce it the Noes Diet , the No Es Diet , or even the No Esses Diet , depending on which aspect of the pun you feel like emphasizing .
I used to spell it all one word , " nosdiet , " for easy googling , but no one else did , which kind of defeated the purpose , so I stopped .
You 'll just have to google with quotes .
What days start with " s " ?
Saturday , Sunday and " Special " days .
Special days include ( your ) national and ( your ) religious and ( your ) close family 's and friend 's birthdays .
My apologies to atheists and non-native English speakers .
A lean and hungry look becomes you .
Sick days also start with S. Though I do n't imagine you 'll be too hungry if you 're really sick , you officially have license to do whatever it takes to get better .
" Days that start with S " are discussed frequently on this site , and since that 's a bit of a mouthful , you 'll usually see them referred to them as S - days .
Days that do NOT start with ( even more of a mouthful ) are referred to as N - days ( i.e. , NON - S days ) .
You can also think N as standing for " normal . "
Non-weekend - S-days are sometimes referred to as NWS - days .
Though I coined this awful term myself , I think it 's clearer to just call them " special " days .
What do you mean by " sometimes " ?
I stuck the word " sometimes " in the exception to remind you not to be an idiot on S - days .
It 's been my experience that the good habits you build on the non-S - days will see you through the S - days without too much excess .
My S - days tend to be no worse than my pre-No S Diet ordinary days .
( relatively ) New !
" Do n't be an idiot " insufficiently specific for you ?
Read this discussion for a little more guidance .
Note : readers of the No S Diet book may have noticed that the word " sometimes " did n't make it to the print version .
The reason for this was mostly typographical ( the 14 word version with " sometimes " just did n't fit as well on the cover ) .
And while some people can using the extra reminder , " sometimes " is n't really logically necessary -- OF COURSE you should n't eat snacks , sweets and seconds ALL THE TIME on S - days .
I 've kept the " sometimes " on the web site so pre-book
No S dieters do n't feel like I 've changed the system out from under them , and as far as I 'm concerned , both the 13 and 14 word formulations of the system are equally valid and " canonical " ( more on this issue here ) .
What do you mean by " seconds ? "
As I mentioned in a post to the No S diet group , by " no seconds , " I officially mean one physical plate , and I think for beginners especially it 's good to stick with this , even if it means a fairly overloaded plate .
If the amount of food on your one plate is a little bestial and disgusting , that 's part of the educational process .
What do you mean by " sweets " ?
I mean something whose principal source of calories is sugar .
Go ahead and put sugar in your coffee or oatmeal ; you have my blessing .
Of course fruits are fine .
But beware of soda and corn syrup " juice " drinks .
I 'm not just being a killjoy ; adolescent Americans get an estimated 13 % of their total calories from such nutritionally bankrupt " liquid carbohydrates . "
I would n't worry too much about borderline foods like yoghurt and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches .
If these are a problem for you , i.e. , you eat them every day and lay it on thick , then make them esses .
If not , do n't .
Just by targeting the really egregious offenders you 'll be cutting out a lot of calories .
And you 'll be that much more likely to stick with the plan .
If you 're like most first worlders , it 's a little revolting to think how much unambiguously crappy food you consume .
So forget the borderline cases , the clear cut cases are 80 % of the problem and 0 % of the headache .
Do you know how many pounds of sugar the average American ingests each year ?
According to the USDA 's Economic Research Service , 105 pounds ( 2001 ) .
That 's about 20 % of total calories .
You could make a snowman out of that .
That 's less than 2 years till you 've eaten your body weight in sugar .
If you 're a real whopper , chances are you eat even more sugar than that , so I figure it works out about the same .
And this is a pretty conservative number .
The ERS assumes that over 40 pounds of " delivered " sugar is " lost " ( 147 delivered , 105 ingested ) , which I find a little hard to believe , but I guess we 're wastrels as well as gluttons .
How do you think that compares with the sugar intake of our ancestors ?
We do n't have to go back to hunter gatherer times to find a striking contrast , or even before Columbus ( when it was close to nil because there was no refined sugar in most places ) .
1821 will do : 10 pounds ( that 's delivered , not ingested ! ) .
You do n't need to be an Atkins nut to see there 's a problem here .
Indeed , why bother taking it to the next level , by severely restricting carbs in general , with all the dubious health issues that entails , when there is plenty problem here , at the sugar level ?
If orange juice is really your problem , you do n't have much of a problem .
I 'm not some food hating , pleasure begrudging voice in the wilderness .
I 'm not telling you to give up sweets completely .
I love sweets .
But I love them even more on S days .
That way I can love them unreservedly , without also hating them for what they do to my body .
On S - days , I make sure to pick out something really nice , to make it count .
Sweets were n't designed for daily , routine consumption , physically or spiritually .
Deserve your desserts .
They taste much better that way .
Does fake sugar count as an " S " ?
As I mentioned in a post to the No S Diet group , I would avoid fake sugar products for 3 reasons .
they tend to be pretty disgusting you * know * that in 10 years scientists are going to discover that they 're even worse for you than real sugar .
you might be fooling your taste buds , but you 're also fooling the habit forming portion of your brain .
It 's bad psychology , and the whole premise of the No S Diet is that psychology is the most important part .
So does it officially count as an S ?
No .
But I 'd be surprised if you can eat a lot of it without reverting to genuine S. Naturally slim people do not cram themselves with diet products .
Neither should you .
Are n't you worried about fat ?
I do n't want to seem like I 'm coming down as " pro-fat " in the carbs vs. fat debate .
I think the evidence strongly suggests that too much fat is bad for you .
But I also think that much ( if not most ) of the fat people consume is in the form of snack foods ( chips , crisps , popcorn , etc. ) and sweets ( candy bars , ice cream , pop tarts , Capt'n Crunch , cake , etc. ) , which are restricted by the No S Diet ( these also tend to be the worst kinds of fat ) .
So while the No S diet does not address fat explicitly , it does so as a kind of side effect .
Fat is a more complex issue than sugar .
There are good fats and bad fats , and it's often less clear which foods are high in fat ( whereas sugar tends to jump right out at you ) .
Simplicity and clarity are important .
If you have a complicated diet that is 100 % in sync with the latest nutritional research and covers every theoretical base , it wo n't do you any good if you can't stick with it ( never mind that the latest nutritional research is a rapidly moving target ) .
Zero percent of a hundred is zero .
An eighty percent solution that you can actually stick with is infinitely preferable to that .
I also do n't think that anyone in the medical profession would suggest regularly going five straight days without any fat .
Unlike added sugar , it has some nutritional benefit ; the body does need it .
What do you mean by " snacks ? "
Snacks are " when , " not " what . "
For No S Diet purposes , anything you eat between meals is a snack .
The kind of food has nothing to do with it .
So pretzels with lunch is lunch .
Maybe not a particularly healthy lunch , but the No S Diet delegates that particular micro-decision to you .
What about healthy snacks ?
Eat healthy meals .
If you know you have just three , you 'll make them count .
I 'm perfectly aware that an orange between meals is not going kill you , that , taken in itself , it 's perfectly healthy .
But the idea is to have the orange instead of , not in addition to , and in justification of , some unhealthy part of your meal .
The problem is primarily one of self - discipline , and if you start making all kinds of exceptions , you 'll fail .
But every other diet guru tells me I SHOULD snack !
" No snacks " is the rule that people seem to have the most trouble accepting .
But I think it 's also the most important rule .
People act as if snacking is this natural thing that would be cruel to deprive themselves of .
But the truth is , historically speaking , snacking is a very recent eating behavior .
No one did it to any degree worth mentioning until very recently - when we promptly started getting fat .
According to an analysis of USDA food consumption data by David Cutler at Harvard University , 90 percent of the increase in calorie consumption in men in the United States since 1977 has come from between - meal eating .
For women , it 's 112 percent -- calories from meals have actually gone down .
( Journal of Economic Perspectives " Why have Americans Become More Obese ? " Page 101 )
So with this one rule , just two words , you 've got a 90 - plus percent solution to the problem of over - consumption .
You 'll find the same correlation when you look at the issue across societies : obesity rates move in lockstep with calories derived from snacking .
The skinny French snack on average less than once a day compared to our three .
The even skinnier Chinese barely snack at all .
The reason snackers eat so much more food is simple : it 's impossible for them to keep track of how much they 're eating without resorting to unsustainable behaviors like counting calories .
They can't eyeball excess anymore , as they could with discrete meals .
Excess sneaks right past them in lots of tiny increments , none of which seems like much in itself , but adding up , at the end of the day , to a tremendous amount .
Why is it that despite these pretty shocking statistics you almost never hear anything but pro-snack messages ?
Simple .
" Follow the money . "
You ca n't sell " no snacks . "
Snacks , on the other hand , especially the booming " healthy " snack segment , are a multibillion - dollar industry .
And the surest sign of having made it as a diet guru these days is having your name on an " energy bar " of some sort , so they 're all in on it , too .
( Lengthier anti-snack jeremiad here )
Please tell me EXACTLY every single food I can and can't eat !
No .
Sorry .
Do n't have the time for that .
And it 's really not necessary .
A " sweet " as I 've defined it above means " lots of sugar . "
If you have to wonder , it 's probably OK .
Just about every diet guru publishes a list of permitted and forbidden foods .
And they 're bestsellers .
People buy millions of copies of these lists .
I am utterly baffled by this phenomenon .
I 'm baffled because it 's so utterly hopeless an enterprise ; there are , for all practical purposes , an infinite number of foods .
I 'm baffled because the things that wind up being forbidden are often so absurd : beets , for example .
I guarantee you , no one ever got fat from eating beets .
If you see a fat person eating beets , that 's not why he 's fat .
Carrots , formerly the quintessential health food that people used to carry around in zip lock bags as a healthy snack , are now vegetable non grata .
But most of all , I 'm baffled that anyone really imagines they will play scavenger hunt at the supermarket for more than a month or two .
It shows an utter ignorance of human psychology .
And yet , as I mentioned , people buy millions of copies of these lists .
They must get something out of it .
Maybe they get an " insider information " thrill out of reading these oddball restrictions and think " whew , glad I know about beets .
That would have killed me for sure . "
What they do n't get is any thinner .
These books may be good for a thrill , but they are psychological suicide as far as losing weight is concerned .
Who is really going to run around a supermarket with a book in hand ?
For a week , maybe .
For a month , maybe .
But that 's it .
At that point they 'll feel justly overwhelmed .
But maybe that 's all they ever wanted .
It 's not the carrots , it 's the carrot cake ( etc. ) .
More to the point , it 's you eating so damn much of the carrot cake .
People refuse to look at the obvious suspects because the implications are so unflattering to themselves -- that they simply eat too much and that there is no " stab in the back " substance to blame .
The forbidden food diets pander to this suicidal vanity .
They are not just harmless ( if unmaintainable ) games .
They are dangerous distractions .
They keep you from seeing and confronting the real problem .
This is n't " murder she wrote . "
It 's not the mousy schoolmarm whom no one suspected who winds up having " dunnit . "
This is a brazen attack in broad daylight .
Take a look in the mirror .
The guilty party is staring right at you .
Still want to count carbs / calories / fat / whatever after all this ?
Save your money and look at the USDA 's nutrient data library .
Endlessly fascinating , if you have nothing better to do .
Those bestselling guru lists are just less accurate / comprehensive versions of this .
What about nutrition ?
The No S Diet is a framework for controlling excess .
Beyond that it makes no stipulations about your nutritional or gastronomic choices .
That does n't mean they 're not important , they 're just separate issues .
Fight one enemy at a time , not three at once .
That said , I find that having a limited number of limited quantity meals makes me take them more seriously , both from a gastronomic and a nutritional point of view .
Pretty much every meal I eat is delicious or healthy or both .
If you feel the need to take a systematic approach towards nutrition too , be my guest .
The No S Diet is compatible with pretty much every other diet plan I 've come across .
You can be a No - S / Vegan if you want .
You could even do No - S plus Atkins , or No - S / Zone if you want to hedge your weight loss bets ( though I think it 's becoming increasingly clear these last two examples are emphatically * not* going to help you in the nutrition department , if at all ) .
What about exercise ?
Of course you should exercise .
Diet ca n't substitute for exercise .
You need to do both .
If you 're having trouble figuring out what exercise to do , consider walking .
If you feel walking is too , well , pedestrian , get over it .
Health - wise , it 's the best long term exercise you can do , and the only consistently useful or interesting one .
If you need more color , you 'll get plenty using my homemade exercise device as a supplement .
The No S Diet is about eating in moderation .
If you can lose significant weight without exercise , you 're not eating moderately -- you 're eating immoderately little .
That 's not sustainable or good .
Do n't look at your problem as being too heavy .
Look at your problem as two behavioral problems 1 ) eating too much 2 ) moving too little .
Both of these need to be solved .
Solving just one " too much " is n't a real solution .
I know people hate to be told they ought to exercise , but I really think coming at it from these two directions makes it much easier , because you do n't have to do that much from either .
You do n't need 3 hour workouts .
Try 14 minutes .
Will this diet help me look like Kate Moss ?
No .
It will help you attain and maintain a healthy and therefore presumably attractive weight .
I 'm not sure it 's healthy to look like Kate Moss .
It wo n't help you look like Victoria Beckham , known as Posh Spice , Courtney Cox , or Calista Flockhart , either ( I just threw that in there for the search engines .
Sneaky , yes , but who knows many young lives l'm saving ) .
WARNING : one poster to the bulletin board warns that a diet like No S might be open to abuse by people with eating disorders .
Please tread carefully and consult your doctor if you think you might fall into that category .
What if I am an idiot and insist on following the letter of the law but breaking it in spirit by ( say ) eating a gallon of ice cream every S - day and counting my second cousin 's hamster 's birthday as an S - day ?
Then I can't help you .
You will be fat and die young .
Seriously , this is less of an issue than you think .
I have n't heard of anyone messing this diet up because they followed the rules during the week and overbinged on the weekends .
But I have heard from plenty of people who anticipate this being a problem , burden themselves with weekend restrictions to prevent it , and then crack during the week because it 's too much .
S - days are a necessary reward and safety valve .
As a group member succinctly put it :
S days should be S days so N days are n't .
( " N - days " are short for " non-S-days " )
What if I screw up ?
Say " I screwed up " and try not to do it again .
Do n't try to compensate for your screw up by extra deprivations -- self - revenge will only make you resentful and that much more likely to quit altogether .
This diet is n't about perfection , it 's about staying healthy .
It 's about what you do most of the time , not about achieving some kind of world 's record .
The other advantage of this attitude is that it deprives you of a very seductive excuse -- I can cheat because I can make up for it later .
The knowledge that there is no make up test , that you have only one chance to do each day right , will make you that much more serious about passing the first and only time around .
It 's a principle worth applying to other aspects of life .
Be strict before you screw up , not after , and you 'll soon find you have very few " after "s to worry about .
But I 'm genetically fat !
It 's possible , but you probably are n't .
If you 're like most overweight people , it 's no mystery why you 're fat .
You 're fat because you eat too damn much .
I do n't care whether it 's carbs or hydrogenated oils or granola bars , you just eat a lot of it .
Maybe you do n't metabolize your food quite as efficiently as your skinny neighbor , I 'll grant you that ( maybe ) , but the fact remains , you eat too much .
I do n't mean to be insulting , I used to eat too much too .
I put it this way because you 're never going to lose any weight if you pretend that there are more complex and flattering reasons for your condition .
So get this genes stuff out of your head , it 's probably an excuse .
Consider this : according to the CDC , the obesity rate in the United States has doubled since 1980 .
Rapid mutation ?
Sorry folks , evolution does n't work that fast .
If you 're still convinced that you 've been doomed by your genes , view this diet as an experiment .
If you can stick with it for 6 months and not lose a significant amount of weight , then you can plead genetics with a clear conscience .
And I suspect you 'll be at least a somewhat skinnier genetically fat person .
So why have people gotten so fat over the last 30 years ?
The faddists say , rather predictably , though with disturbingly little fellow feeling , that the current obesity epidemic is the result of the last fad ; i.e. , that we 're fat because of the low fat craze and now need a high fat craze to undo this ( any guesses what the next fad is going to claim ? ) .
Here 's my question : do you really think the decisive factor was people wolfing down fat free ( and do n't forget sugar free ) cookies with a feeling of impunity ?
Sure people did this , to an extent .
But they certainly also had plenty of super sized fatburgers to wash it all down .
At least , it does n't seem that McDonalds ( NYSE : MCD ) and Krispy Kreme ( NYSE : KKD ) were particularly poor investments during this period .
But I do n't want to say with the paranoids " it 's all the evil corporations ' fault ! "
In fact , I view both of these stances ( fad vs. fad , corporate evil ) as manifestations of the real problem : a catastrophic loss of belief in the idea of personal responsibility .
People today are not merely irresponsible : they are anti-responsible .
They view the idea that they are responsible for their condition as offensive .
It seems ridiculous to them , beneath contempt .
And it is precisely this attitude that has been doing them in on the diet front and so many others .
But I 'm a grazer !
This is a more sophisticated excuse .
Under laboratory conditions , people who eat a controlled amount of calories over the course of many small meals may metabolize them more efficiently than people who eat the same amount of calories in the traditional three .
This is the principle behind the 3 hour diet .
Where 's the rub ?
In real world conditions , people who eat more frequently than the traditional three square meals wind up just plain eating more food -- substantially more .
And despite their metabolism 's scrambling , they chunk up .
The No S Diet is n't a lab diet , biology divorced from psychology .
It 's a real world diet , built to withstand the pressures of your stubborn , sneaky mind .
Scientists who study snacking behavior " in the wild " concur .
From a 2005 article in the International Journal of Obesity :
Obese subjects were more frequent snackers than reference subjects and women were more frequent snackers than men .
Snacks were positively related to energy intake , irrespective of physical activity .
Sweet , fatty food groups were associated with snacking and contributed considerably to energy intake .
Snacking needs to be considered in obesity treatment , prevention and general dietary recommendations .
" Energy intake " makes it sound so positive -- they mean calories .
From a 2002 article in Medicina Clinica :
Snacking was positively associated with a higher probability of gaining weight among men ( OR = 1.88 ; CI 95 % , 1.40 - 2.53 ) and among women ( OR = 1.38 ; CI 95 % , 1.10 - 1.73 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest a direct association between snacking and weight gain in middle - aged people .
Indeed , discreet " snacking " is probably the wrong word for the continuous , automatic eating most of us do nowadays .
From a 2004 article in Harvard Magazine :
" The French explanation for why Americans are so big is simple , " said Jody Adams , chef / partner of Rialto , a restaurant in Harvard Square , speaking at the Oldways conference .
" We eat lots of sugar , and we eat between meals .
In France , no one gets so fat as to sue the restaurant ! "
Indeed , the national response to our glut of comestibles is apparently to eat only one meal day all day long .
We eat everywhere and at all times : at work , at play , and in transit .
Even if you are n't one of these unconscious permasnackers , but count every calorie and want to " graze " to better trick your metabolism , snacking is n't a good idea .
The problem with such grazing is that it 's impossible to get a sense of how much you are eating without paying an exorbitant amount of attention -- counting calories , points , etc .
Doing all this math is way too much conscious overhead to sustain for the long term , and it's not something you can automate into unconscious habit .
But I 'm an exception !
So is everybody else .
And even if you truly happen to be the one , it is n't useful to think this way .
Let me put it another way : chances are you 're deceiving yourself .
And on the odd chance that you are n't deceiving yourself , maybe you should be , the other direction .
People have done all kinds of remarkable things because they thought they could .
People routinely fail to do quite ordinary things because they assume they can't .
But I want an excuse , not a solution !
It sounds crazy , but a lot of people think like this .
They 'd prefer to stay fat and blame McDonalds or refined carbohydrates or hydrogenated vegetable oil or their lousy genes or anyone and anything but themselves .
I 'm not saying these things are n't factors , but they are not the decisive factor .
The decisive factor is just that : human decision .
Do n't be afraid of responsibility .
Responsibility can be liberating .
If it 's your fault , then chances are you can fix it .
If it 's not your fault , then you probably can't .
Would you really prefer that a problem be insoluble than have to work to fix it ?
And yes , thinking makes it so .
Health aside , I 'm amazed at how many people prefer to trade their sense of free will and human dignity for carte blanche to fail .
It 's like Esau selling his divine birthright for a mess of pottage , choosing to be a slave because it is easier than being free .
If you 're one of those , keep searching , this diet is n't for you .
How much less will I wind up eating ?
I have no idea .
It depends .
But one nosdieter has worked it out pretty clearly for himself ( see original post in context ) :
Here 's an illustration of what you were eating before .
I 'm an insulin dependent diabetic using an insulin pump .
For every gram of carbohydrate I eat , I infuse a set amount of insulin .
I know the amount I infused before No - S and the amount I infuse now .
Before No -S , I infused on average 45 units a day .
Now I use about 32 units a day .
that 's what ... < calculating here > about a 30 % drop ?
A 30 % drop in carbohydrate means a more than 30 % drop in total calories since the crap I ate between meals contained more fat than what I eat at meals , in general .
A 30 - 40 % caloric reduction just by cutting out between meal eating and seconds .
It 's no wonder it works .
What is the best way to determine my " ideal " weight ?
I do n't think there is much point in having an ideal weight .
Have ideal behavior -- habits of moderate eating and exertion .
Whatever you weigh then is ideal .
Are there any side effects ?
Yes .
By setting your willpower up to succeed , and succeeding a little bit every day , you will build up general purpose willpower .
It 's like doing 50 spiritual pushups every morning .
Contrast this with the effects of the repeated failures of willpower associated with mainstream yoyo dieting .
You will also start to enjoy food again , instead of merely obsessing over it .
Can I take my Sunday Thursday ? ( etc. ) .
Not officially .
Can I do a " some - S " diet ?
You can do whatever you want , I 'm not going to excommunicate you , but this is n't a good idea .
No - S is n't that hard .
Try doing it strictly for 3 weeks , that 's about how long it takes to form a habit .
You 'll be surprised .
That being said , the esses do n't depend on each other .
Each makes sense on its own , and each should be helpful on its own .
Do what 's possible and necessary for you .
Dieting in a " half - essed " manner , as a group member put it here and here , can have wholly satisfying results -- as long as you 're clear about which half ( or third ) and are no less diligent in sticking to it .
I 've often thought that gradually progressing one S at a time might be a good way to become a full no-esser , say start with no sweets for a week , then add no seconds the next week , then no snacks on week 3 ( or go even slower and give each the full magic habit - building three weeks ) .
That way you could build willpower and habit even more incrementally .
Unfortunately I 'm not aware that anyone has successfully done this [ update : it seems like someone has ( and rather successfully ! ) ] .
I think the trouble is that even full no-s is slow in terms of yielding measurable results , and lack of patience is an even bigger problem for most people than lack of short term willpower .
Fence around the Diet
There 's a Jewish expression , " Fence around the Law , " which means do n't do anything that might possibly be interpreted as giving even the appearance of violating sacred law .
It 's a principle that has its use even with profaner stuff .
When your habit is young , be as strict as you can be , comically strict even .
Only when you 're strong , when the habit is largely unconscious , can you afford stretchers like the above .
It might seem counterintuitive , but strictness makes things easier .
There is no decision to be made , no wrangling , no " can I? can't I ? " .
You 're pre-disapproved , so forget it and move on to something else .
I hope no one will consider it blasphemous that I apply this religious principle to profaner matters such as weight loss , because I think it 's based on a profound and useful psychological insight , and it's with great respect that I repurpose it here .
( more on the advantages of strictness here )
I love the No S Diet , but my doctor says I need to eat 4/5/ 6 meals a day because of my medical condition !
The No S Diet has a little known loophole just for you .
If you look closely at the site , you 'll notice that nowhere does it specify the actual * number * of meals .
Now most people will make a certain assumption , and most people had better stick with that assumption .
But if you have a medical condition that requires you to eat more often , you can still do so and be a proud No S dieter .
Just make sure to figure out what number of meals is right for you , stick with it ( no changing the magic number every day ) , and invest in some really small plates .
And talk to your doctor , of course .
As for the rest of you , pretend you never read this .
It 's for people with doctor 's notes only .
Are there any No S Diet recipes ?
No .
Have you ever eaten a meal cooked from a recipe in a diet book ?
My experience has been that they 're pretty disgusting .
Diet books tend not to be written by people who actually like to eat .
Besides , the No S Diet iet is n't about what you eat .
It 's about when you eat .
You can eat anything you want -- at the right time .
So use your normal cookbook .
It 's No S Diet approved .
Recipes do make great filler , however , which I 'm sure is why diet books are so full of them .
Gratuitous potshots at low carb diets
Low carb diets , whether Atkins or some spin off , are all the rage today .
So they deserve some extra , ahem , attention .
As a friend of mine put it " I refuse to believe that bread , the biblical staff of life , the food that sustained our ancestors for so many generations , is bad for you . "
Amen .
For those of you who are not so up on the bible , consider this : the obesity rates of France , Italy , and Japan are much lower than obesity rates in the United States .
Though I do n't have precise statistics , I 'd bet money that the majority of calories consumed in these countries come from bread , pasta , and rice ( respectively ) -- the staples for which their cuisines are famous .
And we 're not talking brown rice , or whole grain bread , or amaranth pasta .
We 're talking the very refined stuff Atkins and his fellow gurus insist is so evil .
The simple fact is that most people in the world for most of history have gotten most of their calories from carbohydrates , and most of them were skinny ( too skinny ! ) .
Percentage wise , we eat far fewer carbs than they did .
They were too poor to eat much protein or fat .
Only rich people had meat regularly .
Fat was a luxury ; you hunted for eyes of it in your soup .
What our skinny ancestors did n't eat was much sugar .
They ate at social meals , not in between .
And they were lucky if they had enough for firsts .
Sound familiar ?
I 'm not saying it 's ideal to eat a ton of refined carbohydrates .
I 'm willing to concede that brown rice is ( nutritionally ) a better default starch that white rice , and I even happen to like it ( short grain , at least ) .
But it 's not the chief issue , from a weight management perspective .
The chief issue is not to eat too damn much , of anything .
And the No S Diet helps you do that .
The American Paradox
People talk about the " French Paradox , " that the French can eat fatty , carby , delicious food and still stay skinny while health conscious , calorie counting Americans are the fattest people on earth .
It seems not only improbable , but unjust .
They love their food and stay skinny , we hate our food and get fat .
Sometimes red wine or olive oil or some other miracle ingredient is held to account for this .
But the thing is , this phenomenon is not so particularly French .
Look to any country where meals and meal times are still largely governed by tradition and you 'll find the same thing : people make their food choices based on taste instead of health and somehow stay thin .
Japan is often held up as another example .
They also have miracle foods .
But their miracle foods are completely different from the French miracle foods .
And keep in mind that obesity rates in most places are closer to those of France and Japan than to ours .
What do all these countries have in common ?
Not miracle foods .
We 're the schmucks that believe in miracle foods .
What they have in common is traditional structures around when and what and how you eat .
The details may differ a little from country to country , but there is a surprising degree of overlap .
Eating is social , not solitary .
It occurs at set times , not all day long .
There is a difference between ordinary , everyday foods and special festive treats .
Again , sound familiar ?
No S is really just an attempt to stand in for such a tradition where it has been corrupted or lost .
The title and some key ideas from this section were lifted from a New York Times Magazine Article .
What about diet bars ?
Any diet that sells a bar or a snack food is a total scam .
I 'd rather eat a snickers bar than a zone bar , because at least then I 'd be psychologically budgeting for it .
They should call it the self deception bar .
The diet bar is what separates the total scams from the mere fads .
Does it matter when I eat my meals ?
You only get a limited number , so it makes sense to space them out more or less evenly over your waking hours .
For me , that means breakfast at 7:00 , lunch at 12:30 , dinner at 7:00 .
I 'm not religious about this , but it 's usually what I do , and think it 's helpful .
You do n't want to give yourself too long a stretch of time to crave snacks , especially after dinner .
What about drinks ?
Sugar drinks , as mentioned above , are out .
If you think you 'll pop unless you get your pop , have a look at my hierarchy of pop alternatives .
I do n't count alcoholic beverages as esses .
I usually have a drink or two a day , which I 've read is supposed to be very healthy .
2 drinks is my " glass ceiling , " however , because I 've read ( and experienced ) that more than that can be pretty awful .
If you drink that or less , I do n't imagine it 'll have much impact from a caloric point of view .
If you drink much more , you may have a different sort of problem altogether .
The subject of drinks is n't to be viewed in purely negative terms .
It 's not just about avoiding liquid calories .
Drink water proactively , to ward off hunger .
Thirst is often confused with hunger , and a glass of water can be an effective snack replacement .
No , it does n't taste quite as good , but yes it can work .
What about vacation ?
This is n't much of an issue for American wage slaves like myself ; there just is n't a whole lot of damage you can do in a mere two weeks .
Citizens of more enlightened countries may want to consider it more closely .
My policy is : vacation days are like non -S days , with extra tolerance for screw ups .
There was an interesting thread about this in the discussion group .
Apparently it has worked ( rather well ) for at least one European .
Is this diet compatible with having friends / family / a social life of any kind ?
What an odd question !
But think about it .
Eating is an inherently social activity .
Even in our nuclear age , people tend not to eat alone .
So why is it no other diet plan seems to consider this obvious and important fact ?
It 's bad enough that you yourself have to eat the nasty fare prescribed by them ; there 's no way you 're going to succeed if you have to convince others to eat it too , or cook separate meals .
The No S Diet dispenses with all that .
You eat normal food , just like the people you 're eating with .
You just eat less of it .
They do n't even have to know you 're doing anything different .
No more separate meals .
No more awkward excuses at dinner parties .
No more family members secretly or not so secretly hoping you 'll get it over with and fail already so they can go back to eating normal food again .
Who needs this extra stress ?
Dieting is hard enough without having to convince other people to go along with it .
I can think of other things that start with S ...
So can I . S - days are a useful structure for many kinds of habits .
Among other things , I use it to regulate my exercise routine .
Diet - wise , people have suggested " soda " ( which is technically already a sugar S , but some people can use the extra reminder ) and " supersizes , " which no one really needs , and fast food junkies especially should watch out for .
Who are you ?
I am neither a doctor , a nurse , a dietician , a nutritionist , a personal trainer , nor any other kind of health professional .
I AM NOT AN EXPERT .
This is a tremendous advantage .
Diet is not a problem that requires specialized expertise .
It is a general problem with an obvious solution .
If I were encumbered by any form of expertise , this obviousnessness would n't be nearly as striking .
A doctor cannot convincingly say " DUH . "
I am a librarian by training and a computer programmer by accident .
I noticed I was getting a little too heavy ( borderline obese , actually , if you want to get technical ) and came up with this common sense willpower trick .
I lost 20 pounds in two months and kept them off without spending too much time suffering or even thinking about it .
People I 've explained it to have responded enthusiastically and so I thought I 'd stick it on the web .
I 've since lost an additional 20 pounds ( so total progress has been 210 to 170 ) , but to be fair , that may have something to do with the fact that I started doing some exercise .
This seems to be my natural , healthy weight .
People now describe me as " lean , " which is sweet music to a lifelong " husky . "
I 've been on the diet since late 2001 , with no yo - yoing .
Unlike most diets , that get more and more insufferable as the gimmick ages ,
No s gets progressively easier and becomes largely unconscious .
At this point I 'm about as tempted to break the rules as a devout Hindu is to eat a cow , or a Muslim a pig .
It 's a great feeling .
( relatively ) New !
Much as I 'd hoped to avoid this , it seems I have no choice .
The obligatory before and after shots can be found here
But I am way fatter than you were !
Then you probably eat way more than I did , and will benefit that much more from eating less .
What are other people saying about the No S Diet ?
Well , you can always try google .
On March 7th , 2008 , the LA Times mentioned it as one of " ten hot diets " , and Woman 's World did a cover story on the No S Diet in their April 14 2008 issue .
I 've also been interviewed a ( small ) number of times now by websites , podcasts , and radio stations .
Oliver Burkeman wrote a nice piece in the Guardian on my Everyday Systems in general ( let 's hope he 's wrong about the " Moderation does n't sell self - help books " part ) .
But the best place to look is probably the No S Diet bulletin board .
People have actually started signing up recently and it's a good place to get support .
No " Jared "s just yet , but a bunch of people have posted high double digit ( and even low triple digit ) losses .
I 've collated a bunch of success stories from the bulletin board into a testimonials page .
Since I 'm lazy about keeping this up to date , you may wish also to check out the testimonials section on the bulletin board ( aka " yearly check - in " ) , where people post their own success stories .
A bunch of No S Diet blogs have recently started sprouting up -- some with beautiful and inspiring photographs of what can be done with a single plate .
And of course , the No S Diet exists on Facebook , both as a top down blog - style facebook page , and as a more democratic discussion facebook group .
The distinction between facebook pages and groups eluded me for a while , but it bascially boils down to this : if you want an occasional , breif announcement from me , like the page , if you want to discuss no -s with others , join the group .
Or do both .
I want to start this diet NOW .
What should I do ?
Keep in mind that the first three weeks are the hardest .
At three weeks the auto pilot of habit starts to kick in .
Until then , make your portions sufficiently generous so that you are n't tempted to cheat .
Once you 've made it a few weeks without violating any of the literal rules , then you can start scaling the portions down a bit ( though you may find , as I did , that you do n't even need any conscious intervention on this score ) .
The most important part is your mind .
Once you get that lean and tough , the body will follow .
There 's nothing like a sympathetic audience to keep you motivated through those first few weeks .
I 've recently set up a daily check - in forum to facilitate this .
Less social types may wish to just slash days off a calendar .
( relatively ) New !
I 've created HabitCal , a free online habit tracker to help build good habits like No-s .
A rather surprising number of people are using it to track habits of all sorts .
For people who need a physical reminder or talisman , print out the business card and tape it to your fridge .
It may look enormous on your screen , but it prints out business card size .
Or splurge on a real refrigerator magnet .
Is it hard ?
It 's hard in a different way than most other diets .
It can seem harder at first because it does n't pretend that there is some trick to bypassing the work of building new habits - it does take willpower and patience and discipline .
But the hard part is all up front .
Once you get past this initial hump , once you 've turned the rules into unconscious habits , it gets easier and easier .
This is in stark contrast to the way other diets work .
Forbidden - foods diets , like Atkins , seem great at the outset , because you can go on being a glutton , gorging on unlimited steaks to compensate for never eating pasta or pizza or potatoes again .
But it gets old fast .
You really start to miss the forbidden foods .
And then you crack .
Counting calories is the same way .
It can be fun for a week .
Sort of a game .
But after a few months it becomes a time - consuming chore .
Every meal becomes a math assignment .
It 's almost a tossup whether you'd be more miserable sticking your diet or quitting and getting fat again .
Which brings me to another great thing about the No S Diet : it 's never really hard in the sense of being unpleasant , even at the very beginning .
It might take discipline , it might take patience , but it does n't take suffering .
In fact , you 'll enjoy food more .
The spotlight of three single - plate meals does n't just catch excess , it focuses appreciation .
And you 'll enjoy your sweets on weekends and holidays more than you ever did before .
Lastly , it 's socially unobtrusive .
People do n't have to cook you separate meals , as they would on a low - carb plan , for instance .
Most of the time , they wo n't even notice you 're on a diet , much less be inconvenienced by it .
Willpower vs. Habit
Nothing is more powerful than habit .
- Ovid
Habit is overcome by habit .
- Thomas a Kempis
Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters .
- Nathaniel Emmons
Willpower can't win against habit , it 's hopelessly outmatched .
It 's like a bare - fisted man trying to duke it out with an elephant .
But I 'm sure you know this already from personal experience , from having been on the receiving end of bad habits for so many years .
The trick is to make habit work for you , not to engage it head on or duck out of its way every time you see it coming ( as the magic pill diets would have you do ) .
Men do tame elephants , after all , and then ride on their backs , and compel them to pull ten ton logs that a dozen strong men could n't budge .
In the same way , willpower can tame habit .
And habit working for you is a remarkable thing .
Carrot and stick is the proverbial way to tame an animal .
S - day and non S - day are our carrot and stick .
As with animals , we insist on only a few clear points , so the beast does n't feel threatened and attack .
But these few points must be strictly enforced .
Give the beast some room , but stand by the lines you 've made and roar like a maniac when it tries to cross .
The firmer you are , the faster your habit will learn .
Sure this takes effort up front .
But once habit is trained , you wo n't need much will , a slight pressure of the spurs is all it takes .
Do n't believe diets that tell you you do n't need to alter your habits .
Because there is only so long you can duck that elephant .
Sooner or later it 's going to have you in a corner , and if you have n't tamed it , you 're squashed .
Thanks to Diane Sheats for the Nathanial Emmons quote .
Sometimes it takes a false start ( or 12 )
Some people , like me , get No S the first time they try it .
It works and it sticks .
But most people have a bit more trouble than that .
In fact , you might do best if you assume you 'll screw up the first time , so you do n't get too discouraged .
Consider it a reconnaissance mission , a trial run , just to feel out how hard it 's going to be and where problems are going to arise .
If the enemy , appetite , turns out to be such a chump that your reconnaissance mission routs him , great , you 've succeeded .
It might be that easy , you wo n't know until you try .
If not , you 've learned more about him , where he 's likely to ambush you .
You 're stronger , better prepared for next time .
Do n't feel stupid for trying and failing .
Success is the sum of many failures .
This is n't just pep talk .
According to a recent article I was pointed to ( thanks , Valerie ) :
Studies show that altering eating habits for good requires 10 to 12 concerted attempts to succeed - which is to say about a dozen failures come before the eventual success .
" That 's not reason to despair , " said John Norcross , professor of psychology at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania and a researcher on self - initiated change .
" If anything , it 's reason to say , ' I 'm not doing so bad . ' "
So quit dawdling and get some failures under your belt !
Need something more inspirational than another pseudostatistic ?
Try Winston Churchill : " Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm . "
The Right Level of Abstraction
Most commercial diets are too complicated for people with outside interests to follow ( " eating = math " ) .
Most conventional wisdom rules about diet are too simplistic and vague to be useful ( " only eat when you 're hungry " ) .
The No S Diet finds the happy medium between the two .
It 's simple and specific .
As a computer programmer , I 'm always looking for the right level of abstraction for the problem at hand -- the simplest way of conceptualizing a problem that will actually solve it .
For diet , I think this is it .
As a thoughtful poster to the No S Diet group put it :
It reminds me of a Buddhist proverb : " Before I studied Zen , a mountain was just a mountain ... after I began to study Zen , a mountain was no longer just a mountain , then , when I completed my studies , the mountain became a mountain again . "
All that means is , if you look at the problem of weight loss in very short terms , No - S looks like a great solution .
If you start studying it , things get confusing and it may look like No - S is n't the best solution any more .
After you 've spent a few years on the problem , you realize that No - S is a great solution , and that there are a bunch of fairly complicated things you can do to make it marginally better .
But is it worth years to figure out how to make a great solution marginally better ?
Do n't micromanage yourself
Here 's another analogy that illustrates the same point as the above :
Commercial diets are like the boss who micromanages .
It 's clear what you have to do , but you resent being dictated to in every detail , and you soon start sending around your resume .
Conventional wisdom ( " just do n't eat too much " ) is like the boss whose instructions are too vague ( " just do it " ) and refuses further clarification ( " is n't it obvious ? " ) .
The only thing that 's clear is that you are n't doing your job .
The No S Diet is like The Good Boss .
You have just enough direction to do your job , but not so much that you resent its imposition .
You have a solid framework , but the details are up to you .
You have sufficient guidance and sufficient freedom .
It 's a system without too much system .
Join the Moderation Revolution !
As another insightful poster to the group has pointed out , in an age when everything is excessive , it 's moderation that 's revolutionary .
When cereal boxes and candy bar wrappers talk about revolution , the radical thing to do is opt out .
( more on the advantages of structured moderation here )
I 've been on the diet a whole week and I 'm not skinny yet !
Do n't wig out if you do n't lose ten pounds the first day .
This is a marathon , not a sprint .
Progress is slow , but maintainable .
It 's going to take a while but it's also going to last a while -- your whole life .
Do n't sabotage your efforts with quick - fix expectations .
But I know someone who lost xxx pounds on some other diet !
Good for them .
They 're lucky .
Most people who tried that diet failed .
And hey , though I wish them the best , there 's still plenty of time left for that -- a whole lifetime .
It 's a little nightmarish to imagine spending a whole lifetime on most diets .
Think about it .
If your goal is a nightmare , how can you possibly succeed ?
If you can't even imagine it , how on earth are you going to do it ?
Why would you even want to ?
Conventional diets are n't ineffective , in an abstract , biochemical sense .
If you stick with one , you 'll probably lose weight .
They 're just really unpleasant and difficult to be on , so you almost certainly wo n't .
Occasionally someone does manage to stick it out for a few months or years .
But the vast majority do n't .
And people live inconveniently long lives for the purposes of scientific studies , so lifetime numbers are presumably sadder still .
So put your diet envy aside and go with a diet that not only works ( the easy part ) , but admits of pleasant dreams for the future .
So how long is it going to take ?
Sustainable weight loss tends to be very slow .
A crude ( but still useful ) estimate is about half a pound a week .
You 're not going to notice this staring at a scale before you go crazy , it 's going to get lost in random , meaningless fluctuations .
So do n't try -- focus on your behavior instead ( the HabitCal is a good , concrete tool to help you do this ) .
Half a pound a week might not sound like much , but adds up to quite a bit over months and years .
But you 're never going make it that far if you obsess over short term results .
A Problem worth Solving
As I mentioned in this post , most other diets are heavily optimized for short term weight loss .
It 's a much easier problem to solve than long term , and it makes for great ads ( " 20 pounds in 2 weeks , belly fat first ! " ) .
But it 's not really a problem worth solving , because when the weight comes back ( and it will ) , you 're even worse off than you were before .
The No S Diet is slow , but it 's permanent .
It 's humane enough that you can do it your whole life .
I find it enhances my enjoyment of food .
And I do n't think it 's any harder than the quickie systems .
It just requires that you face certain issues up front .
Like the fact that ultimately , diets do n't " work , " you work .
The No S Diet is a good system in that it does n't deceive you into believing otherwise .
It insists that you confront the problem of appetite head on and gives you a little structure to organize your efforts .
There 's no magic .
There 's no passive " wait and see . "
You 'll lose weight because you 'll eat less .
And you 'll know whether you 're eating less because your windows of opportunity are few and easy to monitor .
A Different Kind of Normal
I 'm not going to lie to you : the No S Diet is a diet , a bunch of rules about how you should eat .
But the idea is that the rules are simple and intuitive enough that they 'll eventually become habit , second nature .
A poster to the group put it beautifully :
A month in , I do n't think I 'm on a diet anymore .
I 'm just eating normally , but it 's a different normally than a month ago .
There 's nothing left to stick to ; eating because I 'm bored is unsatisfying now , going for seconds leaves me feeling uncomfortably full , and sweets that are n't * treats * are nowhere near as satisfying as they used to be .
In the interests of full disclosure , I should point out that not every successful nosdieter feels this way .
For some , it remains an active effort , but they still find it satisfying and worth it .
Consider the following post :
I personally am not like Reinhard says , I want candy , every day , I wanna go into the fridge at work , and grab one of those snickers that are in there ... but , if I start walking towards it , I just tell myself , " no you do n't need that . " and turn around .
That also is a great feeling .
The No $ Diet
As you may have noticed , this site is free .
But that 's the least of it .
Far more significant is that the No S Diet does n't require you to buy any pricey diet products or exotic foods .
You buy the same food you used to buy , just less of it -- what a novel concept !
You laugh , but this can really add up .
The diet gurus are laughing all the way to the bank .
You know what they say , " give away the razor , make money on the razor blades . "
A study in Forbes magazine showed that most popular diets cost hundreds of extra dollars a month .
All of the diets reviewed cost more than the status quo of mere overeating .
This is a little absurd when you consider that the goal is ( or ought to be ) to eat less .
On the No S Diet you eat less , you buy less , and you save money .
It feels a little strange for me to have to point this out , but considering the competition , I guess I do .
This diet actually works !
How can I repay you ?
You can 't !
At least , not directly .
I used to have a tongue in cheek paypal donation link here ( the idea was you send me a Merchant of Venice inspired dollar per pound of flesh lost ) , but as I was subsequently informed :
Google policy does not permit the advertisement of websites that contain " the solicitation of funds and do not display tax - exempt status " .
Translation : my adwords competitors complained and this was the only excuse they could come up with .
I 'm flattered !
Who would have thought a little gnat site running out of a basement could get the attention of multi million dollar competitors ?
I must really be onto something .
Now let 's just hope google policy does not forbid the mention of google policy ...
What you still can do is :
Mention this site to people you know , and link to it if you have a website .
A full web server log file is riches enough for me .
Buy anything from amazon.com through this link , I get a tiny cut , and you do n't pay anything extra .
Ca n't think of anything ?
Here are some ideas :
Buy No S Diet promotional products through our Cafepress Store .
C'mon , you know you want one of those refrigerator magnets .
( relatively ) New !
Buy the No S Diet Book ( and then write a nice review ) .
This is the best way you can thank me .
Because if enough people buy the book , I might get the chance to write another one .
And , incidentally , it 's not a bad book .
People who like the site seem to like the book even more .
Can I buy No S Diet branded merchandise such as refrigerator magnets , buttons , coffee mugs , and business cards , lunchboxes , etc. with the entire diet ( all 14 words ) printed on them ?
( relatively ) New !
Yes !
Thanks to the generous and inspired work of Diane Sheats , the No S Diet cafepress store is now open for business .
I think you 'll agree Diane has come up with a very elegant ( and in retrospect obvious , which is always a good sign ) design which we 've splashed across a variety of delightful and indispensable knick - knacks .
More knick - knacks pending .
Comments and suggestions welcome .
The items I 've ordered myself ( mug , button , magnet ) all look good , but the refrigerator magnet is particularly nice ( and appropriate , given the issues most of us presumably have with that appliance ) .
And you just try pouring a double mocha latte with whipped cream into a No S coffee mug .
Now if only cafepress would let me do plates ...
I 've also got a business card , which you are welcome to print out and distribute , if you can figure out how .
Why should I bookmark this page and visit it again , and again , and again ?
Because it changes frequently .
I tweak it obsessively .
Add it to the litany of sites you check every day to distract you from your job .
This is a terrific idea !
Mind if I steal it ?
I do , strangely enough .
I 'm giving this thing away for free and would prefer to at least get credit for it .
So please lay off Nosdiet TM , NoSDiet TM , Nos Diet TM , Nos-Diet TM , No's Diet TM , No Es Diet TM , No S Diet TM , S - Days TM , and No Esses Diet TM ( you get the idea ) .
New !
Notice the little ® after the " No S Diet " at the top of the page .
Having been thoroughly terrified by my lawyer friends , I 've actually gone through the trouble and expense to officially register this thing .
I do n't use it everywhere because that would be incredibly obnoxious and unnecessary .

This is my whirlwind languages tour — the one I was going to write for the Amazon Developers Journal this month , but could n't find a way to do it that was ... presentable .
For one thing , I lapse occasionally into coarseness and profanity here , so it was n't appropriate for an official - ish Amazon publication .
Instead , I 'm stuffing it into my blog , which nobody reads .
Except for you .
Yep , just you .
Hiya .
For another , it 's really a work in progress , just a few snippets here and there , not polished at all .
Another great reason to make it a blog entry .
Does n't have to be good , or complete .
It 's just what I 've got today .
Enjoy !
My whirlwind tour will cover C , C++ , Lisp , Java , Perl , ( all languages we use at Amazon ) , Ruby ( which I just plain like ) , and Python , which is in there because — well , no sense getting ahead of ourselves , now .
C
You just have to know C. Why ?
Because for all practical purposes , every computer in the world you 'll ever use is a von Neumann machine , and C is a lightweight , expressive syntax for the von Neumann machine 's capabilities .
The von Neumann architecture is the standard computer architecture you use every day : a CPU , RAM , a disk , a bus .
Multi-CPU does n't really change it that much .
The von Neumann machine is a convenient , cost - effective , 1950s realization of a Turing Machine , which is a famous abstract model for performing computations .
There are other kinds of machines too .
For instance , there are Lisp Machines , which are convenient 1950s realizations of Lisp , a programming language notation based on the lambda calculus , which is another model for performing computations .
Unlike Turing machines , the lambda calculus can be read and written by humans .
But the two models are equivalent in power .
They both model precisely what computers are capable of .
Lisp Machines are n't very common though , except at garage sales .
von Neumann machines won the popularity race .
There are various other kinds of computers , such as convenient realizations of neural networks or cellular automata , but they 're nowhere as popular either , at least not yet .
So you have to know C .
You also have to know C because it's the language that Unix is written in , and happens also to be the language that Windows and virtually all other operating systems are written in , because they 're OSes for von Neumann machines , so what else would you use ?
Anything significantly different from C is going to be too far removed from the actual capabilities of the hardware to perform well enough , at least for an OS — at least in the last century , which is when they were all written .
You should also know Lisp .
You do n't have to use it for real work , although it comes in quite handy for lots of GNU applications .
In particular , you should learn Scheme , which is a small , pure dialect of Lisp .
The GNU version is called Guile .
They teach Scheme at MIT and Berkeley to new students for a semester or two , and the students have absolutely no clue as to why they 're learning this weird language .
It 's a lousy first language , to be honest , and probably a lousy second one too .
You should learn it , eventually , and not as your first or second language .
It 's hard , though .
It 's a big jump .
It 's not sufficient to learn how to write C - like programs in Lisp .
That 's pointless .
C and Lisp stand at opposite ends of the spectrum ; they 're each great at what the other one sucks at .
The Little Schemer
If C is the closest language to modeling how computers work , Lisp is the closest to modeling how computation works .
You do n't need to know a lot of Lisp , really .
Stick with Scheme , since it's the simplest and cleanest .
Other Lisps have grown into big , complex programming environments , just like C++ and Java have , with libraries and tools and stuff .
That , you do n't need to know .
But you should be able to write programs in Scheme .
If you can make your way through all the exercises inand The Seasoned Schemer , you 'll know enough , I think .
But you choose a language for day - to - day programming based on its libraries , documentation , tools support , OS integration , resources , and a host of other things that have very little to do with how computers work , and a whole lot to do with how people work .
People still write stuff in straight C. Lots of stuff .
You should know it !
C++ is the dumbest language on earth , in the very real sense of being the least sentient .
It does n't know about itself .
It is not introspective .
Neither is C , but C is n't " Object - Oriented " , and object orientation is in no small measure about making your programs know about themselves .
Objects are actors .
So OO languages need to have runtime reflection and typing .
C++ does n't , not really , not that you 'd ever use .
As for C : it 's so easy to write a C compiler that you can build tools on top of C that act like introspection .
C++ , on the other hand , is essentially un-parseable , so if you want to write smart tools that can , for example , tell you the signatures of your virtual functions , or refactor your code for you , you 're stuck using someone else 's toolset , since you sure as heck are n't gonna parse it .
And all the toolsets for parsing C++ out there just plain suck .
C++ is dumb , and you can't write smart systems in a dumb language .
Languages shape the world .
Dumb languages make for dumb worlds .
All of computing is based on abstractions .
You build higher - level things on lower - level ones .
You do n't try to build a city out of molecules .
Trying to use too low - level an abstraction gets you into trouble .
We are in trouble .
The biggest thing you can reasonably write in C is an operating system , and they 're not very big , not really .
They look big because of all their apps , but kernels are small .
The biggest thing you can write in C++ is ... also an operating system .
Well , maybe a little bigger .
Let 's say three times bigger .
Or even ten times .
But operating system kernels are at most , what , maybe a million lines of code ?
So I 'd argue the biggest system you can reasonably write in C++ is maybe 10 million lines , and then it starts to break down and become this emergent thing that you have no hope of controlling , like the plant in Little Shop of Horrors .
Feeeeeed meeeeeee ...
If you can get it to compile by then , that is .
We have 50 million lines of C++ code .
No , it 's more than that now .
I do n't know what it is anymore .
It was 50 million last Christmas , nine months ago , and was expanding at 8 million lines a quarter .
The expansion rate was increasing as well .
Ouch .
Stuff takes forever to do around here .
An Amazon engineer once described our code base as " a huge mountain of poop , the biggest mountain you 've ever seen , and your job is to crawl into the very center of it , every time you need to fix something . "
That was four years ago , folks .
That engineer has moved on to greener pastures .
Too bad ; he was really good .
It 's all C++'s fault .
Do n't argue .
It is .
We 're using the dumbest language in the world .
That 's kind of meta - dumb , do n't you think ?
With that said , it is obviously possible to write nice C++ code , by which I mean , code that 's mostly C , with some C++ features mixed in tastefully and minimally .
But it almost never happens .
C++ is a vast playground , and makes you feel smart when you know all of it , so you 're always tempted to use all of it .
But that 's really , really hard to do well , because it 's such a crap language to begin with .
In the end , you just make a mess , even if you 're good .
I know , this is Heresy , with a capital -' H ' .
Whatever .
I loved C++ in college , because it 's all I knew .
When I heard that my languages prof , Craig Chambers , absolutely detested C++ , I thought : " Why ?
I like it just fine . "
And when I heard that the inventor of STL was on record as saying he hated OOP , I thought he was cracked .
How could anyone hate OOP , especially the inventor of STL ?
Familiarity breeds contempt in most cases , but not with computer languages .
You have to become an expert with a better language before you can start to have contempt for the one you 're most familiar with .
So if you do n't like what I 'm saying about about C++ , go become an expert at a better language ( I recommend Lisp ) , and then you 'll be armed to disagree with me .
You wo n't , though .
I 'll have tricked you .
You wo n't like C++ anymore , and you might be irked that I tricked you into disliking your ex-favorite language .
So maybe you 'd better just forget about all this .
C++ is great .
Really .
It 's just ducky .
Forget what I said about it .
It 's fine .
Lisp
( I'm betting this next section will astonish you , even if you 've been here a while . )
When Amazon got its start , we had brilliant engineers .
I did n't know all of them , but I knew some of them .
Examples ?
Shel Kaphan .
Brilliant .
Greg Linden .
Brilliant .
Eric Benson .
Independently famous in his own right , before he ever even came to Amazon .
Also brilliant .
They wrote the Obidos webserver .
Obidos made Amazon successful .
It was only later that poop - making engineers and web devs , frontend folks mostly — schedule - driven people who could make their managers happy by delivering crap fast — it was only later that these people made Obidos bad .
Clogged the river , so to speak .
But Obidos was a key cornerstone of Amazon 's initial success .
The original brilliant guys and gals here only allowed two languages in Amazon 's hallowed source repository : C and Lisp .
Go figure .
They all used Emacs , of course .
Hell , Eric Benson was one of the authors of XEmacs1 .
All of the greatest engineers in the world use Emacs .
The world - changer types .
Not the great gal in the cube next to you .
Not Fred , the amazing guy down the hall .
I 'm talking about the greatest software developers of our profession , the ones who changed the face of the industry .
The James Goslings , the Donald Knuths , the Paul Grahams2 , the Jamie Zawinskis , the Eric Bensons .
Real engineers use Emacs .
You have to be way smart to use it well , and it makes you incredibly powerful if you can master it .
Go look over Paul Nordstrom 's shoulder while he works sometime , if you do n't believe me .
It 's a real eye - opener for someone who 's used Visual Blub .
NET - like IDEs their whole career .
Emacs is the 100 - year editor .
Shel , Eric , Greg , and others like them that I was n't fortunate enough to work with directly : they did n't allow C++ here , and they did n't allow Perl .
( Or Java , for that matter ) .
They knew better .
Now C++ , Java and Perl are all we write in .
The elders have moved on to greener pastures too .
Shel wrote Mailman in C , and Customer Service wrapped it in Lisp .
Emacs - Lisp .
You do n't know what Mailman is .
Not unless you 're a longtime Amazon employee , probably non-technical , and you 've had to make our customers happy .
Not indirectly , because some bullshit feature you wrote broke ( because it was in C++ ) and pissed off our customers , so you had to go and fix it to restore happiness .
No , I mean directly ; i.e. , you had to talk to them .
Our lovely , illiterate , eloquent , well - meaning , hopeful , confused , helpful , angry , happy customers , the real ones , the ones buying stuff from us , our customers .
Then you know Mailman .
Mailman was the Customer Service customer - email processing application for ... four , five years ?
A long time , anyway .
It was written in Emacs .
Everyone loved it .
People still love it .
To this very day , I still have to listen to long stories from our non-technical folks about how much they miss Mailman .
I 'm not shitting you .
Last Christmas
I was at an Amazon party , some party I have no idea how I got invited to , filled with business people , all of them much prettier and more charming than me and the folks I work with here in the Furnace , the Boiler Room of Amazon .
Four young women found out I was in Customer Service , cornered me , and talked for fifteen minutes about how much they missed Mailman and Emacs , and how Arizona ( the JSP replacement we 'd spent years developing ) still just was n't doing it for them .
It was truly surreal .
I think they may have spiked the eggnog .
Shel 's a genius .
Emacs is a genius .
Even non-technical people love Emacs .
I 'm typing in Emacs right now .
I 'd never voluntarily type anywhere else .
It 's more than just a productivity boost from having great typing shortcuts and text - editing features found nowhere else on the planet .
I type 130 to 140 WPM , error - free , in Emacs , when I 'm doing free - form text .
I 've timed it , with a typing - test Emacs application I wrote .
But it 's more than that .
Emacs has the Quality Without a Name .
We retired Mailman .
That 's because we have the Quality With a Name — namely , Suckiness .
We suck .
We could n't find anyone who was good enough at Emacs - Lisp to make it work .
Nowadays it would be easy ; Amazon 's filled up with Emacs Lisp hackers , but back then , CS Apps could n't get the time of day from anyone , so they did what they could with what they had , and there were n't enough Emacs - Lisp folks .
For a while , they even had Bob Glickstein on contract , the guy who wrote the O'Reilly " giraffe " book Writing Gnu Emacs Extensions , sitting there writing Gnu Emacs Extensions for Mailman in this little office in the Securities building .
CS Apps was Amazon 's first 2 - pizza team , you know .
They 're completely autonomous — then and now .
Nobody talks to them , nobody helps them , they build everything themselves .
They do n't have web devs , they do n't have support engineers , they do n't have squat , except for rock - solid engineers and a mentoring culture .
And that 's all they 've ever needed .
But they had to retire Mailman .
Alas .
Alackaday .
And I still get to hear about how much people miss it .
At parties , even .
I think there may still be more Lisp hackers , per capita , in CS Apps than in any other group at Amazon .
Not that they get to use it much , but as Eric Raymond said , even if you do n't program in it much , learning Lisp will be a profound experience that will make you a better engineer for the rest of your life .
Religion is n't the opiate of the masses anymore , Karl .
IDEs are .
Java
Java is simultaneously the best and the worst thing that has happened to computing in the past 10 years .
On the one hand , Java frees you up from many mundane and error - prone details of C++ coding .
No more bounds errors , no more core dumps .
Exceptions thrown point you to the exact line of code that erred , and are right 99 % of the time .
Objects print themselves intelligently on demand .
Etc. , etc .
On the other hand , in addition to being a language , a virtual machine , a huge set of class libraries , a security model , and a portable bytecode format , Java is a religion .
So you can't trust anyone who loves it too much .
It 's a tricky business to hire good Java programmers .
But Java really has been a big step forward for software engineering in general .
Going from C++ to Java is n't just changing syntax .
It 's a shocking paradigm shift that takes a while to sink in .
It 's like suddenly getting your own Executive Assistant .
You know how VPs always seem to have all this time to be in meetings , and know how the company 's running , and write cool documents , and stuff like that ?
VPs tend to forget that they 're actually TWO full - time people : their self and their EA .
Having an EA frees you up to think about the problems you need to solve ; not having one forces you to spend half your time on mundane tasks .
Switching to Java turns you into two programmers — one taking care of all this stuff that you no longer have to think much about , and another one focused on the problem domain .
It 's a staggering difference , and one you can get used to in a real hurry .
As Jamie Zawinski said in his famous " java sucks " article : " First the good stuff : Java does n't have free ( ) .
I have to admit right off that , after that , all else is gravy .
That one point makes me able to forgive just about anything else , no matter how egregious .
Given this one point , everything else in this document fades nearly into insignificance . "
Jamie 's article was written in 1997 , which in Java years is a long time ago , and Java has improved a lot since he wrote it ; some of the things he complains about are even fixed now .
Most of them are n't .
Java does still kind of suck , as a language .
But as Jamie points out , it 's " the best language going today , which is to say , it 's the marginally acceptable one among the set of complete bagbiting loser languages that we have to work with out here in the real world . "
Really , you should read it .
Java is truly wonderful along almost every dimension except for the language itself , which is mostly what JWZ was griping about .
But that 's a lot to gripe about .
Libraries can only get you so far if your language sucks .
Trust me : you may know many , many things better than I do , but I know that libraries can't really save a sucky language .
Five years of assembly - language hell at Geoworks taught me that .
Compared to C++ , Java as a language is about even .
Well , scratch that , it 's a lot better , because it has strings , oh man , how can you use a language with lousy string support .
But Java 's missing some nice features from C++ , such as pass - by - reference ( - to - stack - object ) , typedefs , macros , and operator overloading .
Stuff that comes in handy now and again .
Oh , and multiple inheritance , which now I 've come to appreciate in my old age .
If you think my Opinionated Elf was a good counterpoint to polymorphism dogma , I 've got several brilliant examples of why you need multiple inheritance , or at least Ruby - style mixins or automatic delegation .
Ask me about the Glowing Sword or Cloak of Thieving sometime .
Interfaces suck .
Gosling even said , a few years ago , that if he had to do it all over again , he would n't have used interfaces .
But that 's just exactly what the problem with Java is .
When James said that , people were shocked .
I could feel the shock waves , could feel the marketing and legal folks at Sun maneuvering to hush him up , brush it off , say it was n't so .
The problem with Java is that people are blinded by the marketing hype .
That 's the problem with C++ , with Perl , with any language that 's popular , and it's a serious one , because languages can't become popular without hype .
So if the language designer suggests innocently that the language might not have been designed perfectly , it 's time to shoot the language designer full of horse tranquilizers and shut down the conference .
Languages need hype to survive ; I just wish people did n't have to be blinded by it .
I drank the OOP Kool - Aid , I regurgitated the hype myself .
When I started at Amazon , I could recite for you all the incantations , psalms , and voodoo chants that I 'd learned , all in lieu of intelligence or experience , the ones that told me Multiple Inheritance is Evil ' cuz Everyone Says So , and Operator Overloading Is Evil , and so on .
I even vaguely sort of knew why , but not really .
Since then I 've come to realize that it's not MI that sucks , it 's developers who suck .
I sucked , and I still do , although hopefully less every year .
I had an interview candidate last week tell me that MI is Evil because , for instance , you could make a Human class that multiply - inherits from Head , Arm , Leg , and Torso .
He was both right and wrong .
That MI situation was evil , sure , but it was all him .
Stupid from a distance , evil if he'd made it in through the front door .
Bad developers , who constitute the majority of all developers worldwide , can write bad code in any language you throw at them .
That said , though , MI is no picnic ; mixins seem to be a better solution , but nobody has solved the problem perfectly yet .
But I 'll still take Java over C++ , even without MI , because I know that no matter how good my intentions are , I will at some point be surrounded by people who do n't know how to code , and they will do far less damage with Java than with C ++.
Besides , there 's way more to Java than the core language .
And even the language is evolving , albeit glacially , so there 's hope .
It 's what we should be using at Amazon .
You just have to be careful , because as with any other language , you can easily find people who know a lot about the language environment , and very little about taste , computing , or anything else that 's important .
When in doubt , hire Java programmers who are polyglots , who detest large spongy frameworks like J2EE and EJB , and who use Emacs .
All good rules of thumb .
Perl
Perl .
Where to start ?
Perl is an old friend .
Perl and I go way back .
I started writing Perl stuff in maybe 1995 , and it 's served me well for nearly a decade .
It 's like that old bicycle you 've put 100 k or 200 k miles on , and you 'll always have a warm fuzzy spot for it , even though you 've since moved on to a more modern bike that weighs 5 lbs and does n't make your ass hurt so much .
Perl is popular for three reasons :
You can get stuff done really fast in Perl , which is what really matters , in the end .
Perl has the best marketing in the world .
You could write a book about how brilliant their marketing is .
Sun has marketed Java with money , and Perl is almost keeping up , popularity - wise , purely on the on sheer marketing brilliance of Larry Wall and his buddies .
Folks at Harvard Business School should study Perl 's marketing .
It 's astonishing .
Until roughly , oh , now , it had no real competitors .
There are " better " languages than Perl — hell , there are lots of them , if you define " better " as " not being insane " .
Lisp , Smalltalk , Python , gosh , I could probably name 20 or 30 languages that are " better " than Perl , inasmuch as they do n't look like that Sperm Whale that exploded in the streets of Taiwan over the summer .
Whale guts everywhere , covering cars , motorcycles , pedestrians .
That 's Perl .
It 's charming , really .
But Perl has many , many things going for it that , until recently , no other language had , and they compensated for its exo-intestinal qualities .
You can make all sorts of useful things out of exploded whale , including perfume .
It 's quite useful .
And so is Perl .
While all those other languages ( Lisp and Smalltalk being particularly noteworthy offenders ) tried to pretend that operating systems do n't exist , and that lists ( for Lisp ) or objects ( for Smalltalk ) are the be-all , end - all of getting shit done , Perl did exactly the opposite .
Larry said : Unix and string processing are the be-all , end - all of getting shit done .
And for many tasks , he was absolutely right .
So Perl is better at Unix integration and string processing than any language on the planet , save one , and that one only arrived on the scene recently , from the land of Godzilla .
I 'll get to that one later .
Sadly , Larry focused sooooo hard on Unix integration and string processing that he totally forgot about lists and objects until it was far too late to implement them properly .
In fact , a few key mistakes he made early on in Perl 's ... well , I hesitate to use the word " design " for whale guts , but let 's call it Perl 's " lifecycle " — those mistakes made it so hard to do lists and objects correctly that Perl has evolved into a genuine Rube Goldberg machine , at least if you want to use lists or objects .
Lists and objects are pretty farging important too , Larry !
Perl can't do lists because Larry made the tragically stupid decision early on to flatten them automatically .
So ( 1 , 2 , ( 3 , 4 ) ) magically becomes ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) .
Not that you ever want it to work this way .
But Larry happened to be working on some problem for which it was convenient on that particular day , and Perl 's data structures have been pure exploded whale ever since .
Now you can't read a book or tutorial or PowerPoint on Perl without spending at least a third of your time learning about " references " , which are Larry 's pathetic , broken , Goldbergian fix for his list - flattening insanity .
But Perl 's marketing is so incredibly good that it makes you feel as if references are the best thing that ever happened to you .
You can take a reference to anything !
It 's fun !
Smells good , too !
Perl can't do objects because Larry never reeeeally believed in them .
Maybe that 's OK ; I 'm still not quite sure if I believe in them either .
But then why did he try adding them ?
Perl 's OO is a halfhearted add - on that never caught on with the Perl community .
It 's just not as inspired as the string - processing or Unix integration stuff .
And of course , Perl has plenty of other crackpot design features .
Take its " contexts " , for instance , which are a horrid outgrowth of Larry 's comical decision to have N variable namespaces , dereferenced by sigils , which he sort of copied from shell - script .
In Perl , every operator , every function , every operation in the language behaves randomly in one of six different ways , depending on the current " context " .
There are no rules or heuristics governing how a particular operation will behave in a given context .
You just have to commit it all to memory .
Need an example ?
Here 's one : accessing a hash in a scalar context gives you a string containing a fraction whose numerator is the number of allocated keys , and the denominator is the number of buckets .
Whale guts , I 'm telling you .
Like I said , though — until recently , nothing could get the job done like Perl could .
Ruby
Every 15 years or so , languages are replaced with better ones .
C was replaced by C++ , at least for large - scale application development by people who needed performance but desperately wanted data types too .
C++ is being replaced by Java , and Java will doubtless be replaced with something better in seven years — well , seven years after it finishes replacing C++ , which evidently has n't fully happened yet , mostly because Microsoft was able to stall it before it became ubiquitous on the desktop .
But for server - side applications , C++ is basically on its way out .
Perl will be gone soon , too .
That 's because a new language called Ruby has finally been translated into English .
Yep , it was invented in Japan , of all places — everyone else was as surprised as you are , since Japan 's known for its hardware and manufacturing , but not for its software development .
Why , is anyone 's guess , but I 'm thinking it 's the whole typing thing ; I just can't imagine they were able to type fast enough before , what with having an alphabet with ten thousand characters in it .
But Emacs got multibyte support a few years ago , so I can imagine they 're pretty dang fast with it now .
( And yes , they use Emacs — in fact Japanese folks did the majority of the Mule [ multibyte ] support for Emacs , and it 's rock - solid . )
Anyway , Ruby stole everything good from Perl ; in fact , Matz , Ruby 's author ( Yukihiro Matsumoto , if I recall correctly , but he goes by " Matz " ) , feels he may have stolen a little too much from Perl , and got some whale guts on his shoes .
But only a little .
For the most part , Ruby took Perl 's string processing and Unix integration as - is , meaning the syntax is identical , and so right there , before anything else happens , you already have the Best of Perl .
And that 's a great start , especially if you do n't take the Rest of Perl .
But then Matz took the best of list processing from Lisp , and the best of OO from Smalltalk and other languages , and the best of iterators from CLU , and pretty much the best of everything from everyone .
And he somehow made it all work together so well that you do n't even notice that it has all that stuff .
I learned Ruby faster than any other language , out of maybe 30 or 40 total ; it took me about 3 days before I was more comfortable using Ruby than I was in Perl , after eight years of Perl hacking .
It 's so consistent that you start being able to guess how things will work , and you 're right most of the time .
It 's beautiful .
And fun .
And practical .
If languages are bicycles , then Awk is a pink kiddie bike with a white basket and streamers coming off the handlebars , Perl is a beach cruiser ( remember how cool they were ?
Gosh . ) and Ruby is a $ 7,500 titanium mountain bike .
The leap from Perl to Ruby is as significant as the leap from C++ to Java , but without any of the downsides , because Ruby 's essentially a proper superset of Perl 's functionality , whereas Java took some things away that people missed , and did n't offer real replacements for them .
I 'll write more about Ruby sometime .
I need to be inspired first .
Read Why the Lucky Stiff 's ( poignant ) guide to Ruby .
That is an inspired piece of work .
Really .
Read it .
It 's amazing .
I do n't understand the kind of mind that could produce it , but it 's funny , and poignant , and all about Ruby .
Sort of .
You 'll see .
Python
Well gosh , what about Python , a nice language that has patiently been waiting in the wings for all these years ?
The Python community has long been the refuge for folks who finally took the red pill and woke up from the Perl Matrix .
Well , they 're just like the Smalltalk folks , who waited forever to replace C++ , and then Java came along and screwed them royally , and permanently .
Oops .
Ruby 's doing exactly that to Python , right now , today .
Practically overnight .
Python would have taken over the world , but it has two fatal flaws : the whitespace thing , and the permafrost thing .
The whitespace thing is simply that Python uses indentation to determine block nesting .
It forces you to indent everything a certain way , and they do this so that everyone 's code will look the same .
A surprising number of programmers hate this , because it feels to them like their freedom is being taken away ; it feels as if Python is trampling their constitutional right to use shotgun formatting and obfuscated one - liners .
3
Python 's author , Guido Van Rossum , also made some boneheaded technical blunders early on — none quite as extravagant as Larry 's blunders , but a few were real doozies nonetheless .
For instance , Python originally had no lexical scoping .
But it did n't have dynamic scoping either , and dynamic scoping may have its share of problems , but it at least sort of works .
Python had NOTHING except for global and local ( function ) scope , so even though it had a " real " OO system , classes could n't even access their own damned instance variables .
You have to pass a " self " parameter to EVERY instance method and then get to your instance data by accessing it through self .
So everything in Python is self , selfself , selfselfself , selfSELFselfSELF__SELF__ , and it drives you frigging nuts , even if you do n't mind the whitespace thing .
Etc .
But in my opinion , it 's really the frost thing that killed Python , and has prevented it from ever achieving its wish to be the premier scripting language , or the premier anything language , for that matter .
Heck , people still use
Tcl as an embedded interpreter , even though Python is far superior to Tcl in every conceivable way — except , that is , for the frost thing .
What 's the frost thing , you ask ?
Well , I used to have a lot of exceptionally mean stuff written here , but since Python 's actually quite pleasant to work with ( if you can overlook its warts ) , I no longer think it 's such a great idea to bash on Pythonistas .
The " frost thing " is just that they used to have a tendency to be a bit , well , frosty .
Why ?
Because they were so tired of hearing about the whitespace thing !
I think that 's why Python never reached Perl 's level of popularity , but maybe I 'm just imagining things .
Coda
That was the ADJ article I really wanted to write .
Or at least something like it .
For some reason , though , my true feelings only seem to come out during insomniac attacks between 3 am and 6 am .
Time for bed !
2 hours ' til my next meeting .
( Published September 2004 .
Minor updates on 3/28/2006 )
Notes
1 Eric tells me it was actually almost all Jamie Zawinski , when they worked at Lucid together .
2 It 's been pointed out many times since I wrote this that Paul Graham actually uses vi .
Go figure !
3 For the record , I personally do n't mind the whitespace thing at all .
I think it 's silly to dislike Python for that reason .
What I 'm saying is that a surprising percentage of * other * programmers hate it .
Courage is in short supply in Washington , D.C.
The realities of the Iraq
War cry out for the overthrow of a government that is criminally responsible for death , mutilation , torture , humiliation , chaos .
But all we hear in the nation ’s capital , which is the source of those catastrophes , is a whimper from the Democratic Party , muttering and nattering about “ unity ” and “ bipartisanship , ” in a situation that calls for bold action to immediately reverse the present course .
These are the Democrats who were brought to power in November by an electorate fed up with the war , furious at the Bush Administration , and counting on the new majority in Congress to represent the voters .
But if sanity is to be restored in our national policies , it can only come about by a great popular upheaval , pushing both Republicans and Democrats into compliance with the national will .
The Declaration of Independence , revered as a document but ignored as a guide to action , needs to be read from pulpits and podiums , on street corners and community radio stations throughout the nation .
Its words , forgotten for over two centuries , need to become a call to action for the first time since it was read aloud to crowds in the early excited days of the American Revolution : “ Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and institute new government . ”
The “ ends ” referred to in the Declaration are the equal right of all to “ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ”
True , no government in the history of the nation has been faithful to those ends .
Favors for the rich , neglect of the poor , massive violence in the interest of continental and world expansion — that is the persistent record of our government .
Still , there seems to be a special viciousness that accompanies the current assault on human rights , in this country and in the world .
We have had repressive governments before , but none has legislated the end of habeas corpus , nor openly supported torture , nor declared the possibility of war without end .
No government has so casually ignored the will of the people , affirmed the right of the President to ignore the Constitution , even to set aside laws passed by Congress .
The time is right , then , for a national campaign calling for the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Representative John Conyers , who held extensive hearings and introduced an impeachment resolution when the Republicans controlled Congress , is now head of the House Judiciary Committee and in a position to fight for such a resolution .
He has apparently been silenced by his Democratic colleagues who throw out as nuggets of wisdom the usual political palaver about “ realism ” ( while ignoring the realities staring them in the face ) and politics being “ the art of the possible ” ( while setting limits on what is possible ) .
I know I ’m not the first to talk about impeachment .
Indeed , judging by the public opinion polls , there are millions of Americans , indeed a majority of those polled , who declare themselves in favor if it is shown that the President lied us into war ( a fact that is not debatable ) .
There are at least a half - dozen books out on impeachment , and it ’s been argued for eloquently by some of our finest journalists , John Nichols and Lewis Lapham among them .
Indeed , an actual “ indictment ” has been drawn up by a former federal prosecutor , Elizabeth de la Vega , in a new book called United States v. George W. Bush et al , making a case , in devastating detail , to a fictional grand jury .
There is a logical next step in this development of an impeachment movement : the convening of “ people ’s impeachment hearings ” all over the country .
This is especially important given the timidity of the Democratic Party .
Such hearings would bypass Congress , which is not representing the will of the people , and would constitute an inspiring example of grassroots democracy .
These hearings would be the contemporary equivalents of the unofficial gatherings that marked the resistance to the British Crown in the years leading up to the American Revolution .
The story of the American Revolution is usually built around Lexington and Concord , around the battles and the Founding Fathers .
What is forgotten is that the American colonists , unable to count on redress of their grievances from the official bodies of government , took matters into their own hands , even before the first battles of the Revolutionary War .
In 1772 , town meetings in Massachusetts began setting up Committees of Correspondence , and the following year , such a committee was set up in Virginia .
The first Continental Congress , beginning to meet in 1774 , was a recognition that an extralegal body was necessary to represent the interests of the people .
In 1774 and 1775 , all through the colonies , parallel institutions were set up outside the official governmental bodies .
Throughout the nation ’s history , the failure of government to deliver justice has led to the establishment of grassroots organizations , often ad hoc , dissolving after their purpose was fulfilled .
For instance , after passage of the Fugitive Slave Act , knowing that the national government could not be counted on to repeal the act , black and white anti-slavery groups organized to nullify the law by acts of civil disobedience .
They held meetings , made plans , and set about rescuing escaped slaves who were in danger of being returned to their masters .
In the desperate economic conditions of 1933 and 1934 , before the Roosevelt Administration was doing anything to help people in distress , local groups were formed all over the country to demand government action .
Unemployed Councils came into being , tenants ’ groups fought evictions , and hundreds of thousands of people in the country formed self - help organizations to exchange goods and services and enable people to survive .
More recently , we recall the peace groups of the 1980s , which sprang up in hundreds of communities all over the country , and provoked city councils and state legislatures to pass resolutions in favor of a freeze on nuclear weapons .
And local organizations have succeeded in getting more than 400 city councils to take a stand against the Patriot Act .
Impeachment hearings all over the country could excite and energize the peace movement .
They would make headlines , and could push reluctant members of Congress in both parties to do what the Constitution provides for and what the present circumstances demand : the impeachment and removal from office of George Bush and Dick Cheney .
Simply raising the issue in hundreds of communities and Congressional districts would have a healthy effect , and would be a sign that democracy , despite all attempts to destroy it in this era of war , is still alive .
XHTMLでCDATA区間を使う。以上。
経緯 HTML4のscriptタグでJavaScriptをちょろっと書く時、中にHTMLタグがあるとダメという話が発端である。例えば、以下のようなのがダメだ。 < script type =" text / javascript " > document.write ( '< p > < a href= " http://www.hikoboshi.org ">hikoboshi.org</a></p>' ) ; </ script > ちなみに、ブラウザで動かせば多分動く。（試してないけど。）じゃあ何がダメかというと、HTMLの仕様的に。ちなみにこういう書き方をすると、多分HTML4でもXHTML1でもダメだと思われ。
そんな話をきっかけに、いろいろ調べた。
何故ダメか まずはHTML4のDTDを調べる。（別にstrictを選ばなくても良いんだけどとりあえず。）
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd <!
ELEMENT SCRIPT - - % Script ; -- script statements --> % Scriptを追っかける。 <!ENTITY % Script " CDATA " -- script expression --> つーわけで、scriptタグの中はCDATAだ。CDATAって何なのかというとこれ。
Although the STYLE and SCRIPT elements use CDATA for their data model , for these elements , CDATA must be handled differently by user agents .
Markup and entities must be treated as raw text and passed to the application as is .
要はただのテキストってことである。タグとかの記号を書いても（つまり<とか"
とかを実体参照を用いずに使っても）そのものとして認識される。
だが、そうしてただの、何の制約もないテキストにすると、scriptタグの終わりが認識できないということになる。それを避けるためにCDATAの終わりが設定されていて、ここではETAGO（</）となっている。
The first occurrence of the character sequence " </ " ( end -tag open delimiter ) is treated as terminating the end of the element 's content .
In valid documents , this would be the end tag for the element .
で。さっきのを見直してみる。 < script type =" text / javascript " > document.write ( '< p > < a href= " http://www.hikoboshi.org ">hikoboshi.org</a></p>' ) ; </ script > CDATAの終わりは『oshi.org</a』ここの</だ。これはscriptの終了でなければならなくて、エラーとなる。 というわけで、scriptタグの中のJavaScriptに、HTMLタグ（正確には閉じタグ）を書くことが出来ない。よく、JavaScriptでいろいろ書くときは別ファイルにして…みたいな話があるけれど、こういう理由があった。
とはいえ、たった一行これを書くだけに1ファイル？とも思う。何か良い方法はないものか。
XHTMLも調べた あまり期待していなかったが、XHTMLなら（ちょっと設計が新しいから）何か良い手だてがあるかも？と思い、調べてみた。 同様にDTDとドキュメント。 http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd <!ELEMENT script ( # PCDATA ) >
In XHTML , the script and style elements are declared as having # PCDATA content .
As a result , < and & will be treated as the start of markup , and entities such as < and & will be recognized as entity references by the XML processor to < and & respectively .
Wrapping the content of the script or style element within a CDATA marked section avoids the expansion of these entities .
script要素の内容が#PCDATAになっているので、中のタグとかがきちんと解釈される。（ETAGO以外は）何を書いても良かったHTML4に比べると一見不親切になったように見えるけれど、そうではない。自分でCDATA区間を指定すれば良い。 < script type =" text / javascript " > <![ CDATA [ document.write ('< p >< a href= " http://www.hikoboshi.org ">hikoboshi.org</a></p>' ) ; ] ]> </ script > この場合、区間の終わりは ]
]>で指定されるので、</でうっかり終わったりしない。まぁ、逆に ]
]>は書けないのだけれど、</よりは出会う可能性は低い。
CDATA区間を明示するのが面倒な場面も往々にしてありそうだけれど、どちらかと言うとXHTMLの方が穴がない。きちんと進化しているのだなぁと思う。

Bad Agile in More Detail
Good Agile Should Drop the Name
When I was growing up , cholesterol used to be bad for you .
It was easy to remember .
Fat , bad .
Cholesterol bad .
Salt , bad .
Everything , bad .
Nowadays , though , they differentiate between " good " cholesterol and " bad " cholesterol , as if we 're supposed to be able to distinguish them somehow .
And it was weird when they switched it up on us , because it was as if the FDA had suddenly issued a press release announcing that there are , in fact , two kinds of rat poison : Good Rat Poison and Bad Rat Poison , and you should eat a lot of the Good kind , and none of the Bad kind , and definitely not mix them up or anything .
Up until maybe a year ago , I had a pretty one - dimensional view of so - called " Agile " programming , namely that it 's an idiotic fad - diet of a marketing scam making the rounds as yet another technological virus implanting itself in naive programmers who 've never read " No Silver Bullet " , the kinds of programmers who buy extended warranties and self - help books and believe their bosses genuinely care about them as people , the kinds of programmers who attend conferences to make friends and who do n't know how to avoid eye contact with leaflet - waving fanatics in airports and who believe writing shit on index cards will suddenly make software development easier .
You know .
Chumps .
That 's the word I 'm looking for .
My bad - cholesterol view was that Agile Methodologies are for chumps .
But I 've had a lot of opportunity to observe various flavors of Agile - ism in action lately , and I now think I was only about 90 % right .
It turns out there 's a good kind of Agile , although it 's taken me a long time to be able to see it clearly amidst all the hype and kowtowing and moaning feverishly about scrums and whatnot .
I have a pretty clear picture of it now .
And you can attend my seminar on it for the low , low price of $ 499.95 !
Hahaha , chump !
No , just kidding .
You 'll only find seminars about the Bad kind of Agile .
And if in the future you ever find me touring around as an Agile Consultant , charging audiences to hear my deep wisdom and insight about Agile Development , you have my permission to cut my balls off .
If I say I was just kidding , say I told you I 'd say that .
If I then say I'm Tyler Durden and I order you not to cut my balls off , say I definitely said I was going to say that , and then you cut 'em right off .
I 'll just go right ahead and tell you about the Good Kind , free of charge .
It 's kinda hard to talk about Good Agile and Bad Agile in isolation , so I might talk about them together .
But I 'll be sure to label the Good kind with a happy rat , and the Bad kind with a sad dead rat , so you 'll always know the difference .
Back in Ye Olden Dayes , most companies approached software development as follows :- hire a bunch of engineers , then hire more .- dream up a project .- set a date for when they want it launched .- put some engineers on it .- whip them until they 're either dead or it 's launched .
or both .- throw a cheap - ass pathetic little party , maybe .
This step is optional .- then start over .
Thank goodness that does n't happen at your company , eh now ?
Whew !
Interestingly , this is also exactly how non-technical companies ( like , say , Chrysler ) handled software development .
Except they did n't hire the engineers .
Instead , they contracted with software consultants , and they'd hand the consultants 2 - year project specs , and demanded the consultants finish everything on time plus all the crap the customer threw in and / or changed after signing the contract .
And then it'd all fall apart and the contractors would n't get paid , and everyone was really miffed .
So some of the consultants began to think : " Hey , if these companies insist on acting like infants , then we should treat them like infants ! "
And so they did .
When a company said " we want features A through Z " , the consultants would get these big index cards and write " A " on the first one , " B " on the second one , etc. , along with time estimates , and then post them on their wall .
Then when the customer wanted to add something , the consultant could point at the wall and say : " OK , boy .
Which one of these cards do you want to replace , BOY ?
" Is it any wonder Chrysler canceled the project
So the consultants , now having lost their primary customer , were at a bar one day , and one of them ( named L. Ron Hubbard ) said : " This nickel - a - line - of - code gig is lame .
You know where the real money is at ?
You start your own religion . "
And that 's how both Extreme Programming and Scientology were born .
Well , people pretty quickly demonstrated that XP was a load of crap .
Take Pair Programming , for instance .
It 's one of the more spectacular failures of XP .
None of the Agileytes likes to talk about it much , but let 's face it : nobody does it .
The rationale was something like : " well if ONE programmer sitting at a terminal is good , then TEN must be better , because MORE is ALWAYS better !
But most terminals can only comfortably fit TWO programmers , so we 'll call it PAIR programming !
" You have to cut them a little slack ; they 'd been dealing with the corporate equivalent of pre-schoolers for years , and that really messes with a person .
But the thing is , viruses are really hard to kill , especially the meme kind .
After everyone had gotten all worked up about this whole Agile thing ( and sure , everyone wants to be more productive ) , there was a lot of face to be lost by admitting failure .
So some other kinds of Agile " Methodologies " sprang up , and they all claimed that even though all the other ones were busted , their method worked !
I mean , go look at some of their sites .
Tell me that 's not an infomercial .
C'mon , just try .
It 's embarrassing even to look at the thing .
Yeah .
Well , they make money hand over fist , because of P.T. Barnum 's Law , just like Scientology does .
Ca n't really fault 'em .
Some people are just dying to be parted with their cash .
And their dignity .
The rest of us have all known that Agile Methodologies are stupid , by application of any of the following well - known laws of marketing :- anything that calls itself a " Methodology " is stupid , on general principle .- anything that requires " evangelists " and offers seminars , exists soley for the purpose of making money .- anything that never mentions any competition or alternatives is dubiously self - serving .- anything that does diagrams with hand - wavy math is stupid , on general principle .
And by " stupid " , I mean it 's " incredibly brilliant marketing targeted at stupid people .
" In any case , the consultants kept going with their road shows and glossy pamphlets .
Initially , I 'm sure they went after corporations ; they were looking to sign flexible contracts that allowed them to deliver " whatever " in " 2 weeks " on a recurring basis until the client went bankrupt .
But I 'm equally sure they could n't find many clients dumb enough to sign such a contract .
That 's when the consultants decided to take their road show to YOU .
Why not take it inside the companies and sell it there , to the developers ?
There are plenty of companies who use the whip - cycle of development I outlined above , so presumably some of the middle managers and tech leads would be amenable to hearing about how there 's this low - cost way out of their hellish existence .
And that , friends , was exactly , precisely the point at which they went from " harmless buffoons " to " potentially dangerous " , because before they were just bilking fat companies too stupid to develop their own software , but now the manager down the hall from me might get infected .
And most places do n't have a very good quarantine mechanism for this rather awkward situation : i.e. , an otherwise smart manager has become " ill " , and is waving XP books and index cards and spouting stuff about how much more productive his team is on account of all this newfound extra bureaucracy .
How do we know it 's not more productive ?
Well , it 's a slippery problem .
Observe that it must be a slippery problem , or it all would have been debunked fair and square by now .
But it 's exceptionally difficult to measure software developer productivity , for all sorts of famous reasons .
And it 's even harder to perform anything resembling a valid scientific experiment in software development .
You can't have the same team do the same project twice ; a bunch of stuff changes the second time around .
You can't have 2 teams do the same project ; it 's too hard to control all the variables , and it 's prohibitively expensive to try it in any case .
The same team doing 2 different projects in a row is n't an experiment either .
About the best you can do is gather statistical data across a lot of teams doing a lot of projects , and try to identify similarities , and perform some regressions , and hope you find some meaningful correlations .
But where does the data come from ?
Companies are n't going to give you their internal data , if they even keep that kind of thing around .
Most do n't ; they cover up their schedule failures and they move on , ever optimistic .
Well if you can't do experiments and you can't do proofs , there is n't much science going on .
That 's why it 's a slippery problem .
It 's why fad diets are still enormously popular .
People want fad diets to work , oh boy you bet they do , even I want them to work .
And you can point to all these statistically meaningless anecdotes about how Joe lost 35 pounds on this one diet , and all those people who desperately want to be thinner will think " hey , it ca n't hurt .
I 'll give it a try .
" That iswhat I hear people say , every time a team talks themselves into trying an Agile Methodology .
It 's not a coincidence .
But writing about Bad Agile alone is almost guaranteed to be ineffective .
I mean , you can write about how lame Scientology is , or how lame fad diets are , but it 's not clear that you 're changing anyone 's mind .
Quitting a viral meme is harder than quitting smoking .
I 've done both .
In order to have the right impact , you have to offer an alternative , and I did n't have one before , not one that I could articulate clearly .
One of the ( many ) problems with Bad Agile is that they condescendingly lump all non-Agile development practices together into two buckets : Waterfall and Cowboy .
Waterfall is known to be bad ; I hope we can just take that as an axiom today .
But what about so - called Cowboy programming , which the Agileers define as " each member of the team does what he or she thinks is best " ?
Is it true that this is the only other development process ?
And is Cowboy Programming actually bad ?
They say it as if it 's obviously bad , but they 're not super clear on how or why , other than to assert that it 's , you know , " chaos " .
Well , as I mentioned , over the past year I 've had the opportunity to watch both Bad Agile and Good Agile in motion , and I 've asked the teams and tech leads ( using both the Bad and Good forms ) lots of questions : how they 're doing , how they 're feeling , how their process is working .
I was really curious , in part because I 'd consented to try Agile last Christmas ( " hey , it ca n't hurt " ) , and wound up arguing with a teammate over exactly what metadata is allowed on index cards before giving up in disgust .
Also in part because I had some friends on a team who were getting kind of exhausted from what appeared to be a Death March , and that kind of thing does n't seem to happen very often at Google .
So I dug in , and for a year , I watched and learned . ( cue happy rat ) I 'm going to talk a little about Google 's software development process .
It 's not the whole picture , of course , but it should suffice for today .
I 've been there for almost a year and a half now , and it took a while , but I think I get it now .
Mostly .
I 'm still learning .
But I 'll share what I 've got so far .
From a high level , Google 's process probably does look like chaos to someone from a more traditional software development company .
As a newcomer , some of the things that leap out at you include :- there are managers , sort of , but most of them code at least half - time , making them more like tech leads .- developers can switch teams and / or projects any time they want , no questions asked ; just say the word and the movers will show up the next day to put you in your new office with your new team . -
Google has a philosophy of not ever telling developers what to work on , and they take it pretty seriously .- developers are strongly encouraged to spend 20 % of their time ( and I mean their M - F , 8 - 5 time , not weekends or personal time ) working on whatever they want , as long as it's not their main project .- there are n't very many meetings .
I 'd say an average developer attends perhaps 3 meetings a week , including their 1:1 with their lead .- it 's quiet .
Engineers are quietly focused on their work , as individuals or sometimes in little groups or 2 to 5 .- there are n't Gantt charts or date - task - owner spreadsheets or any other visible project - management artifacts in evidence , not that I 've ever seen .- even during the relatively rare crunch periods , people still go get lunch and dinner , which are ( famously ) always free and tasty , and they do n't work insane hours unless they want to .
These are generalizations , sure .
Old - timers will no doubt have a slightly different view , just as my view of Amazon is slightly biased by having been there in 1998 when it was a pretty crazy place .
But I think most Googlers would agree that my generalizations here are pretty accurate .
How could this ever work ?
I get that question a lot .
Heck , I asked it myself .
What 's to stop engineers from leaving all the trouble projects , leaving behind bug - ridden operational nightmares ?
What keeps engineers working towards the corporate goals if they can work on whatever they want ?
How do the most important projects get staffed appropriately ?
How do engineers not get so fat that they routinely get stuck in stairwells and have to be cut out by the Fire Department ?
I 'll answer the latter question briefly , then get to the others .
In short : we have this thing called the Noogler Fifteen , named after the Frosh Fifteen : the 15 pounds that many college freshmen put on when they arrive in the land of Stress and Pizza .
Google has solved the problem by lubricating the stairwells .
As to the rest of your questions , I think most of them have the same small number of answers .
First , and arguably most importantly , Google drives behavior through incentives .
Engineers working on important projects are , on average , rewarded more than those on less - important projects .
You can choose to work on a far - fetched research -y kind of project that may never be practical to anyone , but the work will have to be a reward unto itself .
If it turns out you were right and everyone else was wrong ( the startup 's dream ) , and your little project turns out to be tremendously impactful , then you 'll be rewarded for it .
Guaranteed .
The rewards and incentives are too numerous to talk about here , but the financial incentives range from gift certificates and massage coupons up through giant bonuses and stock grants , where I wo n't define " giant " precisely , but think of Google 's scale and let your imagination run a bit wild , and you probably wo n't miss the mark by much .
There are other incentives .
One is that Google a peer - review oriented culture , and earning the respect of your peers means a lot there .
More than it does at other places , I think .
This is in part because it 's just the way the culture works ; it 's something that was put in place early on and has managed to become habitual .
It 's also true because your peers are so damn smart that earning their respect is a huge deal .
And it 's true because your actual performance review is almost entirely based on your peer reviews , so it has an indirect financial impact on you .
Another incentive is that every quarter , without fail , they have a long all - hands in which they show every single project that launched to everyone , and put up the names and faces of the teams ( always small ) who launched each one , and everyone applauds .
Gives me a tingle just to think about it .
Google takes launching very seriously , and I think that being recognized for launching something cool might be the strongest incentive across the company .
At least it feels that way to me .
And there are still other incentives ; the list goes on and ON and ; the perks are over the top , and the rewards are over the top , and everything there is so comically over the top that you have no choice , as an outsider , but to assume that everything the recruiter is telling you is a baldfaced lie , because there 's no possible way a company could be that generous to all of its employees , all of them , I mean even the contractors who clean the micro- kitchens , they get these totally awesome " Google Micro - Kitchen Staff " shirts and fleeces .
There is nothing like it on the face of this earth .
I could talk for hours , days about how amazing it is to work at Google , and I would n't be done .
And they 're not done either .
Every week it seems like there 's a new perk , a new benefit , a new improvement , a new survey asking us all if there 's any possible way in which life at Google could be better .
I might have been mistaken , actually .
Having your name and picture up on that big screen at End of Quarter may not be the biggest incentive .
The thing that drives the right behavior at Google , more than anything else , more than all the other things combined , is gratitude .
You can't help but want to do your absolute best for Google ; you feel like you owe it to them for taking such incredibly good care of you .
OK , incentives .
You 've got the idea .
Sort of .
I mean , you have a sketch of it .
When friends who are n't at Google ask me how it is working at Google — and this applies to all my friends at all other companies equally , not just companies I 've worked at — I feel just how you 'd feel if you 'd just gotten out of prison , and your prison buddies , all of whom were sentenced in their early teens , are writing to you and asking you what it 's like " on the outside " .
I mean , what would you tell them ?
I tell 'em it 's not too bad at all .
Ca n't complain .
Pretty decent , all in all .
Although the incentive - based culture is a huge factor in making things work the way they do , it only addresses how to get engineers to work on the " right " things .
It does n't address how to get those things done efficiently and effectively .
So I 'll tell you a little about how they approach projects .
The basic idea behind project management is that you drive a project to completion .
It 's an overt process , a shepherding : by dint of leadership , and organization , and sheer force of will , you cause something to happen that would n't otherwise have happened on its own .
Project management comes in many flavors , from lightweight to heavyweight , but all flavors share the property that they are external forces acting on an organization .
At Google , projects launch because it's the least - energy state for the system .
Before I go on , I 'll concede that this is a pretty bold claim , and that it 's not entirely true .
We do have project managers and product managers and people managers and tech leads and so on .
But the amount of energy they need to add to the system is far less than what 's typically needed in our industry .
It 's more of an occasional nudge than a full - fledged continuous push .
Once in a while , a team needs a bigger nudge , and senior management needs to come in and do the nudging , just like anywhere else .
But there 's no pushing .
Incidentally , Google is a polite company , so there 's no yelling , nor wailing and gnashing of teeth , nor escalation and finger - pointing , nor any of the artifacts produced at companies where senior management yells a lot .
Hobbes tells us that organizations reflect their leaders ; we all know that .
The folks up top at Google are polite , hence so is everyone else .
Anyway , I claimed that launching projects is the natural state that Google 's internal ecosystem tends towards , and it's because they pump so much energy into pointing people in that direction .
All your needs are taken care of so that you can focus , and as I 've described , there are lots of incentives for focusing on things that Google likes .
So launches become an emergent property of the system .
This eliminates the need for a bunch of standard project management ideas and methods : all the ones concerned with dealing with slackers , calling bluffs on estimates , forcing people to come to consensus on shared design issues , and so on .
You do n't need " war team meetings , " and you do n't need status reports .
You do n't need them because people are already incented to do the right things and to work together well .
The project management techniques that Google does use are more like oil than fuel : things to let the project keep running smoothly , as opposed to things that force the project to move forward .
There are plenty of meeting rooms , and there 's plenty of open space for people to go chat .
Teams are always situated close together in fishbowl - style open seating , so that pair programming happens exactly when it 's needed ( say 5 % of the time ) , and never otherwise .
Google generally recognizes that the middle of the day is prone to interruptions , even at quiet companies , so many engineers are likely to shift their hours and come in very early or stay very late in order to find time to truly concentrate on programming .
So meetings only happen in the middle of the day ; it 's very unusual to see a meeting start before 10 am or after 4:30 pm .
Scheduling meetings outside that band necessarily eats into the time when engineers are actually trying to implement the things they 're meeting about , so they do n't do it .
Google is n't the only place where projects are run this way .
Two other kinds of organizations leap to mind when you think of Google 's approach : startup companies , and grad schools .
Google can be considered a fusion of the startup and grad - school mentalities : on the one hand , it 's a hurry - up , let 's get something out now , do the simplest thing that could work and we 'll grow it later startup - style approach .
On the other , it 's relatively relaxed and low - key ; we have hard problems to solve that nobody else has ever solved , but it 's a marathon not a sprint , and focusing requires deep concentration , not frenzied meetings .
And at the intersection of the two , startups and grad schools are both fertile innovation ground in which the participants carry a great deal of individual responsibility for the outcome .
It 's all been done before ; the only thing that 's really surprising is that Google has managed to make it scale .
The scaling is not an accident .
Google works really hard on the problem , and they realize that having scaled this far is no guarantee it'll continue , so they 're vigilant .
That 's a good word for it .
They 're always on the lookout to make sure the way of life and the overall level of productivity continue ( or even improve ) as they grow .
Google is an exceptionally disciplined company , from a software - engineering perspective .
They take things like unit testing , design documents and code reviews more seriously than any other company I 've even heard about .
They work hard to keep their house in order at all times , and there are strict rules and guidelines in place that prevent engineers and teams from doing things their own way .
The result : the whole code base looks the same , so switching teams and sharing code are both far easier than they are at other places .
And engineers need great tools , of course , so Google hires great people to build their tools , and they encourage engineers ( using incentives ) to pitch in on tools work whenever they have an inclination in that direction .
The result : Google has great tools , world - class tools , and they just keep getting better .
The list goes on .
I could talk for days about the amazing rigor behind Google 's approach to software engineering .
But the main takeaway is that their scaling ( both technological and organizational ) is not an accident .
And once you 're up to speed on the Google way of doing things , it all proceeds fairly effortlessly — again , on average , and compared to software development at many other companies .
We 're almost done .
The last thing I want to talk about here is dates .
Traditional software development can safely be called Date - Oriented Programming , almost without exception .
Startup companies have a clock set by their investors and their budget .
Big clients set target dates for their consultants .
Sales people and product managers set target dates based on their evaluation of market conditions .
Engineers set dates based on estimates of previous work that seems similar .
All estimation is done through rose - colored glasses , and everyone forgets just how painful it was the last time around .
Everyone picks dates out of the air .
" This feels like it should take about 3 weeks . "
" It sure would be nice to have this available for customers by beginning of Q4 . "
" Let 's try to have that done by tomorrow .
" Most of us in our industry are date - driven .
There 's always a next milestone , always a deadline , always some date - driven goal to it .
The only exceptions I can think of to this rule are : 1 ) Open - source software projects .
2 ) Grad school projects .
3 ) Google .
Most people take it for granted that you want to pick a date .
Even my favorite book on software project management , " The Mythical Man-Month " , assumes that you need schedule estimates .
If you 're in the habit of pre-announcing your software , then the general public usually wants a timeframe , which implies a date .
This is , I think , one of the reasons Google tends not to pre-announce .
They really do understand that you can't rush good cooking , you can't rush babies out , and you can't rush software development .
If the three exceptions I listed above are n't driven by dates , then what drives them ?
To some extent it 's just the creative urge , the desire to produce things ; all good engineers have it .
( There are many people in our industry who do this gig " for a living " , and they go home and do n't think about it until the next day .
Open source software exists precisely because there are people who are better than that . )
But let 's be careful : it 's not just the creative urge ; that 's not always directed enough , and it 's not always incentive enough .
Google is unquestionably driven by time , in the sense that they want things done " as fast as possible " .
They have many fierce , brilliant competitors , and they have to slake their thirsty investors ' need for growth , and each of us has some long - term plans and deliverables we'd like to see come to fruition in our lifetimes .
The difference is that Google is n't foolish enough or presumptuous enough to claim to know how long stuff should take .
So the only company - wide dates I 'm ever aware of are the ends of each quarter , because everyone 's scrambling to get on that big launch screen and get the applause and gifts and bonuses and team trips and all the other good that comes of launching things with big impact at Google .
Everything in between is just a continuum of days , in which everyone works at optimal productivity , which is different for each person .
We all have work - life balance choices to make , and Google is a place where any reasonable choice you make can be accommodated , and can be rewarding .
Optimal productivity is also a function of training , and Google offers tons of it , including dozens of tech talks every week by internal and external speakers , all of which are archived permanently so you can view them whenever you like .
Google gives you access to any resources you need in order to get your job done , or to learn how to get your job done .
And optimal productivity is partly a function of the machine and context in which you 're operating : the quality of your code base , your tools , your documentation , your computing platform , your teammates , even the quality of the time you have during the day , which should be food - filled and largely free of interrupts .
Then all you need is a work queue .
That 's it .
You want hand - wavy math ?
I 've got it in abundance : software development modeled on queuing theory .
Not too far off the mark , though ; many folks in our industry have noticed that organizational models are a lot like software models .
With nothing more than a work queue ( a priority queue , of course ) , you immediately attain most of the supposedly magical benefits of Agile Methodologies .
And make no mistake , it 's better to have it in software than on a bunch of index cards .
If you 're not convinced , then I will steal your index cards .
With a priority queue , you have a dumping - ground for any and all ideas ( and bugs ) that people suggest as the project unfolds .
No engineer is ever idle , unless the queue is empty , which by definition means the project has launched .
Tasks can be suspended and resumed simply by putting them back in the queue with appropriate notes or documentation .
You always know how much work is left , and if you like , you can make time estimates based on the remaining tasks .
You can examine closed work items to infer anything from bug regression rates to ( if you like ) individual productivity .
You can see which tasks are often passed over , which can help you discover root causes of pain in the organization .
A work queue is completely transparent , so there is minimal risk of accidental duplication of work .
And so on .
The list goes on , and on , and on .
Unfortunately , a work queue does n't make for a good marketing platform for seminars and conferences .
It 's not glamorous .
It sounds a lot like a pile of work , because that 's exactly what it is .
I 've outlined , at a very high level , one company 's approach to software development that is neither an Agile Methodology , nor a Waterfall cycle , nor yet Cowboy Programming .
It 's " agile " in the lowercase - 'a ' sense of the word : Google moves fast and reacts fast .
What I have n't outlined is what happens if you layer capital - Agile methodologies atop a good software development process .
You might be tempted to think : " well , it ca n't hurt ! "
I even had a brief fling with it myself last year .
The short answer is : it hurts .
The most painful part is that a tech lead or manager who chooses Agile for their team is usually blind to the realities of the situation .
Bad Agile hurts teams in several ways .
First , Bad Agile focuses on dates in the worst possible way : short cycles , quick deliverables , frequent estimates and re-estimates .
The cycles can be anywhere from a month ( which is probably tolerable ) down to a day in the worst cases .
It 's a nicely idealistic view of the world .
In the real world , every single participant on a project is , as it turns out , a human being .
We have up days and down days .
Some days you have so much energy you feel you could code for 18 hours straight .
Some days you have a ton of energy , but you just do n't feel like focusing on coding .
Some days you 're just exhausted .
Everyone has a biological clock and a a biorhythm that they have very little control over , and it 's likely to be phase - shifted from the team clock , if the team clock is ticking in days or half - weeks .
Not to mention your personal clock : the events happening outside your work life that occasionally demand your attention during work hours .
None of that matters in Bad Agile .
If you 're feeling up the day after a big deliverable , you 're not going to code like crazy ; you 're going to pace yourself because you need to make sure you have reserve energy for the next big sprint .
This impedance mismatch drives great engineers to mediocrity .
There 's also your extracurricular clock : the set of things you want to accomplish in addition to your main project : often important cleanups or other things that will ultimately improve your whole team 's productivity .
Bad Agile is exceptionally bad at handling this , and usually winds up reserving large blocks of time after big milestones for everyone to catch up on their side - project time , whether they 're feeling creative or not .
Bad Agile folks keep their eye on the goal , which hurts innovation .
Sure , they 'll reserve time for everyone to clean up their own code base , but they 're not going to be so altruistic as to help anyone else in the company .
How can you , when you 're effectively operating in a permanent day - for - day slip ?
Bad Agile seems for some reason to be embraced by early risers .
I think there 's some mystical relationship between the personality traits of " wakes up before dawn " , " likes static typing but not type inference " , " is organized to the point of being anal " , " likes team meetings " , and " likes Bad Agile " .
I 'm not quite sure what it is , but I see it a lot .
Most engineers are not early risers .
I know a team that has to come in for an 8:00 am meeting at least once ( maybe several times ) a week .
Then they sit like zombies in front of their email until lunch .
Then they go home and take a nap .
Then they come in at night and work , but they 're bleary - eyed and look perpetually exhausted .
When I talk to them , they 're usually cheery enough , but they usually do n't finish their sentences .
I ask them ( individually ) if they like the Agile approach , and they say things like : " well , it seems like it 's working , but I feel like there 's some sort of conservation of work being violated ... " , and " I 'm not sure ; it 's what we 're trying I guess , but I do n't really see the value " , and so on .
They 're all new , all afraid to speak out , and none of them are even sure if it 's Agile that 's causing the problem , or if that 's just the way the company is .
That , my friends , is not " agile " ; it 's a just load of hooey .
And it's what you get whenever any manager anywhere decides to be a chump .
I would caution you to be skeptical of two kinds of claims :- " all the good stuff he described is really Agile " - " all the bad stuff he described is the fault of the team 's execution of the process " You 'll hear them time and again .
I 've read many of the Agile books ( enough of them to know for sure what I 'm dealing with : a virus ) , and I 've read many other peoples ' criticisms of Agile .
Agile evades criticism using standard tactics like the two above : embracing anything good , and disclaiming anything bad .
If a process is potentially good , but 90 + % of the time smart and well - intentioned people screw it up , then it 's a bad process .
So they can only say it 's the team 's fault so many times before it 's not really the team 's fault .
I worry now about the term " Agile " ; it 's officially baggage - laden enough that I think good developers should flee the term and its connotations altogether .
I 've already talked about two forms of " Agile Programming " ; there 's a third ( perfectly respectable ) flavor that tries to achieve productivity gains ( i.e. " Agility " ) through technology .
Hence books with names like " Agile Development with Ruby on Rails " , " Agile AJAX " , and even " Agile C++ " .
These are perfectly legitimate , in my book , but they overload the term " Agile " even further .
And frankly , most Agile out there is plain old Bad Agile .
So if I were you , I 'd take Agile off your resume .
I 'd quietly close the SCRUM and XP books and lock them away .
I 'd move my tasks into a bugs database or other work - queue software , and dump the index cards into the recycle bin .
I 'd work as fast as I can to eliminate Agile from my organization .
And then I 'd focus on being agile .
But that 's just my take on it , and it 's 4:00 am .
Feel free to draw your own conclusions .
Either way , I do n't think I 'm going to be an Early Riser tomorrow .
Oh , I almost forgot the obvious disclaimer : I do not speak for Google .
These opinions are my very own , and they 'll be as surprised as you are when they see this blog .
Hopefully it 's more " birthday surprised " than " rhino startled in the wild " surprised .
We 'll see !
Passengers aboard the plane managed to phone out on mobiles
First reports suggested there were two hijackers , protesting against the Pope , but the one man now in custody is a Turkish army deserter seeking asylum .
Italian police are checking reports that he may have had an accomplice .
All the plane 's 107 passengers - including beauty contest entrants - and six crew are said to be unhurt .
We saw a man wearing track - suit bottoms and a hat go to the cockpit door and pause there , thinking

Passenger , speaking by mobile phone from plane
Greek , then Italian fighters , were scrambled to intercept and escort the airliner after reports of the incident emerged while it was in Greek air space at 1758 ( 1458 GMT ) .
Two Italian F - 16s reportedly forced the plane to land in Brindisi where the hijacker , named as Hakan Ekinci , surrendered after negotiations with police .
Initial reports suggested that two hijackers had wanted to deliver a message to Pope Benedict , angry at his recent comments in a lecture in Germany which appeared to link Islam and violence .
The pontiff is due to visit Turkey in November .
Army deserter
Hakan Ekinci is a conscientious objector who had run away to Albania during military service in the Turkish army , the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports .
Hakan Ekinci faced arrest in Istanbul
He was seeking political asylum there , saying he had converted to Christianity eight years ago and could no longer be forced to serve in a Muslim army .
He charted his efforts to gain asylum in letters to a well - known Turkish pacifist group on the internet .
According to his most recent letter posted last month , he believed his application for asylum had been refused and he was about to be forced to return home .
There is another letter from the same Hakan Ekinci on the Internet - this one an address to Pope Benedict , our correspondent adds .
In it the soldier pleads with the Pope for help with his asylum claim as a Christian .
Again he says he has been forced to join the army against his will and claims he was imprisoned and ill - treated for refusing .
The Turkish foreign ministry confirmed for the BBC that the hijacker , who is 28 , was on the run from the army .
Separately , Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said that Mr Ekinci had faced arrest and transfer to the military authorities on arrival in Istanbul .
Mr Guler added that Mr Ekinci may bluffed the airliner 's pilot into believing he had at least one accomplice on the plane ,
' Track - suit man '
Ergun Ozkeseoglu , a passenger who phoned Turkish NTV television from the plane , said the hijacker had waved and apologised to applauding passengers as he left the plane .
Miss India is among four beauty queens on the plane
He had seen no weapons but had noticed a passenger repeatedly entering the cockpit and " and giving orders to the stewards " .
One Albanian passenger told Albanian TV that nobody had been informed of the hijacking .
Ermir Hoxha , a journalist who was also aboard , described one of the suspected hijackers for his television channel , Albania 's Top - Channel TV .
He said he had not seen any weapon .
" We gathered something was amiss when we saw a man wearing track - suit bottoms and a hat go to the cockpit door and pause there , thinking , " he said .
Contestants in an international beauty pageant , Globe International 2006 , were among the passengers , according to the Albanian event 's press spokesman .
Miss India , Miss Singapore , Miss Malaysia and Miss Philippines were on the flight , the spokesman told the BBC's Asian Network .
In February 2001 , Stephen Gass strode to the podium in a conference room at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and began the video presentation for SawStop , his new invention .
The 75 attendees watched the screen closely as a woodworker fed a sheet of plywood into a power - saw blade spinning at 4,000 rpm .
Then a hot dog was placed in the path of the blade .
Miraculously , the instant the blade made contact with the wiener , the saw shut down and the blade retracted .
The dog escaped with only a small nick -- substitute a finger and it's the difference between a cut and an amputation .
Gass had given the same dog-and - pony show a dozen times , mostly for woodworkers , contractors , and a few industry executives .
But this audience was different .
It consisted of lawyers for the Defense Research Industry , a trade group for attorneys representing the power - tool industry .
SawStop could help prevent thousands of serious injuries caused by power tools each year , Gass believed -- if the industry would license it .
He returned to his seat thinking he had made his case .
Then Dan Lanier , national coordinating counsel for Black & Decker , stepped to the podium .
His topic : " Evidentiary Issues Relating to SawStop Technology for Power Saws . "
Lanier spent the next 30 minutes discussing a hypothetical lawsuit -- in which a plaintiff suing a power - saw manufacturer contended the saw was defective because it did not incorporate SawStop 's technology -- and suggesting ways defense counsel might respond .
Lanier recalls it as a rather dry exploration of legal issues .
Gass heard something different .
To his ears , Lanier 's message was this :
If we all stick together and do n't license this product , the industry can argue that everybody rejected it so it obviously was n't viable , thereby limiting any legal liability the industry might face as a result of the new technology .
( Lanier denies this was his point . )
Gass was stunned .
His tiny start - up , run by three guys out of a barn in Wilsonville , Oreg. , had captured the attention of the entire power - tool industry .
For months , he had been negotiating with major players such as Ryobi , Delta , Black & Decker , Emerson , and Craftsman about licensing his invention .
Instead , they seemed intent on trying to make him and his product go away .
Some 32,000 Americans are rushed to emergency rooms with table - saw - related injuries each year , according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission ; more than 3,000 of those visits result in amputations , usually of fingers or hands .
The medical bill to reattach a severed finger runs from about $ 10,000 for a clean wound to more than $ 25,000 if there 's nerve damage , infection , or other complications , according to James W. Greer , president of the Association of Property and Casualty Claims Professionals , a trade group in Tampa .
Factor in rehabilitation and lost time at work , and the cost per injury can easily reach six figures .
Indeed , in 2002 , the CPSC estimated the annual economic cost of table - saw injuries to be $ 2 billion .
That 's more than 10 times the size of the entire $ 175 million table - saw market .
Clearly , this is an industry that could use a better mousetrap .
That 's what Gass figured he had in the summer of 2000 , when SawStop 's technology made its debut .
A year later , the Consumer Products Safety Commission awarded the device its Chairman 's Commendation for product safety .
Popular Science magazine named it one of 100 Best New Innovations .
Tool industry bigwigs seemed impressed too .
" It is probably one of the most major developments in the area of product safety applicable for table saws , " said Peter Domeny , director of product safety for S - B Power Tool , which makes Skil and Bosch tools .
So , four years later , why is n't SawStop on every table saw on the market ?
That 's the funny thing about better mousetraps .
Build one , and the other mousetrap makers will probably hate your guts .
They might even try to squeeze you out of the mousetrap business altogether .
Just ask the inventors of air bags , safer cigarette lighters , and automatic shutoffs for electrical appliances -- all of which encountered resistance from the status quo .
Ultimately they prevailed and their innovations became standard .
Gass still has a long way to go .
Gass did n't set out to take on the power - tool industry .
Nor did he ever see himself as an entrepreneur .
The amateur woodworker was standing in his workshop one day in 1999 , staring at his idle table saw .
" The idea came to me that it might be possible to stop the blade quickly enough to avoid serious injury , " he says .
A patent attorney who also holds a doctorate in physics , Gass loves nothing more than solving complex technical problems .
He got out pencil , paper , and calculator and got to work .
Stopping the blade , he figured , would require a two - part process .
First , he needed a brake that would work quickly enough when it came into contact with a woodworker 's hand .
Next , he had to design a triggering system that could differentiate between finger and wood .
Given the speed of the blade , it would have to stop in about 1/100 of a second -- or at about an eighth of an inch of rotation after making contact .
Any further , and the cut would be so deep that the device would be useless .
To stop the blade this quickly would require about 1,000 pounds of force to decelerate the blade in 10 milliseconds .
That calculation took Gass about 30 minutes .
The trigger problem was a little more complicated , but Gass came up with the idea of running a small electrical charge through the blade .
The system would sense when the blade hit flesh because the body would absorb some of the charge .
The resulting drop in voltage would be enough to trigger the brake and stop the blade almost instantly .
Gass spent two weeks designing the technology and , using a $ 200 secondhand table saw , an additional week building a prototype .
Then he began to experiment .
With the blade whirring , he touched his hand to its smooth side .
It stopped immediately .
The same thing happened when he ran a hot dog into the blade 's teeth .
Gass repeated the experiment dozens of times -- and each time the blade stopped immediately .
Convinced his invention would be embraced by the industry , he videotaped a demonstration , registered the patent , and set out to convince manufacturers to license the technology , which he had dubbed SawStop .
He sent a video demo to Delta Machinery in Jackson , Tenn. , one of the largest table - saw manufacturers , and waited .
Gass was pleased with his results , but he also knew there was something else to be done :
He had to test SawStop on a real finger .
" There 's not a lot of demand for a saw that 's safe for hot dogs , " he says with a laugh .
And so , on a spring afternoon in 2000 , Gass stood in his workshop and tried to summon the moxie to stick his left ring finger into the teeth of a whirring saw blade .
He had rubbed the digit with Novocain cream , hoping to dull the pain of the cut .
On the first try , his heart beating furiously , he eased in close but recoiled before making contact .
A few minutes later , he tried again .
This time , he rolled his finger close enough to get a faint red mark , but panicked and pulled back before the brake triggered .
By now , his forearm was cramping from the tension .
It was difficult to keep his hand steady .
Still , on his third attempt , he kept his nerve -- and the blade stopped , just as he knew it would .
" It hurt like the dickens and bled a lot , " he says .
But the finger remained intact .
Several months later , Gass finally heard back from Delta .
" No , thanks .
Safety does n't sell , " he says he was told over the phone .
( Delta , now known as Delta Porter Cable , is now owned by Black & Decker .
A Delta spokesperson who asked not to be identified denies that a Delta employee made the comment . )
Gass could not believe his ears .
" Everybody in woodworking knows somebody who 's lost a finger or had an accident , " he says .
How could a major manufacturer not be interested ?
" These guys would walk up to us and say , ' I wanna shake your hand . '
A lot of them were shaking with two or three fingers missing . "
Gass refused to give up .
Working with three other lawyers from his Portland law firm , David Fanning , David Fulmer , and David D'asenzo , he raised $ 150,000 , built a more sophisticated prototype , and signed up for the International Woodworking Fair in August 2000 in Atlanta .
The reaction there was phenomenal .
SawStop 's booth was packed with spectators who stood riveted as Gass and his partners fed wiener after wiener into the table saw .
" Afterward , these guys would walk up to us and say , ' I wanna shake your hand for doing this , " recalls Fanning .
" A lot of them were shaking with two or three fingers missing . "
It was all the validation the four men needed .
A month later , Gass and Fanning walked away from law partnerships to pursue SawStop full - time .
Fulmer , an associate at the firm , followed a few months later .
D'asenzo invested in the venture but kept his day job .
The fall of 2000 was hardly an auspicious time to launch a start - up .
The Internet boom had just gone bust , the Nasdaq was in free fall , and investors were gun-shy .
Yet SawStop was so practical and easy to understand , the trio had little trouble raising $ 1.2 million in angel funding from several different investors .
They invested in more R&D , better prototypes , and small salaries for the three principals .
" It was a no - brainer , " says Grant Simmons , a New Orleans urologist who invested an undisclosed amount in SawStop after reading about the company and seeing a video demonstration in 2004 .
It was Simmons 's first experience as an angel investor , and his interest was more than just financial :
His father was a lifelong woodworker who had lost a finger in a table - saw accident .
" This is revolutionary , " Simmons says .
" They are applying basic physics in a practical way to address a very important issue that people in the industry have totally ignored -- safety . "
Gass , Fanning , and Fulmer , meanwhile , filed more than 50 patent applications to protect their invention .
The only thing they lacked was industry cooperation -- but that seemed inevitable .
After all , they believed , common sense and consumer demand ultimately would win out .
What 's more , the technology had implications far beyond table saws .
It could potentially boost the safety of all power saws , including band saws and circular saws , as well as nail guns , lawn mowers , and other products .
For the next two years , the partners engaged in what seemed to be promising talks with high - level executives at Emerson , Black & Decker , and Ryobi .
In January 2002 , they appeared to have turned the corner when Ryobi agreed to license SawStop 's technology .
Under the terms of the deal , there would be no up - front fee ; Ryobi would pay a 3 % royalty based on the wholesale price of all saws sold with SawStop 's technology .
The number would increase to 8 % if the majority of the industry also licensed the technology .
It was not a get - rich - quick deal , but Gass believed it was a vital first step .
When the contract arrived , Gass noticed a typo and called Ryobi 's attorney , Bob Bugos , to make the correction .
Gass says Bugos apologized and promised to take care of it right away .
( Ryobi representatives declined to comment for this story . )
When a week passed and the revised contract still had not arrived , Gass called back .
He says Bugos was very apologetic and assured him the contract was on its way .
Again , it did n't come .
Gass says he called every two weeks and each time Bugos made the same promise .
After about six months of going back and forth , it finally dawned on Gass that the Ryobi deal , like all the others , was going nowhere .
Indeed , the major power - tool manufacturers have professed to be somewhat less than impressed with SawStop .
" The device has not been field - tested for results , durability , and reliability , " said a representative from Delta Porter Cable .
" It 's an experimental system , not yet field - proven . "
According to Dan Lanier , the Defense Research Industry attorney , all of the manufacturers approached by Gass independently tested and evaluated the technology .
And each one , Lanier said in an e-mail , encountered " significant problems . "
" The primary problem , " he said , " was an unacceptably high rate of false trips of the braking device when cutting wet , green , or pressure - treated lumber . "
The industry , Lanier added , is also wary of the fact that even when the device works , the user still walks away with an injury .
" Manufacturers discovered that , depending on the accident scenario and the type of blade used , a user even with a properly functioning SawStop - equipped table saw still could sustain a very severe injury , " Lanier said .
" Mr. Gass 's hot dog demonstration simply is not representative of the way in which many table - saw accidents occur . "
Given those issues , manufacturers also felt that the 8 % royalty sought by Gass was " exorbitant and unreasonable , " Lanier said .
( Representatives from Ryobi , S - B Power Tool , WHM Tool Group , and Emerson did not return repeated calls seeking comment . )
Gass counters that the industry tests were conducted on unrefined prototypes -- models essentially built to demonstrate that the concept worked -- and that many of the problems Lanier cites have since been addressed .
On current models , most wood needs to dry for only an hour or two before being cut , he says .
As for the fact that SawStop can result in an injury even when it works , Gass asks the following question :
Is n't it better to walk away with a cut , even a deep one , than to lose a finger or a hand ?
" I think they were looking for reasons not to implement it , " he says .
Gass sees the objections as a smoke screen for the industry 's real concern : the increased risk of product - liability litigation .
In most cases , when people sue power - tool manufacturers because they 've lost a finger or hand in an accident , they 're unsuccessful -- because it 's tough to prove that the manufacturer did anything wrong .
Add SawStop to the mix , however , and the picture changes .
Suddenly , the industry is promising an injury - proof saw .
What if someone got hurt ?
" The manufacturer would be at a deeper risk and more vulnerable because it had made a promise of what the technology could do , " says Jim O'Reilley , a product - liability expert at the University of Cincinnati .
" Companies are going to be reluctant to expose themselves to that higher risk . "
Indeed , precisely who would assume that risk turned out to be a major sticking point in SawStop 's licensing negotiations .
The manufacturers believed Gass should indemnify them against any lawsuit if SawStop malfunctioned .
Gass , however , says that he could not possibly make such a guarantee since he would not actually be manufacturing the saws .
And there is another facet to the liability issue .
If SawStop did come to market and was proved effective in preventing accidents , it might be easier for plaintiffs to win lawsuits against manufacturers of traditional saws , because juries might be more likely to return a verdict against a manufacturer that chose not to implement SawStop .
That 's the main reason , Gass believes , that the big tool makers are refusing to deal with him .
They want his product to go away .
After the deal with Ryobi fell apart in mid-2002 , Gass , Fanning , and Fulmer faced a tough choice : Abandon the company and return to practicing law or build the saws themselves .
None of the men had ever run a company , but they all understood that it 's one thing to be an inventor and another to be an entrepreneur .
They would be responsible for designing , manufacturing , marketing , and sales along with the day - to - day operations of a business .
It was a tough prospect -- but not a tough decision .
All three agreed that if they did n't act , their technology would never see the light of day .
" It seemed like the right thing to do , " says Fanning .
" There are n't very many opportunities to make money and do something good . "
With wives and kids to support , Gass and his partners have found that the decision has not always been easy to stand by .
Gass fondly recalls the six - figure salary he earned as a patent lawyer .
At one point , he was so close to returning to his legal career that he got quotes for renewing the legal - malpractice insurance policy he dropped when he devoted himself to SawStop .
" I never doubted my invention or wanted to give up , but I 've wondered if we would be able to keep going , " he says .
" It 's been touch - and - go several times with money , and we always manage to pull through at the last minute . "
SawStop now operates with eight people out of a two - story barn Gass built himself .
Filled with electronics , high - tech machinery , and every tool imaginable , the first floor is a handyman 's paradise .
In the corner is a large stack of woodworking timber left untouched since Gass launched his venture .
Gass logs 12 - to 14 - hour days running the business upstairs .
Desks , computers , and filing cabinets fill the second - floor office space .
A map of the United States hangs above the conference table .
It 's dotted with colored pushpins , each one representing a city where someone has purchased a SawStop table saw .
The first one rolled off the assembly line of a Taiwanese manufacturing plant in November 2004 .
SawStop has since sold about 600 and has 300 more on back order .
A basic contractor saw retails for $ 799 ; the professional - level cabinet saw goes for $ 2,500 .
The company relies on trade shows , news stories , word of mouth , and ads in woodworking magazines for marketing .
Selling online and direct - to - consumer is an acceptable way to get started , but Gass knows that to reach the larger market he will need to get into home improvement stores , where competition for shelf space is fierce .
He 's had discussions with Home Depot and Lowe's , but neither has committed to carrying the product .
" Accidents are usually caused by human error , but this saw grants you forgiveness , " says one contractor .
So for now , Gass is banking on people like Sharon and Don Biers , owners of Collins Custom Cabinets .
After one of the employees at their Lowell , Ark. , shop lost a finger in a power - saw accident in February , the Biers bought a $ 2,500 SawStop cabinet saw and have since ordered two more .
It did n't take long for the purchase to pay off .
Within two weeks , another employee , John Stroud , inadvertently shifted his hand into the path of the blade and the saw shut down when it hit his fingernail .
" We made the calculation that it 's worth it for the safety of our guys , " says Sharon Biers .
" The accidents are usually caused by human error , but this saw grants you forgiveness . "
And not just for professionals .
In May , Gass received an e-mail from a high school shop teacher in Princeton , Wis .
" I have a sophomore who still has two thumbs thanks to your saw , " the man wrote .
The company knows of at least five other amputations that have been averted .
With the big tool companies declining to participate , SawStop is seeking other ways to make sure its technology is adopted .
In April 2003 , the company filed a petition with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to make SawStop - like technology standard on all table saws .
Six months later , the Power Tool Institute , a consortium of 17 power - tool makers , filed an opposing brief in which it argued that SawStop is a " speculative and untested technology .
In addition , the cost to consumers and manufacturers of granting the petition would far outweigh any benefits that may be realized . "
The industry also claims to be developing its own safety systems .
The CPSC is expected to release its findings this summer .
If it states , as Gass hopes and expects , that the technology is effective , it will be the first step in a long process of making SawStop -- or a similar injury - prevention system -- mandatory .
Meanwhile , the industry 's product - liability fears appear to be coming to life .
In 2003 , a construction worker walked into the Wellesley , Mass. , office of attorney Richard J. Sullivan .
He was looking for someone to represent him in a case against Chicago - based S - B Power Tool .
The worker had lost his thumb and four fingers while using a table saw .
Doctors were able to reattach them , but even after six surgeries and $ 150,000 in medical bills , he still had no real functionality in the hand .
Living on workers ' comp , he fell behind financially and was forced to sell his home .
Sullivan turned the case down twice because he did n't see a way to hold the manufacturer accountable .
Then a colleague told him about SawStop .
" His injury occurred on a saw manufactured in April 2003 and sold in May 2003 , " Sullivan says .
" The industry has known about this technology since 2001 .
That gave the manufacturer plenty of time to react . "
The lawsuit , filed in Massachusetts state court in the summer of 2004 , alleges that the manufacturer was negligent for not implementing the technology and seeks compensation for lost wages , future lost wages , and pain and suffering .
( Attorneys for S - B Power Tool responded in January , denying all claims . )
" If Gass can figure this out by tinkering around in his backyard , what has this industry been doing for the past 20 years ? " asks Sullivan , who has since taken on five similar cases .
" They 're like the auto industry , which had to be dragged kicking and screaming to install air bags . "

In Connecticut , residential electric rates rose up to 27 percent last year to an average of $ 128 a month , and are expected to go up as much as 50 percent more in January .
In New Jersey , rates rose up to 13 percent this year , and are poised to go much higher .
New York residential customers , by contrast , paid an inflation - adjusted average of 16 percent less in 2004 than in 1996 , a state report said .
It is not known how much of that is attributable to government - ordered rate cuts , but the state benefited from huge increases in power generated by its nuclear plants and by buying power from New England plants that , starting next year , may have less electricity to sell to New York .
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and five other agencies , in the draft of the report to Congress , are unable to specify any overall savings .
“ It has been difficult , ” the report states , “ to determine whether retail prices ” in the states that opened to competition “ are higher or lower than they otherwise would have been ” under the old system .
Joseph T. Kelliher , the commission chairman , said Friday that eventually “ market discipline will deliver the best prices ” and noted that every administration and Congress since 1978 had pushed the industry toward competition .
He added that the commission recognized a need for “ constant reform of the rules . ”
Under the old system , regulated utilities generated electricity and distributed it to customers .
Under the new system , many regulated utilities only deliver power , which they buy from competing producers whose prices are not regulated .
For example , Consolidated Edison , which serves the New York City area , once produced almost all the power it delivered ; now it must buy virtually all its electricity from companies that bought its power plants and from other independent generators .
The goal is for producers to compete to offer electricity at the lowest price , savings customers money .
Independent power producers , free - market economists and the Clinton Administration cheered in 1996 when the federal government allowed states to adopt the new system .
The new rules “ will benefit the industry and consumers to the tune of billions of dollars every year , ” Elizabeth A. Moler , then chairwoman of FERC , said at the time .
She said the new rules would “ accelerate competition and bring lower prices and more choices to energy customers . ”
“ Allow none of foo , one of foo , or any number of foo . ”
A rule of thumb for software design , which instructs one to not place random limits on the number of instances of a given entity ( such as : windows in a window system , letters in an OS 's filenames , etc. ) .
Specifically , one should either disallow the entity entirely , allow exactly one instance ( an “ exception ” ) , or allow as many as the user wants — address space and memory permitting .
The logic behind this rule is that there are often situations where it makes clear sense to allow one of something instead of none .
However , if one decides to go further and allow N ( for N > 1 ) , then why not N+1 ?
And if N+1 , then why not N+2 , and so on ?
Once above 1 , there 's no excuse not to allow any N ; hence , infinity .
Many hackers recall in this connection Isaac Asimov 's SF novel The Gods Themselves in which a character announces that the number 2 is impossible — if you 're going to believe in more than one universe , you might as well believe in an infinite number of them .

I got a great question via email from a reader a couple of days ago , asking what books I ’d recommend for a Christmas break reading list for someone wanting to educate him or herself on Africa .
I ended up suggesting a couple of my personal faves , as well as one book currently on my “ to read ” pile , George Ayittey ’s Africa Unchained .
The others I suggested as great first reads :
– Chinua Achebe ’s “ Things Fall Apart ”
– Adam Hochschild ’s “ King Leopold ’s Ghost ”
– Any number of Ryszard Kapuscinski’s books , including The Shadow of the Sun and The Soccer War .
It occurred to me , after sending off this brief list , that I ’d be much better off with a list suggested by my readers .
So , if you ’ve got a moment , think about what three books you ’d recommend to someone who does n’t know very much about African culture , politics or history … and share that advice on the comments .
If we get some good feedback , I ’ll post a compiled list of suggestions … and it may help shape my holiday giftgiving as well .
( And yes , I ’m still shopping .
A trip that extends until December 20 will do that to a guy … )
Thanks for the idea , Kevin – point me to your blog , will you ?
Man gets 10 - year sentence for circumcision of 2 - year - old daughter LAWRENCEVILLE , Ga. ( AP ) 
An Ethiopian immigrant who was convicted Wednesday of the genital mutilation of his 2 - year - old daughter was sentenced to 10 years in prison in what was believed to be the first such criminal case in the United States .
Khalid Adem , 30 , was found guilty of aggravated battery and cruelty to children .
Prosecutors said he used scissors to remove his daughter 's clitoris in his family 's Atlanta - area apartment in 2001 .
The child 's mother , Fortunate Adem , said she did not discover it until more than a year later .
Adem , who had no criminal record , could have been sentenced to up to 40 years in prison .
He held his face in his hands and wept loudly after the jury 's verdict was read .
During her father 's trial , the girl , now 7 , clutched a teddy bear as she testified on videotape that her father " cut me on my private part . "
Federal law specifically bans the practice of genital mutilation , but many states do not have a law addressing it .
Georgia lawmakers , with the support of the girl 's mother , passed an anti-mutilation law last year .
But Adem was not tried under that law since it did not exist when his daughter was cut .
During the trial , Adem testified he never circumcised his daughter or asked anyone else to do so .
He said he grew up in Addis Ababa , the capital of Ethiopia , and considers the practice more prevalent in rural areas .
Adem 's attorney acknowledged that the girl had been cut , but implied that the family of the girl 's mother , who immigrated from South Africa , may have been responsible .
The Adems divorced three years ago , and attorney Mark Hill suggested that the couple 's daughter was coached to testify against her father by her mother , who has full custody of the child .
Adem , who cried throughout the trial and during his testimony , was asked what he thought of someone who believes in the practice .
He replied : " The word I can say is ' mind in the gutter . '
He is a moron . "
The practice crosses ethnic and cultural lines and is not tied to a particular religion .
Activists say it is intended to deny women sexual pleasure .
In its most extreme form , the clitoris and parts of the labia are removed and the labia that remain are stitched together .
Knives , razors or even sharp stones are usually used , according to a 2001 department report .
The tools are frequently not sterilized , and often , many girls are circumcised at the same ceremony , leading to infection .
It is unknown how many girls have died from the procedure , either during the cutting or from infections , or years later in childbirth .
Nightmares , depression , shock and feelings of betrayal are common psychological side effects , according to a 2001 federal report .
Since 2001 , the State Department estimates that up to 130 million women worldwide have undergone circumcision .

Claim : “ Make the Pie Higher ! ” poem is composed of actual quotes from George W. Bush .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2002 ]
MAKE THE PIE HIGHER
by George W. Bush MAKE THE PIE HIGHERby George W. Bush I think we all agree , the past is over .
This is still a dangerous world .
It ’s a world of madmen and uncertainty
and potential mental losses .
Rarely is the question asked
Is our children learning ?
Will the highways of the Internet become more few ?
How many hands have I shaked ?
They misunderestimate me .
I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity .
I know that the human being and the fish can coexist .
Families is where our nation finds hope , where our wings take dream .
Put food on your family !
Knock down the tollbooth !
Vulcanize society !
Make the pie higher !
Make the pie higher !
Origins :
We certainly did n’t need to write a piece to inform the world that , like his father , President George W. Bush is not a strong public speaker .
Particularly when speaking
extemporaneously , he often uses words similar in sound but different in meaning to what he intends to
say ( e.g. , “ vulcanize ” for “ Balkanize ” ) or uses incorrect forms of words ( e.g. , “ resignate ” for “ resonate ” ) , garbles familiar phrases by transposing words ( e.g. , “ where wings take dream ” ) , and makes a variety of grammatical mistakes ( e.g. , “ how many hands have I shaked ” ) .
The point here was not to rehash the numerous lists of “ Bushisms ” to be found in a variety of media , but to perform a sort of investigative experiment into the accuracy of information transmission in the Internet age .
A common phenomenon in the world of the printed word is that once a public figure — whether he be an athlete such a Yogi Berra , an entertainment figure such as Samuel Goldwyn , or a politician such as Dan Quayle — acquires a reputation for spouting malapropisms , people quickly begin to put words into his mouth .
All sorts of humorous misuses of words and phrases that sound like something that person might have said are soon attributed to him as something he “ really said ” ; newspapers run the erroneous quotes without verification and are later cited as documented proof of their veracity , thereby enshrining apocrypha as
fact .
Only when someone undertakes the chore of trying to track the quotes back to their sources are the misattributions discovered , usually far too late to dislodge them from the public consciousness .
So , we thought we ’d tackle a project to see whether the increased availability of information in the Internet age has had any effect on this phenomenon ; whether quotes are less likely to be misattributed when nearly every utterance of a public figure as prominent as a presidential candidate is recorded and stored in one form or another .
As a test example , we chose the “ Make the Pie Higher ! ” piece reproduced above ( generally credited to “ Washington Post writer Richard Thompson , ” a satirist and illustrator who produces the “ Richard ’s Poor Almanac ” feature appearing in the Post ‘s Sunday edition ) and attempted to trace every statement listed therein to its source to determine how many of them were actually uttered by George W. Bush .
Our standard was that in order to consider a statement to be a genuine “ Bushism ” we had to find at least one major newspaper article that quoted the actual words spoken ( rather than paraphrasing them ) , included specific information about when and where the statement was made , and was printed within a few days of the event at which the statement was offered .
In this statistically insignificant non-random sample of one , we found that yes , the accuracy of quote transmission was remarkably high :
All but a couple of the items in this piece could be reliably traced back to the mouth of George W. Bush .
Here are the results :
“ I think we all agree , the past is over . ”
In March 2000 , Texas governor George W. Bush locked up the Republican presidential nomination , beating out his chief rival , Senator John McCain of Arizona , in a rancorous primary campaign marked by personal attacks and charges of dirty tactics on the part of both sides .
Two months later Senator McCain somewhat reluctantly endorsed Governor Bush for president during a joint appearance at the Westin William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh , where both men tried their best ( somewhat unconvincingly ) to assure the press that they had put their differences behind them :
Both sides swapped charges of dirty campaign tactics .
McCain aides accused Bush supporters of personal attacks , and Mr. Bush denounced McCain forces for suggesting that the governor was guilty of anti-Catholic bigotry .
On Tuesday , the pair told some 200 journalists that they had discussed policy , not personal history .

McCain aides accused Bush supporters of personal attacks , anddenounced McCain forces for suggesting that the governor was guilty of anti-Catholic bigotry .
On Tuesday , the pair told somethat they had discussed policy , not personal history .
“ There ’s no point , ” Mr. McCain said .
“ I hold no rancor .
Others will be the judge of this campaign , not me . ”
Mr. Bush said the McCain challenge toughened him for the fall campaign against Mr. Gore .
“ We had a tough primary , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ I told him point blank : ‘ You made me a better candidate . ' ”
Later , on his campaign plane , the governor described the discussion as “ very cordial , very frank , very open . ”
He added : “ I think we agree , the past is over . ”

“ This is still a dangerous world .
It ’s a world of madmen and uncertainty and potential mental losses . ”
On the campaign trail in South Carolina while pursuing the Republican nomination in January 2000 , Governor Bush spoke before 2,000 loyal Republicans at a well - attended oyster roast held on a plantation outside Charleston and mystified his audience when , during his discourse on the need for a strengthened U.S. military , he made reference not to “ mental ” losses ( which itself would have sounded odd in the given context ) , but to “ mential ” ( pronounced “ men- shul ” ) losses :
During his visit to South Carolina this week , the first Bushism exploded as the governor painted a passionate picture of the military dangers facing the US , and the pressing need for protection against rogue missile launches .

“ This is still a dangerous world , ” he told more than 2,000 supporters at an oyster roast .
“ It ’s a world of madmen and uncertainty and potential mential losses . ”
Bush ’s spokespeople could not immediately explain what a mential loss was , but it seemed only distantly related to missile launches .

“ Rarely is the question asked , ‘ Is our children learning ? ’ “
During that same South Carolina campaign swing in January 2000 , Governor Bush committed another grammatical mix - up while wrangling a sentence containing both singular and plural subjects , this example occurring ( with a modicum of irony ) during the portion of his stump speech dealing with education :
That ’s not to say Bush has n’t had his share of flubs .
Part of his stump speech focuses on education .
On Tuesday , talking to a crowd of several hundred at a cavernous civic center in Florence , S.C. , Bush decried those who ignore educational programs that produce no results — inadvertently revealing a temporary shortcoming in his own grammar skills .

“ What ’s not fine is rarely is the question asked , are , is our children learning ? ” Bush said .

“ Will the highways of the Internet become more few ? “
During his January 2000 push to win the first primary election of the campaign , held in New Hampshire , Governor Bush was asked to comment on the recently announced merger of media giants Time Warner and AOL , and he addressed concerns over its potential monopolistic effects with some unusual phrasing :
When asked about the Time Warner / America Online merger , the candidate took an unexpected detour on the information superhighway .
When asked about the Time Warner / America Online merger , the candidate took an unexpected detour on the information superhighway .
The key question in considering the merger , Bush said , is “ will the highways to the Internet become more few ? ” 4
“ How many hands have I shaked ? “
By October 1999 Republicans were noting Governor Bush ’s relatively rare appearances in New Hampshire and were beginning to question whether he had assumed he had the nomination sewn up and could afford to take the February 2000 New Hampshire primary for granted .
When reporters persistently questioned him about that possibility on 22 October 1999 , during his first campaign swing through New Hampshire since early September , Governor Bush expressed the notion that the important factor was not the number of appearances he made , but the number of people he reached during those appearances :
Asked repeatedly today about why he had not been around more , Mr. Bush at one point interrupted a reporter ’s question to say , “ The important question is , How many hands have I shaked . ”
5
“ They misunderestimate me . “
The misuse of ‘ misunderestimate ’ for ‘ underestimate ’ seems to be one of George W. Bush ’s more common elocutionary mistakes .
We ca n’t pin down exactly when he used ‘ misunderestimate ’ for the first time in a public statement as a presidential candidate ; the earliest print reference we could find appeared in the Chicago Sun -Times on 13 November 2000 , but it did n’t detail where and when he said it .
Nonetheless , Bush was still using the word ( and catching himself at it ) after his inauguration as President , as demonstrated by this excerpt from a 29 March 2001 news conference :
Look , it is in our nation ’s best interests to have long - term tax relief , and that has been my focus all along .
I ’m confident we can have it , get it done .
I believe not only can we get long - term tax relief in place .
Since our country is running some surpluses in spite of the dire predictions about cash flow , I believe we have an opportunity to fashion an immediate stimulus package , as well .
The two ought to go hand in hand .
Those who think that they can say , “ We ’re only going to have a stimulus package , but let ’s forget tax relief , ” misunderestimate … or , excuse me , underestimate — just making sure you were paying attention — underestimate our administration ’s resolve to get this done … 6
“ I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity . “
This line is a retrospective statement Bush uttered during an interview about his involvement in a partnershipthat bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989 :
George W. Bush has frequently claimed to have cobbled together the deal to buy the Rangers in 1989 .
George W. Bush has frequently claimed to have cobbled together the deal to buy the Rangers in 1989 .
“ I was like a pit bull on the pant leg of opportunity , ” Mr. Bush said in a long interview about his past .
“ And I just grabbed on to it .
I was going to put the deal together .
And I did . ”
The initiative , Mr. Bush acknowledges , came from Bill DeWitt , a businessman and friend of the family .
Mr. DeWitt had heard that the Rangers were on the market and wanted to recruit Mr. Bush as a partner to buy the team .
15
“ I know that the human being and the fish can coexist . “
On Friday , 29 September 2000 , Governor Bush was on the stump in Saginaw , Michigan , and deviated from his prepared speech to reassure the business community that he would not support the tearing down of energy - producing dams merely to protect threatened fish species , an issue he had recently covered while campaigning in the Pacific Northwest :
Friday , feeling the need to explain his statement during a speech on energy policy that he intended to maintain dams in the Pacific Northwest , he departed from his text and added , “ I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully . ”
He did not elaborate .
7
Mark Crispin Miller noted in The Bush Dyslexicon that :
This remark is striking not because it ’s silly but because it casts a threatened creature as a national enemy .
A relic of the Cold War , the phrase “ peaceful coexistence ” was a predétente Soviet coinage , meant to pitch conciliation between the world ’s two rival superpowers .
“ Families is where our nation finds hope , where our wings take dream . “
Swinging through Wisconsin in mid-October 2000 en route to a debate with Democratic presidential challenger Al Gore , Governor Bush was discussing the importance of tax cuts to American families when he transposed a couple of words in a well - worn phrase :
The Texas governor and GOP presidential nominee tangles up words often enough that he sometimes jokes about it , and the phenomenon has acquired a name — Bushism .
On the campaign trail Wednesday , he let one fly : “ Families is where our nation finds hope , ” he said , “ where wings take dream . ”
8
“ Put food on your family ! “
On 27 January 2000 , speaking in Nashua just a few days before the New Hampshire primary , Governor Bush was trying to illustrate the economic plight of single working mothers and again transposed ( and omitted ) a few words in the familiar reference to putting food on the table for one ’s family :
At a breakfast meeting with the Nashua Chamber of Commerce , Bush illustrated his brand of compassionate conservatism by urging his listeners to put themselves in the role of a single mother “ working hard to put food on your family . ”
4
Since these words are difficult to quote in the context in which they were offered , they were soon being rendered as the pithier “ I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family . ”
“ Knock down the tollbooth ! “
Governor Bush ’s misuse of ‘ tollbooth ’ for ‘ roadblock , ’ in reference to eliminating tax obstacles that prevent the working poor from joining the middle class , comes from his New Hampshire campaign appearances in January 2000 , but contemporary reports do n’t seem to agree on the exact words he used — perhaps there was more than one such incident :
Things must be good here , because the mere mention of tax cuts is not enough to get the crowd cheering .
What they like is when Bush worries about the working poor ; they applaud vigorously when he complains that a single mother making $ 22,000 is being penalized by the tax system .
“ It ’s not fair ! ” Bush exclaims .
“ It ’s a tollbooth on the road to the middle class , and I intend not only to reduce the fees but to knock the tollbooth down . ”

“ It ’s a tollbooth on the road to the middle class , and I intend not only to reduce the fees but to . ”
“ The hardest job in America is to be a single mom , making $ 20,000 a year , ” Bush declared at a recent Rotary Club lunch where he promised that as president , he would reduce the struggling woman ’s marginal income - tax rate and “ knock down her tollbooth to the middle class . ”
10 Last weekend , fire marshals were actually turning people away from political rallies .
At a high school near Nashua , you could see folks forlornly peeking in the windows , yearning to be let inside to hear George W. Bush call for “ a law that provides liability to teachers who enforce discipline in the schools . ”
All the candidates are tired , but Mr. Bush ’s speeches are getting particularly unintelligible — at the same high school , he announced , “ I think we need not only to eliminate the tollbooth to the middle class , I think we should knock down the tollbooth . ”
11
“ Vulcanize society ! “
At the very beginning of the 2000 presidential campaign , Ken Herman reported in a front - page story appearing in the 23 March 1999 edition of the Austin American - Statesman that Governor Bush had expressed his disdain for racial quotas as programs that “ vulcanize ” society :
Sometimes this smooth operator is anything but .
This was evident in a March 23 piece by Ken Herman , the Austin American - Statesman ‘s chief Bush watcher , who wrote about the governor ’s “ 2 - step around hot topics . ”
Mr. Bush says he ’s against “ hard quotas , quotas that basically delineate based on whatever .
However , they delineate , quotas , I think , vulcanize society . ”
12
In this instance Governor Bush of course meant to say ‘ Balkanize ’ ( to divide a group into small , often hostile units ) rather than ‘ vulcanize ’ ( to improve the strength of rubber by combining it with sulfur in the presence of heat and pressure ) .
However , the issue was muddied a few days later when the American - Statesman reversed itself and issued a correction :
A front - page story Tuesday inaccurately quoted Gov. George W. Bush ’s position on quotas in college admissions and the awarding of state contracts .
The story said Bush believes quotas “ vulcanize society . ”
Bush actually said he believes quotas “ Balkanize society . ”
13
Whether the reporter misquoted Governor Bush or whether Governor Bush really did say ‘ vulcanize ’ and the American - Statesman later printed an amended quote at the behest of his office is something we can’t determine .
“ Make the pie higher ! “
This final item ( a misstatement of the concept of putting more money into the hands of Americans by reducing taxes to grow the economy and enlarge the economic “ pie ” that everyone shares — i.e. , making the pie “ bigger ” rather than “ higher ” ) is the phrase perhaps most often cited as an example of “ Bushisms , ” so much so that it was used for the title of the poem quoted at the head of this page .
And it is a real quote , something Bush said during the course of a 15 February 2000 Republican debate ( moderated by CNN host Larry King ) in Columbia , South Carolina , between Texas Governor George W. Bush , Senator John McCain of Arizona , and former Reagan administration official Ambassador Alan Keyes :
The difference between our plans is , I know whose money it is we ’re dealing with .
We ’re dealing with the government — we ’re dealing with the people ’s money , not the government ’s money .
And I want to give people their money back .
The difference between our plans is , I know whose money it is we ’re dealing with .
We ’re dealing with thedealing with the people ’s money , not the government ’s money .
And I want to give people their money back .
And if you ’re going to have a tax cut , everybody ought to have a tax cut .
This kind of Washington , D.C. , view about targeted tax cuts is tax cuts driven by polls and focus groups .
If you pay taxes in America , you ought to get a tax cut .
Under my plan , if you ’re a family of four in South Carolina , making $ 50,000 , you get 50 - percent tax cut .
I ’ve reduced the lower rate from 15 percent to 10 percent , which does this — and this is important .
There are people on the outskirts of poverty , like single moms who are working the toughest job in America .
If she has two kids , and making $ 22,000 , for every additional dollar she earns , she pays a higher marginal rate on her taxes than someone making $ 200,000 .
You bet I cut the taxes at the top .
That encourages entrepreneurship .
What we Republicans should stand for is growth in the economy .
We ought to make the pie higher .
This one initially posed something of a mystery to us , because transcripts of the debate prepared by the Federal Document Clearing House and CNN attribute the block of text quoted above to Senator John McCain , not Governor Bush .
However , the immediately preceding question had clearly been posed to Governor Bush , and newspaper accounts the following morning noted the “ make the pie higher ” comment as something uttered by Governor Bush :
Bush , shedding his sometimes goofy demeanor , was as animated and forceful as he has been in any debate , punching the air with his fist to underscore his words .
He scored points among the party faithful in calling for an end to the Clinton era in Washington — one of the money lines of the night .

He scored points among the party faithful in calling for an end to the Clinton era inof the money lines of the night .
On taxes and bringing prosperity to struggling working mothers , however , Bush mangled one metaphor : “ We ought to make the pie higher . ” 14
Moreover , at a Radio / TV correspondents ’ dinner in Washington , D.C. , a few weeks later , Governor Bush made humorous use of the item with no indication that the words were n’t his own :
Now most people would say in speaking of the economy , “ We ought to make the pie bigger . ” I , however , am on record saying , “ We ought to make the pie higher . ”
As frivolous as this experiment may have been , let ’s hope it ’s a harbinger of more accurate information to come .

“ In Bush ’s Words : ‘ Both Sides Must Take Important Steps ’ in the Mideast . ”
As I mentioned in my previous post , my Mastering Regular Expressions book was just reviewed on Slashdot .
One thing that struck me in reading all the resulting comments was the ( several different copies of an ) apparently famous quote that goes something like :
Some people , when confronted with a problem , think
“ I know , I 'll use regular expressions . ”
Now they have two problems .
It 's apparently quite well known , so it floors me that this is the first I 've seen it .
Despite being a manifestation of the ignorance discussed in my previous post , I can certainly appreciate it for its wit .
This quote is generally attributed to Jamie Zawinski ( an early Netscape engineer ) from a post on the comp.lang.emacs Usenet newsgroup .
Unfortunately , there 's never been a comp.lang .emacs newsgroup , which renders the whole attribution suspect .
Oddly curious about it , I did some digging ...
It turns out that the source of the mistaken comp.lang .emacs reference was a May 1998 comp.lang .
python post by Fredrik Lundh , who used it as a cute quote in his sig .
He 's a prolific writer so the sig appeard wide and far , and many people picked up on it and started using it themselves , and the fame of the quote ( along with an incorrect attribution ) spread .
But it was indeed Jamie Zawinski who first said it , in a Usenet post on August 12 , 1997 .
Unfortunately , it seems that Google Groups , which holds a repository of Usenet postings going back a thousand years , does not have this particular post in its database .
If it would , the post would be at the end of this broken link .
[ UPDATE Feb 2013 : it seems now that the link is no longer broken ; Jamie 's original post is there ]
[ UPDATE Jan 2007 : Jamie Zawinski added a comment to this post ]
Actually , it seems that none of Jamie Zawinski's posts in the threads that spawned from this initial post are in Google 's database .
This is quite odd .
I have been able to find parts of his posts quoted in the replies of others .
It was a heated thread , so there 's plenty to go on .
There was a thread in comp.emacs.xemacs and alt.religion.emacs in which the idea of embedding Perl into Emacs was proposed .
( My first - thoughts comment on this idea is that it 's fairly silly , since Emacs already has a powerful lisp interpreter in it .
Lisp is odd , though , in that it 's a vastly more regular language than Perl , yet arguably less readable .
But I digress ... ) .
The main goal of the guy making the original suggestion was to get better regular - expression handling into Emacs .
Perl treats regular expressions as first - class language features , making them a breeze to work with .
They 're not that hard to work with in Emacs Lisp , but in any case , Emacs 's regular expressions are much less powerful and have a syntax that 's even less readable than that of Perl 's , if that 's possible .
( If you look up “ toothpicks , scattered ” in the index of my book , it brings you to a page about Emacs regular - expression syntax . :-) )
Two things must be understood about Jamie Zawinski when evaluating his comments about this idea : he despised Perl , and he spent a nontrivial chunk of his life tending to Emacs and its lisp system , to the point that he considered it a religion .
I can understand and appreciate having that kind of passion about something .
In any case , talk about embedding Perl into Emacs would be heresy of the highest order .
It seems that during the course of this thread , Jamie referenced a three - month - old post by Kelly Murray in which Kelly sarcastically suggests something even more outlandishly silly ( treating all data simply as a stream of bytes ) .
Apparently , Jamie did n't realize that it was meant to be humorous or sarcastic .
Combining this with the idea of embedding Perl into Emacs just for its regular - expression handling , and it was enough to put him over the edge , and Jamie lashed out :
Jamie Zawinski < jwz@netscape.com > wrote on Tue , 12 Aug 1997 13:16:22 - 0700 :
You are trying to shoehorn your existing preconceptions of how one should program onto a vastly different ( and older , and more internally consistent ) model .
I suggest your time would be better spent learning and understanding that other model , and learn to use it properly , and learn what it can and cannot do , rather than infecting it with this new cancer out of ignorance .
The notion that everything is a stream of bytes is utterly braindead .
The notion that regexps are the solution to all problems is equally braindead .
Just like Perl .
Some people , when confronted with a problem , think “ I know , I 'll use regular expressions . ”
Now they have two problems .
Jamie really disliked Perl , and in the ensuing discussion had a few other comments about it .
In this snippet he responds to a “ what 's wrong with Perl ? ” question :
> What 's wrong with perl ?
It combines all the worst aspects of C and Lisp : a billion different sublanguages in one monolithic executable .
It combines the power of C with the readability of PostScript .
( I also appreciate that last sentence for its wit . )
A few days later it became clear that it 's not only Perl itself , that he 's upset with , but how he perceives it 's often used :
Perl 's nature encourages the use of regular expressions almost to the exclusion of all other techniques ; they are far and away the most “ obvious ” ( at least , to people who do n't know any better ) way to get from point A to point B .
Mind you , he 's keeping a fair mind about himself , allowing that Perl has some merit :
Perl is not * all * bad ; just mostly
I find that the next statement is quite telling :
Maybe Java will save the day , once someone straps a Java front end onto the gcc back end .
Later , he says :
The heavy use of regexps in Perl is due to them being far and away the most obvious hammer in the box .
The heavy use of regexps in Emacs is due almost entirely to performance issues : because of implementation details , Emacs code that uses regexps will almost always run faster than code that uses more traditional control structures .
Based solely on how lame the syntax is , and how generally unmaintainable regexp - based code is , Perl would be very close to the bottom of my list of choices for most tasks .
I 'd agree with that first paragraph if the “ most obvious hammer ” phrase were changed to “ most appropriate hammer ” , because Perl is often used for advanced text processing , and that 's exactly where regular expressions shine .
That being said , I 've written plenty of system tools in Perl that are mostly or completely devoid of regular expressions .
I use them when they 're the best tool , and do n't when they 're not .
Anyway , it was a colossal waste of time for me to track this all down ( and for you to read this far :-) ) , but once I got on the trail it was hard to get off .
As cute as the “ now you have two problems ” quote is , it seems that Jamie was n't the first to come up with the idea .
The same quote ( but with AWK rather than regular expressions as the punch line ) shows up in the sig of John Myers post from 1988 , where he credits a “ D. Tilbrook ” for it :
“ Whenever faced with a problem , some people say ` Lets use AWK .'
Now , they have two problems . ” -- D. Tilbrook
I 've also seen the AWK quote credited to a “ Zalman Stern ” ( in this 1993 post of quotations on alt.quotations ) .
As Mark Bessey notes in a post on his blog , it 's an all - purpose joke .
I can imagine that it was first used in by servicemen during WW2 , along the lines of “ Some people think ` Let 's ask the officers ' .... ” .
Someone named Vaspers asks
What will kill the blogosphere ?
and thinks the answer is various forms of marketing - driven corruption lying in the direction that PayPerPost is pointing .
[ Update : Good comments ; pile on ! ]
He might have a point .
Assaf Arkin agrees , and declares Labnotes to be a Blogstitution - Free Zone .
Among other things , he says “ I will not blog favorably about a product / service unless I ’ll go out of my way to get it with my own money ” .
Commercial pressure on blogs is absolutely increasing ; I now get story pitches most days from PR folk , in varying degrees of cluefulness .
The lamest are something like “ In the SOA - driven Web 2.0 era , enterprises need the awesome power of inferential data integration !
We have this vital story , straight from the horse ’s mouth !
And we can adapt it to your blog format for you ! ”
On the other hand , some are of the form “ I ’m a PR consultant working for Frowlotron Information Injectors ; they ’ve got an XML database with a high - performance Atom adaptor , seems like your kind of stuff , want to take a look or talk to our guys ? ”
I usually do n’t , but I also do n’t object to this kind of approach at all .
By a weird coincidence , I got one this afternoon :
Hi , this is Amy from Buzztone .
I enjoy reading your blog and I was wondering if you would be interested in working together in a promotion .
Legendary artist , Yusuf , formerly Cat Stevens , is releasing his first new album in 28 years this week titled " An Other Cup . "
I believe some editorial or information about Yusuf ’s album will be great for your site .
I can provide you with digital assets like photos , bio , news release and a CD for your review .
At one level , kind of irritating about how their stuff will be “ great for my site ” .
But the proposition seems straightforward .
I wrote back saying “ Sure , send me a CD and I might write about it and I might like it , I liked some of Mr. Stevens ’ stuff back in the day . ”
Amy wrote back :
Hi Tim ,
That ’s fine .
I 'll send you the Yusuf CD and you can see what you think .
I am also including a CD called Rytems Del Mundo which is a compilation of music by big artist like Coldplay , Arctic Monkeys , and Sting remixed with an Afro -Cuban sound .
It was done by Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo of Buena Vista Social sound .
Let me know how you like them and if you end up writing about either of the albums .
If she needs help finding out when a blogger ’s writing about her product , a lesson in Technorati 101 would be in order .
But still , seems fair enough .
And obviously , I like writing about music .
If I write about the music , pro or con , I ’d need to disclose that it was a freebie .
Professional music reviewers do n’t , but that ’s fine because we assume they ’re all freebies .
There ’s the potential for corruption , I guess ; I might be incented to write glowing reviews of everything so that record companies send me free music .
I do n’t think I ’ll do that , but if I ’m transparent enough , my readership is intelligent enough to figure it out one way or another .
So is this just a pleasant perk of having a moderately - popular blog , or am I stepping onto a slippery slope ?
They 're the New Puritans .

For my part , I felt duty bound to decline .

According to the Future Foundation , we are increasingly curbing our enthusiasm for profligate consumption , and health and environment - threatening behaviours .
Gone is the guilt - free pleasure - seeker , to be replaced by the model well - meaning citizen , the New Puritan - a tag interchangeable with neo-Cromwellian , if you really want to seal its 17th century origins - who thinks through the consequences of activities previously thought of as pleasurable and invariably elects to live without them .
Think of it as the dieticians ' favourite adage , ' a moment on the lips , a lifetime on the hips ' given socio-economic resonance .
Arguably , these personal codes of conduct would be an arresting enough story on their own , but the New Puritan 's curbs must also be extended to other people 's behaviour , and wherever possible enshrined by legislation - for New Puritans do not fear the nanny state .
According to Murphy , ' In common with all important movements , this one has a silent march .
It 's under - noticed and under - observed . '
Such stealth might suit elements of the movement quite well , especially when it comes to tackling the menace of the Sports Utility Vehicle .
Part of the New Puritan brief is to penalise those who make poor choices on behalf of the rest of society - in this case the gas - guzzling , emissions - generating Montessori wagons that choke our town centres .
In Paris , the well - supported rage against this particular machine comes in the form of Les Degonfles ( The Deflated ) , a clandestine team who , in the dead of night , run round deflating the tyres of SUVs and splattering them with mud .
Les Degonfles aim to deflate about 40 SUVs a week .
In the UK , the job of deterring SUVs has fallen to Sian Berry , a rational and reasonable young woman who runs the Alliance Against Urban 4x4s and spends her spare time posting offending vehicles with fake fixed penalty notices .
Granted , this is lowintensity warfare ; but if governments wo n't legislate - only Sweden has brought in plans to ban non-registered 4x4s , in Stockholm - then the New Puritans will go it alone , with only their principles for company .
Admittedly , these principles vary .
But you can guess that a New Puritan does not binge drink , smoke , buy big brands , take cheap flights , eat junk food , have multiple sexual partners , waste money on designer clothes , grow beyond their optimum weight , subscribe to celebrity magazines , drive a flash car , or live to watch television .
And the list is likely to grow longer : research by the Future Foundation has found that 80 per cent of people agreed that alcohol should not be allowed at work at all ; 25 per cent said snack products should not be offered at business meetings ; more than a third agreed that we should think twice before giving sweets and chocolates as gifts to family and friends , and a further 25 per cent thought that ' the government should start a campaign to discourage people from drinking alcohol on their own at home ' ( this rises to 41 per cent in Scotland ) .
These are all statistics that I find comforting , but it 's obvious that this wave of opprobrium - bearers makes Jim Murphy more than a little uncomfortable - his original report on the phenomenon bears the pejorative title Assault on Pleasure .
' Ten years ago , many of these propositions would have been preposterous , ' he says .
' My mother , for instance , would have thought it a terrible blow not to give a child sweeties ; now the debate centres around whether it's in any way acceptable to do that .
And by 2015 , ' he ventures , ' global tourism could be in decline , because taking a flight to Costa Rica is considered a terribly irresponsible thing to do . '
Murphy also points out that a significant proportion of people agree that ' food companies should be made to pay a levy to the NHS for the cost of treating obesity ' .
These are sobering thoughts for anyone connected to the pleasure market .
But if you possess a shred of New Puritanical sensibility you 're likely to think that the big brands - the junk - food peddlers , alcohol promoters , cigarette pushers and even the supermarkets - had it coming .
That for too long these kinds of businesses reaped vast profits while riding roughshod over community spirit , public health and morality .
The lack of a liberal backlash against increased policing of previously uncontroversial pleasures is significant , too .
And it 's a trade - off the New Puritans are clearly willing to make : extra nannying for extra peace of mind .
This is actually the sign of a maturing civil society , according to Dr Peter Whybrow , director of UCLA 's Institute of Neuroscience and Human Behaviour , and author of American Mania : When More is not Enough , which charts what happens to society when we are pushed to the limits of our physical and mental tolerance .
' Civilisation offers no gifts to liberty , ' he quotes from Sigmund Freud 's Thirties essay , Civilisation and Its Discontents .
Whybrow suggests that we use America as a cautionary tale , 'an indication of what happens when citizens turn into consumers , solely driven by immediate reward , and when consumerist impulses become substitutes for communities . '
Precisely the disturbing scenario that might prompt you to go and seek comfort in a ditch , which is what Hugh Sawyer has done .
The 32 - year - old Oxford law graduate 's lifestyle statement about over - consumption and waste has made him a New Puritan poster boy .
His soubriquet , Ditch Monkey , and eponymous website have also caught the imagination of the media , who have followed his commute between the ditch he calls home and his office at Sotheby 's - he hopes one day to be an art dealer .
There are plenty of people who will view Sawyer 's elective Puritanism as a bit of a stunt , but equally it could be argued that it 's precisely the kind of attention - grabbing gesture that will help New Puritans get their way .
For although there is a perception that the Labour government is at the vanguard of an assault on all kinds of pleasure , and ready to legislate at a moment 's notice , is that really the case ?
Not really , says Sunder Katwala , general secretary of the Fabian Society : ' There are no immediate levers to pull in Westminster and Whitehall to increase public health , for example , or reduce teenage pregnancy rates .
Politics is itself in too poor health , ' he adds .
' There is little legitimacy in seeking collective solutions to social problems , even when the outcome of individual choices does n't work for most people or proves to be simply unsustainable .
Many of the most important public issues of the next few years - the health effects of obesity , increased congestion on the roads , and climate change - depend on whether individuals will change their own behaviour . '
If New Puritans want to spread their ' good ' behaviour to the population at large then , it could be argued , they need a populist approach , which is where Jamie Oliver comes in .
He might not be a fully fledged NP - what with the enormous bank balance and supermarket adverts - but his campaign to kick the junk out of school dinners has had a knock - on effect rivalled only by Morgan Spurlock 's Supersize Me , which took McDonald 's to task .
When education secretary Ruth Kelly announced a nationwide ban on junk food in schools from next September , in canteens as well as vending machines , the Jamie Oliver effect was very much in evidence .
So , with a few grand gestures and some high - profile converts New Puritanism offers a powerful escape route from our impulsive , reward - driven lifestyles .
It might just have the potential to stave off the horrors promised by an out - of - control consumerist culture in which , according to agrarian essayist Wendell Berry , ' The histories of all products will be lost .
The degradation of products and places , producers and consumers is inevitable . '
Consider the New Puritan philosophy from this point of view and it can look like a blueprint for a rather noble kind of empowerment .
Our New Puritans become less like neurotic killjoys and more like early adopters , with an enhanced ability to recognise the pitfalls of contemporary life .
A battle is shaping up between the New Puritans and the old guard libertarians , but at the moment it 's a vastly uneven one .
The New Puritans might be a trend , but it 's still a small one , swimming against a seemingly inexorable consumerist river .
But New Puritans should n't be deterred .
As Oliver Cromwell , their ancestral spiritual leader , put it : ' A few honest men [ and let 's add in women for contemporary relevance ] are better than numbers . '
Katie Harrison 26 , Bristol
Dislikes smokers , junk food , fat people 's excuses Likes hard work , organic food
While Generation X was busy firing up pointless dotcom businesses , the New Puritans were watching and learning .
After university , and a stint travelling in India , Harrison became an ethical entrepreneur , setting up Frank Water , a not - for - profit natural spring water company .
Her business , like her life , is built on hard work , not bank loans .
' I feel very strongly that you should live within your means , ' she says softly but forcibly - a combination she does rather well .
She now feels that it's not enough to try to educate people and that the only way forward is to regulate smoking and bad diets .
' There should be really skinny entrances to McDonald's .
If you can't fit through the door that would be a pretty good indication that you should n't go in at all . '
Conceding that this might be taking the tough love approach too far , she admits she 'd settle for taxes ' on foods that have high percentages of sugar or fat , extra revenue which would then subsidise production , preferably local and organic , of healthier food ' .
She does n't have much truck with excuses either : ' I get quite annoyed when I see really obese people complaining that diets do n't work .
They always seem to blame their weight on something .
But it 's too much junk food , carbohydrate or whatever - and their lifestyle - that 's causing them to be like that .
It 's time that we took responsibility for our own actions . '
Louise Doherty 19 , Nottingham
Dislikes cars , pregnant smokers , ready meals , meat Likes exercise , staying - in , being responsible , being thin
Even Louise Doherty 's mum thinks she should get out more : ' Last time I was home from university she said , " Why are n't you going out and having fun like most 19 - year - olds ?
You 're turning into an old woman . " '
But Louise remains committed to her mission to be more ethically aware , health - conscious and ultimately responsible , which means fewer nights at the pub .
Some of this can be attributed to Ben , her boyfriend , a 27 - year - old fitness instructor .
' He 's got very different views on how we should all live , and like me he appreciates that Western culture has a lot of problems , ' explains Doherty .
The influence runs both ways , however : soon after they met , she made Ben get rid of his gas - guzzling vintage Jag .
Doherty has always had strong views , especially about health and responsibility .
And a couple of years ago , when a friend of a friend continued to smoke throughout her pregnancy , she felt compelled to intervene .
' I 'd go to the health centre and get leaflets on quitting smoking , pointing out the danger she was inflicting on this child .
I suppose I was confident that she would start to see it from the point of view of the baby , but she did n't want to know .
She was being incredibly selfish . '
When it comes to her own health , she takes as few risks as possible .
When her mum was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of years ago ( she has now recovered ) they both went vegan - not easy to do when her flatmates at university exist on ready meals .
' I much prefer to cook from scratch , ' she says .
' It tastes better , it 's time well spent and it avoids chemically infused food .
It 's all about taking responsibility .
If I look after myself , and my diet , then I wo n't get fat , I 'll minimise the chances of getting ill and I wo n't be a financial strain on the NHS . '
Alasdair Sim 27 , London
Dislikes alcohol , air travel , dogs , disposable coffee cups
Likes economising , cycling , selfsufficiency
It 's difficult to imagine anyone less likely to enjoy a Club 18 - 30 holiday in Cyprus than Ali Sim , who is rarely seen without his sustainable coffee travel mug and whose preferred mode of transport is a push bike .
But nevertheless that 's where he ended up a few years ago , when he let his mate book a cheap holiday .
While it was n't necessarily an epiphany , it did bring him face to face with the type of alcohol - fuelled rampage he detests .
' It was horrendous , ' he says , with a hint of lingering trauma .
' We basically only went to the induction , before breaking away from the group .
I 'm not sure why people put themselves through that experience .'
At least it 's unlikely to happen again , not least because these days he would n't even board the plane in the first place : ' I would never just get on a flight and go to Paris for the weekend - I do n't care how cheap it is .'
And he has no qualms about explaining his no-flight arguments to friends and acquaintances either .
' I think they should think about their actions , too .
I 'm not sure I 've converted anybody yet , but I 'm going to keep on trying . '
Any lectures are no doubt mitigated by his gentle demeanour - he sounds like a less - hyper Ewan McGregor .
The son of a Glasgow lawyer , Sim is thankful for his privileged upbringing and remains close to his parents , although he thinks it 's ridiculous that his mother owns five dogs - which waste resources .
He has never had any plans to follow a conventional lifestyle , particularly the part that sees many of his contemporaries ' spending all their money going out , getting bladdered .
I aspire to be someone who produces my own food , not spending very much money on things and boozing it all .
The simple life , I suppose .
I 'm thankful for the lifestyle my dad gave me growing up , but I do n't want to emulate it . '
Miraculously , for someone living in central London , with a not very lucrative job - Sim works as a Green Space ranger - he actually manages to save money every month , proving what you can do when you opt not to keep up with the Joneses .
' I actually find the drive to have new stuff all the time quite unpalatable , ' he says .
' The problem is that people are not asking enough questions ; they just buy into the brand and assume everything 's going to be all right - and it is n't . '

Essay : The Database Model is the Domain Model Wednesday , August 23 , 2006
Preface
To work with data on a semantic basis , it 's often useful to specify general definitions of the elements a given portion of logic will work with .
For example , an order system works with , among other elements , Order elements .
To be able to define how this logic works , a definition of the concept Order is practical :
We will be able to describe the functionality of the system by specifying actions on Order elements and supply with that a definition of that element Order .
This Order element contains other elements ( values like the OrderID and ShippingDate ) and has a tight connection with another element , OrderRow , which in turn also contains other elements .
You can even say that Order contains a set of OrderRow elements like it contains value elements .
Is there a difference between the containment of the value OrderID and the containment of the set of OrderRow elements ?
The answer to this question is important for the way the concept of Order is implemented further when the order system is realized with program code .
The Entity 's Habitat
Looking at the relational model developed by Dr. E.F. Codd [ 1 ] , they should be seen as two separated elements : Order and OrderRow , which have a relationship , and the elements itself form a relation based on the values they contain , like OrderID .
However , looking at the Domain Model , pioneered by Martin Fowler [ 2 ] and others , it does n't have to be that way .
You could see the OrderRow elements in a set as a value of Order and work with Order as a unit , including the OrderRow elements .
What 's an Entity ?
In 1970 , Dr. Peter Chen defined the concept entity for his Entity Relationship Model [ 3 ] , which builds on top of Codd 's Relational Model .
The concept of the entity is very useful in defining what Order and OrderRow look like in a relational model .
Chen defined Entity as
Entity and Entity set .
Let e denote an entity which exists in our minds .
Entities are classified into different entity sets such as EMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and DEPARTMENT .
There is a predicate associated with each entity set to test whether an entity belongs to it .
For example , if we know an entity is in the entity set EMPLOYEE , then we know that it has the properties common to the other entities in the entity set EMPLOYEE .
Among these properties is the afore - mentioned test predicate .
By using the Entity Relationship Model , we 're able to define entities like Order and OrderRow and place them into a relational model , which defines our database .
Using Eric Evans ' definition of Entity , however , we are far away from the relational model , which I think comes down to the following definition : " An object that is tracked through different states or even across different implementations . "
The important difference between Evans ' definition and Chen 's definition of an entity is that Chen 's definition is that of an abstract element ; it exists without having state or even a physical representation .
With Evans , the entity physically exists ; it 's an object , with state and behavior .
With the abstract entity definitions , we 're not influenced by the context in which an entity 's data is used , as the interpretation of the data of an entity is not done by the entity itself ( as there is no behavior in the entity ) but by external logic .
To avoid misinterpretations , we 're going to use the definition of Dr. Peter Chen .
The reason for this choice is because it defines the abstract term for things we run into every day , both physical items and virtual items , without looking at context or contained data as the definition is what 's important .
It is therefore an ideal candidate to describe elements in relational models like Customer or Order .
A physical Customer is then called an entity instance .
Where Does an Entity Live ?
Every application has to deal with a phenomenon called state .
State is actually a term that is too generic .
Most applications have several different kinds of state : user state and application state are the most important ones .
User state can be seen as the state of all objects / data stores that hold data on a per-user basis ( that is , have " user scope " ) at a given time T .
An example of user state is the contents of the Session object of a given user in an ASP .
NET application at a given moment .
Application state is different from user state ; it can be seen as the state of all objects / data stores that hold data on an application scope basis .
An example can be the contents of a database shared among all users of a given Web application at a given moment .
It is not wise to see the user state as a subset of the application state :
When the user is in the middle of a 5 - step wizard , the user state holds the data of step one and two ; however , nothing in the application state has changed ; that will be the case after the wizard is completed .
It is very important to define where an entity instance lives : in the application state or in the user state .
If the entity instance lives in the user state , it 's local to the user owning the user state , and other users can't see the entity and therefore can not use it .
When an entity instance is created , like an order is physically created in the aforementioned order system , it is living inside the actual application ; it is part of the application state .
However , during the order creation process , when the user fills in the order form , for example , the order is not actually created ; a temporary set of data is living inside the user 's state , which will become the order after it is finalized .
We say the entity instance gets persisted when it is actually created in the application state .
You can have different types of application state : a shared , in - memory system that holds entity instances , or you can have a database in which entity instances are stored .
Most software applications dealing with entity instances use some kind of persistent storage to store their entity instance data to make it survive power outages and other things causing the computer to go down , losing its memory contents .
If the application uses a persistent storage , it is likely to call the data in the persistent storage the actual application state : when the application is shut down , for example , for maintenance , the application does n't lose any state : no order entity instance is lost , and it is still available when the application is brought back up .
An entity instance in memory is therefore a mirror of the actual entity instance in the persistent storage , and application logic uses that mirror to alter the actual entity instance that lives in the persistent storage .
Mapping Classes onto Tables versus Mapping Tables onto Classes
O/R Mapping deals with the transformation between the relational model and the object model : that is , transforming objects into entity instances in the persistent storage and back .
Globally , it can be defined as the following :
A field in a class in the object model is related to an attribute of an entity in the relational model and vice versa .
A chicken - egg problem arises : what follows what ?
Do you first define the entity classes ( classes representing entity definitions ) , like an Order class representing the Order entity ) and create relational model entities with attributes using these classes , or do you define a relational model first and use that relational model when you define your entity classes ?
As with almost everything , there is no clear " this is how you do it " answer to that question .
" It depends " is probably the best answer that can be given .
If you 're following the Domain Model , it is likely you start with domains , which you use to define classes , some probably in an inheritance hierarchy .
Using that class model , you simply need a relational model to store the data , which could even be one table with a primary key consisting of the object ID , a binary blob field for the object , and a couple of metadata elements describing the object .
It will then be natural to map a class onto elements in the relational model after you 've made sure the relational model is constructed in a way that it serves the object model best .
If you start with the relational model and you construct an E/R model , for example , it is likely you want to map an entity in your relational model onto a class .
This is different from the approach of the Domain Model , for instance , because the relational model does n't support inheritance hierarchies : you can't model a hierarchy like Person <- Employee <-
Manager such that it also represents a hierarchy .
It is , of course , possible to create a relational model that can be semantically interpreted as an inheritance hierarchy ; however , it does n't represent an inheritance hierarchy by definition .
This is the fundamental difference between the two approaches .
Starting with classes and then working your way to the database uses the relational model and the database just as a place to store data , while starting with the relational model and working your way towards classes uses the classes as a way to work with the relational model in an OO fashion .
As we 've chosen to use Chen 's way of defining entities , we 'll use the approach of defining the relational model first and working our way up to classes .
Later on in the " The Ideal World " section we 'll see how to bridge the two approaches .
Working with Data in an OO Fashion
Entity - representing classes are the developer 's way to define entities in code , just as a physically implemented E/R model with tables defines the entities in the persistent storage .
Using the O/R Mapping technique discussed in the previous section , the developer is able to manipulate entity instances in the persistent storage using in - memory mirrors placed in entity class instances .
This is always a batch - style process , as the developer works disconnected from the persistent storage .
The controlling environment is the O/R Mapper , which controls the link between entity instances in the persistent storage and the in -memory mirrors inside entity class instances .
A developer might ask the O/R Mapper to load a given set of Order instances into memory .
This results in , for each Order instance in the persistent storage , a mirror inside an entity class instance .
The developer is now able to manipulate each entity instance mirror through the entity class instance or to display the entity instance mirrors in a form or offer it as output of a service .
Manipulated entity instance mirrors have to be persisted to make the changes persistent .
From the developer 's point of view , this looks like saving the manipulated entity instance data inside the objects to the persistent storage , like a user saves a piece of text written in a word processor to a file .
The O/R Mapper is performing this save action for the developer .
But because we 're working with mirrors , the actual action the O/R Mapper is performing is updating the entity instance in the persistent storage with the changes stored in the mirror received from the developer 's code .
The relationships between the entities in the relational model are represented in code by functionality provided by the O/R Mapper .
This allows the developer to traverse relationships from one entity instance to another .
For example , in the Order system , loading a Customer instance into memory allows the developer to traverse to the Customer 's Order entity instances by using functionality provided by the O/R Mapper , be it a collection object inside the Customer object or a new request to the O/R Mapper for Order instances related to the given Customer instance .
This way of working with entities is rather static : constructing entities at runtime through a combination of attributes from several related entities does not result in entity - representing classes , as classes have to be present at compile time .
This does n't mean the entity instances constructed at runtime through combinations of attributes ( for example , through a select with an outer join ) can't be loaded into memory ; however , they do n't represent a persistable entity , but rather a virtual entity .
This extra layer of abstraction is mostly used in a read - only scenario , such as in reporting applications and read - only lists , where a combination of attributes from related entities is often required .
An example of a definition for such a list is the combination of all attributes of the Order entity and the " company name " attribute from the Customer entity .
To successfully work with data in an OO fashion , it is key that the functionality controlling the link between in - memory mirrors of entity instances and the physical entity instances offers enough flexibility so that reporting functionality and lists of combined set of attributes are definable and loadable into memory without needing to use another application just for that more dynamic way of using data in entity instances .
Functional Research as the Application Foundation
To efficiently set up the relational model , the mappings between entity definitions in the relational model and entity representing classes and these classes itself , it is key to reuse the results from work done early in the software development project , the Functional Research Phase .
This phase is typical for a more classical approach to software development .
In this phase , the functional requirements and system functionality are determined , defined in an abstract way and documented .
Over the years , several techniques have been defined to help in this phase ; one of them is NIAM [ 4 ] , which is further developed by T.A. Halpin [ 5 ] to Object Role Modeling ( ORM ) .
NIAM and ORM make it easy to communicate functional research findings with the client in easy to understand sentences like " Customer has Order " and " Order belongs to Customer . "
These sentences are then used to define entities and relationships in an abstract NIAM / ORM model .
Typically , a visual tool is used for this , such as Microsoft Visio .
The Importance of Functional Research Results
The advantage of modeling the research findings with techniques like NIAM or ORM is that the abstract model both documents the research findings during the functional research phase and at the same time it is the source for the relational model the application is going to work with .
Using tools like Microsoft Visio , a relational model can be generated by generating an E/R model from an NIAM / ORM model , which can be used to construct a physical relational model in a database system .
The metadata forming the definition of the relational model in the database system can then be used to generate classes and construct mappings .
The advantage of this is that the class hierarchy the developers work with has a theoretical basis in the research performed at the start of the project .
This means that when something in the design of the application changes , such as a piece of functionality , the same path can be followed : the NIAM model changes , the relational model is adjusted with the new E/R model created with the updated NIAM model , and the classes are adjusted to comply to the new E/R model .
The other way around is also true : to find a reason for code constructs the developer has to work with .
For example , for code constructs to traverse relationships between entity instance objects , you only have to follow back the path from the class to the functional research results and the theoretical basis for the code constructs is revealed .
This strong connection between a theoretical basis and actual code is key to a successful , maintainable software system .
Functional Processes as Data Consumers and Location of Business Logic
As the real entity definitions live in the relational model , inside the database , and in - memory instances of entities are just mirrors of real instances of entities in the database , there is no place for behavior , or Business Logic rules , in these entities .
Of course , adding behavior to the entity classes is easy .
The question is whether this is logical , when entity classes represent entity definitions in the relational model .
The answer depends on the category of the Business Logic you want to add to the entity as behavior .
There are roughly three categories :
Attribute - oriented Business Logic Single-entity - oriented Business Logic Multi-entity - oriented Business Logic
Attribute - oriented Business Logic is the category that contains rules like OrderId > 0 .
These are very simple rules that act like constraints placed on a single entity field .
Rules in this category can be enforced when an entity field is set to a value .
The category of single - entity - oriented Business Logic contains rules like ShippingDate >= OrderDate , and those also act like constraints .
Rules in this category can be enforced when an entity is loaded into an entity object in memory , saved into the persistent storage , or to test if an entity is valid in a given context .
The multi-entity - oriented Business Logic category contains rules spanning more than one entity : for example , the rule to check if a Customer is a Gold Customer .
To make that rule true , it has to consult Order entities related to that Customer and Order Detail entities related to these Order entities .
All three categories have dependencies on the context the entity is used in , although not all rules in a given category are context - dependent rules .
Attribute - oriented Business Logic is the category with the most rules that are not bound to the context the entity is used in , and it is a good candidate to add to the entity class as behavior .
Single - entity - oriented Business Logic ) is often not a good candidate to add to the entity class as behavior , because much of the rules in that category , which are used to make an entity valid in a given context , can and will change when the entity is used in another context .
Rules in the multi-entity - oriented Business Logic category span more than one entity and are therefore not placeable in a single entity , besides the fact they 're too bound to the context in which they 're used .
Pluggable Rules
To keep an entity usable as a concept that is n't bound to a given context , the problem with context - bound Business Logic rules in the category attribute - oriented Business Logic and the category single - entity - oriented Business Logic can be solved with pluggable rules .
Pluggable rules are objects that contain Business Logic rules and that are plugged into an entity object at runtime .
The advantage of this is that the entity classes are not tied to a context they are used in but can be used in any context the system design asks for : just create per-context a set of pluggable rules objects , or even more per-entity , and depending on the context state , rules can be applied to the entity by simply setting an object reference .
The processes that decide which rules objects to plug into entities are the processes maintaining the context the entity is used in : the processes representing actual business processes that are called functional processes .
Functional Processes
In the previous section , The Importance of Functional Research Results , the functional research phase was described , and the point was made concerning how important it is to keep a strong link between researched functionality and actual implementation of that functionality .
Often a system has to automate certain business processes , and the functional research will describe these processes in an abstract form .
To keep the link between research and implementation as tight as possible , it 's a common step to model the actual implementation after the abstract business process , resulting in classes that we 'll call functional processes because they 're more or less data - less classes with sole functionality .
The functionality processes are the ideal candidates in which to implement multi-entity - oriented Business Logic rules .
In our example of the Gold Customer , a process to upgrade a Customer to a Gold Customer can be implemented as a functional process that consumes a Customer entity object and its Order entity objects , updates some fields of the Customer entity , and persists that Customer entity after the upgrade process is complete .
Furthermore , because functional processes actually perform the steps of a business process , they are also the place where a context is present in which entities are consumed and the only correct place to decide which rules to plug into an entity object at a given time T for a given context state .
The Ideal World Using NIAM / ORM for Classes and Databases
For most people , reality is not always in sync with what we expect to be an ideal world , and everyday software development is no exception to that .
In the functional research paragraph , physical relational model metadata were used to produce mappings and classes to get to the entity class definitions for the developer to work with .
A more ideal approach would be if the NIAM / ORM model could also be used to generate entity classes directly , avoiding a transformation from metadata to class definition .
It would make the ultimate goal , where the design of the application is as usable as the application itself , appear to be one step closer .
When that ideal world will be a reality , or even if it will be a reality , is hard to say as a lot of the factors that influence how a software project could be made a success can be found in areas outside the world of computer science .
Nevertheless , it 's interesting to see what can be accomplished today , with techniques developed today , like model - driven software development .

Why is it that amnesia patients can't remember their names or addresses , but they do remember how to hold a fork ?
It 's because memories come in many flavors , says Fred Helmstetter , professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee ( UWM ) .
Remembering what is not the same as remembering how .
" Different circuits in the brain are activated when you remember what you had for breakfast this morning versus when you fell off a bicycle in second grade , " says Helmstetter , who researches the brain 's regulation of memories , emotions and learning .
And it 's those distinctive connections in the brain 's communication network that differentiate between the " aware , " or conscious , memories and the unconscious ones , some of which Helmstetter calls " emotional memories . "
Selectivity is one of the many aspects of memory that intrigues him , and it's key to his research into the specific brain process that is responsible for making you aware of what you 've learned or remembered .
Dissecting the mechanisms behind emotional memory is important because the region of the brain that governs this also controls fear and anxiety .
That is why an emotional memory , such as a traumatic car accident , can activate the autonomic nervous system , causing bodily responses like an increase in heart rate , sweating and blood pressure – even if you do n't realize it .
So the research has implications for a variety of illnesses , from Alzheimer 's disease to anxiety disorders .
Unraveling the differences between kinds of memories , Helmstetter believes , depends on understanding the chemical changes that happen in the brain at the molecular level .
Helmstetter 's work has already shown how memories are stored in certain neurons .
Now he wants to know more about the molecular players that make the brain 's whole network of constantly changing memory connections possible .
His extramural funding has come from sources such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health .
Once thought to be static , the adult brain is now known to be the opposite – constantly forming or breaking neural connections and growing new cells .
It happens automatically when you exercise , take drugs or recover from certain illnesses .
But it also occurs by simply thinking :
The brain reroutes its communication pathways and its genetic instructions in response to experience .
" When you first learn something , such as how to ride a bike , there is an actual physical change in the brain – the cells make proteins they did n't make before , " Helmstetter says .
The brain 's capacity for dynamic states , called neuroplasticity , or just plasticity , makes tracking the circuitry behind memories a task of near - epic proportions .
Hundreds of variables come into play .
Consider , for example , that a lot of memory formation and storage goes on simultaneously , some of it consciously and some of it unconsciously .
And , in the time it takes to commit something to memory , hundreds of other experiences are being sorted and perhaps stored .
A message passed between two neurons is like person - to - person e-mail rather than a listserv .
It does not trigger a global response in the brain 's processing network .
Sound complicated ?
" That 's right , " says Helmstetter .
" Plasticity is functionally infinite . "
So how can scientists investigate under such a tempest of changing circumstances ?
It would be impossible to track all the neural adjustments marking every new condition , Helmstetter concedes .
So he uses a mix of approaches .
One weapon in his investigative arsenal is an imaging technique that produces a 3 - D picture of the parts of the human brain that are active during memory formation or recall .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , Helmstetter can " map " the anatomy of plasticity because it allows him to actually see , in real time , where cells are more active and use more energy .
But since it is n't yet possible to observe which genes turn on and off while humans call up their memories , he does the next best thing :
He studies what happens in rats .
He further simplifies the experiments by modifying the expression of whole families of genes at once .
" Our initial approach has been to use broad strokes , " he says .
" We suppress the whole compliment of genes involved in memory formation rather than chasing each individual gene and its expression . "
The rat results are then compared with the information gleaned from the memory imaging in humans to see if there 's a correlation .
The memory circuitry is the same in both organisms , he says .
But of potentially more value is finding the exact role that genes and proteins play in the brain in response to stimuli , he says , because genes also are affected by environment .
What he 's discovered suggests he is on the right track .
Storage of a memory is a time - dependent endeavor .
The process of making a memory involves a set of genes that are expressed or come " on " right away , he says .
" We now look at time versus structure , " he says .
" And we 're focused on a set of proteins that appear to be required in several parts of your brain right after something important happens to you . "

What makes cancer cells different – and how to kill them
What makes cancer cells different – and how to kill them
New Scientist has received an unprecedented amount of interest in this story from readers .
If you would like up - to - date information on any plans for clinical trials of DCA in patients with cancer , or would like to donate towards a fund for such trials , please visit the site set up by the University of Alberta and the Alberta Cancer Board .
We will also follow events closely and will report any progress as it happens .
Update , 16 May 2011 : If you ’ve just heard about this story , please read this recent update too .

It sounds almost too good to be true : a cheap and simple drug that kills almost all cancers by switching off their “ immortality ” .
The drug , dichloroacetate ( DCA ) , has already been used for years to treat rare metabolic disorders and so is known to be relatively safe .
It also has no patent , meaning it could be manufactured for a fraction of the cost of newly developed drugs .
Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada , and his colleagues tested DCA on human cells cultured outside the body and found that it killed lung , breast and brain cancer cells , but not healthy cells .
Tumours in rats deliberately infected with human cancer also shrank drastically when they were fed DCA - laced water for several weeks .
DCA attacks a unique feature of cancer cells : the fact that they make their energy throughout the main body of the cell , rather than in distinct organelles called mitochondria .
This process , called glycolysis , is inefficient and uses up vast amounts of sugar .
Until now it had been assumed that cancer cells used glycolysis because their mitochondria were irreparably damaged .
However , Michelakis ’s experiments prove this is not the case , because DCA reawakened the mitochondria in cancer cells .
The cells then withered and died ( Cancer Cell , DOI : 10.1016/j.ccr.2006.10.020 ) .
Michelakis suggests that the switch to glycolysis as an energy source occurs when cells in the middle of an abnormal but benign lump do n’t get enough oxygen for their mitochondria to work properly ( see diagram ) .
In order to survive , they switch off their mitochondria and start producing energy through glycolysis .
Crucially , though , mitochondria do another job in cells : they activate apoptosis , the process by which abnormal cells self - destruct .
When cells switch mitochondria off , they become “ immortal ” , outliving other cells in the tumour and so becoming dominant .
Once reawakened by DCA , mitochondria reactivate apoptosis and order the abnormal cells to die .
“ The results are intriguing because they point to a critical role that mitochondria play : they impart a unique trait to cancer cells that can be exploited for cancer therapy , ” says Dario Altieri , director of the University of Massachusetts Cancer Center in Worcester .
The phenomenon might also explain how secondary cancers form .
Glycolysis generates lactic acid , which can break down the collagen matrix holding cells together .
This means abnormal cells can be released and float to other parts of the body , where they seed new tumours .
DCA can cause pain , numbness and gait disturbances in some patients , but this may be a price worth paying if it turns out to be effective against all cancers .
The next step is to run clinical trials of DCA in people with cancer .
These may have to be funded by charities , universities and governments : pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to pay because they can’t make money on unpatented medicines .
The pay - off is that if DCA does work , it will be easy to manufacture and dirt cheap .
Paul Clarke , a cancer cell biologist at the University of Dundee in the UK , says the findings challenge the current assumption that mutations , not metabolism , spark off cancers .
“ The question is : which comes first ? ” he says .

: Troubled pop star Britney Spears is back in rehab for the third time .
Her manager Larry Rudolph confirmed she had gone back into the Promises centre in Malibu on Wednesday night , just hours after checking out .
Mr Rudolph 's comments followed a report on showbiz website TMZ.com that claimed the shaven - headed pop princess was back in rehab for what should be a 35 - to 40 - day stay .
Now the mother - of - two is back at an unidentified facility for what should be a 35 to 40 day stay , according to showbiz website TMZ.com .

As a result a planned emergency family law court hearing called by Spears ' estranged husband Kevin Federline has been cancelled , it reported .
Yesterday , she left the Promises treatment centre in Malibu after 24 hours as her estranged husband Kevin Federline was granted an emergency court hearing over custody of their two young sons .
Spears was so worried about rapper Kevin Federline 's action she immediately checked out of rehab and headed straight for her lawyers in Beverly Hills , where she was spotted chain - smoking and peering anxiously out of the office window .
Scroll down for more ...
On the way there were extraordinary scenes with paparazzi descending on her car whenever traffic lights forced it to stop .
The custody battle intensified amid reports that Spears , 25 , could be on the brink of suicide .
There are claims she walked in front of a speeding car and then threatened to overdose on an anti-depressant .

Federline , 28 , is attempting to win sole custody of the children , Jayden James , five months , and 17 - month - old Sean Preston .
It is not known what issue he plans to raise , but a Superior Court spokesman confirmed the session would take place today .
The spokesman added : " Our best information is he will be here ; she wo n't .
But anything is possible . "
After months of wild behaviour from Spears , the attempted suicide claims appeared in the National Enquirer .
A source told the tabloid that she rowed with Federline on Valentine 's Day , adding that she had been hoping for a reconciliation , but he said he was taking her to court in a battle for the children and wanted a hair follicle for drug testing .
" Britney was crying and said she would kill herself if she lost the boys , " a source told the Enquirer .
" She started pulling her hair and told Kevin she would cut it all off before anyone touched it . "
The Enquirer said Spears 's family immediately put her under watch .
" But during the night she escaped and tried to walk into oncoming traffic , " said the source .
" Britney said she wanted to kill herself .
She later grabbed a bottle of Xanax and said she'd take the whole bottle - she did n't care what happened to her . "
After shaving her head at the weekend , Spears has been spotted around Hollywood wearing a cheap blonde wig .
Psychologists warn her behaviour could be more than just a cry for help .
" Britney 's family are terrified she 'll end up like Anna Nicole Smith - on a cold slab in a morgue , leaving her young sons without a mother , " said the source .
" She 's on the same self - destructive path . "

New ways to give the finger Monday , December 18 , 2006 The Snake Charmer
Make a fist with your left hand and hold it , knuckles out , in front of your chest .
Grab your Punji flute in your right hand and begin to play traditional Indian snake charming music .
Rock the Punji side to side as you play .
( Fig 1a )
Slowly raise the middle finger of your left hand , also rocking side to side , until it is fully extended .
( Fig 1 b )
The Bad Reception
Make a fist with your right hand and hold it to your right ear .
Act as if you are in the midst of a phone call .
( Fig 2a )
Then pretend as if you have run into an area of weak signal strength and the quality of your phone call is suffering .
Perhaps saying , “ What ?
What ?
I ca n’t hear you , ” will help illustrate your dilemma .
Next , say , “ Hold on , let me put antenna up . ”
With your left hand , grab the tip of the middle finger on your right hand and raise it to its full extension .
( Fig 2 b ) Finally , with your middle finger still extended , say to your enemy , “ He wants to talk to you ” and hand over your " phone . "
The best part is , there 's nobody on the " phone , " it 's just your middle finger in his retarded face !
The Usual Suspects
Make a fist with your hand and hold it about a foot in front of your face .
Raise your pinky , look at if for a second , shake your head and say , “ No , no that ’s not the guy . ” ( Fig. 3a ) Next , raise your ring finger and repeat the previous steps .
( Fig.3 b )
Do the same for your middle finger .
( Fig 3 c ) Next , raise your index finger and exclaim , ( Fig. 3d ) “ WAIT , go back to that last guy . ”
Lower your index finger and raise your middle finger again .
Say , “ I missed it the first time around but that 's him .
That ’s the guy .
I ’d recognize that Fuck You anywhere . ” ( Fig. 3e )
The Curl
Lower both your arms to the side of your body and extend your middle fingers .
Slowly , and with a lot of feigned effort , raise both arms as if curling a barbell .
( Fig 4a )
For added effect shout out some ‘ pump me up ’ phrases such as , “ GET JACKED ! , ” “ That ’s it , that ’s it , you ’re almost there ! , ” and “ HETERO FOR LIFE ! ”
The Malfunctioning Wolverine
Assume a bellicose posture , as if about to engage in fisticuffs with a super - being .
Say something macho from the greater Wolverine vernacular .
“ It ’s payback time , bub , ” would be a good choice .
( Fig 5a )
At this point , bend your arms and then quickly extend them as if you are causing your adamantium claws to shoot forth from your hands .
Also at this point , extend your middle fingers .
Say , “ Oh no , only two of my claws are working ! ” and hold up your extended middle fingers to your enemy ’s face .
( Fig 5 b )
The Divorce
Extend the index and middle fingers of your right hand and spread them apart .
( Fig 6a )
Make index say , “ I love you . ”
Middle should reply with , “ I love you , let ’s get married . ”
At this point bring your two fingers together so that they are snuggly fitted against each other .
( Fig 6 b ) Say , “ Awwww , how nice . ”
But there 's trouble in paradise ... Slowly separate them as you ad lib a fight between them until they have returned to their starting positions .
( Fig 6 c )
Finally , make index say , “ I ’m leaving you , Middle .
I ’m leaving you and I ’m never coming back ! ”
Lower your index finger , leaving your middle finger extended alone .
( Fig 6d ) Say , “ Fuck you , ” as if calling after index .
Then look into the eyes of your victim and say , “ No , fuck YOU ! ”

BUDAPEST , HUNGARY , March 7 - Omega - 3 fatty acids , found in fatty fish like salmon , are associated with increased grey matter volume in areas of the brain commonly linked to mood and behavior according to a University of Pittsburgh study .
Findings will be presented today by Sarah M. Conklin , Ph.D. , postdoctoral scholar at the Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine Program in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh , at the American Psychosomatic Society 's Annual Meeting , held in Budapest , Hungary .
Animal research has shown that raising omega - 3 intake leads to structural brain changes .
In a separate study presented by Dr. Conklin at the society 's meeting last year , Pitt researchers reported that people who had lower blood levels of omega - 3 fatty acids were more likely to have a negative outlook and be more impulsive .
Conversely , those with higher blood levels of omega - 3s were found to be more agreeable and less likely to report mild or moderate symptoms of depression .
In the study being presented today , the researchers sought to investigate if grey matter volume was proportionally related to long - chain omega - 3 intake in humans , especially in areas of the brain related to mood , helping them attempt to explain the mechanisms behind the improvement in mood often associated with long - chain omega - 3 intake .
Researchers interviewed 55 healthy adult participants to determine their average intake of long - chain omega - 3 fatty acids .
Grey matter volume was evaluated using high - resolution structural MRI .
The researchers discovered that participants who had high levels of long - chain omega - 3 fatty acid intake had higher volumes of grey matter in areas of the brain associated with emotional arousal and regulation - the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex , the right amygdala and the right hippocampus .
While this finding suggests that omega - 3s may promote structural improvement in areas of the brain related to mood and emotion regulation - the same areas where grey matter is reduced in people who have mood disorders such as major depressive disorder - investigators note that more research is needed to determine whether fish consumption actually causes changes in the brain .

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana Pacers guard Stephen Jackson , contending that a new ban on chains worn over clothing is " a racist statement " from the league , wore every long , diamond - studded chain in his collection Tuesday night as a protest .
Jackson voiced no opposition to the bulk of the " business casual " demands in the NBA 's new dress code , but he described the jewelry ban as " attacking young black males . "
" I think it 's a racist statement because a lot of the guys who are wearing chains are my age and are black , " said Jackson , 27 .
" I wore all my jewelry today to let it be known that I 'm upset with it .
" I 'll wear a suit every day .
I think we do need to look more professional because it is a business .
A lot of guys have gotten sloppy with the way they dress .
But it 's one thing to [ enforce a ] dress code and it's another thing if you 're attacking cultures , and that 's what I think they 're doing . "
Jackson made his comments before Tuesday 's home exhibition game against San Antonio , with the four chains he wore to work hanging in his locker -- one sporting his initials , two with a crucifix and a fourth depicting Jesus Christ .
A section in the new dress code listing items players are not allowed to wear on team or league business includes " chains , pendants or medallions worn over the player 's clothing . "
" I know a lot of guys on my team are upset and I have no problem speaking up on it , " Jackson said .
Jackson , though , said he would n't openly defy the rule if it means he keeps " giving money back " in fines .
San Antonio's Tim Duncan , also a critic of the new policy , did not play in Tuesday 's game and sat on the bench wearing an untucked shirt and baggy jeans -- attire that could result in a fine if seen during a regular - season game .
" I think it 's a load of crap , " Duncan told the San Antonio Express - News .
" I understand what they 're trying to do with [ forbidding ] hats and ' do rags and [ retro ] jerseys and stuff .
That 's fine .
But I do n't understand why they would take it to this level .
I think it 's basically retarded .
" I do n't like the direction they 're going , but who am I ? "
Duncan told the newspaper that , in the future , he might choose to stay in the locker room on nights he is n't playing .
A specific range of penalties has yet to be announced , but league officials have already made it clear that violators of the dress code will be fined -- as well as their teams -- with repeat violators subject to suspension .

CES is notorious as an event where this year 's story is the same as last year 's just with better resolution , higher definition and more connectivity .
So when I interviewed a senior member of the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project who told me the group wanted to sell the machine to the general public , " hopefully next year " , then I thought I had a real story on my hands .
The story was published on Wednesday with the headline " Public can buy $ 100 laptop " .
If you look at the story now , however , it has a very different headline .
It now reads " $ 100 laptop could sell to public " .
So why the change ?
Several hours after it was published I received an e-mail from a PR executive at OLPC who told me that there was definitely no plan to sell the laptop .
One frantic call later and it was clear that the " plan " to sell the laptop was no more than a desire , perhaps even just a consideration .
I was told that the executive had mis-spoke .
So what to do ?
My story was written in good faith based on accurate quotes - thankfully I had recorded the interview .
I sent a portion of the audio to the PR to prove I had not acted dishonourably and I made a few changes to the story .
I changed the " plan " to a " possibility " and added a quote from the project 's founder Nicholas Negroponte who said a commercial approach had been " considered " .
If my story had been a TV or radio piece , then there would have been little I could change .
But it was clear that good faith had been present on both side .
The executive had used the wrong words to communicate the project 's actions , giving me the sense it was a plan and more than a possibility .
Of course the outcome could have been different , if the context of the interview had been different .
If it had been Tony Blair teling me he planned to step down next week , only for a PR later to tell me he had mis-spoke , then would we have changed story ?
It 's all about good faith .
One Laptop Per Child is aiming to change the world for the better .
That 's the story , not whether the right modal verb - could , would or will - was used .
Hitler 's sister and associates feature in the documentary
Paula
Wolf was filmed talking about her brother for hour - long ITV documentary Tyranny : The Years of Adolf Hitler , which also interviewed his chauffeur .
It was rediscovered in ITN 's archives as part an ongoing search for footage by the British Film Institute ( BFI ) .
It will be screened from November by the BFI to mark ITV's 50th anniversary .
International search
Paula Wolf , Hitler 's youngest sister who died in 1960 aged 64 , was asked to share personal stories about her brother in the documentary .
Directed by Peter Morley , it also included interviews with Hitler 's associates and fellow employees .
The documentary was discovered by TV historian Dick Fiddy , who traced footage to Germany and the US before finding the full show in London .
Potter 's 1968 drama Shaggy
Dog will also be screened by the BFI
It will be shown alongside Shaggy Dog , an ITV drama by playwright Dennis Potter that was rediscovered by TV enthusiast group Kaleidoscope .
Previously thought destroyed after its only broadcast in 1968 , the 51 - minute show was found earlier this year in the LWT archive at London 's South Bank .
No copies were made of numerous vintage broadcasts due to the expense of making early TV recordings .
The BFI conducts an ongoing search for " lost " footage entitled Missing Believed Wiped .
" We archive as much footage as we can , but we do not have everything , " said BFI spokesman Nick Pearson .
" If people do have original old TV footage dating back a long way , we are always interested to hear from them . "

The front end of a website consists of three layers .
XHTML forms the structural layer , which contains structural , semantic markup and the content of the site .
To this layer you can add a presentation layer ( CSS ) and a behavior layer ( JavaScript ) to make your website more beautiful and user - friendly .
These three layers should remain strictly separate .
For instance , it should be possible to rewrite the entire presentation layer without touching either the structural or the behavior layer .
Despite this strict separation , the presentation and behavior layers need instructions from the structural layer .
They must know where to add that touch of style , when to initiate that smooth bit of behavior .
They need triggers .
CSS triggers are well known .
The class and id attributes allow you to fully control the presentation of your websites .
Although it is possible to work without these triggers , by putting the instructions in inline style attributes , this method of coding is deprecated .
If you want to redefine your site ’s presentation while using them you ’re forced to change the XHTML structural layer , too ; their presence violates the separation of presentation and structure .
JavaScript triggers #section2
The behavior layer should function in exactly the same way .
We should separate behavior and structure by discarding inline event handlers like < code > .
Instead , as with CSS , we should use triggers to tell the script where to deploy the behavior .
The simplest JavaScript trigger is the id attribute :
< div id =" navigation " > < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Link 1</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Link 2</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Link 3</a></li> </ul > </div > var x = document.getElementById(' navigation ' ) ; if ( !x ) return ; var y = x.getElementsByTagName ( 'a ' ) ; for ( var i=0 ;i< y.length ;i++ ) y< i >.
Now the script is triggered by the presence or absence of the id=“ navigation ” .
If it ’s absent nothing happens ( if ( !x ) return ) , but if it ’s present all the link elements that descend from it get a mouseover behavior .
This solution is simple and elegant , and it works in all browsers .
If id s serve your needs , you do n’t have to read the rest of this article .
Advanced triggers #section3
Unfortunately there are situations where you ca n’t use id as a trigger :
An id can be used only once in a document , and sometimes you want to add the same behavior to several ( groups of ) elements .
Occasionally a script needs more information than just “ deploy behavior here . ”
Let ’s take form scripts as an example of both problems .
It would be useful to add form validation triggers to the XHTML , for instance something that says “ this field is required . ”
If we ’d use such a trigger we ’d get a simple script like the one below .
function validateForm ( ) { var x = document .
forms [ 0 ] . elements ; for ( var i=0 ; i[ this field is required ] && !x< i>.value ) // notify user of error } }
But how do we create an XHTML trigger that tells the script a certain field is required ?
Using an id is n’t an option : we need a solution that works on an unlimited amount of form fields .
It would be possible to use the class attribute to trigger the behavior :
< input name = " name " class = " required " /> if ( < strong>x<i>.className == ' required ' && !x [ i ] .value ) // notify user of error
However , the class attribute ’s proper use is defining CSS triggers .
Combining CSS and JavaScript triggers is not impossible , but it can quickly lead to a confused jumble of code :
< input name = " name " class =" largefield required " /> if ( < strong>x<i>.className.indexOf ( ' required ') != - 1 && !x< i>.value )
In my opinion , the class attribute should only be used for CSS .
Classes are XHTML ’s primary triggers for the presentation layer , and making them carry behavior information , too , confuses the issue .
Triggering both layers from the class attribute violates the separation of behavior and presentation , though in the end this remains an issue you have to take your own decision on .
Besides , triggers can grow to be more complicated than just a “ deploy behavior here ” command .
Sometimes you ’ll want to add a value to the trigger .
A trigger value would make the behavior layer much more versatile , since it can now respond to each XHTML element ’s individual requirements instead of mindlessly executing a standard script .
Take a form in which some textareas have a maximum length for their value .
The old MAXLENGTH attribute does n’t work on textareas , so we have to write a script .
In addition , not all textareas in the form have the same maximum length , making it necessary to store the maximum length of each individual textarea somewhere .
We want something like this :
var x = document.getElementsByTagName(' textarea' ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i[ this textarea has a maximum length ] ) x< i>.onkeypress = checkLength ; }function checkLength ( ) { var max = < strong > [ read out maximum length ] ; if ( this.value.length > max ) // notify user of error }
The script needs two bits of information :
Does this textarea have a maximum length ?
This is the general trigger that alerts the script that some behavior is coming up .
What is the maximum length ?
This is the value the script needs to properly check user input .
And it is here that the class - based solution does n’t really serve any more .
Technically it ’s still possible , but the necessary code becomes too complicated .
Take a textarea with a CSS class “ large ” that is required and has a maximum length of 300 characters :
< textarea class = " large required maxlength=300 " > </textarea >
Not only does this example mix presentation and two separate sets of behavior , it also becomes tricky to read out the actual maximum length of the textarea :
var max = < strong>this.className.substring ( this.className.indexOf(' maxlength') +10 ) ; if ( this.value.length > max ) // notify user of error
Note that this bit of code works only when we put the maxlength trigger last in the class value .
If we want to allow a maxlength trigger anywhere in the class value ( because we want to add another trigger with a value , for instance ) the code becomes even more complicated .
The problem#section5
So this is our problem for today .
How do we add good JavaScript triggers that allow us to pass both a general alert ( “ deploy behavior here ” ) and an element - specific value to the script ?
Technically , adding this information to the class attribute is possible , but is it allowed to use this attribute for carrying information it was not designed to carry ?
Does this violate the separation of behavior and presentation ?
Even if you feel there is no theoretical obstacle , it remains a complicated solution that requires complicated JavaScript code .
It is also possible to add the trigger to other existing attributes like lang or dir , but here , again , you ’d use these attributes to carry information they are n’t designed for .
Custom attributes #section6
I opt for another solution .
Let ’s take a second look at the textarea maxlength example .
We need two bits of information :
Does this textarea have a maximum length ?
What is the maximum length ?
The natural , semantic way to express this information is to add an attribute to the textarea :
< textarea class = " large " maxlength = " 300 " > </textarea >
The presence of the maxlength attribute alerts the script to check user input in this textarea , and it can find the maximum length of this specific textarea in the value of the attribute .
As long as we ’re at it we can port the “ required ” trigger to a custom attribute , too .
required =“ true ” , for instance , though any value will do because this trigger just gives a general alert and does n’t carry extra information .
< textarea class =" large " maxlength = " 300 " required =" true " > </textarea >
Technically there ’s no problem .
The W3C DOM getAttribute ( ) method allows us to read out any attribute from any tag .
Only Opera up to version 7.54 does n’t allow us to read out existing attributes ( like src ) on the wrong tag ( like < h2 > ) .
Fortunately later versions of this browser support getAttribute ( ) fully .
So this is my solution :
function validateForm ( ) { var x = document .
forms [ 0 ] .
elements ; for ( var i=0 ;ix < i>.getAttribute ( ' required ') && !x< i>.value ) // notify user of error } }var x = document.getElementsByTagName(' textarea' ) ; for ( var i=0 ;ix < i>.getAttribute (' maxlength ' ) ) x< i>.onkeypress = checkLength ; }function checkLength ( ) { var max = < strong > this.getAttribute (' maxlength ' ) ; if ( this.value.length > max ) // notify user of error }
In my opinion this solution is easy to implement and consistent with the form JavaScript triggers may take : a name / value pair where the presence of the name triggers the behavior and the value gives the script extra information , allowing you to customize the behavior for each individual element .
Finally , adding these triggers to the XHTML would be extremely simple even for novice webmasters .
Custom DTDs#section7
Anyone implementing this solution and running the resulting page through the validator will immediately note a problem .
The validator protests against the presence of the required and maxlength attributes .
It is of course completely correct : the first attribute is not a part of XHTML , while the second one is only valid on < input > elements .
The solution is to make these attributes valid ; to create a custom Document Type Definition ( DTD ) that extends XHTML a bit to include our trigger attributes .
This custom DTD defines our special attributes and their proper place in the document , and the validator obeys by checking the document structure against our special flavor of XHTML .
If the DTD says the attributes are valid , they ’re valid .
If you do n’t know how to create a custom DTD , read J. David Eisenberg ’s aptly named Creating Custom DTDs in this issue , in which he explains everything you need to know .
In my opinion , using custom attributes to trigger the behavior layer — and writing custom DTDs to define these custom attributes correctly — will help to separate behavior and structure and to write simple , efficient scripts .
In addition , once the attributes have been defined and the scripts have been written even the newbiest of webmasters will be able to add these triggers to the XHTML document .
When I took the job at Sun in early 2004 , I had a long talk with John Fowler , about this blog among other things .
John said : “ You might end up happier if you do n’t blog about open - sourcing Java . ”
That was then .
Today ’s story is simple : Unmodified GPL2 for our SE , ME , and EE code .
GPL2 + Classpath exception for the SE libraries .
Javac and HotSpot and JavaHelp code drops today .
The libraries to follow , with pain expected fighting through the encumbrances .
Governance TBD , but external committers are a design goal .
No short - term changes in the TCK or JCP .
There are a ton of presentations and an ( excellent ) FAQ and so on , all to show up at sun.com / opensource / java sometime in the next few hours .
I wanted to add a couple of remarks on areas that stuff does n’t highlight .
Why Free ? · I ’m committed to Open Source but not generally a member of the Free Software movement .
For Java , though , it ’s the only thing that makes sense .
It ’s been given away freely for so long , and it ’s worked its way into so many places , that it should belong to the community , and if anyone figures out how to make it better , they should just bloody well give that discovery back .
So for my money , the GPL ’s the only sane choice .
History ·
There ’s a lot of it , and I do n’t know it , and I like it that way .
I ’ve had a few people say things like “ I ’ll never forgive Sun for what [ name deleted ] said in 1998 ” or “ The liaison from [ company deleted ] were lying bastards and only in it to rape us . ”
And so on .
Well , it ’s history , it ’s water under the bridge , forget it !
And I bet that nobody else will talk about this , so I will : there was internal resistance , and it was passionate .
I disagreed , but I have a lot of respect for those people ; they had good arguments that we need to keep carefully in mind , going forward .
There are people who are bruised and hurting now and really unsure that this is the right path .
I totally hope that , in a couple of years , this will be a tempest in a teapot , seen in the rear - view mirror , and that we ’re still all on the same team .
Forks ·
The FAQs argue that the risk of forking under the GPL is low ; the Free Software and OSS communities do n’t want to ; and given the massive installed base of compatible Java , nobody seems likely to try a repeat of the Microsoft shenanigans that we went to court over .
But I think there ’ll be lots of forks , and I approve .
I suspect that basement hackers and university CompSci departments and other unexpected parties will take the Java source , hack groovy improvements into it , compile it , and want to give it to the world .
They ’ll discover that getting their creation blessed as “ Java ” requires running the TCK / trademark gauntlet , which is n’t groovy at all .
So they ’ll think of a clever name for it and publish anyhow .
Which is terrific .
I see no downside , and I see huge upside in that the Java mainstream can watch this kind of stuff and ( because of the GPL ) adopt it if it ’s good , and make things better for everybody .
Remember : However many forks there are , it ai n’t Java unless it ’s called “ Java ” or has the coffee - cup on it .
If it has the name and cup , it is Java and it ’s compatible .
And Sun will absolutely enforce that in court if we have to .
We have in the past and we will again .
TCK · What to do about the TCK code ?
Its status is still TBD , and is going to take some careful thought .
Right now , the TCK is like the road test that you have to pass to get your driver ’s license .
It ’s a hugely important piece of the Java compatibility story .
It has to maintain its integrity and it has to be perceived as maintaining its integrity .
So , what ’s the right licensing structure to achieve that ?
Beats me .
Long Term ? · Anyone who tries to predict the long - term future effects of Free Java is braver than me .
I have one concrete hope : that the people working on the GNU / Linux desktop can be unshackled from the tyranny of C ++.
Aside from that , who knows ?
Freedom is scary ; but on balance I think Java ’s new path will be more interesting and more profitable and more fun .
Maxim touts its
Hot 100 list as showcasing women who " scored major successes and turned tons of heads " during the year , which is true , if you count looking pouty and vacant as a major success .
And while the list occasionally features women who are smart and funny - such as the controversial comic Sarah Silverman - you can bet that they are not included for their intellectual prowess .
A couple of beers later ( OK , and maybe some margaritas ) , we came up with the idea for the Real Hot 100 .
We knew loads of young women in our social and professional circles who were doing amazing , creative - even potentially world - changing - work , but they did not have a place to show it off .
If the Eva Longorias of the world have Maxim ( and FHM and Stuff and every other damn magazine ) to show off in , we decided that these women should have something too .
So we put the word out through blogs , emails , magazines and websites that we were taking nominations for a new kind of " hot list " that featured young women for all their assets , not just the ones that pop out of blouses .
A list that would show off some of the impressive - although often ignored - work that women do every day .
Clearly this was an idea whose time had come .
Hundreds of women from all over the US were nominated .
Mothers nominated daughters , husbands nominated wives , friends nominated friends .
Despite our initial fears that people would view the campaign as unnecessary , or uncool , the feedback uncovered something totally different .
Robert K emailed us to say : " I have two teenage daughters and I really like your definition of ' hot ' .
Thanks for pointing [ my daughters ] in the right direction . "
And a 15 - year - old Australian sent us a message thanking us profusely for showing her that women can be " awesome " without being half - naked .
And are they ever awesome .
Two of our Real Hot 100 nominees - 26 - year - old Ingrid Hu Dahl and 31 - year - old Suzanne Grossman - founded the Willie Mae Rock Camp for Girls .
The New York City day camp teaches girls to play instruments , write their own songs and generally rock out .
Another nominee , 20 - year - old Estefania Alves , started a Boston - based radio station that only broadcasts music and programming that respects and empowers women .
In a time when young women are said to be apathetic and vapid - pawns of a culture inundated by dumb - is - cool idols such as Paris Hilton and Jessica Simpson - this list demonstrates that we are anything but .
Another nominee , Leana Wen , began medical school when she was 18 .
Now 23 , she has focused her career on helping minorities and women , and recently set up the Medical Student Disaster Relief Programme , which recruited more than 500 volunteers in the wake of Hurricane Katrina .
What is important about the Real Hot 100 is that it highlights the work that actual young women are doing - the ones who do not have the overwhelming desire to roll around in a sopping wet nightie .
And while some of them may look good in a bikini , they know that is not all they have to offer .
So there is 27 - year - old Danielle Lurie , who wrote , directed and produced a film about honour killings in Turkey .
There is Donna Riley , 34 , a professor at Smith College 's first engineering programme specifically for women .
There is a political cartoonist ; a Space Studies student working with Nasa ; a Protestant minister in Iowa working with the homeless ; the founder of Chicago 's first woman - friendly sex shop .
This is what young women are really like : motivated , smart , active and engaged .
It is time we got credit for something other than our cleavage then , because , let 's face it , Maxim is not alone in its proclivity for rating women's " hotness " .
FHM has its 100 sexiest women in the world , People has its 50 most beautiful people , and countless other publications and websites such as hotornot.com use lists or rankings to judge women solely on looks .
These are the world 's most public beauty contests and they are everywhere .
And while the prevalence of hot lists is generally seen as a fun , harmless media ploy to sell more magazines and promote celebrity careers , their increasing social acceptability has made them into something more sordid .
Teaching a generation of boys that women are only there to be ogled and ranked is a sure path to trouble .
When boys do this independent of a magazine , ranking their female schoolmates by looks , we all feign shock , disgust and amazement .
There was recently a big controversy here in the US about a Pennsylvania high school hot list .
A group of male students generated a Top 25 list of their female peers that was vulgar , to say the least .
They gave each girl a grade for her breasts , backside and face with descriptions for some added nastiness .
One girl was said to be " the perfect height to suck a dick " .
A Latina student was described as using " perfume to keep the taco smell off of her " .
Another top - scoring student was held in such high regard that the boys wrote about wanting to " lather up that ass with some ketchup and dip our hot dog into it " .
All of which goes beyond " boys being boys " .
Lists that rate women , and a culture that celebrates this kind of looks hierarchy , put a disturbing twist on already impossible beauty standards for women .
And if we do n't meet " hotness " expectations , we are there to be scorned .
I am all for looking good , but is that seriously all people think young women have to offer ?
There has to be more to being " hot " than a tight ass and the ability to teeter in high heels .
I do not for a minute think that women such Paris Hilton or Jessica Simpson ( well OK , maybe her ) are dumb .
They are smart enough to market themselves and play the ditz because they know it sells .
But the re-emergence of " stupid hot " among celebrities is more than just a silly trend .
Especially when we are looking to these " duh " - sexy gals as , god help us , role models .
It is bad enough that girls only have sexualised images of women to look up to , but do they have to be stupid too ?
Do n't get me wrong , it is not that there is something bad or inherently unfeminist about looking hot and feeling sexy .
I like my cleavage .
But when the idea of sexy is limited to airbrushed asses and canned interview answers ( " I do wish I had that gay experience , because I think women are beautiful ! " as Longoria memorably commented in last year 's Maxim ) , we are in trouble .
Is n't it time that we , and our cultural icons , said goodbye to the idea that to be sexy you must be dumb ?
That women 's worth can be judged on a scale of one to 10 ?
The Real Hot 100 list is just a start , but I hope it will contribute to a new wave of women who are not afraid to show how accomplished they are - and how hot that makes them .

Tough , creative , campaigning : women who change the world
It 's not just US magazines that love hot lists .
In the past few weeks you could have enjoyed FHM's 100 Sexiest Women issue ( in which Christina Aguilera , at No 38 , says , " Two women are way sexier than two men in bed " , while Pamela Anderson , No 72 , purrs , " I can cut glass with my nipples . "
Ouch ) .
In Nuts , you 'd have found " Britain 's sexiest pin-ups " .
And Zoo has decided an occasional hot list is n't enough .
We need more semi-naked women touching their breasts !
Thus a 20 - strong hot list each week , as well as a " girls next door " section .
( " Calling all ladies !
We need pictures of you naked ! " )
And , despite the forced levity , this incessant rating is a genuine problem .
Hot lists are a constant warning that women 's looks are all - important , and our main role in life is to appear sexy , titillating and unthreatening at all times .
Well , at the women 's page we 're bored of these lists , and so , like the Real Hot 100 list in the US , we 're featuring our own roll - call of " world - changing women " here in G2 .
We want to showcase the most creative , exciting , campaigning and incendiary women .
So , if you are someone or know someone who , say , works for social justice by day and writes poetry by night , tell us .

Memoirs From the Browser Wars
News.com : " The original Internet Explorer team was just five or six people .
By the time Silverberg and others decided to rewrite the browser almost completely for version 3.0 , released in 1996 , the team had grown to 100 .
By 1999 , it was more than 1,000 . "
It 's fun reading stories like this from the perspective of a witness .
Instead of reading to find out what happened , I read it to find out if the author got it right .
I was there . :-)
My weblog will remain focused on version control and .NET , but in conjunction with the tenth anniversary of Mosaic , please indulge me a brief trip down memory lane :
Life in the browser wars was a unique time period for me in my career .
Spyglass was sort of like my first real job .
When I joined the company in May 1992 the business was all about scientific data analysis tools .
We had a little over $ 3 M from Greylock and Venrock .
It was a fun company , but data plotting is n't an explosive growth market .
By 1994 , everybody was starting to realize that .
Management made the decision to transition our business completely and pursue the market for web browsers .
Tim Krauskopf , the founder and head of development , asked me to write a web browser .
I started work on Spyglass Mosaic on April 5th , 1994 .
The demo for our first prospective customer was already on the calendar in May .
I ended up as the Project Lead for the browser team .
Yes , we licensed the technology and trademarks from NCSA ( at the University of Illinois ) , but we never used any of the code .
We wrote our browser implementations completely from scratch , on Windows , MacOS , and Unix .
We were not the first Mosaic licensee , but we were the last .
Prior to us , a company called Spry took the Mosaic code and tried to sell " Internet in a Box " .
People still seem to get Spry and Spyglass confused because of the similar names .
Netscape did n't even exist yet , but things happened fast .
Just a few weeks after I started coding , Jim Clark rode into town and gathered a select group of programmers from NCSA .
Mosaic Communications Corporation was born .
It was interesting to note that certain people on the NCSA browser team were not invited to the special meeting .
I can still remember hearing about how ticked off they were to be excluded .
Champaign - Urbana is a very small town . :-)
Spyglass had the legal right to the " Mosaic " trademark .
A few tantrums and lots of lawyering later , MCC changed its name to Netscape .
We thought we had a nice head start on Netscape .
We had a really top - notch team and we moved the rest of our developers over to browser work quickly .
We were ready to compete with anybody .
But Jim Clark was , after all , Jim Clark .
His SGI - ness knew how to work the advantages of being in Silicon Valley .
He provided his young company with lots of press coverage and very deep pockets .
We decided to approach this market with an OEM business model .
Instead of selling a browser to end users we developed core technology and sold it to corporations who in turn provided it to their end users .
We considered ourselves to be the arms dealer for the browser wars .
Over 120 companies licensed Spyglass Mosaic so they could bundle it into their product .
Our stuff ended up in books , operating systems , ATM machines , set - top boxes , help systems , and kiosks .
It was an extremely profitable business .
The company grew fast and ours was one of the first Internet IPOs .
Along the way , we got involved in the standards process .
In fact , I became the chair of the IETF HTML Working Group for the standardization of HTML 2.0 .
I learned a lot through this experience .
In May 1994 I went to the first WWW conference in Geneva , Tim Berners - Lee took me aside and shared his plans for a World - Wide Web Consortium .
It did n't take too long for the W3C to become the venue for HTML standards discussions .
Eventually this was A Good Thing .
Both Netscape and Microsoft became active participants in the W3C HTML Working Group .
Any group which did n't have their involvement was doomed to irrelevance .
For much of 1994 , it seemed like we were ahead of Netscape .
Shortly after we released our 2.0 version , I remember one of the Netscape developers griping about how their schedule had been moved up by six months .
We smiled because we knew we were the reason .
They had not been taking us seriously and they were being forced to do so .
But Netscape was running at a much faster pace .
They got ahead of us on features and they began to give their browser away at no cost to end users .
This made Netscape the standard by which all other browsers were judged .
If our browser did n't render something exactly like Netscape , it was considered a bug .
I hated fixing our browser to make it bug - compatible with Netscape even though we had already coded it to " the standard " .
Life 's not fair sometimes . :-)
We won the Microsoft deal .
I suppose only the higher echelons of Spyglass management really know the gory details of this negotiation .
I was asked to be the primary technical contact for Microsoft and their effort to integrate our browser into Windows 95 .
I went to Redmond and worked there for a couple of weeks as part of the " Chicago " team .
It was fun , but weird .
They gave me my own office .
At dinner time , everyone went to the cafeteria for food and then went back to work .
On my first night , I went back to my hotel at 11:30 pm .
I was one of the first to leave .
Internet Explorer 2.0 was basically Spyglass Mosaic with not too many changes .
IE 3.0 was a major upgrade , but still largely based on our code .
IE 4.0 was closer to a rewrite , but our code was still lingering around -- we could tell by the presence of certain esoteric bugs that were specific to our layout engine .
Licensing our browser was a huge win for Spyglass .
And it was a huge loss .
We got a loud wake - up call when we tried to schedule our second conference for our OEM browser customers .
Our customers told us they were n't coming because Microsoft was beating them up .
The message became clear :
We sold our browser technology to 120 companies , but one of them slaughtered the other 119 .
The time between IE 3 and IE 4 was a defining period for Spyglass .
It was clear that the browser war had become a two - player race .
Even with our IPO stash , we did n't have the funding to keep up with Netscape .
What was interesting was the day we learned that Netscape did n't have the funding to keep up with Microsoft .
For the development of IE 4.0 , a new Program Manager appeared .
His name was Scott Isaacs and I started seeing him at the HTML standards group meetings .
At one of those meetings we sat down for a talk which was a major turning point for me and for Spyglass .
Scott told me that the IE team had over 1,000 people .
I was stunned .
That was 50 times the size of the Spyglass browser team .
It was almost as many people as Netscape had in their whole company .
I could have written the rest of the history of web browsers on that day -- no other outcomes were possible .
After that day , it seemed like Spyglass declined fast .
The company turned its focus on the non-PC browser market .
Things shuffled around .
I left Spyglass in January of 1997 and founded my own company .
I left with no regrets and no bitterness .
Spyglass was an incredible learning experience for me .
Looking back on the browser wars , Tim Krauskopf remarked that we had beaten everybody who did n't outspend us by a factor of five . :-)
A new insulation material with the lowest thermal conductivity ever measured for a fully dense solid has been created at the University of Oregon and tested by researchers at three other U.S. institutions .
While far from having immediate application , the principles involved , once understood , could lead to improved insulation for a wide variety of uses , the scientists say .
In a paper published online Dec. 14 on Science Express , in advance of regular publication in the journal Science , the scientists describe how they used a novel approach to synthesize various thicknesses of tungsten diselenide .
This effort resulted in a random stacking of tungsten - diselenide planes ( WSe 2 ) , possibly leading to a localization of lattice vibrations .
The resulting synthesized material , they report , resulted in thermal conductivity -- the rate at which heat flows through a material -- 30 times smaller than that for single - crystal WSe 2 and a factor six smaller that the minimum level predicted by theoretical computations for the cross -plane thin films used in the experiments .
Surprisingly , creating a fully disordered structure by bombarding the films with ions to destroy the order in the two - dimensional planes actually increases thermal conductivity , said David C. Johnson , a professor of chemistry at the University of Oregon and member of the UO Materials Science Institute .
" The reason for the extraordinarily low thermal conductivity that we 've now achieved is an unusual structure which is crystalline in two directions but has a subtle rotational disorder in the direction of low - heat conduction , " Johnson said .
The material prepared in Johnson ’s lab " is the closest thing that anyone has found to making a dense solid into a perfect thermal insulator , " said co-author and corresponding investigator David G. Cahill , a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
" This material would not be practical for insulating a refrigerator , the wall of a house or parts inside a turbine engine , but the new physical properties displayed by this material might some day point the way toward methods of creating more effective practical insulations . "
The approach is a new alternative to one described by Cahill and others in separate journals in the last two years in which researchers reduced minimum thermal conductivity by manipulating thin films of metals and oxides by adjusting interfaces of the materials by only a few nanometers .
" Thermal conductivity is an important property in both conserving energy and in converting between forms of energy , " Johnson said .
" Obtaining low thermal conductivity in a thermoelectric material , which converts temperature gradients into electrical energy , increases efficiency . "
The properties of Johnson 's material were measured in Cahill 's Illinois laboratory .
The structure was analyzed at the Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne , Ill .
Computational simulations and molecular modeling of the layered crystals was carried out by researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( RPI ) in Troy , N.Y .

Bush would veto Medicare drug price measure , Republicans say WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Bush promised on Thursday to veto Democratic - drafted legislation requiring the government to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices under Medicare .
The House is to debate and vote Friday on the bill , which is one of a handful of priority items for Democrats who gained control of Congress in last fall 's elections .
" Government interference impedes competition , limits access to lifesaving drugs , reduces convenience for beneficiaries and ultimately increases costs to taxpayers , beneficiaries and all American citizens alike , " the administration said in a written statement .
Further , it said , competition already " is reducing prices to seniors , providing a wide range of choices and leading to a more productive environment for the development of new drugs . "
Bush had already threatened to veto another of the top six bills Democrats are pushing across the House floor in the first two weeks of the new Congress .
That 's the measure , approved Thursday , to expand the extent to which federal funds could be used for embryonic stem cell research .
Several Democrats campaigned last fall as critics of the two - year - old program that offers prescription drug coverage under Medicare , saying it tilted too heavily toward profits for the pharmaceutical and insurance industries .
Currently , private drug plans negotiate how much they 'll pay for the medicine their customers take .
But the legislation under consideration Friday would require the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to do so .
" It is clear Medicare can do better and we are insisting that they do so , " said Rep. John Dingell , R - Mich . , the bill 's author .
Democrats have said they would use the savings produced by the negotiations to reduce a coverage gap that is common in many plans .
Republicans argue that individual insurance companies already negotiate lower prices on behalf of their customers , and that the Democratic approach was tantamount to calling for federal price controls .
They note that the program is coming in under budget and seniors are expressing support for the benefit .
" What we set out to do , we accomplished , " said Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , during a hearing Thursday about the drug benefit .
" We had a success , a very big success . "
Also , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation was unlikely to result in lower prices .
" The secretary would be unable to negotiate prices across the broad range of covered Part D drugs that are more favorable than those obtained by ( the plans ) under current law , " Donald B. Marron , the CBO 's acting director , has written .
Actuaries for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services came to the same conclusion Thursday .
Dingell , a leading supporter of the legislation , dismissed the CBO 's letter .
" This is n't the first time the Congress and CBO differed on the amount of savings a particular bill would achieve , " he said .
" Common sense tells you that negotiating with the purchasing power of 43 million Medicare beneficiaries behind you would result in lower drug prices . "
The legislation , expected on the House floor on Friday , also would ban any attempt to limit the array of drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries by creating formularies .
That stands in contrast to the Veterans Administration , which has lower prices for its beneficiaries but uses formularies that limit patient choice .
Under the Medicare prescription drug program , insurance companies offer competing coverage plans , and seniors may enroll in the one they like best .
The administration announced on Wednesday that 23.5 million seniors had enrolled in stand - alone plans as of Jan .
1 . While a majority of seniors are expressing satisfaction with the program , surveys also indicate that they overwhelmingly want the government to have the power to negotiate drug prices .
A survey of seniors for the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that about 81 % of seniors want to let the government use its buying power to negotiate drug prices , including 67 % who said they strongly favor such negotiations .
Democrats say that another survey showed that requiring government negotiations polled more favorably than any other issue that Democrats included for their first 100 hours of the new Congress .
The issue is expected to have a tougher time in the Senate .
However , Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , gave supporters of the measure a lift on Thursday when he said the total prohibition on government negotiations for Medicare beneficiaries should be eliminated .
" I do not buy the argument that the sky will fall on the prescription drug market if we remove this clause , " said Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , which has jurisdiction over Medicare .

You speak as if Apple is in control of the ringtone situation .
It will be the recording companies who tell Apple what they can and cannot do with their artists ' music .
Considering that ringtones have become a billion dollar business , I doubt they will allow Apple to do anything that jeopardizes this form of income .
As for selling ringtones , if there is n't a way to purchase them through Cingular as you would a normal handset then the service will have to come from iTunes .
Apple would probably make the same small amount of pennies on the sale of a ringtone that they do a song purchased from iTunes .
Whatever you can do with your current handset in terms of chopping a song and loading it onto your phone will likely be allowed on the iPhone .
We have no choice but to assume that .
Perhaps there will be new software that allows you to cut up songs more easily but ringtones themselves are not the property of Apple .
[ T ] his document describes a proposed ratification procedure .
Discussion of this procedure is taking place on the ratification-discuss@r6rs.org mailing list .
The discussion period ends on April 15th .
The Scheme Standardization Charter says that after the Editors submit a proposed final draft , " the Steering Committee should then choose either to finalize the draft or to restart the review process . "
This document describes how the Steering Committee will make that decision .
The ratification process proposed is somewhat unusual ( e.g. , a no vote will need to include an explanation ) , but this may change due to the comments sent to the mailing list .
I think many LtU readers should consider taking part in the vote , since as programming languages aficionados we cetainly have a stake in Scheme .
Now is the chance to influence the procedural aspects of the ratification process .
Cyndi Smallwood is looking for a few strong men for her landscaping company .
Guys with no fear of a hot sun , who can shovel dirt all day long .
She ’ll pay as much as $ 34 an hour .
She ca n’t find them .
Maybe potential employees do n’t know about her tiny Riverside firm .
Maybe the problem is Southern California ’s solid economy and low unemployment rate .
Or maybe manual labor is something that many Americans could n’t dream of doing .
“ I ’m baffled why more people do not apply , ” Smallwood says .

President Bush is not .
In his speech to the nation Monday night , he referred to “ jobs Americans are not doing , ” echoing a point he has been making for years .
To fill these spurned jobs and keep the economy humming , Bush says , the U.S. needs a guest worker program .
Otherwise , the logic goes , fruit will rot in the fields , offices will overflow with trash and lawns and parks will revert to desert .
Countering that view , opponents of a guest worker program say that Americans would find the jobs more enticing if there was n’t foreign competition to swell the labor pool and push wages down .
Smallwood is ambivalent on immigration reform , saying demands for immediate citizenship by those who entered the country illegally are offensive .
But without a guest worker program , she says , her company probably will not survive .
Advertisement
“ To get workers , you have to steal them from other companies , ” the 54 - year - old entrepreneur says .
Even that has been unproductive recently .
She ’d ideally like to add eight employees by the end of the year to her current staff of 12 .
The lawn and landscape business in California is heavily Latino , with an abundance of illegal immigrants .
In a study of Los Angeles County ’s “ off - the - books ” labor force , the Economic Roundtable , a nonprofit research organization , estimated that a quarter of the landscape workers were undocumented .
That leaves the companies vulnerable to crackdowns , which has them agitating for guest workers .
At Smallwood ’s company , Diversified Landscape Management , there ’s one white employee , an engineer .
The other employees are Latino and , as far as Smallwood can tell , all in the country legally .
Her employees need driver ’s licenses and the ability to move through freeway checkpoints near the border , which tend to eliminate any with fake papers .
Advertisement
Thirty years ago , those in the landscape industry say , white crews were common .
Now , says Jim Newtson , a San Diego contractor , “ if you see a white guy , you do a double - take , like when you saw an interracial couple back in the 1960s . ”
Managers in the business explain it as a cultural shift , saying that native - born , middle - class Americans of all races and ethnic backgrounds tend to look down on manual labor .
That leaves immigrants to do the work .
“ The people I grew up with 40 years ago expected to work hard physically , ” says Bob Wade of Wade Landscape in Laguna Beach .
“ This is a pretty pampered little town .
The kids do n’t expect to work hard , ” Wade says .
“ A lot do n’t expect to work at all .
They just float . ”
Advertisement
Wade fired one employee three times , the last time for going to look at girls on the beach instead of spraying weeds .
The employee -- his son -- now works in the restaurant industry .
Larger economic forces come into play too .
Orange County , for example , consistently has the lowest jobless rate in the state .
Although that could be a draw for laborers in states with high unemployment , the high housing prices in the county act as a brake on that sort of migration .
Smallwood grew up doing manual labor .
The daughter of a sharecropper in Mississippi , she had to pick her share of cotton from age 6 .
“ I would n’t do that again for any price , ” she says .
When she moved to California , she worked as a property manager , then developed a lawn - care business , which she sold in 1998 .
The death of her only child , Michael , from a drug overdose two years later drew her outside to her own garden .
“ I watered , fertilized , planted and pruned , determined that nothing else was going to die on me , ” she says .
Advertisement
That experience led to the creation of Diversified Landscape , which specializes in public works projects .
Diversified Landscape installs plants on medians on city streets , creates rock formations called “ blankets ” for Caltrans on freeway off - ramps and builds irrigation systems on high school sports fields .
As a government contractor , Diversified Landscape is required to pay prevailing wages as calculated by the state Department of Industrial Relations .
Experienced laborers earn $ 34.24 an hour ; untrained “ tenders ” make $ 14.17 .
Each work site is required to have an equal number of laborers and tenders .
Landscapers such as Bob Wade , who work for private clients , pay much less -- about $ 8.50 an hour to start .
But Smallwood ’s higher wages do n’t seem to be helping her very much .
“ Last July I ran an ad in the Riverside Press - Enterprise , ” she says .
“ I got only two responses . ”
She hired one of them , who left after a few months for a job closer to his home .
Advertisement
Other landscapers also report a labor shortage .
“ Our difficulty in hiring is horrible , ” says Cathy Gurney of Sierra Landscape & Maintenance in Chico , north of Sacramento .
“ We ’ve been advertising for a supervisor , which would pay $ 15 to $ 25 an hour with full benefits .
No one qualified is applying . ”
Some economists say such accounts do n’t mean that Americans wo n’t do some jobs , but that employers such as Gurney simply are n’t paying enough .
“ Every time someone says illegal immigrants take jobs from Americans or do jobs Americans do n’t want , I want to scream , ” UCLA economist Christopher Thornberg says .
Advertisement
This argument makes Smallwood want to scream herself .
On a recent job that went into overtime , a Diversified Landscape foreman , Vincente Sanchez , was making $ 52.34 an hour .
“ How high can you go ? ” she says .
Outside her office one recent afternoon she encounters Bennie Gray , who says he earns about $ 60,000 a year detailing cars -- a different kind of work , but also done in the hot sun .
Gray , a thickly muscled African American , acknowledges that on an hourly basis , he might make more working for Smallwood , but ca n’t imagine it .
“ I ’m not going to lie , ” says Gray , 48 .
“ I do n’t want to work that hard .
My ancestors had to work in the fields .
My mom still talks about the splinters and sores . ”
Advertisement
Smallwood ’s employees have their own theories about the shortage of workers .
“ They do n’t know what the wages are , and they ’re scared to get their hands dirty , ” says Marco Camberos .
He ’s running one side of a two - person auger that will be used to dig about 7,000 one - foot holes along a mile of median in Laguna Nigel .
The team is planting evergreen shrubs .
Camberos is making $ 18 an hour as a trainee .
At 26 , he has a bachelor ’s degree in chemistry from UC Riverside and plans to open his own landscaping business .
“ This is the means to an end , ” he says .
Telling Americans there are jobs they wo n’t do is n’t necessarily a way to endear yourself to them .
Addressing a group of union leaders in Washington last month , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) said the members of his audience would n’t pick lettuce even for $ 50 an hour .
Advertisement
When some in the crowd angrily dissented , McCain demurred : “ You ca n’t do it , my friends . ”
Three dozen demonstrators later showed up at the senator ’s Phoenix office , bearing lettuce - picker applications as well as heads of lettuce .
McCain may be allied with Bush on this point , but many other Republicans are not .
Immigration is driving a wedge between the GOP and its longtime constituency in the business world .
Smallwood has two signed photos of Bush on the wall of her office , one of them thanking her for contributing to the Republican National Committee .
Will she be making another contribution to the Republicans anytime soon ?
“ Not hardly . ”
Advertisement
That ’s due in large measure to her anger at her congressman , Rep. Gary G. Miller ( R - Diamond Bar ) , who does not favor a guest worker program .
In January , Smallwood had a contentious meeting with Miller at his district office in Brea .
She said Miller twice challenged her assertion that she could n’t find workers for $ 34 an hour , saying his son would work for that wage and offering to send him over .
Smallwood said she took the deal , but that his son never showed up .
Miller declined to be interviewed .
Last week Smallwood wrote a flier that says she would pay $ 34 with experience and $ 14 without .
The notice cautions that no application would be accepted “ without verification of proper identification that allows you , by law , to work in the USA . ”
Advertisement
The flier is up in more than a dozen landscaping supply stores .
So far , Smallwood says , there have been no calls .

Dynamic Productivity with Ruby
A Conversation with Yukihiro Matsumoto , Part II
by Bill Venners
November 17 , 2003
Advertisement
Summary
Yukihiro Matsumoto , the creator of the Ruby programming language , talks with Bill Venners about morphing interfaces , using mix-ins , and the productivity benefits of being concise in Ruby .
Yukihiro Matsumoto , or " Matz , " as he is known online , is the creator of the Ruby programming language .
Ruby is an object - oriented language suitable for writing day to day scripts as well as full - scale applications .
Matz began work on Ruby back in 1993 , because he wanted a language that made him productive while being fun to use .
Initially popular in Japan , Ruby has been finding its way into the hearts of programmers all over the world .
On September 24 , 2003 , Bill Venners met with Yukihiro Matsumoto at the JAOO conference in Aarhus , Denmark .
In this interview , which is being published in multiple installments on Artima.com , Yukihiro Matsumoto discusses Ruby 's design philosopy , the features of the Ruby language , and becoming a better programmer .
In this initial installment , Matz waxes philosophic about design imperfection , the danger of orthogonality , granting freedom with guidance , the principle of least surprise , and the importance of the human in computer endeavors .
Changing Interfaces at Runtime
Bill Venners :
In Ruby , I can add methods and variables to objects at runtime .
I have certainly added methods and variables to classes , which become objects at runtime , in other languages .
But in Java , for example , once a class is loaded or an object is instantiated , its interface stays the same .
Allowing the interface to change at runtime seems a bit scary to me .
I 'm curious how I would use that feature in Ruby .
What 's the benefit of being able to add methods at runtime ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
First of all , you do n't have to use that feature .
The most useful application of dynamic features , such as adding methods to objects , is meta- programming .
Such features allow you to create a library that adapts to the environment , but they are not for casual uses .
Bill Venners :
What 's an example of a library that adapts to the environment ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
One example is a proxy .
Instead of designing individual proxy classes for each particular class , in Ruby you can create an all purpose proxy that can wrap any object .
The proxy can probe the object inside of it and just morph into the proxy for that object .
The proxy can add methods to itself so it has the same interface as the wrapped object , and each of those methods can delegate to the corresponding method in the wrapped object .
So an all - purpose proxy , which can be used to wrap any object , is an example of how a library class can adapt to the environment .
Adding methods to objects can also be used in Ruby in situations where Java programmers use inner classes .
For example , if you need to pass a listener object to some method , in Java you often instantiate an anonymous inner class that defines the listener methods and pass it .
In Ruby , you can just create a plain object — an instance of class Object — add the needed listener methods to it dynamically , and pass it .
Also , because you can replace a method as well as add one , you can use this feature to define callbacks .
For example , every OO GUI library has a Button object .
When someone clicks a button , the Button 's click method is called .
In the basic Button class , of course , the implementation of the click method is empty .
To add behavior to the button in other languages , you create a subclass of Button and override the click method .
But in Ruby , if you want , you can directly replace the click method in class Button .
Single Inheritance and Mix -Ins
Bill Venners :
In an article , you wrote , " Ruby supports single inheritance only , which I consider a feature . "
Why is single - inheritance desirable , and what are mix-ins ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Single inheritance is good because the whole class inheritance structure forms a single tree with a single root , named Object , and that is very easy to understand .
In languages with multiple inheritance , the classes form a network , which is harder to understand .
But even though single inheritance is good because of its simple tree structure , sometimes we want to share features or methods between classes outside the lines of single inheritance .
In that case in Java , you have to define an interface to share method signatures , then usually implement using some kind of delegation from one object to another .
In Ruby , we define something called a module , which is like a class , but with some restrictions : namely , you can't create an instance of a module , and a module can't inherit from a class .
So in Ruby , if you define a module that has methods and plug that module into a class , then that class will have those methods , both signatures and implementations .
If you then plug the same module into another class , there will be two classes that share the implementation .
This gives much of the benefit of multiple inheritance , but without destroying the simple tree model of single inheritance .
This approach of plugging in modules is called Mix-ins .
Mix -ins originally started in LISP culture as a usage of multiple inheritance .
In fact , a mix - in is actually a strict way of using multiple inheritance .
So in LISP , it 's a style of using multiple inheritance .
In Ruby , we force you to use mix-ins by supporting classes and modules .
Productivity , Efficiency , and Robustness
Bill Venners :
In an article , you wrote , " Ruby 's primary focus is productivity . "
How does Ruby help productivity , and what about efficiency and robustness ?
Productivity , efficiency , and robustness are all good things .
How do you trade those off in Ruby ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
In my point of view , efficiency and productivity are the same thing , because we focus on programming efficiency , not runtime efficiency .
I do n't care about runtime efficiency .
The computer goes faster and faster every year , so I do n't really care about performance .
Actually , I care about performance when I 'm implementing the Ruby interpreter , but not when I 'm designing Ruby .
The implementer should care about performance , but the designer should n't .
If you care about performance , you will focus on machines in design instead of on humans .
So you should n't focus on performance in design .
To help programmers be productive , I focus on making programs succinct in Ruby .
I try to make programs compact .
I also focus on providing very rich features in class libraries .
If you have a library method to do the things that you want to do , you do n't need to write much code .
In Ruby , we also have blocks , which are nameless functions you can pass to methods .
So we can provide in libraries templates of common programming patterns , and you can provide a block to customize the pattern .
Blocks are built into the Ruby language , so you can use them very easily .
So by providing this rich set of features in the libraries , we help make Ruby programs compact .
As an example , Perl programmers have a technique called the Schwartzian transform , named after Randall Schwartz , who created the technique .
You can use the Schwartzian transform if you have a list that you want to sort in an order determined by the result of passing each element of the list to a particular function .
For example , you may want to sort a list of filenames in order of increasing timestamp .
The list you want to sort are filename strings , but the order you want them sorted in is determined by passing each string to a function that returns a timestamp for that filename .
A Perl user would know this is a job for a Schwartzian transform .
They would pick up a book and look at a Schwartzian transform example , then apply the sample code to their particular case .
But this is kind of a heavy activity for your brain .
In Ruby , we have a sort_by function to which you can pass a list and a function .
So to do a Schwartzian transform in Ruby , you do n't need to look it up in a reference , you just call sort_by .
This is an example of conciseness , and it is much easier .
Bill Venners :
One of the arguments made by static typers in the static versus dynamic typing debate is that static compile - time type checking helps programmers make robust systems .
What is Ruby 's attitude about robustness ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
The Ruby language itself does n't care about robustness .
Actually , the implementation of the interpreter , which is written in C , should be robust .
No Ruby code should crash the interpreter .
So I try to make the interpreter robust , but the language itself in its design does not care about robustness for two reasons .
First , you need to test the system anyway to be robust .
So we encourage unit testing using a testing framework to help achieve robust systems .
The second reason is that programs written in dynamic languages are very easy to run and check .
So for day - to - day programs that are n't not as serious as enterprise systems , you do n't have to be as robust .
It 's not worth the cost of declaring types , for example .
And because there are so many dynamic checks in dynamic languages , in most cases something very terrible usually does not happen .
For example , Ruby checks array boundaries , so you do n't have buffer overwrites .
Ruby does n't provide direct address manipulations , so you can't crash the stack space .
Therefore in Ruby , I want to enable programmers to get a program ready to test in a short time by making programmers productive .
Next Week
Come back Monday , November 24 for part II of a conversation with Bjarne Stroustrup , the creator of C ++.
I am now staggering the publication of several interviews at once , to give the reader variety .

Interview with Ruby Create Y. Matsumoto , by S. Ibaraki :
http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=1224
I started the gCensus project for two reasons : First , the Census Department ’s interface for mapping its data was clunky and looked like something out of the mid-90 ’s — hardly appropriate for a modern web service .
Second , there was ( and is ) a wealth of geographic information publicly available , but few people have access to the kinds of tools needed to view it .
Professional researchers investigating geographic data trends use programs known as GIS ( Geographic Information Systems ) packages for mapping .
Unfortunately , there was no tool easily available to the average person who , say , wanted to see how family - friendly a neighborhood might be .
gCensus is meant to fill that gap .
The obvious idea that comes up when thinking about web - based mapping and visualization is a Google Maps mash - up .
In fact , such a site exists ( and unfortunately , both I and the other site ’s author picked the same gCensus name … ) .
It turns out , though , that while Google Maps is great for some tasks , it ’s not particularly good at visualizing quantitative data , as it does n’t allow you to shade regions or otherwise present an intuitive view of the numbers .
Summary :
The current generation of mobile Internet products and services has miserable usability ( as shown at the DEMOmobile 2000 conference ) .
New devices like Blackberry , Modo , and a prototype Microsoft telephone do better .
The DEMOmobile 2000 conference in early September 2000 clearly showed that mobile Internet is still not ready for real use .
Almost all of the demos were complete flops when viewed with a skeptical usability - trained eye .
Sure , the presenter was capable of laboriously walking through the necessary steps , but an average user having to perform a real task would not be so lucky .
For example , one of the demos concerned use of a WAP phone to order supplies for a construction project .
It does make sense for a foreman to use a mobile device in the field , though it might be better to use a bigger , more supportive device in the car or in the shack .
But then the demo proceeded to let the " purchasing manager " pull up the order on another cellphone to approve it .
Come on , would n't the purchasing manager sit at a comfortable computer in the office with other necessary records within easy reach ?
Worst of all , the demo only proceeded because neither the " foreman " nor the " purchasing manager " had any problems or issues with the order .
They just clicked the " buy this " button .
In real life , there are always exceptions .
One of the first things you learn about task analysis is that no case follows the average rules to the letter .
Any amount of real - world complexity and the demo would have failed .
Several services were shown in both WAP and Palm Pilot versions : every time , it was clear that the deck - of - cards form factor ( of the Palm ) offered immensely superior usability relative to anything based on a telephone .
The bigger screen allows for the display of enough information to be useful .
But even more important , the direct interaction with user interface widgets by touching / moving a pen to the screen provides a much more natural feel than the indirect " scroll - a - wheel " interface on the phones .
As we found in a recent field study in London , WAP almost always has low usability .
New and better devices are coming .
Informal discussions with conference attendees showed that Blackberry is taking off as the best and most loved product for mobile connectivity .
A huge number of people had Blackberries ( of course , most attendees at an expensive conference like Demo can afford $ 60 per month to read their email when out of the office — can average users ?
not so sure ) .
Pocket PC : Mobile Companion to Outlook
The most interesting presentation at DEMOmobile '2000 was by Microsoft .
First , the presenter agreed with my long - held position that Windows CE does not work .
Microsoft is notorious for not discussing the weaknesses of a product until they are shipping the successor , but at least the presenter did admit that it had been a mistake to take a user interface designed for a big screen and shoehorn it onto a small screen .
The new Pocket PC design does seem better than CE .
Rather than making a miniature PC ( as implied by the name ) , the design goal for Pocket PC was to create a mobile companion to Outlook < .
A great strategy since I believe that most users will continue to have a base station in the form of a full - screen device in their home or office .
It is Microsoft 's job to make sure that this full - screen base continues to run Outlook as its primary software .
It is everybody else 's job to create a better communications central , but so far I am not holding my breath for anything to replace Outlook .
Kill the Telephone Keypad
Microsoft also demoed the best telephone at the conference : a cellphone with a high - resolution color display that could display standard HTML content ( running Pocket Internet Explorer on the phone ) .
It is interesting to see Microsoft work on hardware innovations , even though I think it 's a doomed strategy to build mobile Internet devices as mutated telephones .
Much better to build a mobile communicator and allow it to include voice as one of its datatypes .
The prototype Microsoft telephone had the best quality screen I have seen yet on a telephone , but still wasted more than a third of its physical surface on a numeric keypad .
Let 's just get rid of the keys and spend every available square millimeter on pixels .
Most of the telephone numbers you call come from one of these sources :
your address book
an email message ( or equivalent such as SMS or paging messages )
online lookup in yellow pages , telephone directories , corporate websites
Instead of keying in ten digits ( a horrible UI if ever there was one ) , it is better to use the screen and simply tap the name of the person or company you want to call .
Update added 2007 :
Apple 's new iPhone finally implements my recommendation from 2000 to make a mobile device that spends its entire surface on a screen and does n't have the traditional push - buttons .
It only took 7 years for somebody to try , but the other phone vendors can't say that they were n't warned .
Modo : One - Handed Minimal UI
The most interesting new device shown at DEMOmobile '2000 was the Modo .
I ought to have discussed it at the top of this article , following the content usability rule of beginning with the most important information .
However , I had a conflicting usability goal in deferring this section : hoping that the photo would have finished downloading by the time you have scrolled down this far .
Modo device displaying the main menu ring .
Modo 's industrial design reminds me of the vision concepts for future pagers shown by Philips in 1996 .
There is something about a plastic egg that feels more interesting and personal than the square forms that dominate consumer electronics .
Modo is operated by a single hand :
The user 's index finger rests on the back button ( always the most important feature in any navigation interface )
button ( always the most important feature in any navigation interface )
The user 's thumb rests on a wheel with two functions :
Scrolling the wheel moves the selection up and down the screen ( and also scrolls the text when hitting the bottom or top of the screen )
Pressing the wheel activates the current selection ( which usually implies following a hypertext link )
with two functions : Modo also has an on / off button and a button to activate back - lighting of the display , but they are not touched during normal use
This description assumes right - handed use .
From the company website , it does not seem that there is a different version for lefties .
One - handed operation is great for a mobile device .
You often need to use your second hand for carrying your briefcase , holding on to a strap on the bus , or some other purpose that makes two - handed use less convenient than it is in an office setting .
Modo has a very scaled - back user interface .
It is a true information appliance that only does a single thing : providing entertainment and " going out " listings for the city you are in .
There is no configuration .
If you bring your Modo on a trip to a new city , it automatically downloads the information about the new city from the transmissions it is receiving from the local network .
There is also no payment or registration interface .
The device costs a flat fee of $ 99 up front ; the ongoing information service is free .
The hope is to fund the ongoing service out of advertising revenues .
Interesting business model which I do n't think will work :
Advertising does not work on traditional websites , where you have a big color screen and the ability to follow a link to an advertiser 's fully - featured site .
Mobile use is much more time - critical and provides a much more scaled - back environment with less room for ads and less willingness on the part of the users to tolerate interruptions .
An advisory service like Modo depends completely on trust : if users feel that advertisers get better ratings or preferred placement , they will stop relying on it .
Even if advertisers are treated the same as everybody else and get bad reviews when they deserve it , users may think that the service is biased since the old " church - state separation " is not well understood in new media .
In reviewing early content on prototype Modos , it is clear that usability will be impacted by very minute details in the way the text is written .
For example , the line feeds were often wrong and reduced the readability of the text .
Considering that all Modo content is written explicitly for the device and its tiny screen , it will be important for the editors to pay closer attention to word - wrapping and line feeds .
I previously coined the term microcontent to refer to Web design elements like headlines and page titles .
Modo highlights the need for even more fine - grained content usability , which I will have to call nanocontent .
On mobile devices , copyfitting has to be done down to the character to ensure , for example , that the most information - carrying part of a headline is represented in the first 18 characters on certain WAP phones .
Or to ensure that lines break in ways that maximizes the readability of the content .
Update Added October 26 , 2000 : Modo Dead
Unfortunately , my prediction turned out to be correct : Modo 's business model did not work , so the company went out of business in late October 2000 .
Too bad , because I really did like the design .

BAGHDAD , Feb. 20 — In a rare coordinated assault on an American combat outpost north of Baghdad , suicide bombers drove one or more cars loaded with explosives into the compound on Monday , while other insurgents opened fire in the ensuing chaos , according to witnesses and the American military .
Two American soldiers were killed and at least 17 more were wounded .
The brazen attack , which was followed by fierce gun battles and an evacuation of the wounded by American helicopters , was almost surely the work of Sunni militants , most likely Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , according to American and Iraqi officials .
It appeared to be part of a renewed drive by insurgents in recent weeks as more American and Iraqi troops flood the streets of Baghdad and thousands of Marines head to western Anbar Province to try to stem the violence .
Captured documents suggest that insurgents have been able to shoot down more helicopters through coordinated assaults , and hundreds of Iraqis have died in a recent wave of car bombings in Baghdad and elsewhere .
American and Iraqi military officials say they are concerned that militants are moving to areas where the American troop presence remains thin .
As the Iraqi government and its American allies struggled to quell the violence and build public trust in the security forces , a Sunni woman caused a furor on Monday when she publicly charged that she had been raped by members of the Iraqi National Police , which is largely made up of Shiites .
Summary :
The ten most egregious offenses against users .
Web design disasters and HTML horrors are legion , though many usability atrocities are less common than they used to be .
Since my first attempt in 1996 , I have compiled many top - 10 lists of the biggest mistakes in Web design .
See links to all these lists at the bottom of this article .
This article presents the highlights : the very worst mistakes of Web design .
( Updated 2011 . )
1. Bad Search
Overly literal search engines reduce usability in that they 're unable to handle typos , plurals , hyphens , and other variants of the query terms .
Such search engines are particularly difficult for elderly users , but they hurt everybody .
A related problem is when search engines prioritize results purely on the basis of how many query terms they contain , rather than on each document 's importance .
Much better if your search engine calls out " best bets " at the top of the list — especially for important queries , such as the names of your products .
Search is the user 's lifeline when navigation fails .
Even though advanced search can sometimes help , simple search usually works best , and search should be presented as a simple box , since that 's what users are looking for .
2. PDF Files for Online Reading
Users hate coming across a PDF file while browsing , because it breaks their flow .
Even simple things like printing or saving documents are difficult because standard browser commands do n't work .
Layouts are often optimized for a sheet of paper , which rarely matches the size of the user 's browser window .
Bye - bye smooth scrolling .
Hello tiny fonts .
Worst of all , PDF is an undifferentiated blob of content that 's hard to navigate .
PDF is great for printing and for distributing manuals and other big documents that need to be printed .
Reserve it for this purpose and convert any information that needs to be browsed or read on the screen into real web pages .
> Detailed discussion of why PDF is bad for online reading
3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links
A good grasp of past navigation helps you understand your current location , since it 's the culmination of your journey .
Knowing your past and present locations in turn makes it easier to decide where to go next .
Links are a key factor in this navigation process .
Users can exclude links that proved fruitless in their earlier visits .
Conversely , they might revisit links they found helpful in the past .
Most important , knowing which pages they 've already visited frees users from unintentionally revisiting the same pages over and over again .
These benefits only accrue under one important assumption : that users can tell the difference between visited and unvisited links because the site shows them in different colors .
When visited links do n't change color , users exhibit more navigational disorientation in usability testing and unintentionally revisit the same pages repeatedly .

> Guidelines for showing links
4. Non-Scannable Text
A wall of text is deadly for an interactive experience .
Intimidating .
Boring .
Painful to read .
Write for online , not print .
To draw users into the text and support scannability , use well - documented tricks :
subheads
bulleted lists
highlighted keywords
short paragraphs
the inverted pyramid
a simple writing style , and
de - fluffed language devoid of marketese .
> Eyetracking of reading patterns
5. Fixed Font Size
CSS style sheets unfortunately give websites the power to disable a Web browser 's " change font size " button and specify a fixed font size .
About 95 % of the time , this fixed size is tiny , reducing readability significantly for most people over the age of 40 .
Respect the user 's preferences and let them resize text as needed .
Also , specify font sizes in relative terms — not as an absolute number of pixels .
6. Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility
Search is the most important way users discover websites .
Search is also one of the most important ways users find their way around individual websites .
The humble page title is your main tool to attract new visitors from search listings and to help your existing users to locate the specific pages that they need .
The page title is contained within the HTML < title > tag and is almost always used as the clickable headline for listings on search engine result pages ( SERP ) .
Search engines typically show the first 66 characters or so of the title , so it 's truly microcontent .
Page titles are also used as the default entry in the Favorites when users bookmark a site .
For your homepage , begin with the company name , followed by a brief description of the site .
Do n't start with words like " The " or " Welcome to " unless you want to be alphabetized under " T " or " W . "
For other pages than the homepage , start the title with a few of the most salient information - carrying words that describe the specifics of what users will find on that page .
Since the page title is used as the window title in the browser , it 's also used as the label for that window in the taskbar under Windows , meaning that advanced users will move between multiple windows under the guidance of the first one or two words of each page title .
If all your page titles start with the same words , you have severely reduced usability for your multi-windowing users .
Taglines on homepages are a related subject : they also need to be short and quickly communicate the purpose of the site .
7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement
Selective attention is very powerful , and Web users have learned to stop paying attention to any ads that get in the way of their goal - driven navigation .
( The main exception being text - only search - engine ads . )
Unfortunately , users also ignore legitimate design elements that look like prevalent forms of advertising .
After all , when you ignore something , you do n't study it in detail to find out what it is .
Therefore , it is best to avoid any designs that look like advertisements .
The exact implications of this guideline will vary with new forms of ads ; currently follow these rules :
banner blindness means that users never fixate their eyes on anything that looks like a banner ad due to shape or position on the page
means that users never fixate their eyes on anything that looks like a banner ad due to shape or position on the page animation avoidance makes users ignore areas with blinking or flashing text or other aggressive animations
makes users ignore areas with blinking or flashing text or other aggressive animations pop-up purges mean that users close pop-up windoids before they have even fully rendered ; sometimes with great viciousness ( a sort of getting - back - at - GeoCities triumph ) .
8. Violating Design Conventions
Consistency is one of the most powerful usability principles : when things always behave the same , users do n't have to worry about what will happen .
Instead , they know what will happen based on earlier experience .
Every time you release an apple over Sir Isaac Newton , it will drop on his head .
That 's good .
The more users ' expectations prove right , the more they will feel in control of the system and the more they will like it .
And the more the system breaks users ' expectations , the more they will feel insecure .
Oops , maybe if I let go of this apple , it will turn into a tomato and jump a mile into the sky .
Jakob's Law of the Web User Experience states that " users spend most of their time on other websites . "
This means that they form their expectations for your site based on what 's commonly done on most other sites .
If you deviate , your site will be harder to use and users will leave .
9. Opening New Browser Windows
Opening up new browser windows is like a vacuum cleaner sales person who starts a visit by emptying an ash tray on the customer 's carpet .
Do n't pollute my screen with any more windows , thanks ( particularly since current operating systems have miserable window management ) .
Designers open new browser windows on the theory that it keeps users on their site .
But even disregarding the user - hostile message implied in taking over the user 's machine , the strategy is self - defeating since it disables the Back button which is the normal way users return to previous sites .
Users often do n't notice that a new window has opened , especially if they are using a small monitor where the windows are maximized to fill up the screen .
So a user who tries to return to the origin will be confused by a grayed out Back button .
Links that do n't behave as expected undermine users ' understanding of their own system .
A link should be a simple hypertext reference that replaces the current page with new content .
Users hate unwarranted pop-up windows .
When they want the destination to appear in a new page , they can use their browser 's " open in new window " command — assuming , of course , that the link is not a piece of code that interferes with the browser ’s standard behavior .
10 . Not Answering Users ' Questions
Users are highly goal - driven on the Web .
They visit sites because there 's something they want to accomplish — maybe even buy your product .
The ultimate failure of a website is to fail to provide the information users are looking for .
Sometimes the answer is simply not there and you lose the sale because users have to assume that your product or service does n't meet their needs if you do n't tell them the specifics .
Other times the specifics are buried under a thick layer of marketese and bland slogans .
Since users do n't have time to read everything , such hidden info might almost as well not be there .
The worst example of not answering users ' questions is to avoid listing the price of products and services .
No B2C ecommerce site would make this mistake , but it 's rife in B2B , where most " enterprise solutions " are presented so that you can't tell whether they are suited for 100 people or 100,000 people .
Price is the most specific piece of info customers use to understand the nature of an offering , and not providing it makes people feel lost and reduces their understanding of a product line .
We have hours of video of users asking " Where 's the price ? " while tearing their hair out .
Even B2C sites often make the associated mistake of forgetting prices in product lists , such as category pages or search results .
Knowing the price is key in both situations ; it lets users differentiate among products and click through to the most relevant ones .

Scientists have determined the detailed structure of an essential piece of the telomerase enzyme , an important contributor to the vast majority of human cancers .
Understanding the physical shape of the protein has led to a better understanding of how it acts to immortalize cells – and should help scientists design broadly effective cancer drugs .
3 - dimensional structure of an essential domain of TERT ( the telomerase catalytic protein subunit ) .
Green highlights the groove that “ anchors ” the DNA near the end of the chromosome :
Until now , the lack of detailed structural information about the enzyme has hindered progress in developing agents to inhibit it , say the researchers , who published their findings in an advance online publication in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology on February 5 , 2006 .
Howard Hughes Medical Institute President Thomas R. Cech , whose laboratory is at the University of Colorado at Boulder , led the study , conducted with colleagues Steven A. Jacobs and Elaine R. Podell .
Cancer researchers have long sought a way to subdue telomerase , an enzyme whose excessive activity contributes to the unchecked growth of as many as 90 percent of human tumors .
The enzyme is vital for some rapidly dividing cells – such as those in a developing embryo – where it extends telomeres , the regions of highly repetitive DNA found at the ends of chromosomes .
In most healthy adult cells , telomerase is shut off , and telomeres slowly shrink during cell division – a normal process that helps limit cells ’ lifespan .
Cancer cells , however , usually find a way to turn telomerase back on , achieving a dangerous immortality .
“ Getting telomeres replicated again is required for carcinogenesis to proceed , ” Cech explained .
“ It ’s an essential step in the development of cancer , and that makes it of a lot of interest therapeutically , because it is a target that could impact a wide variety of cancers . ”
Telomerase inhibitors have been in clinical development for many years , but , Cech said , progress has been slow .
“ The development of anti-telomerase chemotherapeutics has been challenged by the fact that there was no structural basis for thinking about the problem , ” he said .
“ There was no picture in any detail of what any part of this protein looks like . ”
Many labs have been working toward developing that picture , but the task has proven challenging .
That ’s because the enzyme tends to clump together once outside of cells , preventing it from forming the ordered crystals necessary for structural studies .
Scientists from Cech ’s lab and others had tried to simplify matters by crystallizing a portion of the protein , but the segments that they selected clumped together just as stubbornly as the whole enzyme .
Jacobs , a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation fellow in Cech ’s lab and the first author of the paper , developed a new approach .
With the help of bacteria and a protein that emits green fluorescent light , Jacobs randomly screened tens of thousands of fragments of the enzyme for one that would lend itself to successful structural analysis .
His strategy took advantage of the fact that when multiple copies of the fluorescent protein clump together , the fluorescence is quenched , or extinguished .
So Jacobs engineered bacteria to produce fragments of the telomerase enzyme fused to the fluorescent protein .
Since telomerase fragments that clustered together would drag along – and quench – their associated fluorescent protein , Jacobs knew that any bright green bacterial colonies were producing protein fragments that remained free .
Those rare colonies would be the best candidates for further analysis .
Jacobs performed these experiments on fragments of the telomerase enzyme from a variety of organisms , and found that only a fragment from Tetrahymena — the single - celled organism in which telomerase was first discovered — would work .
The researchers named the protein fragment “ telomerase essential N- terminal ” ( TEN ) domain , in reference to its position within the complete enzyme .
It took a few more biochemical tricks , but eventually Jacobs crystallized the protein fragment and analyzed it using x-ray diffraction .
Finally , the researchers were able to obtain an extremely detailed three - dimensional map , elucidating the position of each individual atom within the TEN domain .
Their studies revealed that TEN was characterized by a deep groove on its surface .
“ But , ” Cech said , “ a protein crystal structure without its relevant partners is not very informative . ”
So the team went on to do further analysis .
Telomerase has to grab on to the end of a chromosome in order to extend it , and Cech said scientists had previously decided that the region of the protein his lab was now studying might contain the essential “ anchor site . ”
Indeed , the TEN domain was able to grip telomeric DNA in a test tube , and when the researchers made a series of single amino acids changes within the domain , they found that three of these severely affected the binding of the chromosome end .
“ They turned out to be lined up right within that groove , ” Cech said .
The scientists found that these same mutations abolished telomerase ’s ability to extend telomeres , demonstrating that the groove was important for active telomerase .
“ We now have a detailed picture of the part of telomerase that forms this anchor site , and in fact have identified a groove within the protein that is what is really holding on to the end of the chromosome , ” Cech said .
The very tip of the chromosome must remain free to allow access to the site on the enzyme that directly extends the telomeres , Cech pointed out , so the anchor site secures the DNA molecule nearby , slightly closer to its center .
Cech is optimistic that the new portrait of the TEN domain will speed the development of telomerase inhibitors as chemotherapeutic agents .
“ A molecule that would sit in that groove – even though it ’s far away from the active site – looks like it would completely abolish the ability of telomerase to work . ”
This expands the possibilities for drug design , he said .
“ Instead of an active site inhibitor , you could screen for a TEN domain inhibitor . ”

Homework , Part I
The Worst Job in the World
What if you had a really lousy job ?
You 're only employed for seven hours a day , but you have to ride the bus for half an hour each way .
While you 're there , they only let you go to the bathroom at certain times .
You only have ten minutes to get from one work station to another , and somehow you also have to use the toilet and get your new work materials from a central depository during those breaks , without being late .
If you do anything wrong , you are n't allowed to talk to anybody during lunch .
Even when you go home , it 's not over .
A job supervisor also lives in your house , and makes you do two or three more hours of the same work you did on the job .
The at - home supervisor is even harsher than the one at work and has more power to inflict annoying punishments if you fail to comply .
If you 're sick and miss a day or two , then when you get better , you have to do all the work that you missed -- both the on - the - job and the at - home tasks .
Not only that , but you can't quit this lousy job .
It 's the law -- the government requires you to stick with it for at least ten years .
What if , on top of all this misery , the work you had to do at home was n't even real ?
What if you just went through the motions of all the tasks you did on the job , but you did n't actually accomplish anything ?
You just spent meaningless hours , repeating the physical movements , while the at - home supervisor says things like , " That 's how you do it ? " and " Are you sure you 're doing it right ? "
That 's a fair description of the lives of far too many of our school - age children .
Child Labor Laws
We made laws abolishing child labor , because we thought it was criminal to deprive children of their childhood .
Yet we tolerate burdening our children , not only with six or seven hours of schoolwork during the day , but also with a steadily increasing amount of homework at night , on weekends , and during holidays and vacations .
What it amounts to is this :
Too many of our homework - burdened children do n't have vacations .
They do n't have holidays .
They do n't have weekends .
They do n't even have homes .
Because the schools feel free to assign them work to do during all those supposed times of rest and recuperation .
It would be like the army sending soldiers home on leave from a war zone , but arranging that the enemy will still be shooting at them while they 're home .
Is n't there any break ?
( Let me say right here that in this school year , so far , our only remaining school age child has not been overburdened with homework .
This essay is not about my particular schoolchild 's current situation .
It 's about homework in general , across America . )
What Is Homework Worth ?
There is actually some science on this subject .
People have conducted studies .
Most of the studies , admittedly , use the extremely unreliable method of " self - reporting , " in which the amount of homework is estimated either by the teachers , the parents , or the students .
Not surprisingly , nobody agrees on just how much homework the kids have .
The teachers think the kids have far less than either students or the parents think they have .
The real question , though , is whether homework actually improves academic performance .
Of course , the question even deeper than that is whether we have any way to measure how much actual learning takes place .
It 's quite possible for students to get very good grades and score very well on standardized tests , while coming to hate the whole process of education and spending the rest of their lives avoiding anything that resembles reading or mathematics or study .
Surely we would call that outcome a failure .
But for the moment let 's just use the normal measures of academic achievement -- grades and standardized tests .
A Fair Study ?
The first problem here is that if homework is graded , then obviously failing to do your homework is going to lower your grade in the course .
It 's a circular process : homework " helps " your grade because if you do n't do it , your grade will be lowered .
It still does n't tell us anything about whether homework helped you learn more .
So in a meaningful study of whether homework accomplishes anything , we would need to have students who were otherwise getting identical instruction , half of whom did two hours of homework a night , and half of whom were assigned none .
Homework would not count in the grade .
Then we compare how they do on the same regularly scheduled tests and see if homework helped .
The trouble is , in the real world the students assigned homework would rebel .
Bloodshed might ensue .
Nor can you let parents decide which kids get homework , because the gung - ho parents who choose to have their kids do homework are also likely to be the motivated parents whose kids are going to be pressured to study more whether there 's homework assigned or not .
There 's no way to do a fair study based on grades where everything , except homework , is identical .
Standardized Tests
Even using standardized tests does n't help much , when the amount of homework different groups are doing is self - reported by teachers , students , or parents .
Furthermore , a group of students might be getting a superb education , with or without homework , without having it all show up on the standardized tests , which do n't measure the quality of your education .
The standardized tests measure only one thing : how well you do on standardized tests .
Some people take tests superbly .
I 'm one of them .
I got in the 99.3rd percentile on the math portion of the ACT ( an SAT alternate ) having never taken algebra II , trigonometry , or calculus , and having earned a D in the last math class I took ( geometry ) .
Why ?
Because I 'm really good at tests .
Whereas some very bright kids freeze up on standardized tests , performing far below their actual academic level .
But let 's pretend that grades and standardized tests actually measure something meaningful , and better results on those would mean that homework accomplishes something .
That 's what a researcher named Harris Cooper did , according to Alfie Kohn , in his book The Homework Myth : Why Our Kids Get Too Much of a Bad Thing .
Cooper looked at a number of different studies of homework and sifted and combined the results to see if some kind of definitive answer emerged .
It did -- but Cooper apparently did n't see it himself .
When Kohn looked at Cooper 's published results , the answer was obvious .
In Cooper 's own words from 1989 : " There is no evidence that any amount of homework improves the academic performance of elementary students . "
That means that there is zero scientific evidence that kids before middle school get any performance boost whatsoever from any amount of homework , no matter how large or small .
And yet when Cooper reached his own conclusions at the end of his published report , he came up with the oft - quoted formula that the ideal amount of homework is ten minutes per grade level per night .
That would mean almost an hour a night for fifth graders -- even though Cooper 's own meta-study found that there was no evidence that any homework for elementary students had any benefit .
Apparently , we have a problem when " science " is done by true believers .
Even when Cooper 's study found no defense for elementary - school homework , he still found a way to recommend in favor of requiring some anyway .
Kohn takes apart all the existing pro-homework studies to demonstrate how fundamentally worthless they are , in methodology , in interpretation , and in how they 're reported .
He does n't prove them false ; he shows that they do n't prove anything at all .
Do n't misunderstand -- Kohn has his own axe to grind .
He 's far more committed to the touchy - feely school of education than I am , and much of his book is slanted in that direction .
But his critique of bad science is sound -- I 've had years of experience with just how bad what passes for science in the field of education can be , and Cooper 's study , for instance , is actually from the reliable end of the spectrum .
When the most - quoted " proof " that homework is " good " states that it can't be shown to have any benefit for elementary school kids , why do we still have teachers sending kids home with work to do from those grades ?
What about High School ?
Here 's what the studies find about homework in high school .
It might make about a four percent difference .
At most .
OK , that might take you from a B+ to an A - .
Or move you up just a tiny bit on the SAT or ACT .
Depending on how you measure academic performance .
Think about that for a moment .
If your kid in twelfth grade spends two hours a night doing homework ( Cooper 's recommended ten minutes per grade per night ) , that means twelve hours a week -- which is the equivalent , when you subtract class changes and lunch , of two extra school days a week .
And those two extra days -- a 28 percent increase in academic time -- make only 4 percent difference in outcome ?
That 's like driving a thumbtack with a sledgehammer .
Is that additional 28 percent worth the nearly trivial 4 percent ?
Let 's factor in the costs of homework .
What Are the Costs of Homework ?
Homework wrecks families .
That 's not a joke , that 's just a fact .
For an alarming number of kids of all ages , their entire relationship with their parents has been turned into a war over homework .
An Endless Cycle .
The first thing the parents say to their kids after school is , " Do you have any homework ? "
That 's not a parent - child relationship , that 's a foreman - millworker relationship .
What 's your task ?
Let 's stay on task !
So the kids are n't actually coming home , are they ?
School is n't over .
It 's just going to go on and on , in their own homes .
They can never , never , never get away .
Not on weekends .
Not on holidays .
Not over Christmas .
Not over summer vacation .
There 's always some assignment from school .
What do you think that does to kids ?
To have not even a day when they can say , Whew , I 'm done with that , I can have a break !
Would you put up with a job that was like that ?
Sure , some people with Type A personalities do live like that -- but most of us do n't even consider that a life .
We want to have days we can count on not belonging to our bosses .
Should n't kids have that too ?
Childhood Obesity .
In all the concern about the hours our children spend playing videogames and watching television , has anybody noticed that time spent doing homework is also not physically active ?
Maybe if our children did n't have to spend even ten minutes a day , let alone hours a day , on homework , they might get enough exercise to shed a few pounds .
Parents As Drill Sergeants .
Parents are told to make sure kids have a regular , well - lighted , quiet place to do homework .
The funny thing is that there is no study indicating that this actually helps homework get done .
What parents really do is set up rewards and punishments .
Do your homework first , and then you can play .
No television till homework is done .
Get it out of the way first !
This is such a horrible mistake .
No wonder so many kids end up in tears over homework .
Why can't they have a couple of hours , right after school , to be themselves ?
Think about it .
They 've spent all day at school where people tell them when to stand , when to sit , when to talk .
Hold still .
No , you can't go to the toilet .
No , you 're wrong .
Pay attention !
You can't eat that in here .
Do n't cross that line .
Stay where I told you !
Hurry up !
Stop that !
And their parents do n't let them have those precious late afternoon hours to run around and be free .
Why ?
So they can get into a better college ?
What good will it do them to get into a better college if they hated their entire childhood ?
So they go to UNC - G instead of Duke because of that four percent difference -- but they have a childhood .
An adolescence .
What do you think will make more of a difference in their lives ?
What will make them happier human beings ?
That 's the goal , is n't it ?
Not the job that makes the most money , but the life that has the most happiness -- right ?
Of course , a lot of parents do n't make their kids do homework during that late afternoon period , because both parents are working and do n't even get home till after five o'clock .
You know what that means .
When young kids have rational bedtimes -- eight o'clock , for instance , which gives them the minimal 10 to 11 hours of sleep that children need -- the parents have only three hours between getting off work and the kids going to bed .
Somewhere in there will be dinner , bathing , whatever chores the kids might be expected to do ( you know , the part of child - rearing that parents do ) -- and ... homework ?
When did we parents decide to give the schools the power to take even a moment of those precious hours away from us and force us to be proctors supervising our children in their schoolwork ?
The high school kids go to bed later -- but they also want a social life .
They have friends .
They want to talk on the phone , go hang out together .
And what about the things they actually love to do -- the plays ?
The sports ?
The dance lessons , the music lessons ?
Is there any time left for parents to be anything but chauffeurs and homework sergeants ?
Homework Kills Students .
I knew a girl who , when she was a rising junior in high school , was assigned to keep a " reading log " over the summer .
This was a girl who had always been a voracious reader , consuming books well above grade level since she was five .
But the moment the teacher intruded in her reading , requiring that she answer questions , make comments , and analyze , every time she set the book down , she stopped reading entirely .
Because her joy of reading had been stolen from her .
It had been turned into an assignment .
It was now work , forced on her by someone else .
That summer she read exactly one book -- a girl who ordinarily would have read at least twenty .
And from that moment on , she was hostile to the entire enterprise of school .
She hated it all .
That summer assignment had turned her into an enemy of the educational system -- she who had been the favorite student of many an English teacher .
Not everyone 's reaction to such assignments is so dramatic .
But there are many bright , eager learners who are turned off from school because homework that was not tailored to their needs intruded into every waking moment and turned their whole lives into a nightmare of never - ending work , under someone else 's control .
Another recent book , The Case Against Homework : How Homework Is Hurting Our Children and What We Can Do About It , by Sara Bennett and Nancy Kalish , is an activist 's handbook .
It makes a powerful case for the damage homework is doing to our families , and then it gives practical suggestions about what you can do to make your own family 's situation better , and perhaps change the way homework is assigned to all the kids in a class , a grade , a school , or a district .
What both books report is one astonishing fact :
There are plenty of teachers who hate homework , too .
Why Teachers Hate Homework
When a teacher assigns each of five classes of 25 students to do 50 math problems overnight , then the teacher has to look at 6,250 math problems .
That 's in addition to the time the teacher spends grading their in - class work -- like quizzes .
And you know the teacher regards those homework results as nearly worthless , because the teacher does n't know who really did the work .
Was it the student , or the parents ?
No way to be sure .
Maybe the student with a dozen mistakes is actually doing better than the student with perfect homework because the student with mistakes is actually doing the work himself .
So the teacher only takes seriously the work the students do in class .
So any time spent grading homework is actually wasted time .
Mostly teachers look at it just to make sure it was done , not to take it seriously as an evaluation tool .
Remarkably , there are even teachers who actually demand that parents proofread their children 's homework .
If the student turns in homework with spelling and punctuation errors , the parents actually get a snippy little note telling them that they 're supposed to proofread their child 's work !
( Though I 'm sure that never happens in Guilford County . )
Here 's another reason some teachers hate homework -- and stop assigning it :
Their own kids reach school age and start having to spend hours a night doing meaningless assignments .
Both books record this phenomenon .
Teachers who are also parents become quite skeptical of the value of homework when they see how it steals time from and ruins their relationships with their children .
Bad Homework
Even admitting that there is some conceivable value to homework in the upper grades , let 's keep in mind that not all homework is equal .
Some kinds of homework are utterly worthless even for seniors in high school .
Art Projects for Academic Classes .
I remember when my oldest son entered chemistry class at Page High School .
During the open house , the teacher proudly told us that the highlight of the year was her requirement that the kids all create a three - dimensional model of the periodic table of elements .
It could be a poster or a t - shirt or a sculpture or ... oh , whatever their creativity suggested .
I raised my hand and pointedly asked how much of the grade would be for art and how much for science ?
She did n't understand my objection .
It was so fun
for the kids .
Nonsense .
It was time - consuming and expensive and a complete waste of time .
Were they going to treasure these models for their whole lives ?
No .
Did it help them actually know more about the periodic table ?
Not a chance .
This is one of the few cases where rote memorization would have been more worthwhile .
They might actually have remembered some of the more common elements ' names , abbreviations , atomic numbers , or weights .
They might have memorized all the gases , especially the inert ones ; all the elements that combine easily ; all the radioactive elements ; all the elements that only occur in the laboratory .
Instead , they made t- shirts .
Or rather , their parents scrambled to figure out how to do it .
There 's an astonishing number of absolutely useless " projects " that are assigned which are really done by the parents anyway , and even if the kids do them , teach them absolutely nothing about the subject matter .
Exactly what does a child learn about astronomy or physics or aerodynamics by building a scale model of the space shuttle ?
Once upon a time , science fairs consisted of displays of voluntary projects done by kids who were really gung - ho about science .
The kids who could n't care less did n't have to bother .
But somebody thought that science fairs were so wonderful that all children should be required to do them .
Did this make the kids who never cared about science suddenly become more interested ?
No .
It was just one more tedious assignment that they postponed until Mom and Dad finally helped them put some stupid thing together at the last minute .
Every now and then , one of our kids actually had a project they cared about and learned something from .
Oddly enough , they were precisely the kind of thing they probably would have done on their own , without anybody requiring them to do it at all -- provided , of course , that they had had any free time .
In other words , the real projects , the ones that kids love , are replaced by the fake ones assigned as homework .
Meaningless Repetition .
Some claim that kids need to do repetitive homework to " nail down " the things they learned in class .
But how many repetitions are needed to " nail it down " ?
If a child has mastered the process , then surely five examples , done in class , will demonstrate the child 's proficiency .
And if the child has not got it right , then what really happens at home when twenty or fifty problems are assigned ?
Either the student does them all wrong , thus " nailing down " the wrong process , or the parent has to try to teach the child what the teacher failed to teach in class .
Is that how homework is supposed to function ?
In that case , it 's really just home schooling -- with less time to do it in and only exhausted children to work with .
Fun and Games .
Here 's a good idea .
Let 's take from the internet a word - search puzzle with terms from the constitution hidden in a 39x39 - letter grid , and make our seventh - grade students play the " game " of finding the important words .
Never mind that a 39x39 word - search grid is monstrously large , that you can get a headache from searching it .
Never mind that the puzzle is n't even clever -- no two terms from the list actually intersect .
None of them shares a letter .
So the puzzlemaker did n't bother to take the time to make a tight , interlocking puzzle .
Nor are the terms themselves useful .
Some are , but some of them are simply not used by grownups in discussions of anything .
And when you 've finally gotten your headache by finding every one of these 29 terms in a huge grid , how much more do you know about the Constitution than you knew before you started ?
Maybe , just maybe , those terms will be marginally more familiar to you .
If you had been assigned to memorize them as spelling words , you could have done it in less time .
When did we actually have any fun ?
And when was any of this actually educational ?
Why is homework like this still being assigned , even though there 's no scientific basis for it ?
And what can we do about it ?
I 'll talk about that in next week 's essay : Homework , Part II .

A new weblog for a new year !
My excuse is that I 'm learning Squeak Smalltalk so I 'm going to need a way to post screenshots , something that 's beyond the capabilities of my custom weblog , and frankly the thought of using Blogger 's Emacs - user - hostile web interface makes me want to scratch my eyes out .
So here I am on Livejournal in the good company of my internet - buddies darius and xach .
Once upon a time I did lots of internet - visible hacking and really enjoyed the feeling of participation in the community with all of you bastards .
My resolution for 2007 is to pick this up again .
The past couple of years I 've instead worked really hard with some friends to build up a happy little Erlang company with an office where we drink our coffee .
We 've developed and marketed a system for mobile phone companies to keep track of all the mobile phones their customers are using and to automatically send configurations for picture messaging , web browsing , and so on .
We 've installed these systems in over 60 countries and have more than 200 million of you puny humans represented in our Mnesia databases .
We 're the market leaders and have only a fraction of our competitors ' staff size , but of course you guessed this when I said " Erlang " . :-)
I 've installed more than a couple of our systems myself and I 've done a lot of on - site hacking .
This has been a fun experience .
A couple of times customers have looked into the Emacs window over my shoulder and said " aha , that 's Erlang ! "
Twice I 've been told " oh , you have magic ! " while I develop and install new features into a live system while simultaneously holding a conversation with the customer .
I must say that I enjoy the adventure - hacker world - travelling customer - impressing lifestyle :-)
Here 're the bits of the earth I 've dragged my muddy boots through so far :
Bahrain 's too small to be on this map but I assure you it 's a lovely place with very friendly people !
... and so to distill this post down to its essense : Hello again , world !
Top House Republican says GOP acted like winos Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday March 7 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an interview with the New York Sun yesterday , a top House Republican excoriated the behavior of his party leading up to the November 2006 Elections , saying they acted like " winos . "
The remark came as Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) discussed the subject of earmarks .
Hensarling is a top House Republican leader .
He serves as the Chairman of the Republican Study Committee , which describes itself at its website as " a group of over 110 House Republicans organized for the purpose of advancing a conservative social and economic agenda . "
When Rep. Hensarling was asked about the Democratic earmark reform program , he remarked " I 'm not personally religiously opposed to earmarks . "
But he said that his party has not managed them responsibly .
" Just like the surgeon general might have told the American populous as a whole that perhaps one glass of red wine a day can be good for your health , he really did n't mean that advice for winos , " Hensarling quipped .
" Unfortunately , too many in our conference have not shown that they can handle earmarks responsibly . "
The Texas Republican also acknowledged that on questions of fiscal responsibility , " somewhere along the way , we lost our way . "
However , he criticized the media for its focus on Republican ethical foibles .
" For whatever reason , the media seemed to pay a little bit more attention to our folks who were ethically challenged than to their folks that were ethically challenged , " he complained .
But he held out hope for a Republican comeback in the future .
" I am convinced that the electorate did not shift to the left , " he insisted .
" They did n't hire the Democrats for what the Democrats believe in .
They fired the Republicans , partly as a protest to the policies in Iraq , but more so because they did n't see Republicans living up to their own principles . "
The full interview can be read at the New York Sun 's Politics website .

The vast bill for rebuilding Iraq has created a need for rigorous auditing
Washington lawmakers have reacted with shock at the discovery that an obscure clause in a military spending bill will terminate the work of the auditor .
The Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has embarrassed the US administration with its reports on corrupt practices .
Critics of the government claim this is what lies behind its sudden closure .
Dogged investigator
Under the direction of Special Inspector General Stuart Bowen , the Office employs 55 auditors and inspectors .
His office has detailed successes among the many reconstruction projects , such as in the rebuilding of infrastructure essential for transport and education .
However , critics of President George W Bush 's Iraq policy seized on the auditor 's conclusion that the overall $ 20 bn ( £ 11.5 bn ) reconstruction effort was being hampered by inefficiency as well as attacks by insurgents .
The auditor recently reported that a subsidiary of Halliburton , the largest US civilian contractor in Iraq , had withheld information from US officials .
Halliburton subsidiary KBR came under scrutiny by the Iraq auditor
It said that KBR , formerly Kellogg Brown & Root , had systematically engaged in practices aimed at veiling the facts around its contracts .
The audit office began operations in March 2004 and has referred 25 criminal cases to the US Department of Justice , of which four have resulted in convictions .
Among its more notable findings was a report on the loss of 14,000 weapons destined for Iraqi government use .
Many of these are believed to have found their way into the hands of insurgent groups after the Pentagon lost track of them .
Perplexed lawmakers
In 2005 , it issued a damning report citing " severe inefficiencies and poor management " at the body that ran Iraq before the recent elections , the Coalition Provisional Authority .
Republican Senator Susan Collins told the New York Times she was mystified about how the termination clause had found its way into the bill .
Senator John Warner , the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , told the newspaper he would push for an extension of Mr Bowen 's charter .
Inspectors from other US government departments , such as the Pentagon , could take over some of the Iraq auditor 's responsibilities .
But the strength of Mr Bowen 's operation lies in its strong presence on the ground in Iraq .
The Pentagon and other US bodies have been criticised by legislators for lacking an extensive network of auditors in Iraq itself .

An international group of researchers has succeeded in identifying a previously unknown group of algae .
As currently reported in the scientific journal Science , the newly discovered algae are found among the smallest members of photosynthetic plankton - the picoplankton .
On account of the minute size of the organisms ( no more than a few thousandth of a millimetre ) and the appearance of phycobili- proteins , researchers have termed the new group Picobiliphyta .
Approximately 50 percent of global photosynthesis is conducted in the world 's oceans where it is dominated by microscopic algae , the so - called phytoplankton .
Scientists estimate that up to 90 percent of phytoplanktonic species are currently unidentified .
In the present study , scientists used molecular techniques to investigate the smallest members of the plankton , the picoplankton .
Because picoplankton algae are so extremely small , they are almost impossible to study by means of microscopy .
Researchers investigated gene sequences of the 18S gene , common to all cells .
The identity of new organisms can be deduced from a comparison of familiar and unfamiliar gene sequences .
" The gene sequences found in these algae could not be associated with any previously known group of organisms " , explain Dr Klaus Valentin and Dr. Linda Medlin , co-authors of the study and molecularbiologists at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven .
The algae in this study were found in plankton samples originating from various regions of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean .
The scientists have discovered a group of organisms which , despite being completely new to science , have a wide distribution .
" This is a good indication for how much there is still to discover in the oceans , especially using molecular tools " , says Valentin .
Apart from the unfamiliar gene sequences , the researchers also extracted phycobili- proteins from the algae .
In red algae , for example , these proteins occur as colour pigments .
However , in the newly discovered algal group , the phycobili- proteins are found at the sites for photosynthesis , i.e. in the plastids .
This location of pigment proteins represents a novelty in that it has not been reported for any other algal species .
Hence , it provides a clear indication that the researchers are dealing with a previously unidentified species of algae .
Referring to their small size and the presence of phycobili proteins , the researchers named the new group Picobiliphytes .

Pizza Flyers : The Height of Good Graphic Design ?
Are pizza flyers well designed ?
The reason I ask is that someone recently said , in all seriousness , that the role of graphic design historians is to identify examples of good graphic design so that we can improve the quality of the pizza flyers we get through our doors .
Of course , � pizza flyers ’ is just a handy euphemism for the sort of everyday graphic design that permeates our lives , being so ubiquitous that it is largely invisible .
Much of this design is undoubtedly � bad ’ in terms of composition , typography and all - round clarity , but is it really � bad design ’ ?
I put this question to my new first year students yesterday during a series of seminars designed to get them thinking ( and re-thinking ) about their preconceptions of their subject .
Pizza flyers , it was agreed , are about as good examples of bad design as you could hope for .
But had any of them used one to order pizza ?
Almost all had , and several said they kept flyers and even had them taped on the fridge door .
So are they badly designed ?
I asked again .
It was like the scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail where the peasants are trying to work out the tortured logic of what it means if a witch burns : �b - because … they ’re made … of wood ?’:
It was clear from a lot of their faces that something was dawning , somewhat uncomfortably , on them .
In this case the logic suggested that if a pizza flyer does its job then , no matter how awful it looks it must , by definition , be �well designed ’ .
I could see most people were struggling with this ( and I imagine most readers of this are too — believe me , I feel your pain ) but the struggle was not because they did n’t see the sense of it , but because it contradicts everything they have ever been taught or read about what makes good design good .
When asked to describe good design the words � creativity ’ , �originality ’ , �vision ’ and � passion ’ came out — hardly the sort of things you ’d associate with pizza flyers .
So why are pizza flyers so good , yet so bad ?
One student repeated a familiar argument : the reason pizza flyers look so bad is because they are put together by people who think that they are designers simply because they have a computer and an illegal copy of Photoshop .
The old �everyone thinks they ’re a designer ’ argument .
Well I ’m not sure I would agree with the generalisation because , while I do n’t doubt that a lot of pizza flyers are put together by �amateurs ’ , a lot of them are designed by your actual real - life designers , some of them for a bit of extra cash but a lot of them as part of their stock - in - trade .
No — the real reason pizza flyers look the way they do is because that ’s what pizza flyers are expected to look like .
It ’s not the designers that are bad , but the visual language .
Comparing a pizza flyer with some agency - originated design is like comparing the language you hear in a court to the stuff you hear on a building site — or college staff room .
Pizza flyers are simply visual expletives : short , brutish and to the point .
But that does n’t answer the earlier comment about a need to improve the quality of design .
Just because that ’s what pizza flyers are expected to look like does n’t mean they should forever look like that , does it ?
I put the question to my students : if approached by a pizza company to design a leaflet to be pushed through thousands of doors in the area , would you produce something like all the others , or strive to be different ?
Most said they would try to be a little more creative and original , selling pizzas without selling out on their own visual tastes .
But would a � well designed ’ pizza flyer work ?
Is n’t it probable that some modernist , sparsely filled masterpiece would send out the signal not that you can have a cheap pizza in minutes , but that you were being offered an expensive and minimalist piece of nouvelle cuisine ?
The fact is , pizza flyers set up precisely the right expectations about the product and the service : cheap , cheerful and quick .
The choice of visual language any graphic designer makes should be appropriate both to the message and to the intended audience .
Differentiation is not an issue here because the pizza market is dependant on reliability and the belief that no matter how many different companies there are offering you pizza , you can be sure you ’ll get the same quality product and service .
I would take issue with the idea that it is the role of the visually literate to impose their values on those they see as the visually illiterate .
And I would question anyone who thinks that effective design , no matter how it looks , is not in some way good design .
Design criticism , and design history , rarely enter TRW ( the real world ) , preferring instead to inhabit a cosy province where everything looks lovely and no designer ever has to hear the dreaded words ‘ that ’s all very nice but could you make the type a bit bigger and all capitals ? ’
The fact that graphic designers have to make money and work for other people should no longer be our profession ’s dirty little secret .
And nor should the fact that graphic design is an essentially multi-lingual activity in which we should , must , be willing to use the same language as the people with whom we are communicating .
Ignoring the invisible visual communication around us , and the powerful effects it has , and looking down our noses at the 99 % of designers who operate in that economy risks us producing a generation of designers who shun work they see as beneath them and insist on speaking a visual language only they understand .
No wonder the vacuum is being filled with amateurs .
