The 10 Most Disgusting Delicacies to Try Before You Die - Would You Eat These ?
“ Think ” Fear Factor and Iron Chef combined and you have THE potentially most disgusting buffet of expertly prepared food delicacies on the planet .
The world is truly a diverse place especially when you launch a gustatory exploration of what have become curious ick - factor foods for a modernized , watered - down , American palate .
Truth is as “ foreign ” as most of these dishes can be , many have deep cultural underpinnings , some of them the side dishes of famous feasts and the tables of kings .
All the vital organs of just about any species have been consumed at one time or another and some of them are rich in the best dietary nutrients .
Amazonian ants , half - cooked fetal eggs , wriggly worms of all kinds and stages of life , hoofs , beaks , ears , and eyeballs have all been efficiently put to good culinary use .
Prep methods are just as enticing : fermenting , pickling , infusing , boiling , blowtorching , decomposing , and simply served live and wriggling .
Culinary Thrill - Seeking for Some , Time - Honored Traditions for Others
If you ’re a gag - seeker , foodie adventurer , or looking for some tantalizing new ethnic dish to serve to guests that goes well beyond the ordinary dinner party fare , here are some of the notoriously “ I hope I ’m never served … ” foods , and how they ’re prepared , from around the globe .
1. This Cheese is So Gross It ’s Been Outlawed …
Casu Marzu , a pecorino cheese and Sardinian specialty , surely wins among most disgusting cheeses of the world .
The direct translation is “ rotten cheese ” and rightly so : blocks of otherwise beautiful Italian pecorino cheeses are purposely prepared to become the natural breeding grounds for nests of maggots — the natural harbingers of rot and putrefaction .
As if pecorino was n’t pungent enough …
Like many distinct ethnic practices and traditions , formaggio marcio , is a generations old culinary delicacy , with roots in familial history .
The process of producing casu marzu , aka “ maggot cheese , ” is considered a process of finely metered fermentation .
However regionally traditional the consumption of maggot - laced cheese , it hardly jives with modern food preparation and sanitation mores , therefore the offending cheese is officially illegal .
Do n’t let that stop you from searching for a chunk along your Italian travels , even if it will run you a steep number of Euros and from a “ black market ” peddler .
“ Godfather , you want formaggio marcio ?
We ’ll get you formaggio marcio , do n’t you worry . ”
Reports are it tastes exactly as you might imagine : strong pecorino , the crawly snot - plump bodies of insect larvae , and the slimy fat they ’ve made of the digested cheese .
Oh , and the worms jump off the cheese while you ’re eating it .
Mange !
2. Mongolian Boodog
They do n’t call it “ Outer Mongolia ” for nothing .
Nomads , sans stainless steel gourmet kitchens , ages ago found more ingenious ways to cook a whole goat , sometimes marmot ( but they may have fleas that host bubonic plague , so goat may be a better choice ) — from the inside out , after you ’ve hung it upside down , bled it and broken its legs .
The stuffing is a bit non-Western , too : smooth hot stones crammed into every cavity imaginable and even up under the leg skin where you would have yanked the broken the bones out .
Blowtorch the beast ‘ til desired doneness ; it can also be roasted over an open fire .
That ’s authentic Mongolian barbecued meat , Boodog .
3. Soft - Boiled Fetal Duck
Balut takes a top spot by a landslide among the gross egg category , which should include 100 - year old eggs .
Balut is a fairly common and unassuming street food available in both the Philipines and Vietnam .
It has also earned a widespread reputation as one of the all - time grossest ethnic delicacies .
Most of the eggs with which Americans are familiar are unfertilized eggs .
The balut , though are fertilized duck eggs , incubated or allowed to grow invitro for a certain length of time , usually a few weeks .
Peel back the shell and along with a typical soft - boiled eggy interior is also the small inert body of a fetal duck — small bones , feathers , beak and all , some more developed than others .
Most accounts suggest slurping it right from the shell with a pinch of salt .
There is a right way to “ enjoy ” balut .
4. Whole Sheep ’s Head
Sheep ’s head has been a traditional delicacy served in a number of world regions , including the Mediterranean and Northern Europe .
You ’ll find smoked versions and recipes for sheep ’s head soup , usually presented whole and intact , sometimes with brains , often without ( risky to consume ) .
The eyeballs and tongue are particular delicacies .
In America , most meats are separated from their heads , their feet , their tails — so we can forget about the fact that we ’re eating something that once had a head , feet and a tail and at that point we no longer call it cow or pig , but T - bone steak , and bacon .
Herein lies the grisly factor in sitting down to a meal of whole sheep ’s head .
5. Octopus , Straight - Up
Anything still alive and squirming is food for a “ most disgusting ” list .
Raw seafood is legendary in most Asian cuisines .
Japanese sushi is notorious in the raw realms .
Raw octopus is common as is still alive octopus , served straight - up on a plate or in a bowl .
Baby octopus ( sannakji ) may be served cut into bite - sized , still - wriggling pieces , suction cups and all , or slurped squirming , whole .
Octopus is exactly as you might imagine : rubbery , chewy and fairly tasteless and some brave adventurers report the suction cups sticking on the way down .
Regardless , the dish has been a valued part of Korea ’s cuisine for centuries and is considered a vitality enhancer and a health food .
At the other end of the spectrum , Korean kimchi is often fermented in jars underground for months and may use brined seafood for seasoning .
6. Vacationing in Alaska : “ Do n’t Eat the Stink Heads ”
Salmon is a staple of the native Alaskan diet and natives have traditionally used all parts of the fish .
One of the traditional delicacies is fermented salmon heads .
Colloquially the dish has earned the name “ stink heads . ”
Essentially the heads of King salmon are buried in the ground in fermentation pits , put into plastic or wooden barrels , even plastic food storage bags , and left to let nature do its thing for a few weeks or more .
The heads are then harvested and consumed as a putty - ish mash .
“ Stink heads ” as a distinct ethnic cuisine have been covered in various mainstream media the latest of which is The Food Network ’s “ Bizarre Foods ” show .
In and of themselves salmon heads are not repulsive , whole fish dishes are a legitimate part of rustic AND haute cuisine everywhere and King salmon is a real world delicacy .
What has struck the “ gross - out ” nerve is the overriding fact that much of the stink head prep process is less about fermentation and more about rot and decomposition .
The dish , by modern culinary standards , is nothing but rotten salmon heads , albeit treasured tribal fare .
Imagine , a bucket load of large King Salmon heads left outside during the warm summer months for a few weeks ….
Outside the native Alaskan culture the stink head topic is nothing but a novelty , but health - wise the tradition of stink head consumption poses a real and continued challenge to regional Alaskan healthcare professionals faced with frequent and , sometimes serious , totally avoidable botulism cases .
7. Deadly Fish : License to Cook
One of Japan ’s most elite delicacies is also one of the most dangerous dishes you ’d ever put in your mouth .
The fugu fish is a cute little puffer fish , hardly “ most disgusting , ” but grossly lethal , certainly .
Coursing throughout its vital fish organs is deadly venom — tetrodotoxin -- a natural defense system that renders its attackers paralyzed .
Ingest enough of this fish ’s poison and you ’ll go belly - up , too dying a slow death from conscious paralysis and asphyxia .
Currently , no type of anti-venom exists to undo what ’s done from fugu poisoning .
Regardless of the risk , in Japan ’s most luxurious restaurants trained and licensed fugu chefs deftly prepare fugu for high society types , fugu aficionados , and culinary thrill seekers .
Chefs adhere to strict preparation , sanitation , storage , and disposal guidelines to minimize risk .
Has fugu killed anyone ?
You bet it has , though annual deaths resulting from fugu consumption nowadays are few and generally accidental .
For true gastronomic satisfaction the best chefs are able to prepare fugu laced with a remaining trace of venom , which reportedly tingles on the tongue , providing the eater with a sensory brush with death .
The potential risk makes fugu even more a thrill to consume and one forbidden to hit the Japanese Emporer ’s dinner plate .
8. Jellied Moose Nose
The ‘ jelly ’ part makes it sound sweet , like a clear jelly you spread on a nice thick slice of toasted sourdough .
But jellied is how the moose nose is prepared , not jelly as in bread spread .
This is , after all the cooking is done , a traditional and time - honored Alaskan dish of real sliced moose snout .
White meat or dark ?
The list could go on AND even more interestingly be drawn from the perspective of someone well outside the American diet .
A non-American list of most disgusting “ delicacies ” would probably begin with the All - American hotdog and a bag of pork rinds : “ A ghastly , but clever disguising of cast off animal parts that do nothing for your health or virility . ”
9. Bat Paste –
Make sure you try this last because it could kill you .
First , net a bunch of flying mouse , fruit , or fox bats in a remote village .
Drop live into a pot of boiling water or milk .
Roast to desired doneness .
Chop and make into paste with Thai herbs and spices .
Or when you have an abundance of fruit bats , try this optional Fruit Bat Soup recipe .
Bats are part of the native cuisine in Thailand , parts of China , Guam and more , but they are considered notorious disease carriers .
You might want to consider dropping them to the bottom of your culinary To - Try list .

An SQL Injection vulnerability has been found in Rails .
The issue affects Rails < 2.1.1 , namely the : limit and : offset parameters that are not correctly sanitized :
Person.find ( : all , : limit => “ 10 ; DROP TABLE users ; ” )
A possible attack will work only if you allow the user control these two values as in User. find ( : all , : limit => 10 , : offset => params [ : offset ] ) .
Note that will_paginate is not affected , it escapes the values before .
This seemed to affect only PostgreSQL and SQLite as MySQL by default disallows multiple SQL statements .
So you can not drop a table .
However , it could be used for information disclosure .
Consider the UNION SQL statement :
User.find ( : all , : limit => params [ : limit ] )
params [ : limit ] #= “ 1 UNION ( select 1,2 , password , 4, 5,6,7,8,9, 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 from users ) ”
What does this mean ?
The result is the full users table , with one small modification :
One field contains the user ’s password and the other fields are always a number between 0 and 9 .
Let ’s assume the third column is the user ’s first name and the application returns everything it found .
This means an attacker may read the user ’s password in the first name field .
All he has to do is find out about the table names ( take a look at the controller names ) , the column names ( review the HTML source , guessing ) and the number of columns in the table ( try it ) .
The UNION statement will work only if the second table has the same number of columns as the first one – hence the list of numbers .
Of course there might not be a password column in clear text , but this could be used to read any data from the database , or even other databases .
Countermeasures
Ontario's unique pension - plan safety net that makes payments when companies go bankrupt is teetering on the edge of being wiped out and could fold if a large corporation were to go under soon , experts warn .
The provincial government is currently accepting comments on a report it commissioned in 2006 – the first review of pension laws in 20 years – and lead author Harry Arthurs concluded the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund , the only such program of its kind in Canada , could soon become history .
" I think one sufficiently large company or several large companies ( going bankrupt ) would cause the plan to go broke , " Arthurs said in an interview , adding that the Ontario government is in no way required to save the pension - insurance program .
" They certainly have no legal obligation to bail it out ... and I think it 's an interesting question – if there is n't enough money , what happens next ? "
Since 1980 , the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund has provided pensioners with up to $ 1,000 per month in the case that a pension plan fails to provide its full benefit , or any at all .
The program is funded by corporate payments and had been run successfully for decades .
But the report notes it 's increasingly common that companies are reporting high levels of unfunded pension liabilities – shortfalls in funds needed to pay out its pension requirements – and the provincial fund is threatened by a possible " shipwreck scenario . "
That could occur if a bankrupted company with many employees flooded the fund with claims and the government found the shortfall too expensive to make up .
Similar fears have been raised in the past because of troubled companies like Algoma Steel , Massey Combines and Stelco , and special provisions were made by the government to keep the fund afloat .
But the plan last reported a deficit of $ 102 million , and there 's no guarantee the government would be willing to again prevent a shipwreck scenario , said Simon Archer , a senior staff member of the expert commission that wrote the report .
He said a shipwreck scenario appears to be " pretty realistic " considering the plight of companies like Nortel , and struggles faced by automakers , manufacturers and the pulp and paper sector .
" If the question is how likely is it , I 'd say there 's pretty good odds these days that there 's going to be a major insolvency and that will put pressure on the PBGF , " Archer said .
While pensioners with large corporations would likely be among the first to be looked after in the case of a government bailout , a failure of the fund is a scary proposition for employees with smaller companies , he added .
" The big guys are going to get attention one way or another but the little guys need this insurance system to keep their pensions in place , " Archer said .
" Problem is , if you 're a tiny little auto parts plant in Brantford or wherever , the government 's not going to step in because you 're not powerful enough ... to attract political attention . "
The report recommends that the government not only find a way to maintain the fund , but also boost its premiums to a maximum of $ 2,500 a month to reflect the current cost of living .
" Nobody loses a pension , what a good public policy that would be , " Archer said .

First off , before I get started on some more guidelines for writing maintainable queries , Regina and Leo already wrote about Part I .
My response to their example is , there is a clear lack of comprehensibility there … but it ’s due to badly named tables , not a need for aliases , let alone single - letter aliases .
And if you ’re stuck with badly named tables , then by all means use aliases … but use meaningful aliases .
Regina , Leo , if you do n’t feel you made your point , how about a more realistic example ?
Use Explicit Joins
Due to parser / planner limitations from 10 years ago ( or 5 years ago in the case of MySQL ) , developers have gotten used to doing their joins in the WHERE clause , SQL89 - style .
Today , this is like programmers who limit all of their function names to 8 characters because darn it , that ’s all FORTRAN ever needed !
WHERE - clause joins are a bad habit , both because they mix up the joins and the filter conditions .
They also make it easy to leave out a join condition entirely , resulting in a cartesian product which might not be discovered until tables are fully populated in production , at which time it brings the whole server down .
Explicit joins ( e.g. persons JOIN posts ON persons.id = posts.author ) are far more readable , and make it easy for you and other maintainer to visualize the full chain of relations produced by the query .
This , in turn , makes it easy ( or at least less difficult ) to see where problems might be happening , especially extra result rows or an empty result set .
PostgreSQL and other advanced databases are capable of reordering your explicit joins just as easily as WHERE clause joins .
So there ’s no performance difference , either .
Use that Whitespace !
One of the other issues I encounter constantly , both in reading clients ’
SQL and on the PostgreSQL IRC channel and mailing lists , is that people will submit queries as one big line , or broken up randomly in a way that does n’t improve readability at all .
Usually I ask the submitter to reformat the query and come back .
SQL is n’t Python .
Whitespace is seldom significant , and has no performance impact .
So , linebreak , tab and space for maximum readability ; think of your SQL as its own documentation and format it like documentation .
Here ’s a good way to use whitespace :
Each clause ( SELECT , FROM , WHERE , GROUP , ORDER ) should go on its own line .
Clauses which are more than 80 characters long should be broken up at natural divisions ( like commas between identifiers ) and tabbed to wrap to a new line .
Subqueries should start on their own line , and be tabbed inwards to match up with the start of the subquery , with each subquery clause starting its own line .
Complex expressions should also get their own line , tabbed in .
Since that ’s a little hard to picture , here ’s a generic template : SELECT table1 , field1 , table2.field2 , expression1 , expression2 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON condition JOIN table3 ON condition WHERE filter1 AND filter2 AND table1.field5 IN ( SELECT fieldA FROM subtableA WHERE filterA ) GROUP BY field1 , field2 ORDER BY field1 , field2
Breaking it up over multiple lines like this makes it easy to zero in on the particular clause which is giving the query problems .
Some people prefer to line up a division line between the syntax keywords and the identifiers instead of tabbing .
This approach can be very readable as well , but it ’s hard to demonstrate using simple HTML so I do n’t have an example .
Other Rules for Readability
Here ’s a few other formatting tips to make your queries easy to read , understand , and maintain :
SQL grammar words and builtins ( such as SELECT , AS and MAX ) should be in all caps , and identifiers and custom functions should be in lower case .
In the FROM and WHERE clauses , try to put the tables and fields in the same order they are in in the SELECT and / or GROUP BY clauses .
Never use the shortcut of referencing GROUP BY identifiers by position ( e.g. ORDER BY 2,3 ) , even if the SQL standard does allow it .
) , even if the SQL standard does allow it .
Refer to fields by their “ table. field ” and not just “ field ” name unless the query is very simple .
This means that you do n’t need to look up each table definition to find out where a field is from .
Putting It All Together

It seems Karl Marx knew a thing or two about the causes of banking crises :
Owners of capital will stimulate the working class to buy more and more of expensive goods , houses and technology , pushing them to take more and more expensive credits , until their debt becomes unbearable .
The unpaid debt will lead to bankruptcy of banks , which will have to be nationalised , and the State will have to take the road which will eventually lead to communism "

Skiers including Olympic gold medalists made an appeal at the UN climate talks in Poland to do more to slow global warming , keeping skiers in business .
[ social_buttons ]
Late last week , several Polish skiers and snowboarders slid down a ramp covered by snow trucked in by the WWF and handed a petition to Polish Environment Minister Macjiec Nowicki in Poznan .
Looking beyond the carbon footprint of trucking - in a ton of snow , it ’s great to see unusual players getting involved in these important global climate change talks .
>> More on the UN COP14 climate talks in Poland
“ Ice and snow are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of global warming , and as avid skiers and snowboarders we see our beloved sports endangered , ” about two dozen skiers said in the petition .
The skiers said climate change means milder winters and less snowfall from the Alps to the Andes , and from the Rockies to the Himalayas .
Signatories of the petition included U.S. Olympic and world Alpine ski champions Ted Ligety and Julia Mancuso , Swiss Olympic gold medal snowboarder Tanja Frieden and eighties - era Austrian ski jumping gold medalist Toni Innauer .
The petition to the 187 - nation talks urged a new global climate treaty , due to be agreed by the end of 2009 , to limit a rise in world temperatures to less than 2 Celsius ( 3.6 Fahrenheit ) since the Industrial Revolution .

Indian IT service providers are losing their advantage against global competitors for providing IT outsourcing services as customer satisfaction levels fall .
But they still compete successfully and still achieve high customer satisfaction levels .
Indian IT outsourcer
Infosys came top with a level of satisfaction , recorded by businesses that outsource IT functions , of 75 % .
The average satisfaction was 64 % .
BT came bottom out of 21 companies in a poll for customer satisfaction with a score of 50 % .
The research carried out by sourcing consultancy Equaterra , for the year 2008 , revealed that although Indian suppliers had good customer satisfaction some of the big global providers are closing the gap .
Satisfaction with Satyam declined 15 % , TCS dropped 8 % and Wipro fell 4 % .
But satisfaction with three of the global providers Accenture , Getronics and Hewlett - Packard increased by 3 % , while Capgemini improved by 8 % , Logica by 5 % and IBM by 9 % .
" It seems that the Indian providers are losing their traditional advantage against the global players and that there is more choice for customers the world is becoming a more level playing field .

WASHINGTON —
The government ’s terrorist watch list has hit 1 million entries , up 32 % since 2007 .
[ efoods ]
Federal data show the rise comes despite the removal of 33,000 entries last year by the FBI ’s Terrorist Screening Center in an effort to purge the list of outdated information and remove people cleared in investigations .
It ’s unclear how many individuals those 33,000 records represent — the center often uses multiple entries , or “ identities , ” for a person to reflect variances in name spellings or other identifying information .
The remaining million entries represent about 400,000 individuals , according to the center .
The new figures were provided by the screening center and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to requests from USA TODAY .
“ We ’re continually trying to improve the quality of the information , ” says Timothy Edgar , a civil liberties officer at the intelligence director ’s office .
“ It ’s always going to be a work in progress . ”

The lies just trip off a bloke ’s tongue : “ Yes , you look gorgeous .
No , your bum does n’t look too big .
Of course you have n’t put on weight . ”
Whether he ’s being polite to save her feelings or fibbing for an easy life , there ’s one inescapable truth .
Marriages and relationships survive on white lies .
As kids we are taught that honesty is the best policy but what happens if you tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth to your wife for a year ?
Welshman Cathal Morrow , 43 , did just that with 39 - year - old Patti , his wife of five years and the mother of his two sons .
Academic Cathal , now living in Madrid , is writing a book about his experiences .
The home truths were not always easy to take and there were some tears and tantrums .
But was the total honesty the making or the breaking of their marriage ?
HIS STORY
When I started this challenge in February last year telling the truth to the missus was not easy .
I reckon I told about six white lies a day and that was fine .
If Patti asked me whether her dress made her look fat it might have sounded like a question .
But , as every man knows , it was really a prompt for immediate reassurance along the lines of : “ Of course not darling , you look fantastic . ”
That ’s how I ’d always answer before my mission – taking the easy route , fibbing .
If I was sitting on the sofa and Patti asked me the question every man dreads : “ What are you thinking about ? ” I ’d come up with a flippant reply such as football , money or anything else to avoid the terrible truth .
Now I had to be honest .
If I was daydreaming about an ex-girlfriend , or about sex , I had to tell my wife .
But when I did I was in for a shock .
Instead of being angry or jealous she simply shrugged it off .
Staying with Patti ’s parents , I had always kept quiet as I do n’t see eye - to - eye with her mum , Maria , who was critical about our lives and how we were raising the kids Borja , four , and Elkin , two .
But we spent four months under the same roof when we first relocated from Wales to Spain and I decided keeping quiet was as much as a lie when I had so much to say .
So , I told Maria what I thought .
Surprisingly , Patti actually seemed to approve and even Patti ’s mum took it better than I had expected .
Patti , who is Spanish , will often cook traditional Spanish food , like tripe , which I secretly did not like .
This year I ’ve had to tell her straight .
Throughout our marriage , Patti has always asked my opinion about the clothes she buys and her weight .
She goes through stages where she ’ll eat loads and , to be honest , it shows .
Before , I went on auto - pilot and made reassuring noises about how lovely she looked .
Now , when she asks me if I think her bum looks big , I ’ll tell her it does .
It might sound cruel .
But what I ’ve learned over the past year is that how you tell the truth matters .
So I ’ll say “ yes , your bum does look bigger , but I like it that way ” .
And I honestly do .
Another time white lies used to arise was when I was going out with the lads .
I ’d fly to meetings in London and stay at a friend ’s house while Patti stayed in Madrid looking after the boys .
When she asked me on the phone what I ’d done with my mates , I ’d avoid telling her we went to the pub because she ’s probably been bored stuck at home and no man wants to risk an ear - bashing .
But now I ’ll tell her the truth , that we went for beers .
I ’ve discovered that the fear of people ’s reaction to the truth is often much worse than the reality of it .
There have been times where we ’ve been out for a meal and a pretty woman has caught my eye .
If Patti asked if I was looking at her , I ’d feign surprise .
Now I ’ll admit , yes , I was looking at her and I found her attractive but Patti has nothing to worry about .
The year - long experiment ’s almost over now and I ’m so glad I did it .
I really feel it ’s made our relationship stronger .
Like a lot of men , I do n’t like talking about feelings .
But now I have to .
And because of it , I think Patti and I have become much stronger .
HER STORY
I thought Cathal was mad when he first told me he wanted to spend a year telling only the truth .
I did n’t think he could do it – not because he ’s dishonest – but because the British are always so polite .
And part of that is telling the odd white lie to not offend anyone .
I must admit Cathal ’s total honesty soon became a bit of a pain in the backside .
For a start , I noticed that he ’d have to think a lot more before speaking , as though he was really trying to work out what the truth was instead of blurting out a quick reply .
Sometimes it ’s been difficult .
I go through stages where I just want to relax on the sofa with a bar of chocolate , and Cathal will come right out and tell me I ’m being lazy !
Other times I ’ll have put on a bit of weight , and I ’ll ask Cathal if he thinks it ’s noticeable .
Before he ’d always reassure me that I looked fine – and that is what most women want to hear , even if they know it ’s a lie .
Now my husband ’s brutally honest .
He ’ll tell me my bum ’s looking big or that I ’ve put on weight .
At first it was hard to hear that – no woman wants to hear their husband tell them they look fatter .
But I do appreciate the honesty , and I know that Cathal still finds me attractive .
Of course , when Cathal started all this , I asked him a few questions about things you always wonder as a wife .
Such as if he ’s ever cheated on me .
It ’s the only thing I fear as I was with a serial cheater before .
But Cathal told me he has n’t cheated , and I believe him 100 per cent .
People could say that he ’s still lying but Cathal ’s told the truth in some difficult situations before , so I know he ’s not afraid to be honest .
He even told my mother that he disagreed with things she was telling us about bringing up our children , and that could n’t have been easy .
If I ’m honest , I can be very temperamental and Cathal and I have always had big rows .
But our arguments have now changed completely – for the better .
Beforehand we would just have massive rows , and not speak until the situation had calmed down .
Now we ’ll fight and then Cathal will walk away .
He ’ll think about it and then come back and we ’ll talk about it honestly .
Cathal will tell me why he was wrong and we ’ll discuss it .
It also means that during fights Cathal will tell me home truths that do hurt to hear , but I believe honesty is important in a relationship and it means we can move on .
Other things were not easy to take .
For instance , when I start cleaning the house , I ca n’t stop .
This year he ’s told me I ’m an obsessive compulsive about cleaning and that it gets out of control .
When he said that I cried .
It ’s not nice to be told about your problems , is it ?
But overall I definitely prefer this Cathal .
He ’s much calmer and he ’s not as confrontational .
I think it ’s because he has to be so thoughtful about what he says and does .
He tries to see things from the other perspective more and he seems much more considerate .
And it ’s rubbed off on me too .
I find that if I tell a lie , it makes me feel dirty .
It might not always be easy to listen to the truth , especially from your husband .
But I ’m lucky .
How many other women can say their husband never lies ?
10 lies it ’s OK to tell
We all like to think we are honest and straight - talking but it seems no one is immune to telling little porky pies .
Relationship psychologist Susan Quilliam explains : “ You learn how to tell white lies as a child and as you get older you generally tell them to avoid hurting others , and that goes in a relationship , too .
“ Lies to women are mainly about appearance , attractiveness and sex appeal and supportive comments they need to hear . ”
Here are some of the favourites :
1 . No darling , you look as toned as you did before the baby .
2. Dinner was delicious .
The four hours you took cooking it really paid off .
3 . Yes , your best friend is really funny .
She ’s great .
4 . No I did n’t fancy that girl on the other table .
5 . She ’s all right looking I guess , for a model .
I had n’t really noticed .
6 . I was just thinking about how much I love you , that ’s all .
7 . I have n’t thought about my ex in years .
Why would I when I have you ?
8 . I love my present , especially after you spent three months trawling the shops to find it .
9 . Your boss was out of order .
You ’re good at your job and not difficult at all .
10 . Great !
It ’ll be good to see your mum again .

The two - part series Red Dwarf : Back to Earth , will kick start a Red Dwarf Easter weekend from Good Friday on TV channel Dave .
This will be followed by Red Dwarf : Unplugged , a " no holds barred " episode with no sets , no effects - and no autocue .
The weekend will climax with Red Dwarf : the Making of Back to Earth , a behind - the - scenes special from the new production .
Dave will reveal news snippets from the production at joindave .co.uk .
Red Dwarf is Dave 's biggest commission yet and its first foray into scripted comedy .
The offbeat series , set in space , has enjoyed phenomenal success since it first aired in 1988 on BBC2 .
It brought in more than eight million viewers for series eight , sold 7.25 million DVD and videos worldwide , broadcast in some 25 territories worldwide and won International Emmy and British Comedy Awards .
The actors have hit the headlines for various reasons since the show ended .
Charles now plays toyboy cabbie Lloyd in Coronation Street .
In November last year , John - Jules was ordered to carry out 120 hours community service for assaulting two refuse collectors .
Ecuador Repudiates Foreign Debt : It ’s About Time
According to Daniel Denvir ( AlterNet , December 15 ) , Ecuador ’s president announced in early December that his country would not be paying the interest on its foreign debt in 2009 , repudiating it as “ illegal . ”
The value of the bonds defaulted on amounts to 19 % of GDP .
As the Australians would say , good on them .
Denvir quotes a statement by the Confederation of Ecuadorian Kichwas ( ECUARUNARI ) , part of the country ’s indigenous peoples movement : “ We have not acquired any debt .
The so - called public debt really belongs to the oligarchy .
We the peoples have not acquired anything or been benefited , and thus we owe nothing . ”
That ’s entirely correct .
In the specific case of Ecuador , according to John Perkins ( Confessions of an Economic Hit Man ) , the loans were designed to foment conditions that make [ Ecuador ] subservient to the corporatocracy running our biggest corporations , our government , and our banks . ”
Infratructure loans were granted on the condition that “ engineering and construction companies from our own country must build all these projects .
In essence , most of the money never leaves the United States ; it is simply transferred from banking offices in Washington to engineering offices in New York , Houston , or San Francisco . ”
More generally , as described by Bruce Rich in “ The Cuckoo in the Nest ” ( The Ecologist , Jan. / Feb. 1994 ) , the World Bank over the past sixty years has nurtured the growth of technocratic complexes within Third World governments , insulated from outside political control , which parrot the assumptions and goals of the World Bank .
From the 1950s onwards , a primary focus of [ World ]
Bank policy was “ institution - building ” , most often taking the form of promoting the creation of autonomous agencies within governments that would be continual World Bank borrowers .
Such agencies were intentionally established to be independent financially from their host governments , as well as minimally accountable politically –except , of course , to the Bank .
The World Bank created the Economic Development Institute in 1956 specifically to enculture Third World elites into the values of the Bretton Woods system .
It offered a six - month course in “ the theory and practice of development , ” whose 1300 alumni by 1971 included prime ministers , ministers of planning , and ministers of finance .
The creation of such patronage networks has been one of the World Bank ’s most important strategies for inserting itself in the political economies of Third World countries .
Operating according to their own charters and rules ( frequently drafted in response to Bank suggestions ) , and staffed with rising technocrats sympathetic , even beholden , to the Bank , the agencies it has funded have served to create a steady , reliable source of what the Bank needs most–bankable loan proposals .
They have also provided the Bank with critical power bases through which it has been able to transform national economies , indeed whole societies , without the bothersome procedures of democratic review and discussion of the alternatives .
These complexes of World Bank and native government technocrats operate this way even when the government is nominally democratic ; but for decades the World Bank enthusiastically pursued such policies even ( or especially ) within military dictatorships ( often installed by the U.S. , back in the days before the neocons discovered the virtues of “ democracy ” ) .
Their main function is to work in collusion with the World Bank to run up debt building the infrastructure foreign capital needs for profitable investment .
A majority of World Bank loans since that agency ’s inception have gone to building the roads and utilities necessary to support foreign - owned industry .
The effect is to crowd out decentralized , small - scale , locally - owned industry serving local markets , and to integrate the domestic economy into a neoliberal framework of providing raw materials and labor for foreign industry .
The resulting debt ( which the people of the country never approved ) can then be used to further cement neoliberal policies , by blackmailing the local government into adopting a structural adjustment program .
And the policies adopted under such programs generally include the “ privatization ” of the same infrastructure the loans were taken out to build , and selling it to the very people it was built to serve .
Not only that , but the “ privatization ” is generally arranged on terms virtually dictated by the purchasers , with native governments sometimes spending more taxpayer money to make the assets salable than the sale actually fetches .
And , naturally , the purchasing companies ’ first order of business after such transactions is generally asset - stripping , with revenues from the sale of assets often exceeding the total purchase price .
In other words , Third World countries are borrowing money to buy the rope to hang themselves with .
Here ’s hoping that Ecuador ’s debt repudiation is the first of many more to come , and that the Third World declares its own jubilee in 2009 without waiting for permission from Bono .
Some people consider oral sex the most intimate of all sex acts .
Cunnilingus , the technical term for performing oral sex on a woman , can be incredibly intimate .
To be good at it , you have to be an excellent reader of her body , her breathing , her movements , and what she might be telling you with words .
Everything you do is for your partner at that moment and should n't be based on performance expectations , lessons from porn , or previous oral sex experiences .
Clean Yourself Up
Make sure your hands are clean and your nails are trimmed as you 'll want to use your hands as well as your mouth on her .
If you have facial hair and shave regularly , be sure to do it beforehand ; nothing kills the mood quite like sandpaper on her sensitive parts .
Get Wet
A lot of people have preconceived notions about the taste and / or smell of their partner ’s genitals .
If you 're anxious about this , suggest a romantic bath or shower together and then go down on her .
Getting naked and wet with each other is never a bad idea , and as you get more comfortable , you will probably find that your partner 's taste and smell trigger more arousal than anything else .
Some people use flavored lubricants , and many dental dams ( great for safer sex ) are flavored also .
Start Slowly
Most women wo n’t want to go from zero to oral sex in 30 seconds .
Take your time and ease into it .
Do other things you know she loves .
Use your hands and mouth all over her body , which will nicely foreshadow what is to come .
When she ’s good and excited , her hips are thrusting and the moans pretty regular , head south .
Get Comfortable
Both of you will enjoy this more if you ’re both physically comfortable .
Use pillows and be creative with oral sex positions so that you are both relaxed and feel like you can move around .
Some people will find it hard on their neck to lie between their partner 's legs with their head poised over her vulva .
For others , this will work just great .
Remember that it ’s okay to change positions and move around .
Get the Lay of the Land
If you do n’t have the body parts , you might want to brush up on your female genital anatomy .
Most of the attention with cunnilingus is on the clitoris , but every woman is different and there may be other parts of her that will take oral sex from the every day to the out of this world .
Use your fingers to spread her lips and take a good look at her clitoris , her labia , her mons , her vagina , her perineum and her anus .
When in Doubt , Go Slow
A lot of women have very sensitive clitorises , so avoid stampeding to the clitoris .
Flatten your tongue and use wide slow strokes to explore her inner and outer lips , her vagina , and her clitoris .
Imagine licking an ice cream cone .
Start at the perineum and lick up and around her clit and back down the other side .
Check the Hood
Most women prefer to have their clitoral hood licked .
This is a fold of skin that covers the actual glans of the clitoris , which is extremely sensitive .
Experiment With Different Strokes
In general , women tend to like firm pressure and repetitive motion .
Quick tongue flicks against the clitoris can be irritating .
If you ’re not sure , ask her to give you feedback while you try different kinds of strokes — circular , side - to - side , up - and - down .
Do n’t take it personally if she flinches — discovering what pleases is often a process of trial and error .
Let Her Give You a Hand
If you 've ever seen her masturbate , you have some idea how she likes her clit to be touched .
Ask her to show you now , or you can offer her your hand and ask her to demonstrate the kind of stroking she prefers by placing hers on top of yours .
Add Penetration
When she ’s good and excited , add some lubricant to your fingers or toy and gently insert it into her vagina .
Move them in and out using short but firm strokes .
Put your mouth back on her clitoris and lick her while you penetrate her .
This wo n’t do it for all women , but many love the experience of clitoral stimulation and penetration .
Keep a Steady Pace
Women like steady stimulation , so do n’t stop unless you need to come up for air .
You ’ll see the signs when she ’s getting ready to go over the top — her moans , her thighs pressing against your head , her body arching , her hands tightening on your head — she ’ll let you know when to stop .
A Few Extra Words of Advice
The GOP ’s Anti-Stimulus Manifesto

For five years , classical liberal columnist and Council on Foreign Relations fellow Amity Shlaes delved deeply into the history of the Great Depression .
She had been an op - ed editor at the Wall Street Journal , a WSJ columnist reuniting Germany , and a columnist for the Financial Times .
She wrote two books , on German national identity and on America ’s tax policy , critiqued from the right .
Both sold well , but neither one foreshadowed the success she ’d have with her research on the New Deal .
The Forgotten Man : A New History of the Great Depression , published in 2007 , has become one of the most influential books of the decade .
Republicans and conservative activists have read the book , absorbed its lessons , and deployed them in the current debate over how to tackle the greatest economic crisis since the 1930s .
Newt Gingrich has read it .
So has Rep. Paul Ryan ( R - Wis. ) , the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee .
And so has Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) , the head of the Senate Republican Policy Committee ; according to his spokesman , the senator has also circulated the book among his colleagues .
“ I ’m just very fortunate that they ’re interested , ” said Shlaes on Monday .
“ This is not an anti-Democrat book , but it is a book that says ‘ cast a skeptical eye on stimuli . ’ ”
Image by : Matt Mahurin
There are 200,000 copies of the The Forgotten Man in print , a dramatic success for a work of economic history .
Shlaes has written a gripping revisionist history of the New Deal , told through the interweaving lives of New Dealers and prominent Americans of the era .
Republicans , of course , have never been too enamored with Franklin Roosevelt or with the New Deal .
But before Shlaes , Republicans and conservatives often sought a sort of compromise with the FDR legacy .
In A History of the English - Speaking Peoples Since 1900 , the conservative British historian Andrew Roberts writes that “ the New Deal worked . ” President George W. Bush widely recommended the book and feted Roberts .
When the former president pushed for partial Social Security privatization , he presented this as a continuation of FDR ’s legacy ; conservative commentators such as Brit Hume even suggested that FDR would have supported private accounts .
Even if he made mistakes , his style of leadership was worth copying , and some of the outgrowths of the New Deal were worth reforming , not abolishing .
The Forgotten Man ’s revisionism does not give so much credit to FDR or his New Dealers .
According to Shlaes , who builds on decades of New Deal criticism and research into the lives and work of FDR ’s brain trust , the programs actually lengthened and aggravated the Depression because of regulation that ate away at American entrepreneurship and profit motive , and because of haphazard implementation that drove businesses and banks to uncertainty and panic .
The “ forgotten man ” of the title is the American whose income and effort were taken , against his will , to pay for the experiments and entitlement programs of the New Deal .
The New Dealers , in this telling , were well - meaning and smart people who did a lot of damage and little good , and understanding that is key to understanding why government intervention in the economy and big- spending stimulus packages are doomed to fail .
Amity Shlaes ( cfr.org )
This argument did not begin with Shlaes , as the author readily admits .
Criticisms of the New Deal are as old as the New Deal itself .
“ Roosevelt drove Republicans mad with rage , ” Shlaes said on Monday .
“ The Republicans who appear in the history of the New Deal were very shrill .
It did not become them .
So , what can we learn from their mistakes ? ”
The last decade has seen a sort of boom in New Deal revisionism , beginning with David M. Kennedy ’s Freedom From Fear : The American People in Depression and War 1929 - 1945 ( 1999 ) , which argued that Roosevelt ’s programs failed to rescue the economy in the 1930s , and continuing through the work of libertarian Cato Institute scholar Jim Powell , whose FDR ’s Folly ( 2003 ) built a systematic case that the New Deal actually prolonged the Great Depression .
The Forgotten Man has surpassed both books in sales .
Powell could n’t be more pleased .
“ I ’m kind of hammer and tongs in my approach , ” said Powell on Monday .
“ [ Shlaes is ] a wonderful , graceful writer who ’s , perhaps , more elegant than that .
If you ’re trying to change opinion on any subject , you need a lot of different people , different voices , and different approaches .
That ’s true whether you ’re trying to abolish slavery or you ’re trying to limit the power of government . ”
Among liberals , Shlaes is also the most controversial of the New Deal revisionists .
She was roundly criticized on the left for a July 2008 column in which she defended former Sen.
Phil Gramm ’s ( R - Tex . ) charge that America was in a “ mental recession . ”
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman criticized Shlaes ’ work and conclusions about the New Deal both before and after he won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics .
But Shlaes has become unescapable on op - ed pages , hungry for contrarian arguments about the stimulus ; for example , she has made three appearences in the Washington Post since early December 2008 , all of them to argue against repeating the mistakes of FDR .
Fred Barnes , the well - sourced editor of the Weekly Standard , reported that those columns , like the book , were “ widely read ” by Republicans .
The Forgotten Man became essential reading among conservatives as soon as it hit the shelves .
In June 2007 Gingrich called the book one of two that was “ guiding ” his thoughts ( the other being French President Nicholas Sarkozy ’s Testimony ) .
In The Forgotten Man , Gingrich saw a path back to “ the Whig - style free - market liberalism ” that defined America before the New Deal .
“ Sarkozy shows us how a courageous leader could translate Shlaes ’s call to liberalism into the boldest campaign in our lifetime , ” said Gingrich , then flirting with a run for president .
Gingrich never ran , but endorsements like that , from a man who many on the right consider an intellectual pioneer , rocketed the book ’s popularity on the right .
During the 2008 campaign , Sen. John Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , the Republican whip in the Senate , bristled at Democratic comparisons between George W. Bush and Herbert Hoover .
On September 18 , as the economic crisis hit , Kyl argued from the floor of the Senate that “ in the excellent history of the Great Depression by Amity Shlaes , The Forgotten Man , we are reminded that Herbert Hoover was an interventionist , a protectionist , and a strong critic of markets .
If anything , Hoover - and then Franklin Roosevelt - prolonged the Great Depression by their manic intervention in the free market , which caused a spiral of deflation . ”
Since President Obama ’s victory , Shlaes ’ work , and her columns for Bloomberg News , have provided much of the grist for Republican arguments against a spending - focused economic stimulus package .
In a December 2008 interview with Brian Howey , Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) , the third - ranking Republican in the House , fired back at a criticism from Paul Krugman with analysis he ’d gleaned from The Forgotten Man .
“ Shlaes points out … [ that ] the recession had abated by the middle of the 1930s in the West with the exception of the United States , ” said Pence .
“ She argues that it was the spending and taxing policies of 1932 and 1936 that exacerbated the situation .
That ’s why I say it ’s important for the Congress to act , but one of the lessons of the 1930s is we can’t borrow and spend back to a growing economy . ”
Last week , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani cited Shlaes to argue against the idea of spending to get out of a recession .
“ Basically it points out why the recession of 1929 , which was a bad one , became the Great Depression of 11 or 12 years , ” Giuliani told Sean Hannity on his Fox News talk show .
“ It became the Great Depression because of unwise government actions first by Hoover and then by Roosevelt .
If you think you ’re just going to get your way out of this recession by all kinds of social programs , welfare programs , you ’re just going to make it much worse . ”
Shlaes wants to wave Republicans off from making the kind of rhetorical or ideological compromise with the New Deal that Republicans made , for example , during the 2005 Social Security fight .
“ This is a time for choosing , ” she said on Monday , “ and I ’m not the first person to say that or to use that term in saying so .
Reagan could afford to like FDR because , at the time , it seemed possible to keep our entitlements if we reformed them .
It turns out that we ca n’t afford entitlements .
We have to choose between Reagan and Roosevelt .
You ca n’t just say you like both Reagan and Roosevelt . ”
As conservatives make their choices , Shlaes is still plugging away .
Her next book will be a revisionist history of the 1960s and the spending and entitlement programs of the Great Society , tentatively titled — after Richard Nixon ’s 1969 speech on Vietnam — The Silent Majority .

I gues they know who are the true victims of AGGRESSION AND OPPRESSION
A backlash against the American drone war in Pakistan has forced officials in Islamabad and Washington to reveal fresh details on another covert U.S. operation on Pakistani soil .
This one involves " more than 70 United States military advisers and technical specialists ... training Pakistani Army and paramilitary troops , providing them with intelligence and advising on combat tactics , " the New York Times reports .
The training program , which involves Special Forces trainers , combat medics , and communications experts , has been public knowledge for months .
But its size and scope have been kept under wraps , until now .
Officials from both Pakistan and the United States agreed to disclose some details ... to help dispel impressions that the
[ drone ] missile strikes were thwarting broader efforts to combat a common enemy .
They spoke on condition of anonymity , citing the increasingly powerful anti-American segment of the Pakistani population .
( So ... these officials wo n't give their names , because the Pakistani public is upset about American operations on their soil .
But they 'll talk all about those inflammatory missions to the New York Times ?
I 'm confused ... )
**
Anyway , the paper reports " both sides are encouraged by the new collaboration . "
A " newly minted 400 - man Pakistani paramilitary commando unit " is now under a separate " chain of command " from the rest of the country 's military , and ready to fight the Taliban .
American - trained Pakistani forces are providing targeting tips , for the drones to hit .
But unnamed " Pakistani Army officers , " quoted by the Times , seem to have a different view .
They say that " the American strikes draw retaliation against Pakistani troops in the tribal areas , whose convoys and bases are bombed or attacked with rockets after each United States missile strike . "
UPDATE : Raise your hand if you believe this one : " The United States has told Pakistan the drones using Pakistani bases are surveillance drones ... and not the Predator drones that launch missiles into the tribal areas in a campaign targeting al Qaeda leaders . "

The Conservatives have accused the government of introducing a ' poison pill ' strategy to their ID cards scheme by writing a clause on the contract which will cost £ 40 million if the cards are cancelled .
The clause could become highly significant if the Tories win the next general election , because the party has promised to scrap the scheme .
" It looks as if the government is deliberately making it as expensive as possible for a future Conservative government to scrap ID cards , " shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said .
" At a time when the public finances are under such pressure , it is simply outrageous for ministers to employ a poison pill strategy against their opponents . "
But Home
Office sources say the £ 40 million figure is merely the product of breaker clauses in the contracts needed to implement the scheme .
Without these compensation clauses the private contractors who will provide the technology for the plans would require prohibitively high premiums to mitigate against the risk of cancellation , the spokesman said .

I would encourage anyone reading and thinking " I need to know more about this stuff " to buy the book that Bob wrote and refers to ( PPP ) .

I consider the first five to be very important for to get deeper understanding of programming .
They 've changed my thinking somewhat , and it 's nice to check your solution against those principles and see what they might reveal .
Also , I have read many articles of yours , and I like them very much .
The way you present the problems and different methods to handle them , are clear and profound .
And you have made good points about why to write tests before any code ; it surely makes programming less painful , when need of debuggin is decreased alot .
It 's a shame you have n't lately written large articles -- at least do n't know any .
But at least this blog and newgroup discussing are active .

Robert ,
yes thank you , I 'm aware of those .
I just wondered you had n't done any article this year , that 's all .
Btw .
I 'm buying a new book about refactoring / TDD / design patterns in general , and would like to hear recommendations .
Refactoring to Patterns by Joshua Kerievsky is often recommended , but someone said it has too application specific examples .
If someone has read it , I 'd like to hear comment on that .
Keep up your good , honest work .
OOP is too flexible .
You can use it for everything and the opposite of everything .
That 's why it got so popular , perhaps .
Principles then are always controverse , though .
What happened for example to the fundamentalists of encapsulation ( those that refuse to design or even use setter / getters ) ?
Also structured programming is n't a silver bullet , and exaggerating with it make things worse ( at least this is what I try to teach to my students ..
Shame on me ! ) .
That 's why your advice is so important : because it is empirically grounded .
Henrik : as of Refactoring to Patterns , I 'd suggest you to have a look at an earlier draft ( I use to read so much about OOP , but your advice always sounds proven and deep .
It 's something else !

Henrik : as of Refactoring to Patterns , I 'd suggest you to have a look at an earlier draft ( http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&q=http://www.tarrani.net/RefactoringToPatterns.pdf ) that contains half of the patterns but gives you a feeling of the overall approach ( sorry if I use this space to reply to another reply ) .
Mauro , thanks for the link :) .
Refactoring to Patterns is awesome .
The examples do deal with real domain - specific code , but the principles are applicable to other domains .
It took me over half a decade to realize that this was n't true .
OOP and OOD are inseparable .
OOA is undefined .
- UB
And the only criteria by which a OO programming language should be judged is the ability to move from one to the other .
Then you move into the notion of Dependency Management as if the way that we think about and write the programs will make it right .
Sorry .
But whether you live in a Structured world or an Object world the notion of dependancies does n't change .
Folks write code that you depend on .
You write code that other folks depend on .
Until that changes , we 're stuck .
No , we are n't stuck .
Dependencies are manageable .
- UB
You begin by talking about OOD and by the end of the first paragraph have made the most critical of errors : equating OOD with OOP .
OOA/D is about THINKING .
OOP is about DOING .
The two are separate .

Now I design a true PayRoll
I recommend that you concentrate on the business rules first .
Do n't worry about the UI or the Database at first .
Get the business rules ( taxes , deductions , etc ) to work .
Then you can add a database .
And finally you can add a UI .
- UB
I read your wonderful book < agile software development > ,
At chapter 19 , u implement the payroll system .
Now I design a true PayRoll [ ? ] system , but i do n't known when and how can i add database detail ?
i can add UI first then meet the client 's requirement ?
Granted , the " Law of Demeter " is a style guideline rather than a principle .
Nonetheless , I would expect it to be something that could be readily derived from a handful of these principles .
Do you agree ?
if so , how would you derive it ?
LOD is a matter of dependencies .
A statement like system.trunk.line.lineCard.connect ( ) concentrates too much information into a single place .
That one line of code knows about four classes !
Large knots of dependencies like this are a violation of the OCP .
Any change to the data structures causes changes to that line of code .

How to make ForumTopic
Denis Krukovsky
http://dotuseful.sourceforge.net/
http://dkrukovsky.blogspot.com/
You could use the class form of the Adapter Pattern ( i.e. Multiple Inheritance ) as follows :
| ForumTopic| | Observable |
A A
| |
+-------+------+
|
| OservableForumTopic|
- UB
Can we start a discussion here ?
Let 's say we have a Model of some entity , say a ForumTopic [ ? ] .
We give it the responsibility to represent a forum topic .
Now a classic case - we want our Models to be Observable .
So we add a responsibility to notify its Observers on state change .
SRP violation .
How to make ForumTopic [ ? ] respect SRP while apply Observer pattern here ?
Denis Krukovsky
Thanks for your Agile Software Development book - a great resource .
I have a question concerning ISP .
The second paragraph explicitly states that some objects require non-cohesive interfaces .
So I have an object O with two non-cohesive interfaces A and B .
My question is this - when a client has access to O as an instance of A , and then at some point needs access to O as an instance of B , how is that managed ?
My instinct tells me to use a factory for the conversion so that the knowledge that A and B are coresident in O is isolated ( allowing adapters and other alternatives ) but I am not confident .
Any advice welcome .
Thanks again .
I 'm reading through PPP tonight , and it's a fascinating book .
But the examples you use to illustrate design smells seem to be dependent on the use of a statically - typed language like C++ , with solutions involving virtual base classes and / or MI .
I 'm playing around with Ruby , which has none of the above , and at first blush it seems to me that a lot of the " binding " issues simply do n't exist there ; LSP is inherently enforced by " duck - typing " , and classes can be extended repeatedly in different source files , providing ISP .
As such , SRP and OCP just do n't seem to matter .
Have there been any discussions or articles about how these principles apply to dynamic languages ?
hi uncle bob ,
I am great fan of yours , i completed reading the book PPP , after reading that book , the way I look at the solution for a given problem is changed , I mean my thought process is changed when i start thinking about the design , thanks a lot for ur marvellous work on this area .
thanks Brijesh
The book is great .
I do have some deeper questions .
The one I have been struggling with lately is defining a responsibility .
You write , " In the context of the SRP , we define a responsibility to be ' a reason for change . ' "
However , the word " responsibility " suggests that the root meaning has to do with managing some sort of feature , and that change is just a * symptom * of managing that feature .
Other responsibilities lie undiscovered until a change exposes them .
But I 've had trouble defining what it is .
I mean , if all you wanted to convey was " a reason for change , " then you could have called it the " Single Reason to Change " principle .
So why did you use the word " responsibility " ?
And is there a deeper definition than " a reason for change " ?
The principle comes from the work of Tom DeMarco
A module should do one thing , do it well , and do it only .
And it has finally transformed into its current form :
A module should have one and only one reason to change .
Are these two phrases really synonyms ?
I think so .
I think a reasponsibility boils down to a reason to change .
For example , consider a payroll module that pays an employee .
We could say that the responsibility is " pay employee " .
However , over time the payment calculation rules change , even though the printed format of the paycheck does not .
Later , the format of the check changes but the calculation does n't .
Clearly there are two different responsibilities .
Calculation , and format .
The principle comes from the work of Tom DeMarco [ ? ] .
I do n't know if he 's responsible for the name or whether the name is an accident of some kind .
What I can tell you is that the definition of the principle has evolved over the last thirty years .
It began as : And it has finally transformed into its current form :

I read with great interest the articles written by you .
In fact we cover one technical article every monday morning .
Today we did Liskov 's Substitution Principle .
Please forgive me if my question sound too naive .
You talked about Factoring as being one way of making classes LSP compliant .
For exampe you created LinearObject
In general what should I do if my to - be - factored classes have some common behavior yet also have some unique behavior .
I shall look forward to hear from you .

Karachi , Pakistan Hi Uncle Bob , I read with great interest the articles written by you .
In fact we cover one technical article every monday morning .
Today we did Liskov 's Substitution Principle .
Please forgive me if my question sound too naive .
You talked about Factoring as being one way of making classes LSP compliant .
For exampe you created LinearObject [ ? ] and sub-classed Line and LineSegment [ ? ] from it .
I was wondering what if the derived classes have some methods that cannot be foctored out to a base class .
For example if I factor Circle , Rectangle , and Square to make the Shape class and put the Draw method in it .
What if I also need to rotate Rectangle and Square but not the Circle .
So what would I do ?
Should I put the Rotate method in the base Shape class and write a degenerative Rotate method in Circle and solid implementations in Rectangle and Square ?
In general what should I do if my to - be - factored classes have some common behavior yet also have some unique behavior .
I shall look forward to hear from you .

What is object oriented design ?
What is it all about ?
What are it 's benefits ?
What are it 's costs ?
It may seem silly to ask these questions in a day and age when virtually every software developer is using an object oriented language of some kind .
Yet the question is important because , it seems to me , that most of us use those languages without knowing why , and without knowing how to get the the most benefit out of them .
Of all the revolutions that have occurred in our industry , two have been so successful that they have permeated our mentality to the extent that we take them for granted .
Structured Programming and Object Oriented Programming .
All of our mainstream modern languages are strongly influenced by these two disciplines .
Indeed , it has become difficult to write a program that does not have the external appearance of both structured programming and object oriented programming .
Our mainstream languages do not have , and therefore appear to obey the most famous proscription of structured programming .
Most of our mainstream languages are class based and do not support functions or variables that are not within a class , therefore they appear to obey the most obvious trappings of object oriented programming .
Programs written in these languages may look structured and object oriented , but looks can be decieving .
All too often today 's programmers are unaware of the principles that are the foundation of the disciplines that their languages were derived around .
In another blog I 'll discuss the principles of structured programming .
In this blog I want to talk about the principles of object oriented programming .
In March of 1995 , in comp.object , I wrote an article that was the first glimmer of a set of principles for OOD that I have written about many times since .
You 'll see them documented in my PPP book , and in many articles on the objectmentor website , including a well known summary
These principles expose the dependency management aspects of OOD as opposed to the conceptualization and modeling aspects .
This is not to say that OO is a poor tool for conceptualization of the problem space , or that it is not a good venue for creating models .
Certainly many people get value out of these aspects of OO .
The principles , however , focus very tightly on dependency management .
Dependency Management is an issue that most of us have faced .
Whenever we bring up on our screens a nasty batch of tangled legacy code , we are experiencing the results of poor dependency management .
Poor dependency managment leads to code that is hard to change , fragile , and non-reusable .
Indeed , I talk about several differentin the PPP book , all relating to dependency management .
On the other hand , when dependencies are well managed , the code remains flexible , robust , and reusable .
So dependency management , and therefore these principles , are at the foudation of thethat software developers desire .
The first five principles are principles of .
They are :
The next six principles are about packages .
In this context a package is a binary deliverable like a . jar file , or a dll as opposed to a namespace like a java package or a C++ namespace .
The first three package principles are about package , they tell us what to put inside packages :
The last three principles are about the couplings between packages , and talk about metrics that evaluate the package structure of a system .

RITI Printer Uses Coffee Grounds for Ink
February 2nd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Coffee grounds are beginning to seem like quite the multi-purpose substance .
First we heard about the possibility of grounds being used as biodiesel , and now we ’ve received word that the world ’s first printer to use coffee grounds for ink is a contestant in Core 77 and Inhabitat ’s Greener Gadgets Design Competition .
The user places coffee grounds or tea dregs into the RITI Printer ’s ink case ( located on top of the printer ) .
After inserting a piece of paper , the user moves the ink case left and right to print the image .
The ink case needs to be washed thoroughly after use .
While the manual labor involved in running the RITI Printer makes the device impractical for large printing jobs , it ’s perfect for printing on the go .
The RITI Printer is one of 50 finalists in the Greener Gadgets Design Competition .
You can vote on your favorite design here .

Special correspondent Oscar Swartz reports .*
STOCKHOLM – Today I bought a scalped seat in a court of justice for the first time in my life .
The Pirate Bay courtroom was full .
But locally famous Swedish author Sigge Eklund whispered in my ear that he had an offer for three seats after the intermission .
The price would be about $ 60 each .
We met in a corner of the hallway and finalized the transaction with three young men who were leaving .
I was in !
This pretty much captures the rock - star quality of The Pirate Bay trial .
To convict the four defendants , the prosecutor has to prove that copyright infringements have actually been committed in the first place – not just as conjecture , but in real cases where the proof will hold up in a court of justice .
So he had instructed the plaintiffs , i.e. representatives of record , film and computer - game companies , to participate in file - sharing activities and collect and store information about the whole process in order to prove that crimes were committed .
Half the first day of the trial was used in such exercises , as opening arguments commenced Monday .
But few in the audience seemed to display much sympathy for the plaintiffs as they heard stories like : " eleven users were simultaneously involved in producing illegal copies of Let it Be by The Beatles , hence infringing on the exclusive right of EMI to produce such . "
Few believe that the defendants in The Pirate Bay case will face particularly harsh penalties in the criminal lawsuit even if they are convicted .
Theoretically they could end up in jail , but they are not accused of committing copyright infringement .
Instead their criminality is alleged to be indirect : " Assisting in and preparing to committing copyright infringement . "
But it is more difficult , both legally and politically , to go after the " real " infringers : the Pirate Bay ’s claimed 22 million strong users .
In the defendants ' opening statements , they denied any criminal acts , though Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm Warg conceded responsibility for certain functions in running The Pirate Bay .
Peter Sunde claimed he had no overall responsibility , while the older Carl Lundstrom claimed he only sold co-location and bandwidth to the operation at market prices .
Media interest is intense .
The largest Swedish newspapers have bloggers covering the trial live as the top front page story .
Public radio and TV have special sites and have broadcast the audio from the courtroom in its entirety .
Crowds of Pirate Party and Pirate Bureau members were circling the court , inside and outside .
Your correspondent was served homemade " Creative Commons cookies " by teenage girls in fantasy genre garb .
They said they wanted to support the good forces of the world and convert bad ones to their cause .
Perhaps recognizing that public opinion was against him , the prosecutor painted a somewhat benevolent picture of the Defendants during his opening statement , telling a story about some very gifted computer nerds who started an ideologically - based project that grew larger , and began needing more resources to keep up with its popularity .
Hence ,
The Pirate Bay started selling ads on the site , and became more organized .
The defendants did n't deny any of this , but claimed that the advertising income just covered part of their expenses for running and developing their heavily trafficked site .
The prosecutor claimed the gross revenue to their operations amounted to the equivalent of $ 150,000 before the raid in May 2006 .
He asks that this amount , as well as a lot of servers and equipment , be forfeited , in addition to sentencing the defendants to fines and jail time .
Most in the crowd seemed to disagree .
Marten Schultz , a professor of tort law at Stockholm University was present and called it " a formative legal policy event " .
He considers the sought damages grossly inflated .
Record companies are seeking some damages but the Hollywood studios are going for the big kill and asking for about $ 10 million for five movies that has been shared .
Schultz would have liked to see a separate civil lawsuit in which such claims would be scrutinized in greater detail .
Such a separate trial was however denied .
The crowd was diverse Monday .
Social science researchers who study resistance movements and civil disobedience came from Gothenburg University .
Internationally recognized artists Palle Torsson and Tobias Bernstrup – who have faced censorship and copyright lawsuits in the course of their careers – contributed work to the street protests outside the court and sat in on the proceedings as well .

Danny Choo is a guestblogger on Boing Boing .
Danny resides in Tokyo , and blogs about life in Japan and Japanese subculture – he also works part time for the empire .
This is a picture of a typical Japanese graveyard .
The norm is that a family buys some land and then builds a tomb to fit the rest of the family .
G'ma , G'pa , mom , pop and yourself get to spend the rest of eternity together – at a cost .
The most expensive tombs I 've been able to find costs 109,908 USD at the Aoyama cemetery .
That 109,908 USD gets you about 3.4 square meters .
The funeral will cost a bomb too and the most expensive I 've been able to find is 23,408 USD at kakaku.com – but you get great drinks and enough food for up to 30 family members and 70 guests who come to pay their respects .
I guess there are ways to make ( lots of ) money even from dead folks .
In general , families have the choice of burning or burying their members .
When you die , how would you like to go ?
My wife and I have decided to donate our organs and folks in Japan can register here if you want to do so too .

Yesterday , I posted part 1 of how to think about compression .
If you have n’t read it already , take a look now , so this post makes sense .
Introduction
In the part 1 test , I compressed a 6GB tar file with various tools .
This is a good test if you are writing an entire tar file to disk , or if you are writing to tape .
For part 2 , I will be compressing each individual file contained in that tarball individually .
This is a good test if you back up to hard disk and want quick access to your files .
Quite a few tools take this approach — rdiff - backup , rdup , and backuppc are among them .
We can expect performance to be worse both in terms of size and speed for this test .
The compressor tool will be executed once per file , instead of once for the entire group of files .
This will magnify any startup costs in the tool .
It will also reduce compression ratios , because the tools wo n’t have as large a data set to draw on to look for redundancy .
To add to that , we have the block size of the filesystem — 4 K on most Linux systems .
Any file ’s actual disk consumption is always rounded up to the next multiple of 4 K .
So a 5 - byte file takes up the same amount of space as a 3000 - byte file .
( This behavior is not unique to Linux . )
If a compressor ca n’t shrink enough space out of a file to cross at least one 4 K barrier , it effectively does n’t save any disk space .
On the other hand , in certain situations , saving one byte of data could free 4 K of disk space .
So , for the results below , I use du to calculate disk usage , which reflects the actual amount of space consumed by files on disk .
The Tools
Based on comments in part 1 , I added tests for lzop and xz to this iteration .
I attempted to test pbzip2 , but it would have taken 3 days to complete , so it is not included here — more on that issue below .
The Numbers
Let ’s start with the table , using the same metrics as with part 1 :
Tool MB saved Space vs. gzip Time vs. gzip Cost gzip 3081 100.00 % 100.00 % 0.41 gzip - 1 2908 104.84 % 82.34 % 0.36 gzip - 9 3091 99.72 % 141.60 % 0.58 bzip2 3173 97.44 % 201.87 % 0.81 bzip2 - 1 3126 98.75 % 182.22 % 0.74 lzma - 1 3280 94.44 % 163.31 % 0.63 lzma - 2 3320 93.33 % 217.94 % 0.83 xz - 1 3270 94.73 % 176.52 % 0.68 xz - 2 3309 93.63 % 200.05 % 0.76 lzop - 1 2508 116.01 % 77.49 % 0.39 lzop - 2 2498 116.30 % 76.59 % 0.39
As before , in the “ MB saved ” column , higher numbers are better ; in all other columns , lower numbers are better .
I ’m using clock seconds here on a dual - core machine .
The cost column is clock seconds per MB saved .
Let ’s draw some initial conclusions :
lzma - 1 continues to be both faster and smaller than bzip2 .
lzma - 2 is still smaller than bzip2 , but unlike the test in part 1 , is now a bit slower .
As you ’ll see below , lzop ran as fast as cat .
Strangely , lzop - 3 produced larger output than lzop - 1 .
gzip - 9 is probably not worth it — it saved less than 1 % more space and took 42 % longer .
xz - 1 is not as good as lzma - 1 in either way , though xz - 2 is faster than lzma - 2 , at the cost of some storage space .
Among the tools also considered for part 1 , the difference in space and time were both smaller .
Across all tools , the difference in time is still far more significant than the difference in space .
The Pretty Charts
Now , let ’s look at an illustration of this .
As before , the sweet spot is the lower left , and the worst spot is the upper right .
First , let ’s look at the compression tools themselves :
At the extremely fast , but not as good compression , end is lzop .
gzip is still the balanced performer , bzip2 still looks really bad , and lzma - 1 is still the best high - compression performer .
Now , let ’s throw cat into the mix :
Here ’s something notable , that this graph makes crystal clear : lzop was just as fast as cat .
In other words , it is likely that lzop was faster than the disk , and using lzop compression would be essentially free in terms of time consumed .
And finally , look at the cost :
What happened to pbzip2 ?
I tried the parallel bzip2 implementation just like last time , but it ran extremely slow .
Interestingly , pbzip2 < notes.txt > notes.txt.bz2 took 1.002 wall seconds , but pbzip2 notes .
txt finished almost instantaneously .
This 1 - second startup time for pbzip2 was a killer , and the test would have taken more than 3 days to complete .
I killed it early and omitted it from my results .
Hopefully this bug can be fixed .
I did n’t expect pbzip2 to help much in this test , and perhaps even to see a slight degradation , but not like THAT .
Conclusions
As before , the difference in time was far more significant than the difference in space .
By compressing files individually , we lost about 400 MB ( about 7 % ) space compared to making a tar file and then combining that .
My test set contained 270,101 files .
gzip continues to be a strong all - purpose contender , posting fast compression time and respectable compression ratios .
lzop is a very interesting tool , running as fast as cat and yet turning in reasonable compression — though 25 % worse than gzip on its default settings .
gzip - 1 was almost as fast , though , and compressed better .
If gzip were n’t fast enough with - 6 , I ’d be likely to try gzip - 1 before using lzop , since the gzip format is far more widely supported , and that ’s important to me for backups .
These results still look troubling for bzip2 .
lzma - 1 continued to turn in far better times and compression ratios that bzip2 .
Even bzip2 - 1 could n’t match the speed of lzma - 1 , and compressed barely better than gzip .
I think bzip2 would be hard - pressed to find a comfortable niche anywhere by now .
As before , you can download my spreadsheet with all the numbers behind these charts and the table .
Freedom and other necessities for prosperity ( such as the rule of law , absence of taxation , and so forth ) have been in decline in the US over the past decade .
The specific proximate causes for the legislation and social changes that brought this decline do n't really matter all that much - there is always some sequence of events that politicians and populace can use as justification and cover to further destroy all the qualities that once made their society great .
Interestingly , the field of medicine has escaped lightly in this time of rapidly declining freedoms .
Perhaps this was in part because medical research and development is already hopelessly shackled and wedded to the control of central bureaucrats - innovation is already crushed to a fraction of what it might otherwise be .
Just because something is bad does n't mean it can't become worse , of course .
The present scaremongering over the economy is a grand opportunity for political opportunists to manipulate the system in ways far beyond the pale .
Great leaps and bounds are taken down the slope of knives to the natural end of any government .
It 's only a matter of time before medicine and scientific research is further harmed .
Take this for example , in reference to the " stimulus " bill presently being enacted :
Tragically , no one from either party is objecting to the health provisions slipped in without discussion .
These provisions reflect the handiwork of Tom Daschle , until recently the nominee to head the Health and Human Services Department .
...
The goal , Daschle ’s book explained , is to slow the development and use of new medications and technologies because they are driving up costs .
He praises Europeans for being more willing to accept " hopeless diagnoses " and " forgo experimental treatments , " and he chastises Americans for expecting too much from the health - care system .
...
Daschle says health - care reform " will not be pain free . "
Seniors should be more accepting of the conditions that come with age instead of treating them .
That means the elderly will bear the brunt .
I do n't think I need to comment on the intent , beyond noting that it is unusually honest .
This approach has been underway in Europe for some time now : see for example , the " fair innings " philosophy .
The fair innings argument ( FIA ) is frequently put forward as a justification for denying elderly patients treatment when they are in competition with younger patients and resources are scarce .
...
The whole debate has to be put in context , however .
This is related to the operation of the universal health care system in the UK , a system that has long been in the doleful steady state of all such socialist , centralized systems : waste , terrible services , and - most importantly - rationing .
Every taxpayer involuntarily funding this behemoth feels that they own a piece of it , and everyone has that tug on their human nature urging them to make sure that no - one gets more than they do .
It 's ugly , and it's why socialism fails .
Along the way to failure , however , it produces dangerous ideas , such as " human beings have a fixed length of life , after which they should be cut off and left to die . "
All rapid legislation turns into a wish - list for those closest to power : the faster it is enacted , the greater the scale of corruption , and the more you can be sure that your interests are being directly harmed .
The legislation discussed above is a good example of the way in which the politics of central control turn what would be a golden opportunity for a free market in healthcare into the modern equivalent of putting the old people out into the snow .
Do n’t be afraid of [ healthcare ] ; it ’s actually the leading industry .
The demands of healthcare are going to pull all other industries forward .
Of course they require new technologies in steel and heavy industry and as well as delivery systems .
I think they should be looked at positively .
Again I say if this were a privatized system , we would all say " gee it ’s wonderful .
All these people want more health care , this industry is thriving " .
Let me put one other analogy .
Suppose we made cars a government entitlement .
Instead of cheering when auto production went up , we ’d say , " Oh my God , we ca n’t afford this ! " .
How you finance it may greatly affect the psychology and actually the freedom of the economy to take advantage of these new opportunities .
At the end of the road ahead there will be ruins .
We can hope that the decline of the US and failure of its current political system is peaceful and rapid , such that growth and honest toil to create prosperity can begin again as soon as possible .
It 's an unpleasant thing to say for one who came to America with high hopes , but history ever repeats itself , and the downward slope has taken a steeper turn .
Economic ignorance is the death of cultures ; it is presently eating away at the US , and is sadly most advanced in medicine and medical research .
People who favor equality and envy over wealth and progress are , unfortunately , usually comparatively wealthy themselves and thus largely insulated from the short - term consequences of their ignorance .
These dangerous philistines will have to decide in the years ahead whether their dearly - held positions are worth losing their lives to , not to mention the lives of everyone they manage to kill - at the rate of 100,000 with each and every day of delay on the way to working anti-aging technologies .

[ A lecture delivered at the Gold and Monetary Conference , New Orleans , November 10 , 1977 .
It made its first appearance in print in the Journal of Libertarian Studies , Volume 3 , Number 1 . ]
When a little over two years ago , at the second Lausanne Conference of this group , I threw out , almost as a sort of bitter joke , that there was no hope of ever again having decent money , unless we took from government the monopoly of issuing money and handed it over to private industry , I took it only half seriously .
But the suggestion proved extraordinarily fertile .
Following it up I discovered that I had opened a possibility which in two thousand years no single economist had ever studied .
There were quite a number of people who have since taken it up and we have devoted a great deal of study and analysis to this possibility .
As a result I am more convinced than ever that if we ever again are going to have a decent money , it will not come from government : it will be issued by private enterprise , because providing the public with good money which it can trust and use can not only be an extremely profitable business ; it imposes on the issuer a discipline to which the government has never been and cannot be subject .
It is a business which competing enterprise can maintain only if it gives the public as good a money as anybody else .
Now , fully to understand this , we must free ourselves from what is a widespread but basically wrong belief .
Under the Gold Standard , or any other metallic standard , the value of money is not really derived from gold .
The fact is , that the necessity of redeeming the money they issue in gold , places upon the issuers a discipline which forces them to control the quantity of money in an appropriate manner ; I think it is quite as legitimate to say that under a gold standard it is the demand of gold for monetary purposes which determines that value of gold , as the common belief that the value which gold has in other uses determines the value of money .
The gold standard is the only method we have yet found to place a discipline on government , and government will behave reasonably only if it is forced to do so .
I am afraid I am convinced that the hope of ever again placing on government this discipline is gone .
The public at large have learned to understand , and I am afraid a whole generation of economists have been teaching , that government has the power in the short run by increasing the quantity of money rapidly to relieve all kinds of economic evils , especially to reduce unemployment .
Unfortunately this is true so far as the short run is concerned .
The fact is , that such expansions of the quantity of money which seems to have a short run beneficial effect , become in the long run the cause of a much greater unemployment .
But what politician can possibly care about long run effects if in the short run he buys support ?
My conviction is that the hope of returning to the kind of gold standard system which has worked fairly well over a long period is absolutely vain .
Even if , by some international treaty , the gold standard were reintroduced , there is not the slightest hope that governments will play the game according to the rules .
And the gold standard is not a thing which you can restore by an act of legislation .
The gold standard requires a constant observation by government of certain rules which include an occasional restriction of the total circulation which will cause local or national recession , and no government can nowadays do it when both the public and , I am afraid , all those Keynesian economists who have been trained in the last thirty years , will argue that it is more important to increase the quantity of money than to maintain the gold standard .
I have said that it is an erroneous belief that the value of gold or any metallic basis determines directly the value of the money .
The gold standard is a mechanism which was intended and for a long time did successfully force governments to control the quantity of the money in an appropriate manner so as to keep its value equal with that of gold .
But there are many historical instances which prove that it is certainly possible , if it is in the self - interest of the issuer , to control the quantity even of a token money in such a manner as to keep its value constant .
There are three such interesting historical instances which illustrate this and which in fact were very largely responsible for teaching the economists that the essential point was ultimately the appropriate control of the quantity of money and not its redeemability into something else , which was necessary only to force governments to control the quantity of money appropriately .
This I think will be done more effectively not if some legal rule forces government , but if it is the self - interest of the issuer which makes him do it , because he can keep his business only if he gives the people a stable money .
Let me tell you in a very few words of these important historical instances .
The first two I shall mention do not refer directly to the gold standard as we know it .
They occurred when large parts of the world were still on a silver standard and when in the second half of the last century silver suddenly began to lose its value .
The fall in the value of silver brought about a fall in various national currencies and on two occasions an interesting step was taken .
The first , which produced the experience which I believe inspired the Austrian monetary theory , happened in my native country in 1879 .
The government happened to have a really good adviser on monetary policy , Carl Menger , and he told them , " Well , if you want to escape the effect of the depreciation of silver on your currency , stop the free coinage of silver , stop increasing the quantity of silver coin , and you will find that the silver coin will begin to rise above the value of their content in silver . "
And this the Austrian government did and the result was exactly what Menger had predicted .
One began to speak about the Austrian " Gulden " , which was then the unit in circulation , as banknotes printed on silver , because the actual coins in circulation had become a token money containing much less value than corresponded to its value .
As silver declined , the value of the silver Gulden was controlled entirely by the limitation of the quantity of the coin .
" … warding off the gradual decline into a totalitarian , planned system , which will , at least in this country , not come because anybody wants to introduce it , but will come step by step in an effort to suppress the effects of the inflation which is going on . "
Exactly the same was done fourteen years later by British India .
It also had had a silver standard and the depreciation of silver brought the rupee down lower and lower till the Indian government decided to stop the free coinage ; and again the silver coins began to float higher and higher above their silver value .
Now , there was at that time neither in Austria nor in India any expectation that ultimately these coins would be redeemed at a particular rate in either silver or gold .
The decision about this was made much later , but the development was the perfect demonstration that even a circulating metallic money may derive its value from an effective control of its quantity and not directly from its metallic content .
My third illustration is even more interesting , although the event was more short lived , because it refers directly to gold .
During World War
I the great paper money inflation in all the belligerent countries brought down not only the value of paper money but also the value of gold , because paper money was in the large measure substituted for gold , and the demand for gold fell .
In consequence , the value of gold fell and prices in gold rose all over the world .
That affected even the neutral countries .
Particularly Sweden was greatly worried : because it had stuck to the gold standard , it was flooded by gold from all the rest of the world that moved to Sweden which had retained its gold standard ; and Swedish prices rose quite as much as prices in the rest of the world .
Now , Sweden also happened to have one or two very good economists at the time , and they repeated the advice which the Austrian economists had given concerning the silver in the 1870s , " Stop the free coinage of gold and the value of your existing gold coins will rise above the value of the gold which it contains . "
The Swedish government did so in 1916 and what happened was again exactly what the economists had predicted : the value of the gold coins began to float above the value of its gold content and Sweden , for the rest of the war , escaped the effects of the gold inflation .
I quote this only as illustration of what among the economists who understand their subject is now an undoubted fact , namely that the gold standard is a partly effective mechanism to make governments do what they ought to do in their control of money , and the only mechanism which has been tolerably effective in the case of a monopolist who can do with the money whatever he likes .
Otherwise gold is not really necessary to secure a good currency .
I think it is entirely possible for private enterprise to issue a token money which the public will learn to expect to preserve its value , provided both the issuer and the public understand that the demand for this money will depend on the issuer being forced to keep its value constant ; because if he did not do so , the people would at once cease to use his money and shift to some other kind .
I have as a result of throwing out this suggestion at the Lausanne Conference worked out the idea in fairly great detail in a little book which came out a year ago , called Denationalisation of Money .
My thought has developed a great deal since .
I rather hoped to be able to have at this conference a much enlarged second edition available which may already have been brought out in London by the Institute of Economic Affairs , but which unfortunately has not yet reached this country .
All I have is the proofs of the additions .
In this second edition I have arrived at one or two rather interesting new conclusions which I did not see at first .
In the first exposition in the speech two years ago , I was merely thinking of the effect of the selection of the issuer : that only those financial institutions which so controlled the distinctly named money which they issued , and which provided the public with a money , which was a stable standard of value , an effective unit for calculation in keeping books , would be preserved .
I have now come to see that there is a much more complex situation , that there will in fact be two kinds of competition , one leading to the choice of standard which may come to be generally accepted , and one to the selection of the particular institutions which can be trusted in issuing money of that standard .
" The power to issue money was essential for the finance of the government … in order to give to government access to the tap where it can draw the money it needs by manufacturing it . "
I do believe that if today all the legal obstacles were removed which prevent such an issue of private money under distinct names , in the first instance indeed , as all of you would expect , people would from their own experience be led to rush for the only thing they know and understand , and start using gold .
But this very fact would after a while make it very doubtful whether gold was for the purpose of money really a good standard .
It would turn out to be a very good investment , for the reason that because of the increased demand for gold the value of gold would go up ; but that very fact would make it very unsuitable as money .
You do not want to incur debts in terms of a unit which constantly goes up in value as it would in this case , so people would begin to look for another kind of money : if they were free to choose the money , in terms of which they kept their books , made their calculations , incurred debts or lent money , they would prefer a standard which remains stable in purchasing power .
I have not got time here to describe in detail what I mean by being stable in purchasing power , but briefly , I mean a kind of money in terms which it is equally likely that the price of any commodity picked out at random will rise as that it will fall .
Such a stable standard reduces the risk of unforeseen changes in the prices of particular commodities to a minimum , because with such a standard it is just as likely that any one commodity will rise in price or will fall in price and the mistakes which people at large will make in their anticipations of future prices will just cancel each other because there will be as many mistakes in overestimating as in underestimating .
If such a money were issued by some reputable institution , the public would probably first choose different definitions of the standard to be adopted , different kinds of index numbers of price in terms of which it is measured ; but the process of competition would gradually teach both the issuing banks and the public which kind of money would be the most advantageous .
The interesting fact is that what I have called the monopoly of government of issuing money has not only deprived us of good money but has also deprived us of the only process by which we can find out what would be good money .
We do not even quite know what exact qualities we want because in the two thousand years in which we have used coins and other money , we have never been allowed to experiment with it , we have never been given a chance to find out what the best kind of money would be .
Let me here just insert briefly one observation : in my publications and in my lectures including today 's I am speaking constantly about the government monopoly of issuing money .
Now , this is legally true in most countries only to a very limited extent .
We have indeed given the government , and for fairly good reasons , the exclusive right to issue gold coins .
And after we had given the government that right , I think it was equally understandable that we also gave the government the control over any money or any claims , paper claims , for coins or money of that definition .
That people other than the government are not allowed to issue dollars if the government issues dollars is a perfectly reasonable arrangement , even if it has not turned out to be completely beneficial .
And I am not suggesting that other people should be entitled to issue dollars .
All the discussion in the past about free banking was really about this idea that not only the government or government institutions but others should also be able to issue dollar notes .
That , of course , would not work .
But if private institutions began to issue notes under some other names without any fixed rate of exchange with the official money or each other , so far as I know this is in no major country actually prohibited by law .
I think the reason why it has not actually been tried is that of course we know that if anybody attempted it , the government would find so many ways to put obstacles in the way of the use of such money that it could make it impracticable .
So long , for instance , as debts in terms of anything but the official dollar cannot be enforced in legal process , it is clearly impracticable .
Of course it would have been ridiculous to try to issue any other money if people could not make contracts in terms of it .
But this particular obstacle has fortunately been removed now in most countries , so the way ought to be free for the issuing of private money .
If I were responsible for the policy of any one of the great banks in this country , I would begin to offer to the public both loans and current accounts in a unit which I undertook to keep stable in value in terms of a defined index number .
I have no doubt , and I believe that most economists agree with me on that particular point , that it is technically possible so to control the value of any token money which is used in competition with other token monies as to fulfill the promise to keep its value stable .
The essential point which I can not emphasize strongly enough is that we would get for the first time a money where the whole business of issuing money could be effected only by the issuer issuing good money .
He would know that he would at once lose his extremely profitable business if it became known that his money was threatening to depreciate .
He would lose it to a competitor who offered better money .
As I said before , I believe this is our only hope at the present time .
I do not see the slightest prospect that with the present type of , I emphasize , the present type of democratic government under which every little group can force the government to serve its particular needs , government , even if it were restricted by strict law , can ever again give us good money .
At present the prospects are really only a choice between two alternatives : either continuing an accelerating open inflation , which is , as you all know , absolutely destructive of an economic system or a market order ; but I think much more likely is an even worse alternative : government will not cease inflating , but will , as it has been doing , try to suppress the open effects of this inflation ; it will be driven by continual inflation into price controls , into increasing direction of the whole economic system .
It is therefore now not merely a question of giving us better money , under which the market system will function infinitely better than it has ever done before , but of warding off the gradual decline into a totalitarian , planned system , which will , at least in this country , not come because anybody wants to introduce it , but will come step by step in an effort to suppress the effects of the inflation which is going on .
I wish I could say that what I propose is a plan for the distant future , that we can wait .
There was one very intelligent reviewer of my first booklet who said , " Well , three hundred years ago nobody would have believed that government would ever give up its control over religion , so perhaps in three hundred years we can see that government will be prepared to give up its control over money . "
We have not got that much time .
We are now facing the likelihood of the most unpleasant political development , largely as a result of an economic policy with which we have already gone very far .
My proposal is not , as I would wish , merely a sort of standby arrangement of which I could say we must work it out intellectually to have it ready when the present system completely collapses .
It is not merely an emergency plan .
I think it is very urgent that it become rapidly understood that there is no justification in history for the existing position of a government monopoly of issuing money .
It has never been proposed on the ground that government will give us better money than anybody else could .
It has always , since the privilege of issuing money was first explicitly represented as a Royal prerogative , been advocated because the power to issue money was essential for the finance of the government - not in order to give us good money , but in order to give to government access to the tap where it can draw the money it needs by manufacturing it .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is not a method by which we can hope ever to get good money .
To put it into the hands of an institution which is protected against competition , which can force us to accept the money , which is subject to incessant political pressure , such an authority will not ever again give us good money .
I think we ought to start fairly soon , and I think we must hope that some of the more enterprising and intelligent financiers will soon begin to experiment with such a thing .
The great obstacle is that it involves such great changes in the whole financial structure that , and I am saying this from the experience of many discussions , no senior banker , who understands only the present banking system , can really conceive how such a new system would work , and he would not dare to risk and experiment with it .
I think we will have to count on a few younger and more flexible brains to begin and show that such a thing can he done .
In fact , it is already being tried in a limited form .
As a result of my publication I have received from all kinds of surprising quarters letters from small banking houses , telling me that they are trying to issue gold accounts or silver accounts , and that there is a considerable interest for these .
I am afraid they will have to go further , for the reasons I have sketched in the beginning .
In the course of such a revolution of our monetary system , the values of the precious metals , including the value of gold , are going to fluctuate a great deal , mostly upwards , and therefore those of you who are interested in it from an investor 's point of view need not fear .
But those of you who are mainly interested in a good monetary system must hope that in the not too distant future we shall find generally applied another system of control over the monetary circulation , other than the redeemability in gold .
The public will have to learn to select among a variety of monies , and to choose those which are good .
If we start on this soon we may indeed achieve a position in which at last capitalism is in a position to provide itself with the money it needs in order to function properly , a thing which it has always been denied .
Ever since the development of capitalism it has never been allowed to produce for itself the money it needs ; and if I had more time I could show you how the whole crazy structure we have as a result , this monopoly originally only of issuing gold money , is very largely the cause of the great fluctuations in credit , of the great fluctuations in economic activity , and ultimately of the recurring depressions .
I think if the capitalists had been allowed to provide themselves with the money which they need , the competitive system would have long overcome the major fluctuations in economic activity and the prolonged periods of depression .
At the present moment we have of course been led by official monetary policy into a situation where it has produced so much misdirection of resources that you must not hope for a quick escape from our present difficulties , even if we adopted a new monetary system .

BACKGROUND :
The story below was written for those who already have a rudimentary knowledge of this scandal .
If you ’re coming to this cold , you might want to start with a few of these links ( NY Daily News and video of NBC Nightly News covering the Gannon story ) .
Then read the story below for the real details …
WOLF BLITZER : Because one of the things , as you know , that were said is that you had some sexually explicit Web sites that you were working on .
I do n’t understand what that is , but maybe you could explain that .
JEFF GANNON : Well , several years ago , before I came to Washington , I had registered various domain names for a private client .
I was doing Web site development .
Those sites were never hosted .
There ’s — nothing ever went up on them .
And the client went on to do something else .
– CNN , 2/10/05
Site 1
The Web site reflects the era in which it was built .
A simple black background , white text , lots of kitschy images and bad puns .
The theme is decidedly military .
The logo at the top is borrowed from the US Marine Corps , an eagle standing atop an anchor .
The letters USMCPT run across the logo , written in the colors of the flag .
Below the strange acronym are four words : “ Personal Trainer , Bodyguard , Escort . ”
Above it stands a muscular and headless man in black military boots , white socks , buck naked .
In 1999 , Paul Leddy , a Web designer and photographer from Los Angeles , says he received an email from a man named Jeff from Wilmington , Delaware .
Jeff wanted Paul to build him a new Web site for his business .
Paul accepted the job , provided Jeff mailed him a check with half the money up front ( Jeff had not provided a last name , and Paul wanted to make sure he was for real ) .
Jeff sent the check , it cleared , and Paul built the site and launched it online for Jeff .
Paul did n’t think about Jeff much until last week when he heard about a breaking scandal involving a man named Jeff who owned several military escort service Web addresses .
“ I saw the name Jeff Gannon , knew our Jeff , saw the militarystud.com Web address , and thought ‘ hmmm , everything was military , that sounds like Jeff who we did the site for . ’ ”
Paul searched the Internet WhoIs director for militarystud.com and saw that the owner was Bedrock Corp of Wilmington , Delaware .
“ That ’s definitely him , ” Paul said .
( Paul and a second source both recall Jeff paying with a check in the name of Bedrock Corp .
The name stuck in their heads at the time because they asked Jeff why “ Bedrock ” ?
He replied something about the Flintstones , they recall . )
This is relevant because a Bedrock Corp in Wilmington , Delaware also owns former White House reporter Jeff Gannon ’s personal Web site and a series of Web addresses apparently dealing with military male escorts .
Paul then went and checked his files .
He found five invoices to Jeff from August 31 , 1999 to March 30 , 2000 .
( The file properties say they were created on those dates by Paul Leddy . )
The invoices are from BELDesigns for “ Website Design ” and “ hosting . ”
The billing address ?
Bedrock Corp
5721 Kennett Pike
Centreville , DE 19807
( Paul Leddy ’s address , phone number and email were removed from this invoice by me before publishing , at Paul ’s request .
I am happy to show the full invoice to journalists . )
According to the date the html files were created for the USMCPT Web site – files Paul still has – Paul built the site for Jeff in September 1999 .
Paul says he launched it within a matter of weeks .
The site was eventually migrated to its own URL , USMCPT.com .
While the site is no longer live on the Internet , archived copies of it were available up until around February 23 , 2005 ( someone had them deleted after this story broke on February 14 , 2005 – you can see the home page below – note that the home page had a black background which does n’t pick in this file :
Those archives showed that the site was live at the USMCPT.com address at least from October 31 , 2001 until May 8 , 2003 .
( This date is relevant since Gannon reportedly entered the White House the first time as a “ journalist ” in February , 2003 . )
When asked what USMCPT meant , Paul said he asked Jeff that very question .
The answer : United States Marine Corps , Part Time .
Paul recalls
Jeff telling him he was still in the Marines , but only part time .
Paul also recalls Jeff being around 40 years old , even though the Web site said he was 32 .
The military theme continues at USMCPT.com .
The “ Ammunition ” section contains the description of the escort .
It reads :
White , 200 pounds , hair “ high and tight , ” chest “ 46 ’ Usually Shaved or Clipped , ” and under “ Weapon ” it says “ 8 inches cut . ”
The escort mentions that he takes clients in the Washington , DC , Virginia and Maryland area , and that he prefers to “ travel to your location or travel with you . ”
The USMCPT home page never speci
fically mentions sex , though it ’s clear this is not your run -of - the - mill personal trainer or bodyguard .
Under a section entitled “ Mission , ” it says :
Ex-USMC Jock : Available for hourly , overnight , weekend or longer travel – OUT ONLY !
Personal Trainer : Safe - Sane - Strenuous - Satisfying workouts , Sports training , and competition , especially wrestling ….
Big SPORTS
Fan :
Will go to the game with you , then take you home and ….
“ AGGRESIVE , VERBAL , DOMINANT TOP ”
I DON’T LEAVE MARKS ….ONLY IMPRESSIONS
Further on down the page , on at least the early versions of the Web site ( several versions over the span of a year and a half are cached online ) , you can see the logo for BELDesigns , Paul ’s Web design business .
There ’s also a button that says “ SEE MORE OF ME . ”
This brings you to a page comprising 43 or so thumbnail - sized pictures of “ Jeff , ” in various states of undress .
In one photo he ’s lounging spread eagle on some pillows , fully erect .
In another he ’s bent over , naked , apparently checking something on his nightstand ( while revealing a great set of lats ) …
… and in a third set of photos he is urinating .
If you click on the thumbnail photos , you can see larger - sized versions ( though not for all the photos , the archive is incomplete ) .
If you look at the html source on this page , you will see that numerous of the photos are named “ Jeff . ”
In several of the photos you will see Jeff wearing a distinctive silver watch with a solid black band .
He likes to wear it on his left hand , slightly above the wrist joint .
The site also contains a third page , called “ Bulldog.htm . ”
( The bulldog is recurring theme on the site . )
On this page we learn that Jeff is available as a travel companion , a workout partner / trainer , an event companion ( “ Want to see the Orioles , Caps , Wizards , or ‘ Skins ? ” ) , tour guide , and bodyguard .
Jeff then provides his email address , [ email protected ]
The USMCPT site has a link on its home page that , depending on which version in time of the home page you ’re examining , says either “ See more of me and my buddies at : Male Corps ” or “ Featured on Studfiles . ”
Site 2
The Male Corps link takes you to another of Jeff ’s escort pages , housed on a different escort service Web site called MaleCorps.com .
The page contains the same spread - eagle picture that was on Jeff ’s personal site , notes that his branch of service is “ United States Marine Corps , ” provides more personal information , and the email address for contact is [ email protected ]
There ’s also a link to see 30 more “ x - pics ” of Jeff , including “ full bod , dick shots , jocks . ”
The link appears to be no longer accessible .
Site 3
The StudFiles link on Jeff ’s USMCPT site takes you to an escort Web site that is still live today .
It ’s for an escort named “ Bulldog . ”
On the page there ’s a picture of Bulldog ’s torso , shirtless , wearing dog tags .
He ’s 32 years old , lives in Washington , DC , is “ 5 ’9 ” , 200 pounds , brown high and tight haircut , green eyes , 8+cut ! ”
Under “ position ” it says “ Top ! ”
For an email – or “ emale , ” as it says – contact it gives [ email protected ]
There is also a link to visit “ the Adult Photos ” in Gallery 16 .
In order to access those photos , you need to buy an electronic Web ID that proves you are over the age of consent …
Site 4
Once you buy the ID , for $ 20 a year ( it ’s a write - off ) , you enter the WorkingBoys . net Web site .
You click on Gallery 16 and arrive on Bulldog ’s adult page .
It ’s not unlike the PG - rated page except that Bulldog is now wearing a pair of dog tags , sitting spread eagle , and hard as a rock .
The profile also has as link “ Visit Bulldog on the Net ! ” – it links back to http://www.USMCPT.com
The WorkingBoys.net escort profile is still live today .
Interestingly , the name of the html file for the page is “ DC007 . ”
Site 5
A bit more Internet sleuthing turned up even more escort profiles for apparently the same escort on various other sites .
Meetlocalmen.com contains a profile with the same spread - eagle picture as was on the other sites .
This site includes the escort ’s name as Jeff
/ Bulldog .
His location , DC .
His Internet address is yet another Web site that is no longer active .
His rates , $ 1200 / weekend .
( While the profile is still live at MeetLocalMen.com , it takes a bit of hunting to find it .
You need to click on “ Meet Local Escorts , ” then click on DC , then skip through 16 pages or so until you find Jeff in DC , then click on that picture . )
Sites 6 and 7
A search for USMCPT on Google turns up two more escort sites for Bulldog , one in DC and one in Philly ( both are still online , but in inactive status ) .
One mentions the weekend rate of $ 1200 / weekend , the other an hourly rate , $ 200 .
The sites also include feedback from satisfied customers .
The most recent review is from 11/12/2002 , from a man named Spaceman .
An earlier review , dated 7/11/2000 , is from a man who says he ’s an active duty senior officer in the US Army .
He notes that Jeff has a Marine background .
There ’s much more .
Paul has additional photos that Jeff provided him .
Some of the photos are exact copies of those on the USMCPT.com Web site , and then some .
The buck naked photo on the logo , for example .
Paul provided me with the entire complete photo .
The head of the man in question looks remarkably like Jeff Gannon .
Regarding the photo of “ Jeff ” urinating ( it ’s actually a series of photos ) .
Paul provided the entire photo of a man who looks remarkably like Jeff Gannon , even wearing the signature Gannon watch .
Paul provided several more photos that he says Jeff gave him .
Each photo looks remarkably like Jeff Gannon :
Compare the above photos from the Web developers with photos , below , that we KNOW are of Gannon :
Even more photos show Jeff wearing the same silver watch with a black band that Jeff Gannon is known to sport .
Some show that Jeff and Jeff Gannon have the same short and pointed eyebrows , same ears , same face structure , chest structure and nipples .
Same wrinkles / creases in their stomachs when they bend forward .
The resemblance is astonishing .
Jeff Gannon was contacted and asked to comment on the specific allegations that he is the owner of USMCPT.com and several other profiles that offer his services as an escort .
He did not respond to this request .
Why does this matter ?
So in the end , why does this matter ?
Why does it matter that Jeff Gannon may have been a gay hooker named James Guckert with a $ 20,000 defaulted court judgment against him ?
So he somehow got a job lobbing softball questions to the White House .
Big deal .
If he was already a prostitute , why not be one in the White House briefing room as well ?
This is the Conservative Republican Bush White House we ’re talking about .
It ’s looking increasingly like they made a decision to allow a hooker to ask the President of the United States questions .
They made a decision to give a man with an alias and no journalistic experience access to the West Wing of the White House on a “ daily basis . ”
They reportedly made a decision to give him – one of only six – access to documents , or information in those documents , that exposed a clandestine CIA operative .
Say what you will about Monika Lewinsky – a tasteless episode , “ inappropriate , ” whatever .
Monika was n’t a gay prostitute running around the West Wing .
What kind of leadership would let prostitutes roam the halls of the West Wing ?
What kind of war - time leadership can’t find the same information that took bloggers only days to find ?
None of this is by accident .
Someone had to make a decision to let all this happen .
Who ?
Someone committed a crime in exposing Valerie Plame and now it appears a gay hooker may be right in the middle of all of it ?
Who ?
Ultimately , it is the hypocrisy that is such a challenge to grasp in this story .
This is the same White House that ran for office on a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage .
While they are surrounded by gay hookers ?
While they use a gay hooker to write articles for their gay hating political base ?
While they use a gay hooker to destroy a political enemy ?
Not to mention the hypocrisy of a “ reporter ” who chooses to publish article after article defending the ant - gay religious - right point of view on gay civil rights issue .
Who in the White House is at the center of all of this ?
Who allowed this to go on in the People ’s House ?
Who committed the crime of exposing Valerie Plame ?
Jeff Gannon has the answers to these questions , and boy we know he loves to talk .
Let him talk to Patrick Fitzgerald .
Is this the iPhone killer ?
Nokia launches £ 450 handset billed as ' world 's most advanced mobile computer '
Nokia has unveiled a new mobile phone it hopes will blow the iPhone and the BlackBerry out of the water .
The N97 is being billed as ' world 's most advanced mobile computer ' and features both a large touchscreen , like Apple 's iPhone , and a keyboard like the BlackBerry .
It is expected to go on sale next year and will cost around cost £ 450 for the handset alone - although this would be heavily subsidised on contract .
' The world 's most advanced mobile computer ' : The Nokia N97 hopes to rival the iPhone and the BlackBerry
The 3.5 in touchscreen display can be fully personalised with frequently updated widgets of favorite web services and social networking sites .
Nokia claim the phone makes it easy to update social networks automatically with real - time information , giving approved friends the ability to update their ' status ' and share their ' social location ' as well as related pictures or videos .
A hidden keyboard slides out from under the screen , allowing users to type emails and text messages .
The phone also boasts integrated A - GPS sensors and an electronic compass , which allow it to ' intuitively understand where it is ' .
Other features include a five - megapixel camera and a huge 48 GB of memory , capable of storing thousands more songs than the Apple iPhone .
Unlike the Apple iPhone , the N97 will be able to play the Flash videos used on many websites .
The Nokia N97 is expected to be available from next year for around £ 450
' From the desktop to the laptop and now to your pocket , the Nokia N97 is the most powerful , multi- sensory mobile computer in existence , ' said Jonas Geust , Vice President , heading Nokia Nseries .
' The Nokia N97 mobile computer adjusts to the world around us , helping stay connected to the people and things that matter most . '
Despite its long list of features , experts say the phone could struggle in a hugely competitive market .
' It 's an interesting device , but Nokia are undoubtedly playing catch - up to their rivals , ' said Stuart Miles of gadget site Pocket Lint .
' However , it does n't really have the cool factor of the latest BlackBerry or iPhone .
' Nokia has tried to merge its business and consumer phones , and they 've lost all the sex appeal a phone really needs to do well . '
Microsoft ( MSFT ) is talking about Windows XP , Windows 7 , and the enterprise again .
For the moment , put aside any concerns over Microsoft 's flagging online presence or the long - term threat of Office - competitors like Google ( GOOG ) Apps .
The biggest problem for Microsoft over the next 12 - 18 months is whether enterprise customers , a whopping 71 % of whom never upgraded off Windows XP , will embrace the upcoming Windows 7 , or whether they 'll stick it out with XP for years to come .
The specific problem :
While a Vista - to - 7 upgrade seems easy , upgrading from XP - to - 7 ( or even XP - to - Vista , which is how Microsoft got stuck in this hole in the first place ) is a major headache .
For an enterprise client with thousands ( or tens of thousands ) of PCs , upgrading off XP could easily be the most difficult and / or expensive IT deployment a company will undertake all year .
We heard CEO Steve Ballmer tell CIO mag that corporations should move to Windows 7 because " people will ask their boss why the heck they do n't have the stuff they have at home . "
Now that 's not the stuff corporate buying decisions are made of , and Steve is smart enough to know that .
Which underscores how Microsoft is grasping at straws to get their corporate customers to undertake major IT upgrades amidst the recession .
But we credit Microsoft this :
Once the company has a plan , it does n't back down .
Over on the Microsoft Windows Blog , the company is debuting a new set of tools to help corporate clients plan their upgrade .
And in a stunning display of chutzpah , Microsoft is urging their customers still on XP to upgrade to Vista ( which they 've avoided all along ) first :
We know some of our customers are considering waiting for Windows 7 instead of deploying Windows Vista today .
We want these customers to understand the following considerations , so they are not surprised later on :
You may find your company in situations where applications are no longer supported on Windows XP and not yet supported on Windows 7 ...
We expect deployment and application migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 to be similar in effort to going from Windows XP to Windows Vista .
As I mentioned above , there is a great deal of compatibility between both Windows Vista and Windows 7 , as we are not introducing any major architectural changes .
Our customers who focus efforts in getting their applications to work on Windows Vista will ease future migration to Windows 7 and help accelerate their Windows 7 deployment .
Nice try , but no one is going to upgrade Vista now .
What we still do n't hear , and what we 're starting to fear there 's no good answer for :
Other than the fear of having official support for Windows XP applications cut off , just what exactly are the quantifiable , ROI - generating benefits of Windows 7 for the enterprise ?
It 's certainly not " touch . "
My friend Nat Case , from my own Twin Cities Friends Meeting , has a blog I had n’t paid much attention to until a month or two ago .
I do n’t know how much of my inattention is because I had n’t noticed how smartly provocative his writing is , and how much is because , as a cartographer , he ’s been writing less for a mapmaking audience lately , and more for Quakers and other people who question the meaning of religion .
People like me .
This post expands on a brief comment I made on his post Fragments of a Religion That Never Existed , where Nat writes in part :
“ What I ’m interested in here is the idea of scripture not defined by its innate qualities ( e.g. dictated by God ) , but by its functional qualities .
What does scripture do ?
I find scripture - as - community - glue interesting , but my sympathies lie with scriptures - taken - to - heart .
I do have a series of books , passages from books , poems , some formal religious texts , ballads , and films that form what I believe is similar to the sort of scripture - taken - to - heart that orthodox folk might have .
Except I do not have a community that draws from the same set of texts . ”
I most certainly have my “ scripture ” in the sense Nat speaks of here .
A fair bit of what ’s in the Bible qualifies , including Genesis , Exodus , Job , Ecclesiastes , and others .
Unlike most liberal Friends I have spoken with , I find almost nothing in the Gospels as compelling as these books of the Hebrew Bible .
The teachings of Jesus are certainly remarkable , but for the most part I do n’t turn to the Bible for direction on how to live my life ; I turn to it for illumination of how life is .
I prefer Job to the Sermon on the Mount not because it gives better advice , but because it strikes me as more accurate–more true to the nature of life on earth .
If God existed in the sort of world we live in , I think he would terrify like the voice out of the whirlwind , not comfort like a loving parent .
The birds of the air Jesus speaks of may be arrayed better than Solomon in all his glory , but a great many of them starve before they give birth , or are eaten alive by other birds of the air .
This is how life is shaped , sayeth the scripture of Darwin .
The plumage of the birds of the air is lovely because it is tinctured with blood .
When I tell those who take the Bible as their one essential scripture , that I read the Bible the same way I read Melville or Dostoevsky or Kafka or Cormac McCarthy , they tend to take this as a dismissal of the Bible .
It ’s not .
Literature like this plays a powerful , crucial role in my life , intellectual , emotional and spiritual .
At its best these works unveil to me a rare and breathtaking view of the usually hidden essential nature of human existence .
What is revealed is sometimes beautiful , sometimes horrifying , sometimes –most revealing of all –both at once .
I suppose if I had to choose one volume to serve as my scripture , the Bible would be a pretty good choice .
There are stories and passages in there as soul - shattering as anything I ’ve ever read .
But I do n’t have to choose one volume , and I think there ’s something to be said for not choosing .
( In reply to this last point , Nat suggests that perhaps we do n’t choose our scriptures so much as our scriptures choose us .
Yes .
The only way I know I have found my scripture , is when I read it and it electrifies me .
As Emily Dickinson wrote , “ If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off , I know that is poetry . ” )
Police are preparing for a " summer of rage " as victims of the economic downturn take to the streets to demonstrate against financial institutions , the Guardian has learned .
Britain's most senior police officer with responsibility for public order raised the spectre of a return of the riots of the 1980s , with people who have lost their jobs , homes or savings becoming " footsoldiers " in a wave of potentially violent mass protests .
Superintendent David Hartshorn , who heads the Metropolitan police 's public order branch , told the Guardian that middle - class individuals who would never have considered joining demonstrations may now seek to vent their anger through protests this year .
He said that banks , particularly those that still pay large bonuses despite receiving billions in taxpayer money , had become " viable targets " .
So too had the headquarters of multinational companies and other financial institutions in the City which are being blamed for the financial crisis .
Hartshorn , who receives regular intelligence briefings on potential causes of civil unrest , said the mood at some demonstrations had changed recently , with activists increasingly " intent on coming on to the streets to create public disorder " .
The warning comes in the wake of often violent protests against the handling of the economy across Europe .
In recent weeks Greek farmers have blocked roads over falling agricultural prices , a million workers in France joined demonstrations to demand greater protection for jobs and wages and Icelandic demonstrators have clashed with police in Reykjavik .
In the UK hundreds of oil refinery workers mounted wildcat strikes last month over the use of foreign workers .
Intelligence reports suggest that " known activists " are also returning to the streets , and police claim they will foment unrest .
" Those people would be good at motivating people , but they have n't had the ' footsoldiers ' to actually carry out [ protests ] , " Hartshorn said .
" Obviously the downturn in the economy , unemployment , repossessions , changes that .
Suddenly there is the opportunity for people to mass protest .
" It means that where we would possibly look at certain events and say , 'yes there 'll be a lot of people there , there 'll be a lot of banner waving , but generally it will be peaceful ' , [ now ] we have to make sure these elements do n't come out and hijack that event and turn that into disorder . "
Hartshorn identified April 's G20 meeting of the group of leading and developing nations in London as an event that could kick - start a challenging summer .
" We 've got G20 coming and I think that is being advertised on some of the sites as the highlight of what they see as a ' summer of rage ' , " he said .
His comments are likely to be met with disappointment by protest groups , who in recent weeks have complained that police are adopting a more confrontational approach at demonstrations .
Officers have been accused of exaggerating the threat posed by activists to justify the use of resources spent on them .
Police were said to have been heavy - handed at Greek solidarity marches in London in December and , last month , at protests against Israel 's invasion of Gaza .
In August 1,000 officers , helicopters and riot horses were drafted to Kent from 26 UK police forces to oversee the climate camp demonstration against the Kingsnorth power station .
The massive operation to monitor the protesters cost £ 5.9 m and resulted in 100 arrests .
But in December the government was forced to apologise to parliament after the Guardian revealed that its claims that 70 officers had been hurt in violent clashes were wrong .
However , Hartshorn insisted : " Potentially there will be more industrial actions ...
History shows that some of those disputes - Wapping , the miners ' strike - have caused great tensions in the community and the police have had difficult times policing and maintaining law and order . "
Both " extreme rightwing and extreme leftwing " elements are looking to " use the fact that people are out of jobs " to galvanise support , he said .
A particularly worrying development was the re-emergence of individuals involved in the violent fascist organisation Combat 18 , he said .
" They are using the fact that there 's been lots of talk about eastern European people coming in and taking jobs on the Olympic sites , " he said .
" They 're using those type of arguments to look at getting support . "
Hartshorn said he also expected large - scale demonstrations this year on environmental issues , with hardcore green activists " joining forces " with middle - class campaigners over issues such as airport expansion at Heathrow and Stansted .
With the prospect of angry demonstrations against the economy , that could open the door to powerful coalitions .
" All you 've got to do then is link in with the environmentalists , and look at the oil companies .
They 're seen to be turning over billions of pounds profit in issues that are seen to be against the environment . "
Climate change is a bigger problem than the struggling British economy , a Government minister said today .

Sustainability Minister Lord
Hunt spoke on the first day of London Fashion Week as he launched an action plan to to make the clothing industry less damaging to the environment .
" We are facing big issues about the economy at the moment but the really big issue we face at the moment is climate change which can have a devastating impact on all of us , " he said .
" The clothing industry is responsible for lots and lots of greenhouse gas emissions . "
Lord Hunt said today 's launch was " the start of a great movement towards sustainable clothing " .
" It 's going to be great for the fashion industry , great for the climate and for anyone who's in the supply industry in developing countries to those working in retail .
" We believe customers want sustainable clothing and we want to give them as much as possible . "
Lord Hunt spoke before fashion week 's Estethica catwalk show of ethical designer fashion which is marking its third year .
British Fashion Council chairman Harold Tillman said : " When we launched this in 2004 it was the world 's first showcase for ethical fashion .
" It has grown from 13 designers to 37 and has grown in profile and reputation . "
The designers included in the Estethica section of the fashion week exhibition use either organic , fair trade or recycled materials .
Design house Noir and Bllack Noir provided the autumn / winter 2009 looks for the catwalk show .
Noir founder Peter Ingwersen said : " Estethica provides a fantastic platform for ethical brands to communicate with one voice .
" We all look to inspire the industry and consumers that sexiness , luxury and fashion , corporate social responsibility and ethics can work in harmony together without compromising look and style . "
The UK's clothing and textiles sector produces around 3.1 million tonnes of CO2 , two million tonnes of waste and 70 million tonnes of waste water per year - with 1.5 million tonnes of unwanted clothing ultimately ending up in landfill , according to the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs .
Dubious Role Models Study Reveals Many German Schools Still Named After Nazis
A new study shows that several German schools are still named after Nazis , including proponents of racial hygiene , rocket scientists and high - ranking party officials .
But local authorities are often reluctant to change the names .
A ' Robometer ' alerts police and sends a text message to the driver
The revolutionary “ smart meters ” – already dubbed Robometers – are being rolled out across France and are expected to reach Britain next .
The system allows authorities to detect the presence of vehicles parked in restricted areas .
Police are then alerted and fines issued , with a computer sending a text message to the driver to inform them .
While the system could herald the end of parking wardens in the UK , the number of people fined would inevitably rise – and motoring groups last night said it was a step too far .
Captain Gatso , the anonymous anti-speed camera campaigner , said the system was just another way of taxing drivers and raising cash for local authorities .
“ It is another case where cash is king and the motorist is seen as easy meat .
It is all so extreme and is yet another reason for motorists not to register their cars , ” he added .
About 60 councils in France have already installed the new system and it is believed authorities in the UK will also invest in it as a way to keep down the cost of parking enforcement .
Claude Zandona , managing director of Technolia , which developed the system , said : “ We are revolutionising parking with the individual monitoring of spaces . ”
The new meters create magnetic fields capable of registering the metal mass of vehicles .
The smart meter then sends a message to a police control room when a car overstays , which alerts officers through their mobile phones 15 minutes later .
“ That way police and wardens do n’t have to spend the day walking up and down the road , ” said Mr Zandona , who said he wanted to introduce the technology to Britain .
“ The police can go and sit in a cafe if they like and just pop out when they get a message to say a car is parked illegally .
They have an 80 per cent chance of finding the car still there between 12 and 18 minutes after the limit , we have found .
That ’s why we warn them after 15 minutes . ”
Technolia now wants to introduce an updated version in Britain , which will see drivers paying for parking with a PIN number incorporated into their mobile phones .
Schemes involving text messaging have already been introduced in parts of London but have been criticised by motorists who say they are complicated and leave them unable to talk to a human when there is a problem .
But Mr Zandona defended the new system , saying fines could be sent directly to drivers ’ homes , reducing or even ending the need for wardens .
Variations of the meter include one for disabled motorists , who are given a magnetic badge allowing them to park in designated spaces .
When a driver without a badge parks in a disabled bay , the meter alerts police .
THERE are so many things you ca n’t do in the big , bad city , and you ’d think that one of them would be climbing down a manhole when you ’re not an employee of the Department of Transportation or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority or Con Edison .
But you would be wrong .
Thanks to Bob Diamond , the man who rediscovered a 19th - century Atlantic Avenue train tunnel in Downtown Brooklyn , you can scurry down a certain manhole without being hauled away by your ankles by the authorities .
Since his big reveal in 1980 , Mr. Diamond , the 49 - year - old founder of the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association , has been conducting tunnel tours via the manhole with the blessing of the D.O.T .
But of late , Mr. Diamond has been pushing for another potential urban architectural “ get . ”
Behind a wall in the tunnel , near Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street , he believes , there is a steam locomotive lying on its side like an abandoned toy train , in “ pristine condition , a virtual time capsule . ”
And he wants to dig it up .
Schumer : GOP did n't object to deficit spending when Bush did it David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Sunday February 15 , 2009
Print This Email This Congressional Republicans have attacked the Obama administration 's stimulus program on the grounds that it involves spending money we do n't have , but Senator Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) struck back sharply against that argument in an appearance Sunday on ABC's This Week .
" On the floor of the Senate , I heard over and over again , ' This is a trillion dollars that we 're not paying for , ' " Schumer began .
Schumer was referring to statements like those made by House Minority Leader , John Boehner , who is quoted on his official website as saying ,  Republicans agree action is needed to help our economy create jobs and get back on the path to recovery , but borrowing billions from our children and grandchildren and spending it on slow - moving government programs is nt the answer . "
" I never heard that mentioned when it came to the Iraq War , " continued Schumer , " which is a trillion dollars which we 're not paying for .
I never heard it mentioned when George Bush changed a surplus of $ 300 billion into a deficit of over 800 . "
In 2006 , when the Republicans still controlled Congress , they actively beat back any attempts to control deficit spending .
The New York Times reported on March 14 of that year , " Senate Republicans on Tuesday narrowly defeated an effort to impose budget rules that would make it harder to increase spending or cut taxes , a move that critics said that showed Republicans were posturing in their calls for greater fiscal restraint .
...
Republicans said the push to add the rules to the budget was a back - door effort to make it harder to extend President Bush 's tax cuts .
' The practical effect of this is to raise taxes , ' said Senator Judd Gregg , Republican of New Hampshire and chairman of the Budget Committee . "
" So all of a sudden , the reason to be against this is deficit spending , " Schumer concluded .
" But when it was Iraq War or tax cuts for the highest - income people , we never heard it . "

A copy of DS title Animal Crossing Wild World sent out to media yesterday by Nintendo came loaded with most of the game 's secrets unlocked , it also included a nasty surprise .

When you come upon Baabara , the town 's resident sheep , you 're greeted with a racial epithet .
The word is used repeatedly in your conversation with the sheep .
" I almost forgot about you , N — - a " " So got any juicy gossip for me , N— -a ? " " Just thinking about it gets me all excited , N — -a . "

The word , written with a tilda over the N and an accent over the A , apparently popped up in the game because the person who was playing it , most likely a Nintendo employee , customized the greeting of the critter to include the word .
One of the draw's of the original DS title was that the text speech of the game 's inhabitants can be customized .
The sheep was first discovered by MTV's Stephen Totilo , who reported on it over on Multiplayer .
I was able to track the sheep down on the version sent me by Nintendo and verified that she 's just as mouthy in my version .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
It appears that Nintendo copied the save for the game to multiple copies of Wild Word and then sent it out to game writers .
The copy came with a letter explaining that content had been unlocked so writers could check out how moving stuff from the DS Animal Crossing title to the recently released Wii version worked .
We 've contacted Nintendo for comment and will update when they reply .

THE global financial crisis has finally broken the back of the struggling manufacturer Nylex , maker of the Esky brand , which has been placed in receivership and its shares suspended from trading on the ASX .
Control of the business and assets now rests with the receiver , McGrathNicol , appointed yesterday by a syndicate of secured lenders .
Nylex , which employs about 700 people in Australia , owes $ 60 million to Westpac and ANZ Bank , and has debts of $ 100 million .
A diversified company more than 60 years old , Nylex makes some of Australia 's best - known products .
Besides Esky coolers , it makes Ajax fasteners , rubbish bins and water tanks .
The group will continue trading while in administration .
Nylex , based in Melbourne , has struggled for a decade after being a major company under Alan Jackson in the late 1990s .
It has faced extensive restructuring in the past three years .
When trading halted , its shares were worth 6.4 c , giving the company a market capitalisation of $ 3.5 million .
The stock was trading as high as 65 c in August , and the group was worth $ 35 million .
SAVE OUR CHILDREN : LEGALIZE DRUGS
By Frosty Wooldridge
February 26 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
After the first 12 interviews with my brother Police Officer and Detective Howard Wooldridge of Lansing , Michigan ( retired ) concerning the " War on Drugs , " more and more Americans understand the underpinnings of how the U.S. government protracts a national taxpayer fraud .
At this time , over 10,000 judges , sheriffs , cops and thousands of citizens belong to www.leap.cc or Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
After 39 years of a failed Drug War policy and 30 million citizens that served time in prison for simple drug possession , this organization educates citizens toward a more plausible future for Americans .
" For decades we have seen commercial spots and our police and political leaders demand more action , more arrests to ' protect our children ' from the scourge of illegal drugs .
How can anyone argue with that concept ? " said Officer Howard Wooldridge .
" Wait !
Is Modern Prohibition / War on Drugs helping or hurting our young people ?
Based on my 18 years of police service and over a decade of examining the issue , led me to the answer NO !
To truly protect and save the lives and futures of our children , we need to legalize / regulate and tax these illegal drugs now .
" Drugs are readily available to America 's youth " states a DEA ( Drug Enforcement Administration ) brochure .
This admitted fact and failure of policy means that kids easily buy any illegal drug .
Indeed , government research shows that teens can buy illegal drugs easier than beer .
Whereas 40 years ago , one could only find heroin in large cities , today teens can purchase it easily in small towns like Jefferson , Wisconsin or Twin Falls , Idaho .
" Modern Prohibition kills our teens .
The federal government 's newest research shows that over 900,000 teens are employed — as drug dealers .
Many first join a gang — not a step in the right direction .
Every day several are shot and 1 - 2 die every week .
What kind of country has a policy which offers a 13 year old employment which starts him on a life of crime or worse , shot and killed ?
The United States of America !
This is immoral .
Teens should either be making chump change flipping burgers or unemployed .
Period !
" Teen drug dealers have become the symbol of success in the barrio and ghettos of American cities .
They have the money , women , cars and respect of their peers .
Even when they are arrested or shot , someone who looks just like them takes their place .
As good ministers and others urge young people to stay in school and away from drugs and gangs , these symbols undermine much of their efforts .
Why study hard when a youth can make decent money selling drugs and their employer does not ask for a high school diploma or where France is ?
" And many see little risk in taking illicit drugs . "
This from the same DEA pamphlet mentioned above .
Due to hard line policies by the prohibition crowd , our education efforts have completely failed our kids .
' Just say no . ' is a throw away joke line for young people .
Worse , they learn that their DARE officer lied to them that all these illegal drugs will kill them .
Now they experiment not knowing what is fact or fiction .
They combine their parents Valium with a six pack of beer and die of a polydrug overdose .
And as happens every day , even when teens see their friend dying of an overdose , nobody calls 911 to save the life .
They are too scared to get into trouble .
This horrendous situation is encouraged by the likes of " Washington State Senator Pam Roach who believes it is better for teens to die because saving them would ' encourage ' illegal drug use .
" Of course lives are ruined by a simple possession charge , as that person finds it nearly impossible to find meaningful employment , obtain a license , a credit card , housing or a student loan .
Worse , when a young person sells to their friends and are busted , they can end up dead by Rachel Hoffman a Florida University student that was forced into becoming a narc to not spend years in prison .
My colleagues asked her to buy guns and pills from real bad guys and they killed her .
Another case from 2008 in North Carolina is yet another of so many disgusting tragedies .
Mark Reid was arrested for minor sale of pot .
My colleagues interrogated him and told him how he would spend years in prison being raped and worse if he did not cooperate .
He could not morally go bust his friends to escape jail .
They scared him literally to death .
After he bonded out , he went home and hung himself .
He is forever 18 .
" All young people and our society are hurt as we build prison after prison instead of more junior colleges .
Tuition has on average tripled the inflation rate since 1990 , as we have jammed 2.3 million citizens into 6 X 8 cages — 70 % because of Modern Prohibition .
The trillion + dollars my profession has spent to arrest 39 million people has been truly a Bridge to Nowhere .
" As we look into a bleak couple of years , will our politicians ( they are rarely leaders ) have the will and courage to do what our grandparents did in 1933 ?
Will they end this Prohibition
Two which will save the lives and futures of our teenagers ?
It can go either way .
Tell your politicians how you feel .
Call , write , email or send a smoke signal .
Our teens deserve better . "
LEAP cops in their own words :
" Tell your member of Congress to support hearings on whether the war on drugs is an effective drug control strategy .
Urge your local city or county government to pass a resolution , asking for a national conversation on drug prohibition .
Ask yourself what have been the benefits , the positive outcomes for our country during the 38 year Drug War ?

" Envision a world where crime is cut in half , terrorists do n't make money selling drugs and kids are not employed in the drug trade , " Wooldridge said .
" Envision a world where the police focus on DUI , child predators and terrorists .
Imagine a world where if you have a drug problem , you see a doctor not a judge .
All are possible , when we find the courage to end our Prohibition . "

Adjust tuning in to your time zone .
In my reading over the last few days , I found a couple of items which really hammered home the point of just how ignorant people on the right are .
First up , from RedState ( yes , I read right - wing blogs so you do n’t have to ) .
In a diary written about an article in the Boston Globe about Rush Limbaugh , the writer first copies the Globe author then provides commentary .
Globe author :
Yes , our pinup boy has a following of about 20 million listeners .
But last time I looked , Obama won with nearly 70 million voters .
At this rate , The Party That Wo n’t Change is going to have to rename itself the Grand Old Ditto Heads .
Redstate commentary :
Sorry , Mz Goodman , but Obama did not win by 70 million votes as your rhetoric tries to cajole the reader into imagining .
The popular vote was 69,456,897 for Obama ( 52.9 % ) and 59,934,814 for McCain ( 45.7 % ) .
Hey , what ’s a preposition ( or .9 % ) between friends .
I usually do n’t link to the RedState articles , but this one is too good to pass up .
It is a must read for its sheer comedic value .
Next up , we have the tried and true lunacy from the Glenn Beck show ( via Crooks and Liars ) .
This time , it is Beck ’s guest Mark McKinney who , along with Beck , are railing against unions for having the nerve to have a conference at a place which usually charges $ 400 - $ 1400 per night .
( How dare them use their own funds for this type of soriee !
Do n’t they know that it is only TARP bail - out funds which are supposed to be used for an event ?
Whoops … slightly off topic there .
My bad ! )
So , what did Mr. McKinney say ?
This is the hotel that recently sponsored the Victoria ’s Secrets fashion show , which is ironic , because now they ’re planning to take away the secret ballot from American employees when they ’re being organized by union — by union folks trying to organize the workplace .
Someone , please tell me what is ironic in that sentence ?
I am missing it .
Do you see something ironic there ?
A play on words , perhaps .
( We all know that wingnuts do n’t have a well - honed sense of humor , so this is what , I assume , passes as humor to them .
That said , the unintended humor in the previous example had me rolling . )
Would someone please send these guys a dictionary / thesaurus ?
What is ironic is that the union , which are known for negotiating , had negotiated a room rate of less than $ 200.00 per night .
And on the show prior to Beck , Cavuto had acknowledged that it was a stellar negotiation by saying : “ The most expensive room for your members attending is $ 200 ?
Really .
[ Pause ]
All right , then everything ’s off .
You did OK .
If I could get one of those deals — that ’s not bad ! ”
That I find ironic .
The intellectual deficiency of the right is , simply put , stunning .

I was heartened to see an article about the need for mass transit in the pages of The Nation , though I was severely disappointed by the magazine ’s own hypocrisy and historical blindness .
The article is in all ways a standard left - liberal screed against the car and for mass transit , which is a topic close to my heart , though I ’d prefer a more libertarian approach to returning America to its mass transit roots as opposed to the publicly - funded version that The Nation advocates .
The first bit of historical blindness comes at the end of the second paragraph , when The Nation argues for government investment in mass transit on the grounds that it will “ strengthen labor , providing a larger base of unionized construction and maintenance jobs . ”
But do n’t they realize that the demands of organized labor were one of the straws that broke the privately - owned mass transit camel ’s back during the first half of the twentieth century ?
Joseph Ragen wrote an excellent essay about how unions in San Francisco demanded that mass transit companies employ two workers per streetcar instead of one , codifying their wishes through a series of legislative acts and even a referendum .
Saddled with these additional costs , the streetcar companies could not make a profit , and eventually the lines were paved over to make way for the automobile .
Mass transit companies , whether publicly - or privately - owned , cannot shoulder the burden of paying above - market wages and still hope to pose any serious threat to the automobile ’s dominance .
The second , and perhaps more egregious error , comes a little later , when The Nation lays the blame on every group but itself for the deteriorating state of mass transit in America :
Nonetheless , smart growth and transportation activists still have high hopes that the Obama administration and a Democratic Congress will revitalize mass transit .
But institutional stumbling blocks –including generations of federal policy favoring roads and cars ; pressure from fiscal conservatives ; and the power of auto , oil and highway construction lobbies –may cause them to miss this opportunity .
Smart growth , though not a libertarian movement , has a distinctly libertarian issue at its core : reversing the mandatory low density zoning and parking regulations that afflict almost every city , town , and village in America .
But who started the movement for zoning and low - density planning in the first place ?
Progressives , a group which The Nation fancies itself a member of .
And in fact , a search of The Nation ’s archives reveals that my suspicions were correct : the magazine was , sure enough , among those who were calling for a de-densification of America , and railing against the inefficiencies of mass transit .
From the April 24 issue published in 1920 , there ’s an article entitled “ The Lack of Houses : Remedies ” in which the author , Arthur Gleason , lays out his policy prescriptions for dealing with what he considered to be a dearth of housing in America .
Regarding zoning ( which at the time almost always meant separating homes from jobs and decreasing density – anathema to the New Urbanist call for mixed uses and density ) , Gleason was wholeheartedly in favor of it :
Zoning regulates and limits the height and bulk of buildings , and regulates and determines the area of courts , yards , and other open spaces .
It divides the city into districts .
It regulates and restricts the location of trades and industries and the location of buildings .
It conserves property values , directs building development , is a security against nuissance , a guarantee of stability , and an attraction to capital .
Not only did The Nation circa 1920 abhor density , but it also treated mass transit with disdain , writing that “ [ s ] ubways make a slum out of a suburb . ”
This is typical of progressives of the era , who saw mass transit as capitalistic and backwards .
There was also a tinge of racism to the attitude , as the “ slum ” was populated largely by Polish , Italian , Irish , and Jewish immigrants , while the “ suburb ” contained more acceptable non-immigrant Americans .
The Nation pays lip - service to America ’s mass transit - laden past , writing that “ it predates the automobile , ” but then conveniently forgets the reasons that mass transit in America ceased to exist .
And that ’s convenient , because the reasons – almost all driven by government intervention against streetcars , subways , and density – were once causes that The Nation championed .

Sony PlayStation ( PS1 ) 101 : A Beginners Guide
Note from racketboy : Special thanks goes to Ack for putting most of this guide together !
The RetroGaming 101 series is aimed at gamers who are just starting out in the classic gaming scene or are curious about an older console that they do n’t know much about yet .
Originally designed to be a peripheral for the Super Nintendo , Sony ’s PlayStation brand would go on a steady climb through the late 1990s to dominate the market for two generations of games .
But before it could get there , it would have to go toe to toe with the giants of the 16 - bit era , Nintendo and Sega .
The PlayStation , sometimes referred to as the PS , PS1 , or even PSX , would also see an influx of gamers coming into the field while an older generation began looking for more mature titles .
The little gray console would see one of the longest production runs in gaming history , running for over 11 years .
Production would finally be halted on March 23 , 2006 .
Background Information
Originally named the SNES - CD , it was changed to “ Sony Play Station ” after Nintendo ’s deal with Sony soured .
Nintendo dropped the original deal in 1991 after Hiroshi Yamauchi , then president of Nintendo , read the 1988 contract and discovered that Sony would practically have total control over all SNES - CD games .
In 1992 , Sony and Nintendo worked out a new deal where the “ Play Station ” would have a slot for SNES cartridges and Nintendo would own the rights and receive the majority of profit , while Sony ’s SPC700 audio chips would still be used for SNES carts .
Sony then decided against the deal , changed the name to PlayStation , and dropped the SNES port .
Many third - party companies that were furious with Nintendo then abandoned the console developer and joined Sony , cementing their place on the market .
The most notable of these would be Squaresoft .
The console launched in Japan on December 3 , 1994 , in America on September 9 , 1995 , Europe , September 29 , 1995 , and Australia and New Zealand , November 1995 .
Historical Impact
The Playstation led the way in the transition from the cartridge format to the CD , though not the first to use CDs .
While memory carts were used on the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64 , the PS1 would utilize memory cards via its controller ports , the Sony PlayStation would be the first to utilize the portable memory device effectively
Over 962 million PlayStation games have been sold worldwide .
Proved that third party support was absolutely key to a console ’s success .
The general design of Sony ’s PlayStation controller has also stayed similar in three generations , the longest of any game company .
Strengths
Featured the Geometry Transformation Engine , which would allow it to process on average 360,000 flat - shaded polygons per second , and 180,000 texture mapped and light - sourced polygons per second .
Could handle up to 16.7 million colors , with 24 bit color depth , resolutions ranging from 256×224 to 640×480 , and up to 4000 8×8 pixel sprites at any time
The PlayStation controller , while featuring 8 buttons and a D - pad initially , saw one of the greatest upgrades in the Dual Shock , which featured two Dual Analog sticks built into it in places easily accessible by the thumbs .
Featured large amounts of 3rd party support , including the coveted Squaresoft .
The console was also remembered for its large number of adult - oriented games , such as the Resident Evil series , Silent Hill , Parasite Eve , and Dino Crisis .
Nintendo was meanwhile forced to fend off an image as “ kiddy . ”
The Playstation has one of the most diverse game libraries in the history of the industry – the only console to surpass it was its successor , the Playstation 2 .
Fans of Japanese RPGs , 2D scrolling shooters , and platformers will find a wealth of essential games in the PS1 library .
The Playstation is much easier to emulate accurately than both the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64 .
For a More In - Depth Discussion , please see our detailed guide to the Playstation ’s Strengths and Weaknesses vs the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn .
Weaknesses
Could only display quickly moving polygons in lower resolutions .
Textures also sometimes appeared grainy .
The machine was designed with 3D graphics in mind , so 2D graphics had to be saved in as multiple polygon textures .
Games suffered from load times , and were less durable than the cartridges of previous eras .
Cases are also fragile and have a tendency to crack .
First generation PlayStations had cases and moving parts for their lasers made out of plastic , which would eventually wear away from friction and heat .
Eventually Sony would fix this by replacing these parts with metal ones .
Some early models , especially 100x models , would not run FMVs or streamed audio properly , leading to skipping or freezing .
In a few extreme cases the machine would have to be turned over to work .
Early consoles also suffered from some overheating problems .
There were many different models released , featuring various ports , S - video , A/V and direct connections .
One model could even play Video CDs .
The overall amount is a bit mind - boggling , and charts are best used to describe them
As mentioned above , you can see more detail in the PS1 vs N64 vs Saturn guide .
Game Library
Importing & Modifying
PlayStations are region locked , though some early models could play burned games and imports using the swap trick .
Modchips exist that require minimal soldering skills to use , though local and national laws should be considered before installation .
Other mods that require no use of soldering tools do exist , such as the Breaker Pro , though the quality of these devices is debatable .
Emulation
PlayStation 2 is backwards compatible , so PlayStation games will work on it along with Playstation memory cards and Dual Shock controllers .
All existing models of the Playstation 3 are also able to play PS1 games – even those that do not have support for PS2 games .
Emulators to play PlayStation games on the PC , such as ePSXe ( including a Linux version ) , PCSX , PSXeven , and pSX .
Tools also exist to emulate PlayStation titles on other formats , including the PSP and iPhone .
You can get some impressive results by tweaking your settings , plugins , and filters on ePSXe
Accessories
The PlayStation garnered considerable third party support for controller design , such as the EA Sports PlayStation Controller , the Namco neGCon Analog Controller , or the Performance Dual Impact Controller .
The Namco JogCon is a particularly interesting design , a mixture of standard PlayStation controller and steering wheel .
Joysticks ( including the Dual Sticks and ASCIIWARE Specialized Joystick ) , Dance Pads ( such as the Konami Dance Pad ) , Racing Wheel , and an official Mouse and Mousepad ( and a trackball mouse as well ) were released for the PlayStation .
Stranger controllers , such as the Agetec Bass Landing Fishing Controller , Reality Quest Glove , Ultra Racer , and even the Naki Finger Dance Pad , were all manufactured for this console .
Perhaps the oddest is the Beatmania controller , with five keyboard keys and a mini-turntable .
A wide selection of light guns were made available by such companies as Nyko and Mad Catz .
Namco also manufactured and marketed their own light gun , the GunCon ( G - Con if you live in Europe ) , though it only worked with Namco games .
Auto - reload pedals were also sold .
Multi taps were manufactured , allowing games to have up to four players .
Two multi taps could be combined to allow a maximum of eight players for the biggest games .
Link cables were also manufactured to hook two PlayStations together .
A vast array of cheating and import materials , from Code Breakers to Game Sharks to Game Enhancers existed for the console , working via swap tricks , or even plugging into the parallel port found on the back .
Some of these doubled as additional memory storage devices .
Other storage devices that used the printer port were available , as well as larger - sized memory cards from third party developers .
Sony also released a special memory card , the Pocketstation , which had a variety of features .
It could also unlock extra features in some games , and could transfer saves directly to other Pocketstations .
Additional memory storage included Interact ’s Dex Drive , which allowed people to upload their saves from their memory cards onto their computers .
The PlayStation was also compatible with Blaze Technology ’s MPXchanger , as were the Pocketstations .
An official carrying case was also released for the console .
Variations in Hardware
The PlayStation had multiple hardware variations , often changing the type of ports .
The SCPH - 1000 had S - Video connections .
Later models dropped the parallel port first , and then the serial port .
One model , the SCPH - 5903 , was the only model that could play Video CDs .
The SCPH - 700 x series standardized Dual Shock , and were released around the time the 10 millionth unit was sold .
As a result , Sony released several of these in Midnight Blue .
The SCPH - 5552 had an extremely rare Men in Black variant .
The case was black and had the film ’s logo on the top of its CD lid .
The SCPH - 900 x series introduced Sound Scope to the PlayStation , but removed the parallel port .
The PS One was a smaller , retooled version of the PlayStation .
It lacked the parallel and serial ports , could play all PlayStation games , featured a different interface , and was designed to be very difficult to modchip .
Sony also released an LCD screen and an adapter so the console could be used in a car .
( See Pictures )
The Net Yaroze was a black PlayStation that featured many of the tools for game development , though not everything .
It was also region free , but could not play burned games .
Programming was also limited to 2 MB of game space .
( See Pictures )
Blue and green developer consoles can also be found on the market .
They are virtually identical to other PlayStations , though they could play burned games .
The difference in color represented the hardware they used : Blue for “ Revision B , ” green for “ Revision C . ”
Deciding Between Various PS1 Models
Unless S - Video is absolutely essential , look for a later model , like the 500x series .
By that point most of the major hardware issues are fixed , such as the plastic laser pieces .
PSOnes offer portability due to the LCD screen and car adapter , but lack serial ports , so link cables do not work on them .
They ’re also difficult to mod .
900 x series does not include the parallel port , making it incompatible with some of the peripherals , especially some larger memory storage devices .
However , there are the only standard PS1 models with Sound Scope .
Dual Shock is standardized in the 700 x series , so keep that in mind when selecting controllers !
Advantages PS1 Has Over a PS2
Because there is no reliance on an ejecting CD tray , the PlayStation tends to have a longer lifespan than the PS2 .
Certain PlayStation games are not compatible with the PS2 , or with specific models .
A few will run but experience technical problems .
These games do not work at all : Fighter Maker , Judge Dredd , Monkey Hero , Poy Poy 2
Tobal 2 typically has trouble on the PS2 , though may work on later PS2 models .
The PAL version is apparently ok .
Final Fantasy V sometimes glitches while saving on PlayStation 2 .
Mortal Kombat Trilogy only works on one model PS2 , only when it ’s the Greatest Hits copy .
But even this version freezes when the player beats arcade mode .
PS2 3000X models have trouble running Legend of Dragoon , Lunar Silver Star Story , Lunar 2 : Eternal Blue Complete , Metal Gear Solid : Special Missions , and Final Fantasy Tactics
Some games including Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo , Driver , and Syphon Filter 3 do not work on the PS2 Slim at all ( see full list here )
Since some of these are good games , it ’s well worth it to pay the extra few bucks to use them .
Many of the peripherals for the PS1 do not work on the PS2 , especially anything that used the parallel port .
Affordability
j Query is a great javascript framework that has been growing steadily in popularity .
One of its best features is its extensibility .
jQuery has a lightweight core that can easily be extended to provide additional functionality through plugins .
Using a jQuery plugin looks something like this :
$ ( " selector " ) .pluginname ( ) ;
While writing one - off scripts and applications is necessary , often there are components of a project that can be reused in the future .
A good idea is to encapsulate these components in a plugin .
The jQuery documentation has a Plugin Authoring Guidelines page which has some great information , but I have found it to be an impractical guide .
After doing some reading and developing a couple of plugins on my own , I have found the following template ideal for developing jQuery plugins :
( function ( $ ) { $. fn.pluginname = function ( options ) { options = $. extend ( { optionOne : ' defaultValue ' , optionTwo : { partOne : ' defaultValue ' } } , options ) ; $ ( this ).each ( function ( ) { /* Plugin Code Here */ } ) ; } } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Now let me break down each part of the template and explain why each is necessary .
The Wrapper is a Closure
( function ( $ ) { /* plugin code */ } ) ( jQuery ) ;
Using '$ ' is desirable when using jQuery because it is terse , requiring fewer keystrokes and is an assumed default in the jQuery community .
However , many other frameworks and scripts use the symbol , so for compatibility reasons , it can not be assumed that it is available .
When developing a plugin , this consideration is especially important because the environment that the plugin will be deployed to is unknown .
By wrapping our plugin in a closure we are able to use the ' $ ' symbol throughout our plugin without worrying about namespace issues .
Additionally , any helper functions or objects that we need for our plugin will not be exposed to the global namespace and instead will live inside our plugin only .
Assigning the Plugin Name
$.fn.pluginname = function ( options ) { }
This assignment allows us to use our plugin as a jQuery function as shown at the very beginning of this post .
Rather than letting your plugin be a nest of functions and objects that would clutter the namespace if they were simply copied and pasted into your script or included as a script separately , your plugin will exist only as a function call on jQuery objects .
When working on larger projects this is important .
Using Default Values with an Options Argument
options = $. extend ( { } , options ) ;
When developing a jQuery plugin , it is best to avoid having many arguments in favor of using a single options argument .
This makes it much easier to make settings optional as well as have some defaults set .
By having a single options argument you can use the jQuery .
extend utility to assign defaults without overwriting values that a user has passed in .
It is also good practice to make as much of your plugin configurable by options as possible .
This will allow your users to have a large amount of control without having to mess around with the internals of the plugin .
As an example , authors of plugins that perform an animation will often have a string arguement that controls the type of animation that is done .
They expect values such as ' fade ' or ' slide ' .
The accepted way to handle animations is to instead use the animate method which will give the user more complete control .
Conclusion
Hopefully this template is helpful in developing jQuery plugins .
If you have seen or put together a cool plugin be sure to drop it in the comments .
Also be sure to let me know of any other good tips you have for setting up a plugin for jQuery .
For all you Inauguration - bound travelers who can't get a room , there 's a cheap alternative -- with a catch -- you have to take it all off .
THE GREAT SLUMP OF 1930
By
JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES
I .
The world has been slow to realize that we are living this year in the shadow of one of the greatest economic catastrophes of modern history .
But now that the man in the street has become aware of what is happening , he , not knowing the why and wherefore , is as full to - day of what may prove excessive fears as , previously , when the trouble was first coming on , he was lacking in what would have been a reasonable anxiety .
He begins to doubt the future .
Is he now awakening from a pleasant dream to face the darkness of facts ?
Or dropping off into a nightmare which will pass away ?
He need not be doubtful .
The other was not a dream .
This is a nightmare , which will pass away with the morning .
For the resources of nature and men's devices are just as fertile and productive as they were .
The rate of our progress towards solving the material problems of life is not less rapid .
We are as capable as before of affording for everyone a high standard of life — high , I mean , compared with , say , twenty years ago — and will soon learn to afford a standard higher still .
We were not previously deceived .
But to - day we have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle , having blundered in the control of a delicate machine , the working of which we do not understand .
The result is that our possibilities of wealth may run to waste for a time — perhaps for a long time .
I doubt whether I can hope , in these articles , to bring what is in my mind into fully effective touch with the mind of the reader .
I shall be saying too much for the layman , too little for the expert .
For — though no one will believe it — economics is a technical and difficult subject .
It is even becoming a science .
However , I will do my best — at the cost of leaving out , because it is too complicated , much that is necessary to a complete understanding of contemporary events .
First of all , the extreme violence of the slump is to be noticed .
In the three leading industrial countries of the world — the United States , Great Britain , and Germany — 10,000,000 workers stand idle .
There is scarcely an important industry anywhere earning enough profit to make it expand — which is the test of progress .
At the same time , in the countries of primary production the output of mining and of agriculture is selling , in the case of almost every important commodity , at a price which , for many or for the majority of producers , does not cover its cost .
In 1921 , when prices fell as heavily , the fall was from a boom level at which producers were making abnormal profits ; and there is no example in modern history of so great and rapid a fall of prices from a normal figure as has occurred in the past year .
Hence the magnitude of the catastrophe .
The time which elapses before production ceases and unemployment reaches its maximum is , for several reasons , much longer in the case of the primary products than in the case of manufacture .
In most cases the production units are smaller and less well organized amongst themselves for enforcing a process of orderly contraction ; the length of the production period , especially in agriculture , is longer ; the costs of a temporary shut - down are greater ; men are more often their own employers and so submit more readily to a contraction of the income for which they are willing to work ; the social problems of throwing men out of employment are greater in more primitive communities ; and the financial problems of a cessation of production of primary output are more serious in countries where such primary output is almost the whole sustenance of the people .
Nevertheless we are fast approaching the phase in which the output of primary producers will be restricted almost as much as that of manufacturers ; and this will have a further adverse reaction on manufacturers , since the primary producers will have no purchasing power wherewith to buy manufactured goods ; and so on , in a vicious circle .
In this quandary individual producers base illusory hopes on courses of action which would benefit an individual producer or class of producers so long as they were alone in pursuing them , but which benefit no one if everyone pursues them .
For example , to restrict the output of a particular primary commodity raises its price , so long as the output of the industries which use this commodity is unrestricted ; but if output is restricted all round , then the demand for the primary commodity falls off by just as much as the supply , and no one is further forward .
Or again , if a particular producer or a particular country cuts wages , then , so long as others do not follow suit , that producer or that country is able to get more of what trade is going .
But if wages are cut all round , the purchasing power of the community as a whole is reduced by the same amount as the reduction of costs ; and , again , no one is further forward .
Thus neither the restriction of output nor the reduction of wages serves in itself to restore equilibrium .
Moreover , even if we were to succeed eventually in re-establishing output at the lower level of money - wages appropriate to ( say ) the pre-war level of prices , our troubles would not be at an end .
For since 1914 an immense burden of bonded debt , both national and international , has been contracted , which is fixed in terms of money .
Thus every fall of prices increases the burden of this debt , because it increases the value of the money in which it is fixed .
For example , if we were to settle down to the pre-war level of prices , the British National Debt would be nearly 40 per cent .
greater than it was in 1924 and double what it was in 1920 ; the Young Plan would weigh on Germany much more heavily than the Dawes Plan , which it was agreed she could not support ; the indebtedness to the United States of her associates in the Great War would represent 40 - 50 per cent .
more goods and services than at the date when the settlements were made ; the obligations of such debtor countries as those of South America and Australia would become insupportable without a reduction of their standard of life for the benefit of their creditors ; agriculturists and householders throughout the world , who have borrowed on mortgage , would find themselves the victims of their creditors .
In such a situation it must be doubtful whether the necessary adjustments could be made in time to prevent a series of bankruptcies , defaults , and repudiations which would shake the capitalist order to its foundations .
Here would be a fertile soil for agitation , seditions , and revolution .
It is so already in many quarters of the world .
Yet , all the time , the resources of nature and men's devices would be just as fertile and productive as they were .
The machine would merely have been jammed as the result of a muddle .
But because we have magneto trouble , we need not assume that we shall soon be back in a rumbling waggon and that motoring is over .
II .
We have magneto trouble .
How , then , can we start up again ?
Let us trace events backwards : —
1 . Why are workers and plant unemployed ?
Because industrialists do not expect to be able to sell without loss what would be produced if they were employed .
2 . Why cannot industrialists expect to sell without loss ?
Because prices have fallen more than costs have fallen — indeed , costs have fallen very little .
3 . How can it be that prices have fallen more than costs ?
For costs are what a business man pays out for the production of his commodity , and prices determine what he gets back when he sells it .
It is easy to understand how for an individual business or an individual commodity these can be unequal .
But surely for the community as a whole the business men get back the same amount as they pay out , since what the business men pay out in the course of production constitutes the incomes of the public which they pay back to the business men in exchange for the products of the latter ?
For this is what we understand by the normal circle of production , exchange , and consumption .
4. No ! Unfortunately this is not so ; and here is the root of the trouble .
It is not true that what the business men pay out as costs of production necessarily comes back to them as the sale - proceeds of what they produce .
It is the characteristic of a boom that their sale - proceeds exceed their costs ; and it is the characteristic of a slump that their costs exceed their sale - proceeds .
Moreover , it is a delusion to suppose that they can necessarily restore equilibrium by reducing their total costs , whether it be by restricting their output or cutting rates of remuneration ; for the reduction of their outgoings may , by reducing the purchasing power of the earners who are also their customers , diminish their sale - proceeds by a nearly equal amount .
5 . How , then , can it be that the total costs of production for the world 's business as a whole can be unequal to the total sale - proceeds ?
Upon what does the inequality depend ?
I think that I know the answer .
But it is too complicated and unfamiliar for me to expound it here satisfactorily .
( Elsewhere I have tried to expound it accurately . )
So I must be somewhat perfunctory .
Let us take , first of all , the consumption - goods which come on to the market for sale .
Upon what do the profits ( or losses ) of the producers of such goods depend ?
The total costs of production , which are the same thing as the community 's total earnings looked at from another point of view , are divided in a certain proportion between the cost of consumption - goods and the cost of capital - goods .
The incomes of the public , which are again the same thing as the community 's total earnings , are also divided in a certain proportion between expenditure on the purchase of consumption - goods and savings .
Now if the first proportion is larger than the second , producers of consumption - goods will lose money ; for their sale proceeds , which are equal to the expenditure of the public on consumption - goods , will be less ( as a little thought will show ) than what these goods have cost them to produce .
If , on the other hand , the second proportion is larger than the first , then the producers of consumption - goods will make exceptional gains .
It follows that the profits of the producers of consumption goods can only be restored , either by the public spending a larger proportion of their incomes on such goods ( which means saving less ) , or by a larger proportion of production taking the form of capital - goods ( since this means a smaller proportionate output of consumption - goods ) .
But capital - goods will not be produced on a larger scale unless the producers of such goods are making a profit .
So we come to our second question — upon what do the profits of the producers of capital - goods depend ?
They depend on whether the public prefer to keep their savings liquid in the shape of money or its equivalent or to use them to buy capital - goods or the equivalent .
If the public are reluctant to buy the latter , then the producers of capital - goods will make a loss ; consequently less capital - goods will be produced ; with the result that , for the reasons given above , producers of consumption - goods will also make a loss .
In other words , all classes of producers will tend to make a loss ; and general unemployment will ensue .
By this time a vicious circle will be set up , and , as the result of a series of actions and reactions , matters will get worse and worse until something happens to turn the tide .
This is an unduly simplified picture of a complicated phenomenon .
But I believe that it contains the essential truth .
Many variations and fugal embroideries and orchestrations can be superimposed ; but this is the tune .
If , then , I am right , the fundamental cause of the trouble is the lack of new enterprise due to an unsatisfactory market for capital investment .
Since trade is international , an insufficient output of new capital - goods in the world as a whole affects the prices of commodities everywhere and hence the profits of producers in all countries alike .
Why is there an insufficient output of new capital - goods in the world as a whole ?
It is due , in my opinion , to a conjunction of several causes .
In the first instance , it was due to the attitude of lenders — for new capital - goods are produced to a large extent with borrowed money .
Now it is due to the attitude of borrowers , just as much as to that of lenders .
For several reasons lenders were , and are , asking higher terms for loans , than new enterprise can afford .
First , the fact , that enterprise could afford high rates for some time after the war whilst war wastage was being made good , accustomed lenders to expect much higher rates than before the war .
Second , the existence of political borrowers to meet Treaty obligations , of banking borrowers to support newly restored gold standards , of speculative borrowers to take part in Stock Exchange booms , and , latterly , of distress borrowers to meet the losses which they have incurred through the fall of prices , all of whom were ready if necessary to pay almost any terms , have hitherto enabled lenders to secure from these various classes of borrowers higher rates than it is possible for genuine new enterprise to support .
Third , the unsettled state of the world and national investment habits have restricted the countries in which many lenders are prepared to invest on any reasonable terms at all .
A large proportion of the globe is , for one reason or another , distrusted by lenders , so that they exact a premium for risk so great as to strangle new enterprise altogether .
For the last two years , two out of the three principal creditor nations of the world , namely , France and the United States , have largely withdrawn their resources from the international market for long - term loans .
Meanwhile , the reluctant attitude of lenders has become matched by a hardly less reluctant attitude on the part of borrowers .
For the fall of prices has been disastrous to those who have borrowed , and anyone who has postponed new enterprise has gained by his delay .
Moreover , the risks that frighten lenders frighten borrowers too .
Finally , in the United States , the vast scale on which new capital enterprise has been undertaken in the last five years has somewhat exhausted for the time being — at any rate so long as the atmosphere of business depression continues — the profitable opportunities for yet further enterprise .
By the middle of 1929 new capital undertakings were already on an inadequate scale in the world as a whole , outside the United States .
The culminating blow has been the collapse of new investment inside the United States , which to - day is probably 20 to 30 per cent .
less than it was in 1928 .
Thus in certain countries the opportunity for new profitable investment is more limited than it was ; whilst in others it is more risky .
A wide gulf , therefore , is set between the ideas of lenders and the ideas of borrowers for the purpose of genuine new capital investment ; with the result that the savings of the lenders are being used up in financing business losses and distress borrowers , instead of financing new capital works .
At this moment the slump is probably a little overdone for psychological reasons .
A modest upward reaction , therefore , may be due at any time .
But there cannot be a real recovery , in my judgment , until the ideas of lenders and the ideas of productive borrowers are brought together again ; partly by lenders becoming ready to lend on easier terms and over a wider geographical field , partly by borrowers recovering their good spirits and so becoming readier to borrow .
Seldom in modern history has the gap between the two been so wide and so difficult to bridge .
Unless we bend our wills and our intelligences , energized by a conviction that this diagnosis is right , to find a solution along these lines , then , if the diagnosis is right , the slump may pass over into a depression , accompanied by a sagging price - level , which might last for years , with untold damage to the material wealth and to the social stability of every country alike .
Only if we seriously seek a solution , will the optimism of my opening sentences be confirmed — at least for the nearer future .
It is beyond the scope of this article to indicate lines of future policy .
But no one can take the first step except the central banking authorities of the chief creditor countries ; nor can any one Central Bank do enough acting in isolation .
Resolute action by the Federal Reserve Banks of the United States , the Bank of France , and the Bank of England might do much more than most people , mistaking symptoms or aggravating circumstances for the disease itself , will readily believe .
In every way the more effective remedy would be that the Central Banks of these three great creditor nations should join together in a bold scheme to restore confidence to the international long - term loan market ; which would serve to revive enterprise and activity everywhere , and to restore prices and profits , so that in due course the wheels of the world 's commerce would go round again .
And even if France , hugging the supposed security of gold , prefers to stand aside from the adventure of creating new wealth , I am convinced that Great Britain and the United States , like - minded and acting together , could start the machine again within a reasonable time ; if , that is to say , they were energized by a confident conviction as to what was wrong .
For it is chiefly the lack of this conviction which to - day is paralyzing the hands of authority on both sides of the Channel and of the Atlantic .
Bianca Jagger is a prominent human rights campaigner
An Austrian who found a ring belonging to human rights activist Bianca Jagger is suing her for defamation resulting from a row over whether she should pay a reward .
Reinhard Ringler found the ring , worth 200,000 euros ( $ 254,000 ; £ 175,000 ) , in Salzburg last year .
According to Austrian law , he is due 5 % of the value - 10,000 euros .
Ms Jagger , who was once married to the Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger , refuses to pay because , according to comments made by her lawyer , Mr Ringler took too long to return the item .
It is claimed that he is not entitled to the reward as he took eight days to give it to the police .
Mr Ringler says he initially gave the platinum and aquamarine ring to his daughter , thinking it was worthless , and only realised its value when he saw reports of the lost ring in the media .
Ms Jagger 's lawyer says that , as an alternative , she offered to pay 9,000 euros to Amnesty International and the remaining 1,000 to Mr Ringler 's daughter .
The defamation case will be heard at a court in Salzburg in May .
Correction 15 May 2009 : The original version of this story , based on an agency report , wrongly stated that Mr Ringler was suing Ms Jagger in connection with a reward for the finding of the ring .
In fact , it was an action for defamation based on comments made by Ms Jagger 's lawyers .
Ms Jagger rejects the allegations .

William Mark Felt , the infamous ‘ Deep Throat ’ of Watergate fame , was no hero .
Sometimes portrayed as heroically risking his job at the Federal Bureau of Investigation to expose President Richard Nixon ’s illegal ‘ Plumbers ’ unit that burglarized Democratic National Committee headquarters , Felt coveted the job as director .
Felt , who had engaged in and covered up dirty tricks and illegal conduct of FBI agents for years , was making a move to become the new boss .
The largest FBI crime spree that Felt kept under wraps was Operation COINTELPRO and his name appears on a secret FBI memo in the ‘ Omaha Two ’ case authorizing the withholding of a crime lab report .
Ed Poindexter and Mondo we Langa ( formerly David Rice ) were leaders of a Black Panther Party chapter in Omaha , Nebraska and targets of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover ’s clandestine war on the party .
Hoover was determined to crush the party and jail or eliminate its leadership .
In 1975 , Noam Chomsky put the two illegal operations in context writing about COINTELPRO misdeeds .
“ The criminal activities of the FBI were initiated under the liberal Democratic administrations and carried further under Nixon .
The programs were ( partially ) exposed during the Watergate period , and though incomparably more serious than anything charged against Nixon , they were virtually ignored during this period by the liberal national press and journals of opinion , and only marginally discussed since . ”
The August 17 , 1970 bombing murder of Omaha , Nebraska policeman Larry Minard gave Hoover ’s agents the opportunity to place the blame on the Panther leaders and have them charged with the crime .
Assistant Chief of Police Glen W. Gates was agreeable to compromising the investigation into Minard ’s killing in order to get the two Panthers .
One snag to the COINTELPRO plot was a tape recording of the killer ’s voice made on the recently installed 911 system when a false report was made of a woman screaming .
A plan was made the same day of Minard ’s murder to send the recording to the FBI Crime Laboratory for analysis .
However , the crime lab was not to issue a report on the testing which would have to be disclosed to defense attorneys .
The scheme to withhold evidence and drop the search for Minard ’s actual killer was outlined in a confidential COINTELPRO memorandum addressed to Ivan Willard Conrad , the FBI lab director .
Conrad spoke with Hoover on the phone on August 19th , the day before officer Minard ’s mangled body was buried , about the unusual request .
Hoover authorized withholding the report and Conrad noted Hoover said it was “ OK to do ” on his copy of the memo .
The jury that convicted Ed Poindexter and Mondo we Langa never got to hear the recording of the killer ’s voice .
The jury also never learned that J. Edgar Hoover had personally authorized withholding evidence from them about the killer ’s identity .
Hoover ’s dirty role did not come to light until years later in a Freedom of Information request by Mondo we Langa .
Although the released document was heavily redacted enough information was left by FBI censors to reveal the awful details of the plot to let Minard ’s killer get away with murder in order to pin the crime on Poindexter and Langa .
Felt , as chief of the Inspection Division , was on the COINTELPRO directorate that oversaw the field operations and approved or denied actions of the agents .
Felt was also on the distribution list of the Omaha memo .
Felt ’s name appears sandwiched in between Conrad and James H. Gale , his predecessor at the Inspection Division .
Although Mondo ’s heavily redacted copy of the COINTELPRO memo does not reveal Felt ’s initials there can be little doubt
Felt was aware of the plan to let Minard ’s killer escape justice .
In his autobiographical memoir , The FBI Pyramid From the Inside , Felt bragged about his total oversight of field operations .
“ The chief inspector occupied a unique position in the FBI hierarchy .
Operating under the direct supervision of the Director and with authority to inquire at any time and any place on any matter . ”
Felt elaborated , “ The whole operation was a pyramid with everything funneling up through ever tightening lines of responsibility until it reached Hoover . ”
Felt also describes in his book his close working relationship with Conrad , with whom he was quick to pick up a phone and call when questions arose on a case .
As chief inspector , Felt should have insisted that a laboratory report be issued on the vocal analysis of Minard ’s killer .
When the Church Committee of the U.S. Senate investigated COINTELPRO in the mid-70’s , Felt was the star witness , stonewalling the committee .
In another book , A G - Man ’s Life , a sanctimonious Felt complained about the Senate inquiry and defended COINTELPRO abuses .
“ I found myself becoming the foremost FBI witness , I was interviewed on five separate occasions by the committee staff — an exercise in futility and frustration , since most of what I said was ignored and the rest taken out of context . ”
Felt kept up his drumbeat , “ I emphasized as strongly as I could that our country ’s complacency against domestic terrorism would eventually lead to disaster . ”

MyMMOShop.com , a site specializing in the acquisition and sale of virtual goods and currency in the online gaming realm , has been sold for $ 10 million to private firm My MMO Inc. , reports Kotaku .
For those unaware , sites like MyMMOShop.com are brokers for the sale of virtual goods .
In general they use cheap ( often foreign ) labor to accumulate large sums of gold and items in online games ( such as the above - pictured Age of Conan ) that is then sold for a huge profit to impatient gamers .
Hunter Crowell , media relations agent for My MMO Inc. , says his company purchased the site in reaction to the tumultuous economic climate .
Virtual goods , he says , are one of the few investment vectors that have not become wildly devalued as part of the massive market fluctuations of the past few months .
As Kotaku points out , the real question here is how much of the $ 10 million will see its way into the hands of those doing the actual gold farming .
As the enterprise is inherently a gray market , I wonder what , if any , incentive exists for the higher ups at these firms to not simply pocket all the cash in the continued exploitation of the grunts in their employ .

I have seen and done many horrible things ,
either at Guantánamo or in Iraq , and I know
what it is like to try and move on with your
life .
It 's hard .
-- Spc. Brandon Neely
Tell me a bit about your life before you joined the military .
Where were you born and grew up ?
Why and when you enrolled , and so on ?
I was born June 2 , 1980 at Fort Benning , Georgia .
My father was stationed there in the Army at that time .
I lived at Fort Benning until I was 4 ; then we moved on to Fort Knox , Kentucky until I was around 10 .
From there we moved to Huntsville , TX .
This is where my father retired as a master sergeant from the army .
Huntsville is a small town .
The only thing in the town is the prison system and the college ( Sam Houston State University ) .
Growing up there was not a whole lot to do ; we spent most of our time playing sports and trying to stay out of trouble .
I can remember being 16 years old and telling my parents that I would never join the military .
Even though I was raised in a military household , my father did not bring the army home with him .
The military was not something our parents wanted us to do .
We were always told " College first and , if you want the military after that , it will be there afterwards " .
I graduated high school in 1998 with no plans whatsoever for my future .
I was not ready for college .
I was not mature enough and I knew that I could had went , but I for sure would had wasted my parents money .
For almost 2 years I did n't do much other then hang out and work at a local grocery store stocking groceries 40 hours a week .
In June of 2000 I woke up one day and decided I was going to join the army as a military police officer .
I knew that I needed to do something with my life .
I was not sure what yet , but I knew the military would help me grow up and give me some options for my future .
So I called my local recruiting station and made an appointment .
When I arrived for my appointment that day I told my recruiter that I wanted to be a military police ( MP ) officer and that I understood I had to sign a 5 year contract to do so .
And that was it ; nothing else .
A couple days later I was on my way to the Military Entrance Processing Station ( MEPS ) .
There I enlisted for 5 years as a MP .
That day was June 20 , 2000 .
Then , on August 20 , 2000 , I left for Fort Leonard , Missouri , for 17 weeks for basic and advanced individual training .
It is striking how specific your decision to become an MP was …
Law enforcement was something I was always drawn to .
It was a field I had hoped to get into ever since I was a child .
At the age of 7 or 8 , while we were in Fort Knox , Kentucky , I was out back down the hill with a couple other friends playing in the dirt .
Suddenly , these 2 MPs came running our way chasing this guy for some reason .
One of them stopped and asked us where we lived and took us home .
I can remember then saying " One day I would like to be that guy . "
What are some of the strongest memories you have of your training period ?
There are a lot of memories I have from basic training .
My first really strong memory is the very first day I arrived to my basic training company ( Alpha Company 795 4th Platoon ) .
We all were placed in this cattle truck at the in - processing center to go to our company .
All we had was the uniform on our back and two duffel bags .
Once the doors on the cattle truck were shut you quickly knew who was in charge .
The drill sergeants were yelling " Get your face in your duffel bag " , as to say " Do n't look at me !
Look down ! "
I looked over to my right and noticed a guy opening his duffel bag and literally putting his head inside the duffel bag .
It was very hard not to laugh , but I restrained from doing so .
Once we arrived to the company area the doors on the truck came swinging open and there stood more drill sergeants screaming to get off the truck .
Having the two duffel bags we were instructed to put one duffel on the front of us and lay the second one horizontal on top of that duffel .
Once I did this -- me not being the tallest guy in the world - - I could not see where I was going .
I just knew I needed to move and move fast .
I started to run as fast as I possible could with the duffel bags to my area still not able to see where I was going , then all of a sudden I came to a halt .
I had ran into something or someone .
My top duffel bag feel to the ground and that is when I noticed I had ran into the back of a drill sergeant who was in the middle of yelling at someone else .
His attention quickly turned in my direction yelling " What the hell is wrong with you ?
What platoon are you going to , private ? "
I replied " 1st platoon , Drill Sergeant . "
" Not anymore you are ; you are coming to 4th platoon with me now , " he said .
This is when I totally realized I was no longer a civilian .
I was property of the United States Army .
What were your first assignments ?
Graduation day came in January of 2001 .
17 weeks of training were finally over .
It was now to time to move on to the real army .
I had been assigned to go to Fort Hood , Texas .
This day was a great time for me .
It was a day in which I realized I had finally transformed myself from a hard headed civilian into an American solider -- something my father had been and took so much pride in .
I took great pride and honor putting that uniform on , and knowing that I had accomplished something on my own .
Really for the first time in my life .
The funniest thing on graduation day the drill sergeant I had ran into the first day of basic training approached me and said : " Neely do n't think I forgot you ran into me the first day at the company .
That 's something I wo n't forget .
Take care , and good luck . "
This was the first and only thing he ever said about it and until that day I had just thought he forgot all about it .
Where were you on September 11 , 2001 ?
On September 11 , 2001 I was in Fort Hood , Texas , assigned to the 410th military police company .
I was getting dressed for the day after PT when someone came in my barracks room saying " Get over here and see the TV " .
When we got next door I saw the pictures of the planes crashing into the towers .
We did not know what was going on , so we hurried and finished getting dressed and went downstairs to the platoon office .
Once we arrived we were told to grab our Kevlar 's and our gear and grab our M4 rifles and M9 mm out of the armory , and that the United States was under attack by terrorists .
After gathering all my gear and weapons we were locked and load .
I was placed along with many other MPs at the East side entrance of Fort Hood , where we searched every vehicle and person coming onto post .
Once I found out that the United States had been attacked by terrorists I was ready for revenge .
I was angry .
I was ready to go to war .
Someone or something had attacked my country , and I believed people needed to be held responsible for this .
Even before 9/11 had happened my company was all ready to go to Egypt in late September for a training exercise know as Operation Bright Star .
Then , after the 9/11 attacks , rumors swirled around that we would be deployed somewhere else in the world .
But that did not happen we went on to Egypt as scheduled , from the end of September until the end of November .
Anything memorable about Operation Bright Star ?
What was your next assignment ?
Being in Egypt and being part of Operation Bright Star was actually very boring .
We returned back to Fort Hood a couple days before Thanksgiving of 2001 , and I went on leave for two short weeks .
When I returned to my unit I was placed on gate duty .
On January 5 , 2002 , around 0930 hrs or so , I was sleeping in my barracks room after having just got off work a couple hours before .
Then I was woke up by someone pounding on my door .
It was one of the squad leaders from my platoon .
He was informing me of a couple deployments that were coming down throughout the battalion .
He asked if I wanted to volunteer myself to go .
Being the high - spirited , motivated , soldier I was at the time , I said " Sure .
Why not ? "
And then I went back to my bed .
Later that night , since I was off , I went out with a couple buddies .
We were all at a local club just having a good ol ' time when my cell - phone rang .
It was my platoon sergeant telling me to get back to the company ASAP .
Once I arrived back to the platoon office I was told I had been selected to go to the 401st Military Police company and deploy .
I was to report there at 0700 hrs the next morning for more details .
At 0700 hrs the next day I reported like I was told , and was placed in 1st platoon .
Then I was told that we would be deploying to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , within the next 24hrs .
It was not until later that afternoon that we were told that we would be starting and running a detainee facility , not an EPW ( or Enemy Prisoner of War ) camp .
We were told that a detainee camp had never been ran before , and that this would be the first time in history this had taken place since these people would not fall under the Geneva Convention .
Later that night we were finally finished packing and loading all our stuff to deploy .
I called back home to tell my folks that I would be leaving in the morning and would not be back for at least 6 months .
I went and showered and just laid there that Saturday night , nervous and very anxious , wondering what I was getting myself into .
I just kept thinking about what we were told all day -- that we were going to come face to face with some of the worst people the world had to offer , and that these were the people who had attacked and killed so many people in our country .
Early the next morning , January 7 , 2002 , we had a good - bye formation and loaded up on the buses to the airstrip and boarded the plane to Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
It does n't seem you received a lot of training for your Guantanamo assignment .
Did you receive any training on the Geneva Conventions during your basic training ?
We did not receive any kind of special training for working at Guantanamo .
Nor did we receive any kind of real training on what would happen once we got there and the detainees starting arriving .
No one from the top down in the company knew what was really going on or what to expect .
At this time there was no standard operating procedure as we went out on a trial - and - error basis .
In basic we did receive training on EPWs , but it was more for setting up a hasty EPW camp .
Something you would put together really fast to hold some prisoners in a combat situation for a short time until you could get them moved to a more permanent place .
As far as the Geneva Conventions , we touched very shortly on that in training .
Most of what people knew about them was from their own readings .
Can you describe your arrival in Guantanamo ?
We arrived in Guantanamo early on the afternoon of January 7 , 2002 .
Coming from Texas in January it was quite cold , so everyone had their field jackets and their cold weather BDUs on .
Once we got off that plane I quickly realized I was not in Texas anymore .
It was warm .
Very warm from what I remember .
Here we were dressed for cold weather carrying all these weapons like we were going to a fight a war somewhere .
All the Navy guys who were stationed there and in charge on in - processing us just kind of chuckled .
We quickly turned our weapons in to the local armory where they would stay for the next 6 months .
Went through an in processing briefing filled out some paper work and boarded a ferry that would take us to the other side of Guantanamo .
Once on the other side we were boarded on a bunch of buses .
During the bus ride we drove right through the naval base .
I remember seeing all the post housing the BX ( or Base Exchange ) , McDonald 's , bowling alley , the gym .
I remember thinking " Man !
This is going to be a really nice deployment .
We have all we need .
But we kept driving further and further , until there was nothing around us anymore , and in the distance you could see all these tents lined up in a row .
We turned up going up the dirt road towards the tents .
Off to the left you could see sparks coming from this area where it looked like people were welding .
We got off the buses and formed a big line where we were issued one cot and one MRE ( or Meal Ready to Eat ) and told to find a tent .
After we got everything situated we were told right down the hill was the detainee camp we would be operating out of .
This was the same camp the Haitians were held out in the 90s .
The Navy Sea Bees were down in the camp welding more cages and fixing the old ones that had already been there .
I laid down that first night not knowing at all what to expect .
No one knew what really was going on .
How did you spend the rest of your time before the detainees arrived ?
The next day [ January 8 , 2002 ] brought us nothing .
We did not hear anything more .
We just sat around in our tents and sleep most of the day .
Later that night we were told the next morning we would be going down to Camp X - Ray for a walk - through and start some training with some Marines who were correctional officers for a couple days .
No one was allowed to leave or go to the main part of post where everything was .
Not even to shower or eat .
For the first week or so , when we showered , it was behind a wall with a water hose .
On January 9 we all got together and marched down to Camp X - Ray and walked around for a quick tour .
It was nothing like I had ever seen before .
The cells -- or cages as I call them - - were small .
" Something like you would put a dog in , " I thought .
And , on top of that , it was all outdoors .
Except for a small metal roof .
The whole camp was rocks .
No matter where you stepped you were stepping on rocks .
But , " Oh well , " I thought , " I was not going to be staying in there . "
We started our training with the Marine correctional officers .
We were broken down into groups as to what you would be doing inside the camp .
I was placed with the group that would be doing the guarding ( walking around the different blocks ) .
Since we were all MPs we were pretty well trained in handcuffing .
But we covered it anyways : how to properly handcuff ( hand restraints ) and leg shackles .
Over and over .
We went over escorting procedures .
Since they would be wearing a belt with cuffs we were to grab the back of the belt with one hand and , with the other hand , grab their arm .
Since escorting was a two - man job , one of the people escorting would force the detainees ' head down while we walked so he could not see where he was going .
Some of use also went through the five man internal reaction force training .
This team would be called upon supposedly when a detainee was out of control .
The Number 1 Man would have the shield .
Once the cage door was open he would go in and hit the detainee as hard as he could with the shield .
Number 2
Man would go in and gain control of the detainee 's left arm ; Number 3
Man would gain control of the right arm ; Number 4
Man would go for the left leg , and Number 5 Man would go for the right leg , take him down , and handcuff him .
This training went on for the next 2 days and , on January 10 , we were told that the first batch of detainees would be arriving sometime the next day , so we would be on standby the next day .
Again , not much in the way of training regarding the humane treatment of prisoners …
The training I mentioned was all we got .
It was nothing , really , that we had n't had before .
Except for the leg shackling and the IRFing .
As far as the Geneva Convention , we were told the reason we had to live in an old trash dump in tents was due to the fact we could only live one step above the detainees .
I did not understand this , as we were told on numerous occasions they did not fall under the Geneva Convention .
Did you get any briefing on who the soon - to - arrive prisoners were ?
The only thing I can recall being told about the detainees that would arrive was that they were captured fighting the Americans in Afghanistan .
And that they were known terrorists .
And that many of them helped in the planning of the 9/11 attacks .
We would be coming face - to - face with the worst people the world had to offer .
Our mission would be to guard these terrorists so the United States could get more info on attacks and , possibly , stop more terrorist attacks .
As to us , we talked a lot about the detainees before they arrived .
About them and what they had probably been involved in .
A lot of us , including myself , were pissed off , and many people were out to get revenge for the havoc the United States had been through in recent months by these people .
But , as the months went on , one or two of us would actually question what was going on here , the way the detainees were being treated and if they were actually terrorists or not , but being no -ones , and young , and dumb , we never questioned anything further ; just did our time until we went home .
A number of sources , including Standard Operating Procedures which are now public , mention pepper - spraying as part of IRFings .
Were you trained in the proper use of pepper - spray ?
I have seen many of the Standard Operating Procedures ( or SOPs ) that are now out , and many of them that were written only in late 2002 .
There was no SOP when we got there , and there was not an official one when I left in June of 2002 .
We were trained on pepper - spraying , but only for working patrol back at Fort Hood .
When I was at Camp X - Ray and for the couple months I was at Camp Delta , pepper - spray was never used .
Or even thought of .
Camp Delta SOPs also require IRF teams to give repeated verbal warnings to the detainee before engaging him physically .
As far as IRFing , when I was there , it went somewhat in this order : ( 1 ) The block guards would have a problem with a detainee ( not listening , maybe saying something , or not following rules ) .
The guards would then contact the duty officer for that shift .
We were told " If you were working a block and was having a problem with one of the detainees , and you could n't handle it , or get it under control , you should call the duty officer , " who was usually a E - 7 ( Sergeant First Class ) or a 0 - 1 or 0 - 2 ( First and Second LT ) .
They would come to the block , assess the situation , and make the decision whether to take " comfort items " away or call the IRF team into play .
If the latter , then ( 2 ) The duty officer would come to the block with an interpreter and tell the detainee to do whatever he was told to and , if not , the IRF team would be called upon .
( 3 ) Once the IRF team was called upon and arrived on the block there was no " I am sorry I will do it " from the detainee ; the IRF team was going to enter that cage and hog tie that detainee .
And what about minimal force ?
SOPs say IRFings have to use the minimal amount of force necessary .
And guards ' reports that have been released say they were conducted in this way as well .
On the other hand , you say that the Number 1 Man of the IRF team had to " hit the detainee as hard as he could with the shield " .
That does not seem consistent with minimal force …
All I can say to this question is I am sure a lot really has changed in the way the day - to - day activities take place .
Especially with regards to IRFing .
But at Camp X - Ray , especially before ICRC ( or International Committee of the Red Cross ) arrived , I heard many times the IRF team being told ( and telling each other before they went to get a detainee ) that it was their time to " get some , " which is to say inflict pain , get revenge .
But we were instructed that the Number 1 Man on the IRF team was to hit the detainees as hard as possible .
So January 11 , 2002 finally arrives .
This is the day the first batch of detainees would arrive .
What was the atmosphere like that day ?
On January 11 , 2002 everyone , including myself , was very nervous .
We did not know when or how many detainees would be arriving that day to Camp X - Ray .
I was on standby the whole day when , early that afternoon , we were told the first detainees would be arriving in a couple hours .
The people who were on this shift went ahead and went down to Camp X - Ray to wait and be told what our duties would be that day .
The duty officer called off names for people working all the blocks .
My name was not called .
Then , when the names were read for the people who would be doing the escorting that day I was called and paired with a buddy that had come over to the 410th MP company with me from the 401st .
We were glad to be paired with one another .
At least we were familiar with each other ; at this time most of the people in the company were all new faces .
After waiting a couple hours we got the call that the detainees were at the air strip and being loaded up to bring to the camp .
I started getting really nervous ; almost scared .
I keep thinking " Here it comes ; I am fixing to see what a terrorist looks like face - to - face . "
I remember my escort partner saying over and over " I got your back , man , if anything happens . "
I could tell he was as nervous as I was .
Everyone in the camp that day was nervous and scared ; you could literally hear a pin drop moments before that bus full of detainees arrived .
Describe the arrival of the bus transporting the detainees .
Marine humvees with .50 caliber guns mounted on them led the bus to the camp .
The sally port gates were open , and the bus pulled in just feet within the main gate , right next to the temporary holding pen in which they would be until they were taken , first for in - processing , and then to their cages .
The bus doors opened , the escort teams were lined up right next to the bus to take the detainees off the bus and put them in the holding area .
You could hear the Marines screaming at them " Shut the fuck up !
You 're property of the United States of America now . "
We were not allowed to step onto the bus .
The Marines would push them towards us down the bus stairs and we would catch them .
The first person who got off the bus , I will never forget .
It was a man with one leg .
He was later called Stumpy by everyone .
I do n't know his name , but he was around 5 ' 7 and at least 250 lbs .
He was the biggest guy we had for a long time .
Grabbed by the escorting MPs , Stumpy was jumping on one leg , MPs screaming at him to walk faster towards the holding area when , from inside the bus , someone threw his prosthetic leg out onto the ground .
Myself and my partner were next .
The second detainee came off the bus .
We grabbed him like we were trained and took him into the holding area , yelling at him to get on his knees and to shut up .
Also in this bunch of detainees was an Australian .
We were told he was a mercenary who was caught fighting against the Americans in Afghanistan .
His name was David Hicks .
Throughout the months I would talk to him plenty of times and hear his story , along with many others , including that of Feroz Ali Abbasi .
He was British and was held on Bravo Block along with David Hicks .
This went on until all the detainees were taken off the bus and placed in the holding area .
What did the detainees have on as they came off the bus ?
The prisoners arrived in orange suits .
Some had orange ski caps .
They had goggles on their eyes , earmuffs on their ears , surgical masks on their faces , and black gloves on their arms .
They were handcuffed and leg - shackled .
They had chains around their waists with a padlock on the back .
The handcuffs were attached to the waist chain .
How did the in - processing take place ?
After all the detainees were in the holding pen , half of the teams would take them out of the holding pen and bring them into the tent to be in - processed .
One by one the detainees were taken from the holding area to the back side of the camp , where in - processing happened very quickly .
Ear muffs , goggles and masks were taken off , their pictures were taken , and ID bracelets were made and placed on their wrists .
Then the goggles and the surgical mask were placed back on until they got to their cages .
Meanwhile , the other half of the escort teams , including my own , had gone to the back side of the camp and waited on the outside of the tent for the detainees to come out after being in - processed and be taken to their cages .
How were the detainees taken to their cages ?
After being in - processed we escorted the detainees to the various blocks .
We would take them to their assigned blocks , walking at a very fast pace .
If they could n't keep up with our pace or attempt to fall we would yell , scream , and carry them to their cages .
We were told one would go to Alpha block , next one would go to Bravo block and so on .
We were spreading them all out since there was very few of them .
Once in the cages they were placed on their knees .
One MP would remove the goggles , throw them outside the cage , kneel down , remove the leg irons , and throw them outside .
Then the person in charge of the block would unlock the padlock that was on the waist chains and then their handcuffs would be removed .
After one hand was removed from the cuffs the detainee was told through an interpreter to place his hand on top of his head and not move .
Once everything was removed , one MP would back out of the cage ; the other one would still have control and then slowly back out , always keeping eyes on the detainee .
Then the cage would be closed and locked .
The interpreters would then tell the detainees what items were in their cages .
They were given 2 buckets ( one for water and one to use as a toilet ) , a green army mat , a small tooth brush , and a sheet .
From what I can remember , they were also told not to move and no talking was allowed .
Did any of the detainees arrive with serious injuries ?
Later that day , after my shift was over , the detainees would be taken out of their cages and go through some sort of physical examination , as many of them arriving had injuries .
I do n't necessarily remember the injuries of the detainees of the first group , but many of them came with injuries such as gunshot wounds , broken arms , legs .
One injury that sticks out in my mind was on a very slight , malnourished detainee , who had been grazed by a .50 caliber fighting the Americans in Afghanistan ( supposedly ) .
He arrived with the first or the second batch of detainees .
When he arrived , his right arm was in a sling .
I took him to medical a couple times throughout my time at Camp X - Ray .
I will try to explain his injury as best as I can .
Take your arm and fold it like it was in a sling against your chest .
The hole was in his bicep area .
Due to the fact his arm was in a sling , and in that position so long , the muscle had attached to his forearm somewhat , and he would go to medical so they could stretch it out .
It was a very painful time every time he went .
How did your day end ?
After we got off that day it was late .
No one really spoke much .
I went back to my tent and laid down to go to sleep .
I was thinking " those were the worst people the world had to offer ?
Not what I expected . "
I guess I was expecting people who looked like monsters or what - not .
So much hap - pened on that very first day …
A lot of it is a blur …
But more de- tainees would be coming the next day .
We had to get up early and head to camp .
Here is a pic- ture of the holding area that I found on the net .
This picture was taken the very first day .
To your right of the detainees are the out - door cages of Alpha Block .
If you look closely you will see a solider that is actually standing in one of the cages on Alpha block .
To the left , past the soldiers standing there , are the cages of Bravo Block .
In the back , to your left , with the people on the roof , is the makeshift hospital .
Directly behind Bravo Block would stand the future Delta Block .
At this time there were tents there to in - process the detainees .
[ At this point in the interview , Mr. Neely volunteered the following , unprompted statement ]
Even though I reached out to talk to you about Guantánamo and wanting to tell what it was really like inside the camp at the beginning when I was there , I am not a totally innocent person as far as what happened inside the wire .
I am very ashamed to admit it and tell you that I was involved in the very first IRFing incident at Camp X - Ray .
I left it out of what happened on Day 1 , and I apologize for that .
It 's just something that I am very ashamed of .
Here is what happened .
On the first day we had been taking detainees from the in - processing center to their cages for quite a while when myself and the guy that was my escorting partner grabbed the next detainee to be taken .
He was an older man .
Probably in his mid to late 50s - - short and kind of a husky build .
I remember grabbing him and then starting to walk first through the rocks and then through the sally port ( a long walk way with gates on both sides ) heading towards Alpha Block .
Then I noticed he was really tense , shaking really bad , and not wanting to walk or move without being forced to do so .
We made our way to Alpha Block to the cage he would be placed in .
He was instructed to go to his knees , which he did .
My partner then went down and took off his leg shackles .
I still had control of his upper body , and I could still feel him tensing up .
Once the shackles were off my partner started to take off the hand cuffs .
The detainee got really tense and started to pull away .
We yelled at him a couple times " Stop moving ! "
Over and over .
Then he stopped moving , and when my partner went to put the key in that first handcuff , the detainee jerked hard to the left towards me .
Before I knew it , I threw the detainee to the ground and was on top of him holding his face to the cement floor .
At this time my partner had left the cage .
The block NCOIC ( or Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge ) was on the radio yelling code red which meant emergency on the block .
Before I knew , I was being grabbed from behind and pulled out of the cage by the IRF team .
They grabbed this man and hog - tied him .
He laid there like that for hours that day before he was released from that position .
A couple days later I found out from a detainee who was on that block that the older detainee was just scared and that when we placed him on his knees he thought he was going to be executed .
He then went on to tell me that this man had seen some of his friends and family members executed on their knees .
I can remember guys coming up to me after it was over that night and said " Man , that was a good job ; you got you some " .
I did not feel good about what I did .
It felt wrong .
This man was old enough to be my father , and I had just beaten up on him .
I still to this day do n't know who was more scared before and during this incident me or the detainee .
I remember seeing him the next day when I walked into camp .
His face was all bruised and scraped up .
I was young and did n't question anything back then .
As I do nowadays .
But even then , when I was as pissed off as anyone there , I felt ashamed of what I did .
As the years have went on and the more I learn the more guilt I feel .
This is one of the incidents from my time at Guantanamo that haunts me .
I am in no position to judge you , and I will not dare to do so .
All I can say is that it is well known that good people can do evil things in evil environments ( what psychologists call the Lucifer Effect ) .
Or when people in authority order them to do so ( the Stanford Obedience Experiment ) .
You were in both situations .
In any event , if you are OK with it , I have a couple of questions about this incident .
I am fine with this being part of my testimony .
I want it to be told no matter how it makes me look .
I believe it 's very important people know what happened there .
I am sure there were ( and are ) a lot of detainees in Guantanamo that are guilty of something .
But , on the other hand , there are a lot that are not guilty of nothing at all other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
And no one , guilty or innocent , should be treated in the manner they have been .
I appreciate that very much .
Would you say this was the first IRFing incident in Guantanamo ?
I really do n't see this as the first IRF incident as much .
When my partner put out the Code Red on the radio , anyone and everyone would respond .
It just so happened that most of the IRF team was right outside Alpha Block at this time .
Got it .
It is still not clear to me , though , how the detainee got the scrapes and bruises on his face .
You say you were holding his head against the cement floor , but this does not cause scrapes and bruises in and of itself .
I had a hold of the detainee 's left arm , with my left hand grabbing around the bicep area and had my right hand grabbing the back on his shirt .
When he pulled away I just pushed or slammed him forward , with his face hitting the cement and me going on top of him .
I did not strike him with an open or closed fist .
He was moving his head and this is why I was holding is head to the ground .
When I was pulled out of the cage and the members of the IRF team were hog- tying him I could not see if any one of them were striking him , as they were all on top of him .
I just know that his face was scraped and bruised , and I am sure the initial hit to the pavement caused some if not all those marks .
Any incidents of abuse soon after the arrival of detainees ?
There are a couple things that I remember seeing first - hand that come to my mind and that I believe were totally unjust and just plain abuse .
I am not sure of the dates or times when they occurred , but it was n't too long into the beginning of Camp X - Ray .
One night I was assigned to Charlie Block as a block guard .
The medic was handing medication out on the block .
He made his way over to one detainee on the block and instructed him to drink a can of Ensure ( a lot of detainees were given this since they were underweight and malnourished ) .
The detainee refused to take the Ensure .
The medic told him multiple times to take it and the detainee still refused .
The medic then went and told the block NCOIC of the situation .
The block NCOIC then went to the detainee and gave him the same instructions to take the can of Ensure .
Once again the detainee refused to follow these orders .
Next the on duty OIC ( or Officer in Charge ) was notified of the situation .
The OIC then made his way to the block where a discussion went on about the situation and the conclusion was that the detainee could not refuse any medications at all .
The camp OIC then went over to the detainee and gave him the same instruction to drink the Ensure or , if he refused , he would be forced to take it .
Once again he refused to drink it .
The call was made on the radio for the IRF team .
The IRF team entered the block where they were met by the OIC and the medic .
They were told of the situation and advised once they entered the cell they were to restraint the detainee so the medic could give him the can of Ensure .
The IRF team then started to approach the cage the detainee was in .
Since I was on the block I walked on the other side of the cage so I could watch what was going on .
Once the IRF team was lined up and got in position to enter the cell the OIC unlocked the lock and pulled it off and opened the cage door .
The detainee just stood there , facing the IRF team .
BOOM !
the Number One Man hit the detainee with shield causing him to fall to the cement floor of the cage .
Quickly the whole team was on top of the detainee .
I could not see exactly what they were doing .
They stood him up and hand - cuffed him to fence in the cage .
The person who had the shield held the detainee 's head so he could not move .
The medic then entered the cage with the can of Ensure .
Once he entered the cage he looked up and saw me .
He then motioned for me to move over to my left ( his right ) .
So I moved over .
I did not think anything about it .
He then opened the Ensure can , grabbed the detainee by the neck , and started to pour it down his throat .
The detainee was attempting to move his head , and he would n't swallow any of it .
The Ensure just ran down his face all over him .
The medic looked up one quick time and punched the detainee twice on the left side of his face with his right fist .
The medic then just turned around and walked out of the cage like nothing happened .
The detainee was then un-handcuffed from the cage and laid down on the cement in the cage .
He was then hog -tied .
He laid in this position for a couple hours .
When the whole incident was over I turned around and noticed the guard tower where the Marines were stationed watching over and realized that the medic had placed me in front of the view of the tower and I had not even realized it .
I later learned through other detainees on the block the reason the man refused the Ensure was that he thought he was being poisoned .
That was a ghastly incident …
One day , while on duty at Camp X - Ray , I was assigned to escorting duties .
I was at the very back of the camp .
There was like a big shed there .
This was also where the IRF team was stationed at until called upon .
On this day the call came for the IRF team to come to Bravo Block .
They made their way to the block and , at the time , I was not doing anything , so I made my way down to the block to watch from the outside of the block .
The situation on the block was that a detainee had called a female MP " bitch " a couple times .
For punishment , the IRF team was called upon to enter the cage and hog - tie the detainee .
The female MP was very upset , yelling " Whip his ass ! "
The IRF team , along with the camp OIC , approached the detainee 's cage and told him to stop yelling and lay down so he could be restrained .
The detainee just stood there , staring at them .
The IRF team lined up in position to enter the cage .
The OIC unlocked the lock on the cage door and , when this was done , the detainee turned around , went to his knees and placed his hands on the top of his head .
The lock was taken off and the cage door was opened .
The Number One Man on the IRF team tossed his shield to the side and , with a quick run towards the detainee , hopped in the air and came down on the back of the detainee with his knee ( the Number One guy on the IRF team was no small guy ) .
This caused the detainee to fall to the cement floor of the cage with the Number One Man on top of him .
Then the whole IRF team was on top of him hitting , punching , and kicking him .
It seemed like a long time , but in reality it lasted 15 - 20 seconds .
While the IRF team was still on top of the detainee someone yelled for the female MP that was called a bitch .
She entered the cage and she punched the detainee a couple times in the head and then left the cage .
Everyone in the cage stood up and the detainee laid there cuffed - up but motionless and unresponsive .
Next thing I saw were medics coming from the medical house with a stretcher .
They left the block with the detainee on the stretcher ; they took him to a waiting military ambulance and was transported to the main hospital .
The IRF team would ride along with the detainee .
I went back to work not fully knowing what was wrong or what happened to the detainee .
Later that night , after we had been off for a while , the IRF team came back from the hospital .
They would go on and talk about how they hit and punched the detainee and how they held him down so the female MP could hit him a couple times .
They went on to talk about the ambulance ride saying no one spoke and it was a very silent ride .
One of them even stated the detainee went into cardiac arrest in the ambulance .
I do not know if this statement is true or not .
I know the camp OIC of this incident would joke many times about how he never heard his name and " war crimes " in the same sentence so many times in his life .
Eventually the detainee would return back to the camp from the hospital .
About a week or so later I was assigned to work Bravo Block , and the block NCOIC happened to be a member of the IRF team .
He was the Number One Man of the day of this incident .
When the NCOIC walked onto the block a detainee named Feroz Abbasi yelled " Sergeant , have you come back to finish him off ? "
1
You say someone was using the camp OIC 's name in the same sentence as the phrase war crimes .
Who was that ?
Was the camp OIC being reprimanded ?
I do not know for sure who was telling him that .
I would figure it would have been the Colonel who was in charge .
After this day you never heard anything more about it .
No one was reprimanded for what happened .
Were these IRFings filmed ?
When an IRFing took place a camera was supposed to be present to capture the IRFing .
Every time I witnessed an IRFing a camera was present , but one of two things would happen : ( 1 ) the camera would never be turned on , or ( 2 ) the camera would be on , but pointed straight at the ground .
In the incident on Bravo Block I spoke about I found out through talking to people and hearing them joke that the video of the incident was destroyed .
Do you remember other IRFing incidents ?
When new detainees arrived to the camp , a detainee on Alpha Block began to yell so loudly that you could hear him all over camp .
Every time we would take a new detainee to Alpha Block he would get even louder .
Eventually , the IRF team was called in to restrain this detainee .
You could always tell when someone got IRFed , as the detainees throughout the camp would start chanting and screaming .
So I could tell when the detainee on Alpha Block was IRFed that day .
By the time the IRF team was coming off the block and I was walking back towards Alpha Block I noticed a couple of the guys had blood on their arms , hands , and uniforms .
They were washing their hands with water .
The detainee was escorted off the block to medical , where he was given stitches for multiple lacerations to his head .
Later that day I came back on the block and saw the cage this detainee was IRFed in .
The cement floor was a dull red color from the blood .
You could tell at one point before it was washed out that there was a lot of blood on the floor of that cage .
How often did IRFings take place ?
From what I recall , IRFings did n't happen all that often .
Especially once the ICRC came to the camp .
There were other IRFings , but nothing like these I have mentioned .
These are probably the most brutal that I can remember from when I was there .
But I am only talking about the times I was on camp grounds .
I am sure IRFings happened on other shifts .
Everything in the Camp changed once the ICRC showed up .
At first detainees were not allowed to talk or get up and walk around inside their cages .
They were not even allowed to cover themselves up when they used the bathroom in their buckets .
They were told to sit in the middle of the cage unless told otherwise or face punishment .
They did not even know where they were at .
They would ask and we would just lie to them and tell them they were in Russia or some other place .
Many times they would ask about what happened to their country , and many of the soldiers including myself at times would tell them their country was destroyed by a nuclear bomb .
Once the ICRC came they were told where they were at , allowed to talk , allowed to get up and walk around .
The chain of command was really careful when the ICRC was around .
Anything you want to add about IRFings ?
I do n't believe the IRF team was used for the right reasons at all .
At least the people on the team used it for the wrong reasons .
It was their way to beat up on someone who was smaller and weaker than them .
I have often wondered why you would need 5 healthy , grown men , in riot gear , to go take a down a detainee who was most likely underweight and very weak .
Continuing on the subject of physical abuse , there is a lot of testimony about shackles being placed needlessly tight .
So much so that this might qualify as a form of binding torture .
And shackling in such uncomfortable positions that this could count as positional torture …
I do know that shackles were put on very tight in some cases , really depending on who put them on .
You are taught to leave enough room for a finger to go between the cuff and the part you cuff up .
I know many detainees , when they arrived , were bleeding or had bruises from the handcuffs or leg shackles .
And some could not even walk -- the leg shackles were so tight .
Yes : some soldiers did place the cuffs and leg shackles overly tight .
On the blocks detainees would be hog -tied for punishment and left that way for hours .
Sometimes 2 hours , sometimes 4 hours , all depending on when they felt like releasing them from that position , as the call to release them came from the OIC .
Did you witness waterboarding ( allegedly known as " drown - proofing " in Guantánamo ) ?
I did not witness any waterboarding or drown - proofing .
I did not even hear anyone speak about it during my time at Guantánamo .
This could be due to the fact that we did not interact with the people doing the interrogations , and we did not even escort the detainees to interrogations .
Another military police company from Fort Stewart would come and take the detainees to the interrogation rooms .
What about medical abuse ?
I know that detainees could not refuse medication or it would be forced upon them as I stated in previous incidents .
The detainees knew they would be IRFed if they refused , so many of them just took the medications so they would not be IRFed .
And I know this since I was told tis many times from some of the detainees there .
I talked about the detainee who came to Camp X - Ray wounded from a .50 caliber .
His bicep had attached to his forearm due to the fact his arm was in the sling for so long .
I escorted this detainee to medical a couple times for physical therapy as he could not bend his arm down at all .
On one occasion , when I escorted him there the medic began to massage the area that was attached and he kept rubbing harder and harder to the point the detainee started to cry and squirm all over the bed .
The medic stopped massaging and started to stretch the detainee 's arm down a little at a time .
You could tell this was very painful and uncomfortable for him .
The medic said " You really want to watch him scream . "
Then he stretched the arm all the way down until it was straight out on the bed .
The detainee started screaming loud and crying .
The medic finally put his arm back up and did it again .
And then he said he was finished with the physical therapy .
The whole time the medic just laughed at what he was doing .
We then escorted the detainee back to his cage .
I witnessed the " physical therapy " sessions a couple of times , and never had it went the way I described it above .
Usually they would just massage the area for a bit , then stretch the arm a little bit just to the point it got uncomfortable to him .
But the medic that did this therapy was not the same one that I saw before .
Did you witness forced feedings ?
I did not witness any forced feedings other than the one I described [ see the Ensure incident ] .
But it was done especially during a hunger strike .
After so many days they would be escorted to medical and fed through a tube or put on a IV .
I know this from talking to people who would talk about it .
And during a hunger strike the medics would always say if they do n't [ eat ] after -- 30 days I believe it was -- they would just force - feed them .
I am not totally sure of the time frame for forced feedings , but I remember hearing 30 days somewhere in there .
I do n't .
At least that I witnessed .
At Camp X - Ray we had a medical facility , but it was more a clinic than anything .
If a detainee had anything serious , or surgery , they would be taken to the Hospital , and I never worked there as far as guarding detainees .
I have no knowledge of any drugging that may had happened at the camp .
You have described now four incidents of abuse by medical personnel ( two " rectal exams , " one session of " physical therapy , " and one incident of punching a detainee after a failed attempt at forced feeding ) .
Was the same individual involved in all four ?
The physical therapy exam and the punching were done by completely different male medics .
The two " rectal exams " were done by the same Navy doctor ( all the rectal exams were done by Navy doctors stationed there ) .
So there were three different individuals involved ; two medics and one doctor .
I am surprised there were hunger strikes that early .
Yes , there were hunger strikes in the early days .
Some detainees started out on hunger strike .
I believe it was early February when , on Charlie Block , a Koran was thrown to the floor during a cell search .
This caused the whole camp to go in a massive uproar , screaming and yelling to the point all MPs came out of the blocks .
Due to this incident most of the detainees went on hunger strike .
I remember some of the detainees being so weak they could not move and every hour or so if I was on assigned to a block I would try and get a response out of them as some of them were so weak that they looked as if they were dead .
Was this the first hunger strike at Guantánamo ?
This was the first hunger strike that happened at Camp X - Ray .
There were maybe one or two detainees who would not eat , but that would n't last very long .
When the incident with the Koran happened , the whole camp pretty much went on a hunger strike that lasted a week or so .
What ended the hungry strike was the Marine General who was over the camp at a time brought all the detainee block leaders to meet with him .
I am not sure what was said either way as I was not present for this discussion .
All I know is later that day the detainees began to eat once again .
The detainees were fed 3 times a day .
For the first week or so detainees were given MREs ( or meals ready to eat ) .
We would strip the MREs of everything other then the main meal .
Stuff we would take out was like matches , coffee , gum and anything else that was considered extra .
After a week or so of MREs 3 times a day , hot chow started to come twice a day from the Navy chow hall .
Also pork MREs were not to be given out for obvious reasons , but I do know that some guards handed them out and laughed if a detainee was to eat it .
When a detainee or detainees were on hunger strike , nothing really changed .
We would still make an attempt to feed the detainees .
If they refused , we just left them alone and noted it in the block log .
Each block and the command post had a green notebook that was used to document all activities on the block and camp .
This was to hold information like who was working the block and when and who relieved you on duty , when the detainees were fed or showered , who left the block and to where , and when the buckets of human waste were emptied .
You say the Koran was thrown to the floor .
That suggests it was done intentionally …
When the incident happened with the Koran I was on Alpha Block working that day .
All of a sudden detainees started to yell and chant , and it spread around the camp in a second .
Next thing I know , detainees were throwing their mats out of the cage .
Some were throwing their water out of their bucket out of the cage .
Everyone was going off .
Then we heard that on Charlie Block , during cell search , a guard had thrown the Koran to the ground , and that was the cause of this .
Well , the guard that threw the Koran to the ground was a really good friend of mine , and the same MP I escorted with on the first day the detainees arrived .
I talked to him that night about what happened .
He swears he did n't throw the Koran to the ground being hateful .
He told me he was just doing a cell search -- as was to be done every time a detainee left the cage .
We were told to search the Korans and that 's what he did .
And he said that , before thinking about it , he tossed it to the side , hitting the ground .
And that 's when all hell broke loose in the camp .
He was very upset about the whole thing .
He was really worried something would happen to him as far as disciplinary [ action ] through the chain of command , mainly due to the fact the Colonel had stated he wanted that soldier who was responsible for this to be punished .
But he never was and , after a while , it was all forgotten about .
You say that pork was given to a detainee -- without warning him and knowing that this violated religious rules .
Did you witness other forms of religious abuse ?
Disrespecting the call to prayer or the prayer proper ?
The Koran being kicked or thrown into the waste bucket ?
Yes there was loud rock music that was played throughout the camp .
Especially in the early days of X - Ray .
Over time this seemed to stop , but the National Anthem was played every morning at 0630 .
Muslim calls to prayer were broadcast after the first week of Camp X - Ray .
During call to prayer many times soldiers would mock and laugh at the detainees .
Many would also try to sing along to the call for prayer trying to be funny .
I also know that sometimes , during call for prayer , water would be given out to the detainees in their bucket , and some would spray the detainees with water during prayer , then stating it was an accident .
I did not hear ( or know ) of any dropping Korans in the waste bucket .
Or kicking it .
I do not recall any more religion abuse other then what I have already stated .
I remember just talking to some detainees and them telling me that , since they had nothing else to do , that they were studying their religion more and reading the Koran to better understand their religion .
I remember thinking I could n't believe how dedicated these people were to their religion ; always reading the Koran , always praying .
I actually admired them for this , as you do n't see a lot of people take religion so seriously .
Did you witness sexual abuse ?
The in - processing changed a bit , especially once Delta block was finished .
The detainees were still taken off the bus and placed in the holding pin , but instead of walking way to the back of the camp , directly across the holding area was an open spot of the camp where a big tent was put up .
And this became the new in - processing area .
Now , when they were taken out of the holding area , the escort team would take them to this tent where they would go through the same in - processing , except now there was a doctor who would check their rectum area ( we were told the rectal exam was to check for any kind of weapons that could be hidden there ; we were told that , in Afghanistan , a grenade had been found in the rectum of a detainee ) .
So an escorting MP would pull the detainee 's pants down and the doctor would instruct the detainee to lean over the table .
Then , with a surgical glove on his hand , the doctor shoved his finger in the rectum of the detainee .
Both times I witnessed this I never once saw any kind of lubrication used ; they did not use the lube that was on the table to perform this .
This exam was not done in any gentle manner whatsoever .
It seemed to me that the doctor just reached back and shoved his finger as hard as he could in the rectum of the detainee .
I witnessed this twice with my own eyes ( at this time I was working blocks more ) .
But I heard it talked about many times from other soldiers .
Even when I was not witness to these exams , but was still within earshot of the tent they were performed in , I could hear the detainees scream and cry out during the exam .
I even remember one detainee coming out of the tent after this looking like he was in tears .
I know through talking with other people who witnessed this that the doctor would make little smart comments before he did the exam like " this wo n't hurt ; it will only take a minute , " in a very sarcastic manner .
And that sometimes the doctor would even be laughing .
Also , each detainee was searched when he left his cage and when he returned to his cage .
In the process of searching or patting - down the detainee we were taught a technique which we called the " credit card swipe " .
You would take your hand put all your fingers straight together and go straight up the backside of a person .
If this was done the correct way just a quick swipe it really was no big deal , but some people took it to the extreme , and would do it so hard -- in effect just hitting the detainee in the private area to cause pain .
[ On April 6 , 2009 , Specialist Neely contacted us to comment on this image ( which he saw in a National Geographic special televised the night before ) .
The image depicts the tent where the " rectal exams " were given to the detainees during their in - processing .
As shown in this picture , an escort team would take a detainee ( the one pictured here is covered only by a white towel ) into the tent through the open flap seen to the left .
The guards to the right of the detainee are part of an IRF team .
To their right is a wall and , behind it , the showers .

A genocide is engulfing the people of Gaza while a silence engulfs its bystanders .
" Some 1.4 million people , mostly children , are piled up in one of the most densely populated regions of the world , with no freedom of movement , no place to run and no space to hide , " wrote the former senior UN relief official Jan Egeland and Jan Eliasson , then foreign minister of Sweden , in Le Figaro .
They described a people " living in a cage " , cut off by land , sea and air , with no reliable power and little water , and tortured by hunger and disease and incessant attacks by Israeli troops and planes .
Egeland and Eliasson wrote this four months ago in an attempt to break the silence in Europe , whose obedient alliance with the United States and Israel has sought to reverse the democratic result that brought Hamas to power in last year 's Palestinian elections .
The horror in Gaza has since been compounded : a family of 18 has died beneath a 500 lb US / Israeli bomb ; unarmed women have been mown down at point - blank range .
Dr David Halpin , one of the few Britons to break what he calls " this medieval siege " , reported the killing of 57 children by artillery , rockets and small arms and was shown evidence that civilians are Israel 's true targets , as in Leba non last summer .
A friend in Gaza , Dr Mona el - Farra , emailed : " I see the effects of the relentless sonic booms [ a collective punishment by the Israeli air force ] and artillery on my 13 - year - old daughter .
At night , she shivers with fear .
Then both of us end up crouching on the floor .
I try to make her feel safe , but when the bombs sound I flinch and scream . . . "
When I was last in Gaza , Dr Khalid Dahlan , a psychiatrist , showed me the results of a remarkable survey .
" The statistic I personally find unbearable , " he said , " is that 99.4 per cent of the children we studied suffer trauma .
Once you look at the rates of exposure to trauma you see why : 99.2 per cent of their homes were bombarded ; 97.5 per cent were exposed to tear gas ; 96.6 per cent witnessed shootings ; 95.8 per cent witnessed bombardment and funerals ; almost a quarter saw family members injured or killed . "
Dahlan invited me to sit in on one of his clinics .
There were 30 children , all of them traumatised .
He gave each a pencil and paper and asked them to draw .
They drew pictures of grotesque acts of terror and of women streaming tears .
The excuse for the latest Israeli terror was the capture last June of an Israeli soldier , a member of an illegal occupation , by the Palestinian resistance .
This was news .
The kidnapping by Israel a few days earlier of two Palestinians - two of thousands taken over the years - was not news .
A historian and two foreign journalists have reported the truth about Gaza .
All three are Israeli .
They are frequently called traitors .
The historian Ilan Pappe has documented that " the genocidal policy [ in Gaza ] is not formulated in a vacuum " but part of Zionism 's deliberate , historic ethnic cleansing .
Gideon Levy and Amira Hass are reporters on the Israeli newspaper Haaretz .
In November , Levy described how the people of Gaza were beginning to starve to death : " There are thousands of wounded , disabled and shell - shocked people , unable to receive any treatment . . .
The shadows of human beings roam the ruins . . .
They only know the [ Israeli army ] will return and they know what this will mean for them : more imprisonment in their homes for weeks , more death and destruction in monstrous proportions . "
Hass , who has lived in Gaza , describes it as a prison that shames her people .
She recalls how her mother , Hannah , was marched from a cattle - train to the Nazi concentration camp at Bergen - Belsen on a summer 's day in 1944 .
" [ She ] saw these German women looking at the pris oners , just looking , " she wrote .
" This image became very formative in my upbringing , this despicable ' looking from the side ' . "
" Looking from the side " is what those of us do who are cowed into silence by the threat of being called anti-Semitic .
Looking from the side is what too many western Jews do , while those Jews who honour the humane traditions of Judaism and say , " Not in our name ! " are abused as " self - despising " .
Looking from the side is what almost the entire US Congress does , in thrall to or intimidated by a vicious Zionist " lobby " .
Looking from the side is what " even- handed " journalists do as they excuse the lawlessness that is the source of Israeli atrocities and suppress the historic shifts in the Palestinian resistance , such as the implicit recognition of Israel by Hamas .
The people of Gaza cry out for better .

An employee of search engine startup Mahalo has been sentenced to four years in prison for infecting as many as 250,000 computers with malicious botnet computer code .
John Schiefer was sentenced Wednesday in federal court after previously pleading guilty to hacking , fraud and wiretapping charges .
He was arrested in 2007 as part of a large U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation enforcement action against botnet makers , called Operation Bot Roast II .
The case marks the first time that someone has been charged with operating a botnet under federal wiretapping laws .
Schiefer could have been sentenced to as much as five years in prison on the charges .
When they hired him , Mahalo executives did n't know about his criminal activities .
In a blog posting , Mahalo founder Jason Calacanis said company CTO Mark Jeffrey had " screwed up by not doing a simple Google search on John 's name , " but he stood by his employee , saying there is a fine line between hackers " who put one foot over the line " and commit minor indiscretions , and others like Schiefer , who " race past it . "
" I consider myself a fairly decent judge of character , and after spending months with John , I 'm convinced he was an angry stupid kid when he launched his botnet attack ( which did .000000001 % of the damage it could have ) , " Calacanis wrote .
" Now he 's an adult who just wants to make a decent living , spend time with his significant other and breathe the clean air off the Pacific Ocean by our offices in Santa Monica . "
" When he comes out , I hope to be able to offer him a job and that we can work together again , " Calacanis said .
Schiefer built his botnet army while a consultant at 3G Communications , a small Los Angeles telecommunications company .
The network , built with the help of two accomplices , was used to snoop in on Internet traffic between victims ' computers and financial institutions such as PayPal , prosecutors said .
Schiefer would then make purchases or simply drain his victims ' bank accounts .
He used several partners in the scheme -- some of them minors whom he " bullied ... into participating in the crimes , " prosecutors said in the suit , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California .
When a minor named Adam expressed reservations about claiming stolen money from PayPal , Schiefer told Adam to " quit being a bitch and claim it , " the filing states .
Online , Schiefer was known as Acidstorm .
His MSN Messenger handle also included the tagline , " Remember the name or feel the pain . "
In another scam , a Dutch online marketing company called Simpel Internet paid him more than US $ 19,000 for installing the company 's TopConverting adware on PCs , which he did without the consent of his victims .
As part of his plea agreement , Schiefer will pay $ 20,000 in restitution to Simpel Internet and the financial institutions he defrauded .
He also used the botnet to launch distributed denial of service ( DDOS ) attacks , and in an interview with the FBI he claimed to have knocked the Los Angeles Times '
Web site offline , prosecutors said .
According to an FBI affidavit filed in the case , Schiefer also accessed computers at an unnamed 3G Communications client without authorization .
Schiefer seemed happy with the money he was making from his scams .
According to evidence entered into court , another one of his instant messaging signatures read : " Crime pays , and it also has an excellent benefits package . "
Schiefer hopes to seek future employment in the information security field , prosecutors said .
In recent years , the medical community has been experimenting with what you might call targeted , direct interventions with the brain .
Things like drugs will affect any nerve cells that express the protein they interact with , but biology has identified a number of areas of the brain that are associated with specific functions or diseases , and medical researchers are starting to try to manipulate their electrical activity .
Later this week , the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science will publish a paper that describes how stimulating the primary motor cortex can help people learn to perform a challenging task involving fine muscle control .
There are a number of ways of performing electrical brain stimulation .
In the case of deep brain stimulation , surgeons implant electrodes directly into specific areas of the brain , allowing currents to be sent directly to the relevant cells .
This sort of invasive procedure is currently only being tested on crippling diseases such as Parkinson's .
Another approach is called transcranial magnetic stimulation , which uses fluctuating magnetic fields to actually trigger the firing of neurons in specific areas of the brain .
Since this is far less invasive , it 's being tested on a broader range of medical conditions .
The new paper involves an approach that 's a step down from those , called transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) .
In this case , electrodes attached to the person 's head run a current directly through the brain ; the location of the electrodes can target the current to specific areas of the brain .
At the cellular level , these currents are extremely weak , but they 're thought to reduce the voltage barrier needed for a nerve to fire , essentially enhancing normal activity .
Depending on the area of the brain targeted and whether that 's closer to the anode or cathode , tDCS has been observed inducing a variety of effects .
The new paper targets an area of the brain known as the primary motor cortex , which helps control muscle movements .
The authors focused on a learning task , one they describe as similar in principle to the process we go through when we learn a new sport .
Subjects were given a device that measured the pressure applied between the thumb and forefinger , and asked to use it to maneuver a cursor through an on - screen obstacle course .
One group of subjects received a current ; the controls had electrodes attached , but received no current .
The subjects were asked to come in for five consecutive days to repeat the process so that researchers could track how their skill improved .
By the end of day one , those who had an anode placed near the primary motor cortex were already pulling away from their peers ( a cathode had no effect ) , and had opened up a large and significant gap by the end of day five .
As expected , stopping the training at day five resulted in a gradual decline of the skills over time .
Because the two sets of subjects showed declines of roughly the same rate , the gap that opened up during training wound persisting to at least 85 days after the training sessions ended .
The authors also looked into whether the affect of tDCS comes from the formation of or consolidation of the training by comparing the gains within a day to the retention of skills between days , which they called online and offline training .
Overall , the differences in online gains between the two groups were n't statistically significant .
Between days , however , the control group was prone to forget some of the skills they had developed ; in contrast , those receiving the current actually came back the next day in better shape than they 'd left the day before .
The authors argue that this fits in nicely with our model of how memories are formed , as it involves a three - step process of learning , consolidation , and retention .
Clearly , the tDCS was only affecting the consolidation portion of the process .
Although the results are startling enough on their own — the fact that something as crude as sticking an electrode on your head is enough to have such specific consequences is quite surprising — they actually have significant practical implications .
Strokes and many other types of brain damage often force their victims to relearn basic motor skills , from speech to walking .
Given that tDCS is noninvasive and may help speed to recovery of these patients , I 'd expect to see tests of its efficacy in the near future .

MIAMI — A financial adviser from Indiana disappeared into the Alabama woods early Monday after faking a distress call and parachuting from a small plane that crashed in Florida .
The police in three states were looking for the pilot , identified as Marcus Schrenker , 38 .
No one was hurt in the crash .
According to the police in Santa Rosa County in the Florida Panhandle , where the plane went down , Mr. Schrenker turned up safely about 220 miles north of there .
And there is evidence that Mr. Schrenker was an experienced pilot who might have been trying to fake his own death .
His life seemed to be unraveling .
Court records show that Mr. Schrenker ’s wife filed for divorce on Dec. 30 .
A Maryland court recently issued a judgment of more than $ 500,000 against one of three Indiana companies registered in his name — and all three are being investigated for securities fraud by the Indiana Secretary of State ’s Office , a spokesman , Jim Gavin , said .
Mr. Schrenker has at least a decade of experience as a pilot , according to the airport in Anderson , Ind. , where he departed Sunday evening .
But the police said that within hours of taking off , he issued a distress call .

This loads in css and javascript files where you want them ( usually in the head ) - but allows you to put them anywhere in your code - i.e. in a TemplateTag .
so your head code will look like this :
< head > ...
<!-- HEAD_init --> ... </head >
then somewhere in your templates you can load in javascript or css files like so :
<!-- HEAD_include myfile.js myotherfile.css -->
It automatically checks if you 've already included the files , and only puts them in once .
It automatically figures out if its a javascript or css file by the file name - If you have an irregular filename ( i.e. a google maps api script url ) you can force it by using either of the following tags :
<!-- HEAD_include_js [ my javascript file ] --> <!-- HEAD_include_css [ my css file ] -->
Or you can write inline code to get rendered in the head :
<!-- HEAD_render < script > someJavascriptCall ( ) ; </ script > -->
Todo : make it compress the js into one file ...

A small legalistic pamphlet from Verizon arrived today telling me that I have 45 days to opt out of “ agreeing ” to let Verizon share Customer Proprietary Network Information , i.e. , “ information created by virtue of your relationship with Verizon Wireless , ” including “ services purchased ( including specific calls you make and receive , ” billing info , technical info and location info .
They promise to only share this with “ affiliates , agents and parent companies . ”
It will definitely not be shared with “ unrelated third parties ” … unless , perhaps that third party pays Verizon to become an affiliate , whatever the heck “ affiliate ” means .
To opt out you can call 1-800-333-9956 .
Or you can follow the instructions in the mailing to go to verizonwireless.com and log into My Verizon where you will find no mention , no button , no link and no help .
Ah , but you forgot to check your Messages .
There you will indeed find a link to CPNI .
The link is marked “ Not available . ”
Dead end .
You could then call Verizon ’s excellent telephone support .
( Nope , I ’m not being sarcastic . )
They wo n’t be able to find the opt out button either .
But during the 8 minutes the rep puts you on hold , you ’ll be amused to hear one of their continuous bits of self - promotion tell you that Verizon never shares your personal information .
Oh , what a wry sense of humor Verizon has !
When you escalate the call , you will finally be told to click on the My Profile tab in My Verizon , then click on Phone Controls , and there you will conveniently find the link .
It ’s just that simple !
The whole thing sucks :(
[ March 10 : ] Verizon responds in its blog .
GigaOm responds more broadly to that response .
And I still say that the if you ’re going to make the mistake of opting us in to sharing private info , then you have an ethical obligation to make it damn clear to us that you ’re doing so , and making it a damn site easier for us to opt out .
[ March 11 : ] Al Gidari , Jr. of Perkins Cole is giving a talk at the Berkman Center about the privacy of mobile - based info .
I asked him about CPNI .
Here are my notes on what he said :
The kerfuffle was an example of bad journalism .
The article expressed it badly .
The info you are opted in to giving can be used only within the family of companies for marketing purposes .
For sharing outside , it requires explicit opt-in .
And CPNI has a higher standard for location info , which does not get shared .
An “ affiliate ” is an entity you own or control .
Verizon is incorporated in separate states , so they ’re trying to share the info among that family of corporations .

Right now , we have a Republican party devoid of credibility playing politics with what tiny percentage of the GDP can actually be spent to help people .
What would have happened if the system simply , fully collapsed ?
I seriously doubt they would institute " martial law " - maybe an " economic martial law " as in freezing all assets valued over x amount .
Most companies in the U.S. and the world would be , on paper , insolvent .
And , suddenly , all this wealth that has been transferred to the top 1 percent , is completely meaningless .
You and I , with our sub - $ 100,000 FDIC accounts , would be fine .
But the massively wealthy , it would all come crashing down .
It would be yet another in a series of illustrations beginning with the robber - barons of the late 19th century , that this kind of greed - based - crony - capitalism DOES NOT WORK .
It would also have been the END of the unelected Fed presiding over the U.S. monetary system .
Remove monetary policy from the Fed , and place it back in the hands of the people ( through the House and Senate ) , and suddenly when main street suffers , politicians suffer .
It changes everything .
It would also be the end of the IMF , etc. as there would be no money left to help deploy crony capitalism to the third world .
People worry about Bush being punished ?
Bush and his whole lot would have been punished .
And good riddance .
Yes , I know we'd have 30 % unemployment , and retirees savings and stocks would be wiped out .
But I sense that unless and until that happens , this crowd will be back .
So maybe we shoulda let it all go .
Let the chips fall .
Is n't that what they want ?
Government to " get out of the way " .
( CNN ) -- Human - induced global warming is real , according to a recent U.S. survey based on the opinions of 3,146 scientists .
However there remains divisions between climatologists and scientists from other areas of earth sciences as to the extent of human responsibility .
A survey of more than 3,000 scientists found that the vast majority believe humans cause global warming .
Against a backdrop of harsh winter weather across much of North America and Europe , the concept of rising global temperatures might seem incongruous .
However the results of the investigation conducted at the end of 2008 reveal that vast majority of the Earth scientists surveyed agree that in the past 200 - plus years , mean global temperatures have been rising and that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures .
The study released today was conducted by academics from the University of Illinois , who used an online questionnaire of nine questions .
The scientists approached were listed in the 2007 edition of the American Geological Institute 's Directory of Geoscience Departments .
Two questions were key :
Have mean global temperatures risen compared to pre-1800s levels , and has human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures ?
About 90 percent of the scientists agreed with the first question and 82 percent the second .
The strongest consensus on the causes of global warming came from climatologists who are active in climate research , with 97 percent agreeing humans play a role .
Petroleum geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters , with only 47 percent and 64 percent , respectively , believing in human involvement .
" The petroleum geologist response is not too surprising , but the meteorologists ' is very interesting , " said Peter Doran associate professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago , and one of the survey 's authors .
" Most members of the public think meteorologists know climate , but most of them actually study very short - term phenomenon . "
However , Doran was not surprised by the near - unanimous agreement by climatologists .
" They 're the ones who study and publish on climate science .
So I guess the take - home message is , the more you know about the field of climate science , the more you 're likely to believe in global warming and humankind 's contribution to it .
" The debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long - term climate processes , " said Doran .
All About Global Climate Change
Blue -eyed , curly - haired Cyril Jacquet was the perfect reality show participant .
Young , attractive , outgoing and ambitious , he and his girlfriend , Paola Alberdi , were determined to win a new Spanish TV show called Around the World .
The show , on the Antena 3 channel , involves couples racing each other around the globe .
It promised adventure , a € 200,000 ( £ 178,000 ) prize and , inevitably , fame .
Jacquet did not seem to realise , however , that fans of the show would inevitably start putting his name into their internet search engines and finding out a little bit more about him .
So it was that , on Sunday night , he returned from Venice and abandoned the show after programme - makers questioned him about internet rumours that as a 15 - year - old he had murdered his mother and father .
" I will always hold my head high , " Cyril said , before he and Paola waved a tear - filled goodbye .
" People change , " he added .
Antena 3 , which devoted part of the Sunday - night to Monday - morning show to the news , said it had no idea that one of its contestants was a parricide .
" The programme did not know , " a ­presenter told viewers .
" After we checked the facts of the case we brought them back to Spain to protect them from media attention . "
In 1994 , Jacquet killed his mother with three shots from his father 's automatic pistol after she entered the family home .
A few hours later , Jacquet used the remaining seven bullets for his father .
He eventually confessed to the double killing and served three years in a youth detention centre .
Under Spanish law he has no criminal record since he was a minor at the time of the double killing .
Jacquet , now an airline cabin crew worker , blamed the media and " undesirable " people for his decision to abandon the show .
" They do n't let you leave the past behind , " he complained .
" I do n't want to keep giving them the excuse to lynch me . "
Paola , who said she had always known about her boyfriend 's past , said : " It bothers me a lot that we have to go because someone wants to pour shit on someone else 's life .
I know he is strong .
If he has got to where he has , it is because he can handle anything . "
Terry Childs , the ex-network admin accused of holding San Francisco 's computer network to ransom , is suing the city for $ 3 m .
Childs , who has been in prison since July and is still awaiting trial , wants compensation for lost wages , damages and emotional distress caused by what he claims was his wrongful arrest and imprisonment .
He is seeking $ 1 m for lost wages and benefits , $ 1 m for emotional distress , $ 500,000 in " special damages " and $ 500,000 to pay off his lawyer .
San Francisco is seeking damages from Childs to recover the costs it claims were incurred by his actions .
Childs was suspended from work in July 2008 and refused to hand over passwords , leaving officials shut out of the city 's wide area network .
San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom visited Childs in prison and convinced him to hand over the passwords .
Childs , 43 , is due back in court on 13 February .
His lawyer has filed to dismiss three charges as too vague , the SF Examiner reports . ®
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the past weeks
The Pope 's justice minister , Cardinal Renato Martino , has sharply criticised Israel 's actions and likened the Gaza Strip to a " big concentration camp " .
Correspondents say his words mark the Vatican 's toughest comments since Israel began its offensive with intensive air attacks 12 days ago .
He accused both sides of only thinking of their own interests while innocent people paid the price .
Pope Benedict XVI has already called for an end to the conflict .
Cardinal Martino , president of the Vatican 's Council for Justice and Peace , made the comment to Italian online site Il Sussidiario .
" Defenceless populations are always the ones who pay , " he said .
" Look at the conditions in Gaza : more and more , it resembles a big concentration camp . "
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says relations between Israel and the Vatican have been strained recently , after the Pope made it clear that he favoured making Pope Pius XII a saint .
The controversial wartime pope was accused by some Jews of turning a blind eye to the holocaust .
Cardinal Martino 's comments were immediately criticised by Israel , who said the Vatican was repeating Hamas propaganda .
Call for intervention Israel says it wants to stop rocket attacks on southern Israel and to stop Hamas smuggling weapons into Gaza via Egypt , while Hamas says any ceasefire deal must include an end to Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
The fact that this land is the scene of bloodshed seems a great tragedy
Cardinal Renato Martino Cardinal Martino urged both sides to hold peace talks .
" If they can't come to an agreement , then someone else should do it [ for them ] , " he said .
" The world can not sit back and watch without doing anything . "
He added : " We Christians are not the only ones to call this land ' holy ' , Jews and Muslims do so too .
" The fact that this land is the scene of bloodshed seems a great tragedy . "
There was a brief lull in hostilities on Wednesday when Israel halted military operations in Gaza for three hours to create " humanitarian corridors " for supplies and fuel .
It followed the deadliest day of the operation - more than 130 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday , medics said .

Huge solar storms could zap Earth , scientists warn / Next sunspot cycle may disrupt power , communications
An 11 - year epoch of increasingly severe solar storms that could fry power grids , disrupt cell - phone calls , knock satellites back to Earth , endanger astronauts in space , and force commercial airliners to change their routes to protect their radio communications and to avoid deadly solar radiation could begin as soon as this fall , scientists announced Monday .
When the solar cycle reaches its peak in 2012 , it will hurl at Earth mammoth solar storms with intense radiation and clouds of high - speed subatomic particles millions of miles across , the scientists said .
A storm of that magnitude could short - circuit a world increasingly dependent on giant utilities and satellite communications networks .
Such a storm in 1989 caused power grids to collapse , causing a five - hour blackout in Quebec .
Monday 's forecast was announced by scientists from agencies including NASA and the National Science Foundation , based on research centered at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado .
There is disagreement on exactly when the new cycle will begin -- one key researcher predicted the cycle will start in late 2007 or early 2008 , and another said it could begin either late this year or in early 2007 .
But they did agree that the most severe storms wo n't begin popping on the solar surface for several years , but when they do , they 'll be huge .
The solar storms in the past have knocked out huge power grids and screwed up global electronics and data communications , but " the next sunspot cycle will be 30 to 50 percent stronger than the last one , " the scientists said in Monday 's statement .
Reaching that 50 percent threshold would make it the most intense solar cycle since the late 1950s and the second worst since the early 1700s , Peter Gilman , one of the researchers , said in a phone interview .
Astronomers will monitor the sun daily in the coming months to see how it 's doing .
Early warning signs will be the formation of large groups of sunspots , which are clusters of solar magnetic fields that are cooler than the rest of the sun .
" I look ( at telescopic images of the sun ) almost every day , thinking , ' It could be today , ' " said David Hathaway , solar physics team leader at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama .
He compared it to " waiting for the first sparrow of spring . "
Solar storms can happen at any time during an 11 - year solar cycle .
However , by far the worst storms are likeliest to occur during the period known as " solar maximum , " or solar max for short .
The last solar max was in 2001 .
The scientists are confident of their forecast for 2012 because they 've successfully used a new computer model to " forecast " the past .
That is , they used records of old solar cycles to figure out how the sun should have behaved during eight past cycles , as far back as the early 20th century .
They " forecast " the sun 's past behavior -- " hindcasting , " they call it -- " with more than 98 percent accuracy " the scientists said .
" I 'm really excited about this ( discovery ) , " said NASA 's Hathaway .
" It 's based on sound physical principles , and it finally answers the 150 - year - old question : What causes the sunspot cycle ? "
The cycle 's victims could include space satellites .
The coming storms could heat the upper levels of Earth 's atmosphere , causing it to expand and exert drag on low - flying satellites -- perhaps enough drag to tug some of them back to Earth .
Solar storms have been blamed for the U.S. Skylab space station 's premature fall back to Earth in 1979 .
Air travelers could be affected , too .
Since the end of the Cold War , to avoid headwinds , airlines have increasingly flown subpolar routes to get between the United States and other Northern Hemisphere continents quickly and cheaply .
But during solar storms , they must avoid the poles and fly more southerly routes .
They do so partly in order to avoid having their radio communications disrupted over dangerous polar terrain and partly to avoid exposing passengers -- especially pregnant women -- to the increased radiation , said solar - storm expert Joseph Kunches , chief of the forecast and analysis branch of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Space Environment Center in Boulder , Colo .
The northern and northeastern portions of North America are historically more vulnerable to system outages caused by solar storms than California and most of the Western states , said Gregg Fishman , spokesman for the California Independent System Operator .
That 's possibly because among other things , he said , there 's a higher iron and mineral content in the North and Northeast that conducts the ground current more easily and allows for more of an impact during solar storms .
( Money Magazine ) -- Alicia Munnell is a Harvard - trained economist .
She served as an assistant secretary of the Treasury and is regarded as one of America 's foremost experts on 401 ( k ) s .
You'd think she'd be terrific at managing her own retirement , but even she has to fess up to some mistakes .
" When my son got married , I took some money out of my plan to help , " says Munnell , who heads Boston College 's Center for Retirement Research ( CRR ) .
" And I ended up paying a 10 % penalty and taxes . "
In the jargon of the retirement business , that 's called leakage .
It 's a common problem : About 60 % of job switchers with a 401 ( k ) plan cash it out .
That 's just one of the many pitfalls .
Lots of people start saving too late , save too little or make missteps with their portfolio .
And all of us are vulnerable to risks that we can't control .
Your employer might not offer a plan or might choose one with second - rate investments .
Or you may hit a market storm at precisely the wrong moment : the year you stop working .
That last problem is especially obvious now .
Over the past 12 months , a 64 - year - old investor in an age - tailored " target date " mutual fund has lost 26 % .
Savers with high balances can recover from that .
But many lost more , and the typical near - retiree with a 401 ( k ) has less than $ 50,000 stashed away in it .
That will spend down quickly , and once the money 's gone , it does n't matter if the market roars back .
A recent CRR study shows that a bear market retiree could easily end up with just half the income from a 401 ( k ) as someone retiring during a bull market .
" Any system that delivers such wild swings in retirement income is just not working , " says Munnell .
She is n't the only one who 's worried .
A growing number of policy experts who study 401 ( k ) s think they fall short .
So why not rethink America 's retirement system from the ground up ?
No , it wo n't be easy :
We 're in an economic crisis , and lobbyists for the financial services industry will fight like tigers for the status quo .
But that does n't make the task any less urgent .
Some 78 million baby boomers are hurtling toward retirement .
Their poverty , if it comes to that , will be a burden to their children and lead to calls for taxpayers to support them .
What would a better system look like ?
It would be universal and strike a more conservative balance of risk and return .
Most of all , it would be designed for savers , not employers or money managers .
Here are five principles for reform .
1 . We need a plan for everyone
Our current retirement system has n't broken - it was never really a working system to begin with .
No law - makers designed the 401 ( k ) to displace the traditional pension , although that 's what ultimately happened .
It is named for a tax loophole that pension consultants gradually built a plan around .
Under the rules , the earnings you put into a 401 ( k ) are n't taxed , and the account grows tax deferred until you cash out at retirement .
It 's not a cheap program :
The tax advantage for 401 ( k ) contributions will cost the Treasury $ 51 billion in 2009 .
Add in the break for IRAs , which are largely funded by 401 ( k ) rollovers , and it's $ 63 billion .
If you are a typical reader of this magazine , that tax break has been extremely valuable for you .
Whether it actually encourages you to save more is another matter .
Since 401 ( k ) s became more popular , some studies have shown , higher - income people seem to have shifted their assets from taxable to nontaxable accounts rather than saving more .
Lower - and middle - income households , on the other hand , do n't benefit as much from the program .
They are less likely to be covered by any plan or by one that offers a generous company match .
Since they pay lower tax rates , they get less out of the tax deferral .
In all , about 70 % of the tax benefits for 401 ( k ) savings goes to the top 20 % of earners .
" Given the way 401 ( k ) s are structured , they are virtually designed to provide inadequate retirement income for the average worker , " says University of California Berkeley political scientist Jacob Hacker .
So how can the system pull more people in ?
Enlisting employers
One obvious approach is to ensure that more people have access to a savings plan through their jobs .
This one could be an easy bipartisan compromise .
Retirement experts at the conservative Heritage Foundation and the liberal Brookings Institution have together proposed an " automatic IRA . "
Businesses with no retirement plan would have to put a portion of workers ' paychecks into an IRA unless the employee opted out .
Pension experts Pamela Perun and Eugene Steuerle have proposed a simplified retirement plan similar to one in the U.K .
Employers would be required to offer a retirement plan with a match of up to 3 % of salary .
As part of the bargain , the plan would lift some of the burdensome administrative rules of today 's 401( k ) .
Getting a boost from Uncle Sam
A more ambitious approach would be a government savings match similar to what you get from your employer .
If this sounds like a subsidy , it is - but then , so is the current tax break .
The difference is that this one would take the form of a refundable credit .
Unlike tax deferrals , such a credit can benefit even people in low brackets .
Gene Sperling , a former Clinton administration official , has proposed a " universal 401( k ) " in which low - income workers can get as much as a two - to - one match .
Higher - income families may get a 30 % match .
Economist Teresa Ghilarducci of the New School for Social Research goes further .
To ensure that everyone saves from the start of their career to the end , she proposes a mandatory national savings account on top of Social Security .
You 'd kick in 2.5 % a year and your employer another 2.5 % .
In one version , the tax credit would be a flat $ 600 a year for everybody .
Of course , the government can't just throw cash around ( recent events notwithstanding ) .
Paying for tax credits would likely mean trimming or eliminating the existing deferrals .
Tough sell .
No one is talking about touching existing 401 ( k ) balances .
But if you are a high earner able to contribute the max to your 401 ( k ) , you 'd pay more taxes under Ghilarducci 's plan .
Before you throw out the idea altogether , though , consider this :
You were n't always in your current tax bracket .
A plan for moderate - income earners could have gotten you saving consistently from the first day of your first job .
It could do the same for your kids .
2. Spread some of the risk - but not all of it
In any retirement system , your standard of living will depend to some extent on the state of the economy .
Traditional pensions rely on a financially healthy employer .
Even Social Security , as a pay - as - you - go system , depends on the productivity of current workers .
But 401 ( k ) s stand out for the way that they concentrate nearly all the economic risk on you alone .
With that risk comes a shot at high rewards .
If you have an above - average income , it makes sense to have at least some of your retirement money in the market over your career .
But many retirement experts think we need a third tier of savings in between Social Security and the 401( k ) .
It would offer a better return than Social Security but less market risk than mutual funds and other investments .
Just a portion of the money you now put into 401 ( k ) s would go here .
Working out the details of this third - tier plan wo n't be simple .
One approach would be to offer a straight - up guarantee .
In Ghilarducci 's plan , the mandatory savings would go into a single government fund invested in stocks and bonds .
You would be guaranteed a payment based on a 3 % annual return after inflation , possibly more if the market did so well that the managers decided they could safely distribute extra gains .
" Historically , that 's a very achievable rate of return , " says Ghilarducci .
Unfortunately , it is also a modest one - over long periods , stocks have generally beaten inflation by six percentage points or more .
Boston College 's Munnell thinks the Dutch retirement system might be a better model .
In their national pension fund , retirees get a payment based on their salary and years of service , similar to a company pension .
But the amount can change in the event of a severe market crash or funding shortfall .
" If returns are low , everyone takes a hit , " says Munnell .
" Retirees might not get the full cost - of - living adjustment , employers may have to put in more , and workers building up benefits will accrue less . "
An American solution would be different in the details .
Even so , the basic principle could apply : Spread risk among employers , retirees and current workers and you can smooth out the highs and lows to make some retirement income more predictable .
3 . Help us make the money last
At the end of your career , a 401 ( k ) will leave you ( you hope ) with a big pile of money .
But stretching those dollars over two or more decades is as big a challenge as accumulating them was .
You face two uncertainties : how markets will perform and how long you will live .
Spend too much and you might find yourself a hale and hearty 85 - year - old with an empty bank account .
One solution is to use at least part of your savings to buy a fixed - rate immediate annuity , which creates a pensionlike income for life .
But almost no one does this with their 401 ( k ) balance .
Why ?
Annuities can be complex - insurance salesmen like them that way - and the expenses are higher for retail investors than for institutions like pension funds .
There 's also a big psychological barrier :
You give up hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for a lot of smaller checks .
Yet there 's evidence that older retirees are happier if they have some annuity income .
A third - tier savings program could provide some guaranteed income .
But even without a whole new retirement plan , there are ways to make it easier for retirees to annuitize .
Right now most 401 ( k ) s pay out in a lump sum as a default .
It 's just less trouble for employers that way .
But simply by switching that default to an annuity - or a partial annuity - new retirees would get a signal that this is the smart move .
This would also remove some of the hassle and encourage a more competitive annuity market .
Experts at Brookings and Heritage recommend automatically converting a portion of a new retiree 's 401 ( k ) into a " trial " annuity for just two years .
If retirees like getting the regular paychecks , they can convert to a lifetime annuity .
" It 's a way of letting investors take an annuity for a test drive , " says Mark Iwry of Brookings .
4 . Choke off high investment fees
Unfair as it sounds , 401 ( k ) plans do not have to fully disclose how much you 're being charged .
Chances are , it 's a lot .
" A typical 401 ( k ) plan may be charging participants 1.5 % or more annually , when a more reasonable cost would be 0.5 % to 1 % , " says Matthew Hutcheson , an independent pension fiduciary in Portland , Ore .
Over 20 years , paying an extra 1 % in expenses can reduce your nest egg by about 17 % , assuming a 6.5 % annual average return .
Low costs would be a key advantage of a public savings plan - in general , the larger the plan , the lower the expenses .
In the meantime , though , we could at least set some sensible expense rules for the system we have .
Congressman George Miller , head of the House Education and Labor committee , has introduced a bill mandating that plans offer at least one low - cost index fund .
That 's a great start .
5 . How about a " retirement Fed " ?
All of these proposals require some public oversight of your retirement investments .
But when tax breaks are involved , that 's inevitable - your current 401 ( k ) plan is already highly regulated .
The task is to make the regulation more effective .
To see how the current rules fall short , consider the 2006 Pension Protection Act .
It encourages employers to sign people up for 401 ( k ) s automatically and to use target - date retirement funds and other diversified stock - and - bond portfolios as the default investments .
Money markets and stable - value funds were mostly ruled out as automatic options .
In other words , the government has already started opining on what is and is n't an appropriate retirement investment .
The bill has probably helped steer more savers in the right direction .
Even so , the investment guidelines were left quite loose , and different fund companies offered wildly different asset mixes .
When the market collapsed last year , investors who happened to be in plans that had nudged them into stock - heavy allocations suffered steep losses .
These are tricky issues .
We need a visible public forum to thrash them out , and we ought to be drawing on the advice of the nation 's top retirement and investing minds .
So why not create a quasi - independent Federal Retirement Security Board ?
The members of this " Retirement Fed " should represent a range of backgrounds and points of view - academics , small business owners , workers and money managers .
The board 's first task would be to set better rules of the road for those default plans and work on standards for expenses .
But it could also develop proposals for that crucial third - tier savings plan .
Getting retirement right is essential to our nation 's economic health .
Let 's give it the attention it deserves .

Emerging Muslim Freethinkers and the Battle of Civilizations
The Muslim world is obviously in a mess .
Political instability , unbridled corruption , lack of economic development , widespread intolerance and violence , and lack of freedom , liberty and human rights are some of the traits that characterize Muslim societies most glaringly .
All indications suggest that things will get only worse over coming decades .
Amongst many factors that differentiate Muslim societies from most other progressive and more peaceful societies are its missing freethinkers — namely critics and reformers — who are able to criticize the troublesome aspects of its societal core , its religious foundations .
Other societies had its problems in the past .
However , those societies allowed the emergence of progressive freethinking scholars , philosophers and reformers .
They exercised variable measures of liberty to criticize , to point fingers at , the underlying reasons , including the religious ones , of the many ills of their societies .
Jewish societies produced brilliant minds like Benedict de Spinoza , Carl Marx and Albert Einstein amongst many other ; Christianity produced great thinkers like Rene Descartes , Emmanuel Kant , David Hume , John S Mill , Bertrand Russell and many more .
Some of these thinkers , Spinoza for example , attracted ire from religious authorities , faced excommunication .
Nonetheless , their ideas and views were not choked out ; instead , they were disseminated with some measure of ease ; security to their life was not threatened .
The resilience , the power , of their progressive and reformative social , political and philosophical ideas eventually triumphed .
As a result , those societies reformed , secularized , progressed and prospered .
But Muslims societies , the core of which is most intimately integrated with its religious ideals , have never really allowed the emergence of its own breed of freethinkers and progressive reformers , particularly over the past eight centuries .
One must not negate the fact that the Islamic world once excelled the rest in the so - called Golden Age of Islam ( 800 –1200 CE ) .
This was , however , possible only because the Islamic world fell in wrong hands soon after its founding by Prophet Muhammad ( d. 632 ) .
The Arab imperialist Umayyad rulers ( 661–750 ) were mostly anti-Muhammad and anti-Islam , except when it served their purpose .
For example , they exploited the Islamic doctrine of Jihad at its best for their imperialism expansion , whilst tried their best to prevent the conversion of non-Muslim subjects to Islam , so that they could extract more taxes from them .
During Umayyad rule , all kinds of often - progressive but theologically heretical ideas ( i.e. , rationalist Mutazilism ) prospered unchecked in Muslim societies .
Next , the Abbasid rulers ( 750 –1250 ) , who — rejected the Arab ways and adopted the Persian civilization — further propped up the flourishing of this often - heretical intellectual tradition .
The Persians already had a great tradition in intellectual exercise prior to Islam ’s birth .
The Abbasids promoted science and philosophy even at theological compromise .
Caliph Al - Mamun ( 813 –833 ) , for example , even persecuted the orthodox ; all his officials had to agree that the Quran was not divine but created by Prophet Muhammad .
His policies continued during the subsequent rule of al - Mutassim ( d. 842 ) and Al - Wathik ( d. 847 ) .
Al - Wathik , embarrassingly for Muslims , became dubbed as the “ Commander of the Unbeliever ” .
This deviation from true Islam set the emergence of the Islamic Golden Age in motion , albeit on the wings of heresy and theological compromise of all sorts .
We see the greatest - ever Muslim scientist and thinker , Al - Razi ( d. 945 ) , calling Prophet Muhammad a charlatan , a fraudulent trickster ; responding to Allah ’s challenge of creating a book like the Quran , he called it an assorted mixture of “ absurd and inconsistent fables ” .
The writings of Plato , Aristotle , Euclid , and Hippocrates — he asserted — contained much greater wisdom and brought greater service to humanity than the Holy Scriptures , which brought more harm than good .
This was all to change soon .
Islamic orthodoxy was gaining strength ; it triumphed in Islamic societies by the spadework of legendary Islamic theologian Imam Ghazzali ( d. 1111 ) .
He called Al - Farabi and Ibn Sina — his predecessor and the brilliant 11th - century philosophers and scientists of Muslim world — apostates , which demands death .
Luckily for the latter , they had already left the world .
The rational and progressive thoughts became increasing suppressed .
Religious orthodoxy , obscurantism and intolerance entered the body of Islamic societies .
The Golden Age of Islam was dead .
( My just - released book , Islamic Jihad : A Legacy of Forced Conversion , Imperialism and Slavery , discusses in Chapter IV the circumstances that made the so - called Golden Age in the Muslim world a reality ) .
Progressive thoughts and ideas have been choked out in Muslim societies with the instruments of intimidation and violence ever since .
When colonial powers briefly imposed some measure of tolerance in Islamic countries , a few Muslim intellectuals of note emerged .
After the colonial powers withdrew , the Islamic world has marched towards orthodoxy and intolerance , particularly after the oil - boom in the 1970s .
Its progressive freethinkers , the generators of new ideas and creativity and propellers of civilization , are dealt with intolerance and brutality by authorities as well as by mobs .
As long as intolerance of dissenting ideas remain in force , Islamic world will unlikely emerge from its current malaise and lack of material progress .
It is unlikely to change any time soon .
There is , however , a glimmer of hope .
Kicked out of their home countries , some Muslim dissidents — harbored by the liberal West — are showing their intellectual prowess .
Muslim apostates like Ibn Warraq and Ayaan Hirsi Ali have written bestselling books .
Most of all , they , for the first time , are pointing fingers at the debilitating nature of the Islamic theology , which must undergo modernization as have other creeds .
The new - age information technology , the Internet , have also come to their aid .
Another lesser known , but more populous , breed of Muslim intellectuals have taken up pens for pointing out the troublesome aspects of the theological foundations of Islam and are airing their views through increasingly popular Websites , such as Islam Watch , Faith Freedom International , Apostates of Islam and more .
More and more intellectually capable writers from Muslim backgrounds are being generated through these Internet - based ventures .
As Muslim countries become increasingly networked to the Internet , the pool of Muslim readers , accessing their messages , will inevitably grow and help their enlightenment , which is already happening .
Samuel Huntington , in his Clash of Civilizations , quite correctly points to a prominent ongoing clash of Islam with the rest humanity , which is all there for one to see .
It is raging by the day and will undoubtedly accentuate over coming decades .
Islam ’s history , particularly until the European colonial interventions in the Muslim world , has been a monotonous saga of continual war against non-Muslims ; it has claimed hundreds of millions of lives from Asia to Africa to Europe .
Even the far - off United States was not spared this Islamic brutality : her ship - crews captured and enslaved in North African waters suffered horribly .
The war is being reinvigorated again .
Since the 9/11 attacks , there have been no less than 12,800 Islam - inspired acts of violence committed by Muslim militants and mobs globally as tracked by a Website ( a small fraction of them against Western targets ) .
While this battle now claims thousands of lives annually , millions of lives could be at stake in the not - too - distant future .
It is Muslims , who are waging this raging new war against their non-Muslim neighbors all over the world ; it is in their hands , too , to end it peacefully .
Only a dawn of Islamic enlightenment — which entails Muslims ’ recognition that there is unjustified violence and intolerance integrated in their religion and that these must be abandoned in order for them to be a peaceful part of the global humanity — can avert this dreadful prospect .
This is a battle not winnable through military might .
The global Muslim community ’s access to the rather unsavory views of this emerging band of Muslim freethinkers , and their willingness to pay heed to latter ’s message may end this long - standing war of Islam against non-Muslim humanity with reduced damage to life and property .
Else , humanity stands to lose immensely in this battle of civilizations .
Muslims will lose no less .

you are loosing jobs due to islam .
Mad fanatic osama ordered 9/11 on WTC .
Immediately Uncle sam ( US ) ordered war on terrorirm instead of keeping queit like dumb indians who never consider loss of its citizens .
Upto this it is ok .
but George bush faught the war with out knowing the real root cause of terrorism , islam and terrorism breeder feild Pakistan .
onside he is waging war terrorist in Afghan on the other hand he stupidly aided billions into pakistan undeer Musharaf regime for support in his war but large part of it was diverted to couner indian waepons rather than dismantling teror network in pakistan and terror financing petro dollar banks .
After bush waged another war on iraq on suspicion of nucleur weapons with Saddham .
This was death knell for US which made it to bakrupt utterly weaken its economy .
The consequence is its citizens lost their jobs which lead to to non paymemnt of bank loans of their houses and credit cards .
Then it lead to collapsing of baks .
This lead to cascading effect of global econmy which all the world central banks have invested their hard earned foriegn exchange in US banks by buying US treasury bonds .
All these effects lead to recession job losses .
Thousands of indians are loosing hitehc software and hard ware jobs which are outsourced to them from US as part of india 's opening door to globalisation and American goods like drinks , american apples and corn imports .
India is still suffering financially from pakistan and islam even after 60 years of partition .
Islam is like a toxic tree which does not die by cutting its branches .
WE have to cu it roots and stem .
No more silence .
Let us all world citizens fallow Einstein steps to criticise evil religions and fanatism in general islam in particular .
First islam must be condemned in all forms of media right from internet , print and literature like novels .
Let us appreciate Anwar sheaik , Taslima and SALMAN RUSHDIE like people who have early predicted evil islam its danger and daringly critised and warned danger of it .

Excellant article .
Unfortunately , it can not be sent to Muslim countries because of ban on ISLAM WATCH .
Truth does not seem to be pallatable to the Muslim mind .
Islam is like a mill - stone around the neck of Muslims , but they are quite happy with that .
It is the fear of Allah and Mohammad , which has paralysed them to submission .
The future of Islam and Muslims is very bleak unless they change their thinking about this dangerous cult of hatred and ignorance .

Mu'tazili theology originated in the 8th century in Basra ( Iraq ) when Wasil ibn Ata ( d. 131 A.H./748 A.D. ) left the teaching lessons of al - Hasan al - Basri after a theological dispute regarding the issue of Al - Manzilah bayna al - Manzilatayn ( described below ) ; thus he , and his followers , including Amr ibn Ubayd ( d. 144 A.H. / 761 A.D. ) , were labelled Mu'tazili [ 1 ] .
Later , Mu'tazilis called themselves
Ahl al - Tawhid wa al - ' Adl ( " People of Divine Unity and Justice " ) based on the theology they advocated , which sought to ground Islamic creedal system in reason .
Though Mu'tazilis later relied on logic and different aspects of early Islamic philosophy , Greek philosophy , and Hellenistic philosophy , the truths of Islam were their starting point and ultimate reference .
[ 2 ]
The accusations leveled against them by rival schools of theology that they gave absolute authority to extra-Islamic paradigms reflect more the fierce polemics between various schools of theology than any objective reality .

Facing the problem of existence of evil in the world , the Mu'tazilis pointed at the free will of human beings , so that evil was defined as something that stems from the errors in human acts .
( 3 ) Al - Wa'd wa al - Wa'id - Promise and Threat .
This comprised questions on the Last day and the Qiyamah ( Islamic Day of Judgment ) .
( 4 ) Al - Manzilah bayna al - Manzilatayn - the intermediate position .

MA Khan has lied about the Mu'tazilis .
They were true Muslims .
They had never doubted about the authenticity of the Quran neither had they ever criticized Prophet Muhammad .
It 's absurd !
Instead they had tried to rationalize the basic tenets and teachings of Islam , and it 's absolutely OK according to the Spirit of the Quran .

By the end of the ninth century , Mu'tazilis were subjected to vehement attacks from the traditionalists on one hand , and from the atheists , deists , philosophers , non-Muslim thinkers , etc. on the other .
It is important to note that the traditionalists , as opposed to Mu'tazili rationalists , were not irrationalists .

Comment
The Mu'tazilis had a nuanced theory regarding reason , Divine revelation , and the relationship between them .
They celebrated power of reason and human intellectual power .
To them , it is the human intellect that guides a human to know God , His attributes , and the very basics of morality .
Once this foundational knowledge is attained and one ascertains the truth of Islam and the Divine origins of the Qur'an , the intellect then interacts with scripture such that both reason and revelation come together to be the main source of guidance and knowledge for Muslims .
Harun Nasution in the Mu'tazila and Rational Philosophy , translated in Martin ( 1997 ) , commented on Mu'tazili extensive use of rationality in the development of their religious views saying : " It is not surprising that opponents of the Mu'tazila often charge the Mu'tazila with the view that humanity does not need revelation , that everything can be known through reason , that there is a conflict between reason and revelation , that they cling to reason and put revelation aside , and even that the Mu'tazila do not believe in revelation .
But is it true that the Mu'tazila are of the opinion that everything can be known through reason and therefore that revelation is unnecessary ?
The writings of the Mu'tazila give exactly the opposite portrait .
In their opinion , human reason is not sufficiently powerful to know everything and for this reason humans need revelation in order to reach conclusions concerning what is good and what is bad for them .

Please stop messing up the forum .
A little knowledge you can gain reading wikipedia does not necessarily tell the whole thing .
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing and you are a proof .
Of course , Mutazilis were believers ; indeed , they were Muslim .
But it is also because of their ideas that Caliph Al - Mamun started persecuting those , who claimed the Quran was divine .
Al - Mamun made all his top officers to take oath by the pledge that Quran was created .
His officers in turn did the same upon lower - ranked officers .
The biggest victim of Al - Mamun 's persecution was orthodox jurist Ibn Hanbal for his refusal accept that Quran was created .

On careful study of semetic scriptues vis-a - vis world history I found the original sin is not eating of the apple of wisdom but strategic monotheism , propounded by Abraham / Ibrahim and put to practice by the Jews .
Jews art still paying for such sin .
While making a travesty of Judaism St. paul committed the second original sin , which is religious conversion .
It only taught intolerance and exclusivism destroying cultures across the globe .
It is sort of colonising the mind by creating mental clones .
Muhammad just added the third by beautifying violence throughjehad .

A university has apologised to a graduate student who lost his unique collection of rare lizard excrement when it was thrown away by mistake .
Daniel Bennett had been studying the butaan lizard for more than five years in the Philippines and was working towards a doctorate .
He had built up a large collection of faeces samples which were stored at Leeds University and then disposed of .
The university said Mr Bennett was still due to finish his PhD this year .
' Protocols improved '
The 35kg ( 77lb ) bag of excrement was thrown out during a clear - out in his lab .
The butaan is closely related to the Komodo dragon .
One of the world 's rarest reptiles , it was thought to be extinct for over 100 years .
Mr Bennett said he spent seven years of painstaking work searching the rainforest to find the faeces of the large and mysterious lizard .
He said the reptile was so shy that he studied what it ate through its droppings , rather than trapping or disturbing it .
The university said : " The loss of these samples was an unfortunate mistake .
" They were thrown away in error because they were in an unmarked bag .
" Lessons have been learned and protocols improved to ensure this cannot happen again .
" Mr Bennett is due to graduate with his PhD this year , subject to minor corrections to his thesis , unrelated to the loss of the materials . "
Herschel departs Europe - launch campaign underway
13 February 2009
On the evening of 10 February , the Herschel spacecraft departed the ESTEC test facilities in Noordwijk , The Netherlands , travelling in its custom transport container by special convoy , arriving at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol around midnight .
There , the 3 - tonne spacecraft was loaded onto an Antonov plane together with additional support equipment totalling more than 30 tonnes .
The next day , on the evening of 11 February , the Antonov plane carrying Herschel took off on a non -stop flight to Rochambeau airport .
According to schedule , Herschel will be joined at the Centre Spatial Guyanais in Kourou by the Planck spacecraft in the middle of next week .
This will be the first time that the two complete spacecraft meet .
In the period leading up to the launch , foreseen for Thursday 16 April 2009 , the two spacecraft will undergo their final checks and preparations for the combined launch on an Ariane ECA rocket .

Relativity in Chemistry : The Color of Gold
Why is gold yellow ?
Metals exhibit their characteristic shininess as the delocalised electron sea in the metallic bonds are able to absorb and re-emit photons over a wide range of frequencies .
Thus the reflectance spectra of most metals appears fairly flat and they appear silver in colour .
A few metals , such as copper and gold , have a reflectance spectrum where the red end ( 400 –700 nm ) dominates .
Why is this so ?
I first thought that it may be something to do with the single unpaired electron in the outermost valence shell , but Silver also displays this but has a flatter reflectance curve .
Can anybody shed some light ( groan ) on this ?
Chemists often consider the first sub -shell of a given angular momentum to be anomalous .
The 3d , filled in copper , is less shielded by the s and p subshells than you might otherwise expect .
Silver , with a filled 4d behaves more like you think it should .
Now when you get to gold ( 5d ) relativistic effects become important .
Compared to non-relativistic results the s and p subshells are more contracted ( the so - called relativistic stabilization ) while d and f are destabilized and more diffuse .
So gold also behaves somewhat differently .
If you were to do a solid state calculation on gold without including relativistic effects you would predict it to be silvery .
Including relativistic effects you get reasonably good agreement with reality .
Let ’s face it : any game where you kill zombies has its merits .
Enter Aim for the Brain , a quick , fun title for the iPhone and iPod touch developed in conjunction with Westlake Interactive and PerfectDork Studios .
The title sort of explains it all .
Open the game , choose one of three levels ( “ Alleyway ” , “ Cemetery ” or “ Hospital ” ) , choose a difficulty level ( “ Easy ” , “ Normal ” or “ Hard ” ) and begin shooting zombies as they duck out behind doorways , sewer grates , headstones , hallways , ceiling vents , etc .
The zombies do n’t inflict damage to the player and can be shot or left alone , but you need to check your fire when innocent civilians duck out from behind objects .
Hit enough civilians and the game ends .
The higher levels afford you less breathing room as three slain civilians on the “ Hard ” setting end the game .
The developers did their homework with this title and it shows .
A blend of smooth , polished graphics and imaginative character designs among the 20 types of zombies lends a tongue - in - cheek humor to the game .
Yes , there are the conventional zombie types with the gray skin , rotten limbs and semi-exposed brains , but there are also some humorously crafted zombies such as the undead in bear and clown suits that help make up the cast .
Aim for the Brain ’s sound and music round out the environment and lends an undeniable sense of fun to the game via its crunchy , squishy sound effects .
Between comical guttural moans from the undead to the screams of innocent civilians accompanied by the energetic - yet - creepy music , the audio elements work perfectly and make the title that much more fun .
Even if Aim for the Brain is n’t much more than “ Whack - a - Mole with Zombies ” for your iPhone or iPod touch , the game knows what it is , is well crafted and delivers a fun experience .
Responsive controls react well to the multi - touch interface , the application runs without hiccups or errors and there were no perceptible breaks in the game ’s frame rate during game play .
While there ’s really nothing to improve upon and the game more than validates its $ 1.99 App Store price tag , some additional bells and whistles to the title would n’t hurt .
More weapons , additional levels and an online scoreboard would make a good thing that much better , even though the game is off to a great start considering how close it is to version 1.0 .
Aim for the Brain !
does n’t break new ground or define new territory but understands itself for the silly , quick iPhone tap - shooter it is and is a solid , well - crafted title that helps kill a few free minutes .
For two bucks on the App Store , you ca n’t go wrong and I look forward to seeing what Westlake Interactive and PerfectDork come out with next .
Aim for the Brain ! is compatible with any iPhone or iPod touch running the iPhone 2.x software update .

Real Life Gundam : Japanese Robot Suit ( HAL )
Japan has led the way in the field of robotics and in keeping with this tradition has become the first country to begin mass - producing a robot that will help human beings become more mobile .
Meet Robot Suit HAL ( Hybrid Assistive Limb ) and shake his hand ; that is , if he will let you .
Robot Suit HAL is worn over the arms and legs .
Through the use of eight electric motors attached to shoulders , elbows , knees and the waist , this device greatly assists body movement .
Produced by Cyberdyne Inc , the company expects to make the robot suit available for rental through specific sales outlets in the very near future .
Almost like those fairy tale boots and magic carpets that transport the wearer into mystical realms of flying and super powers , this incredible device supports the limb movements of the wearer , and through the help of sensors quickly responds to wherever more mobility is needed .
Robot Suit HAL ’s secret powers are derived from a unique method that senses bioelectric signals sent from the brain , rather by than detecting muscle movements .
Commercialization of Robot Suit HAL is still in its infancy and there are some technical problems .
Robot Suit HAL remains creepy and weird however , because its essence translates into a person controlling the robot by his or her own will even if the user is unable to move !

Is this a bear market rally or is the tide changing ?
The market is putting its faith on a leaked internal memo from Citi that indicated that they are having the best Q since the beginning of the recession .
Only last week the market believed that the company was within days of collapsing .
We are talking about a former giant that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s within smelling distance of being a penny stock , an entity that has received billions in tax payerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s money and multi-billions in assurances from the US treasury .
Least we forget , they have been allowed to write down billions on their balance sheets , surely itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s even possible for them to have a positive Q , but to bet your Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœdevaluedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ house on them being the reason for potentially turning this market sentiment is a stretch !
This morning we have been brought back to earth on ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worse than expected export numbers ( exports tumbled - 25.7 % and imports fell - 24.1 % , y/y ) .
There will be time for Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœconcreteÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ euphoria itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s just not yet .
The US $ is mixed in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 9 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Bernanke comments and recommendations yesterday were expected .
Nothing new or earth shattering was presented to dissuade current positive equity market sentiment .
Again he urges an immediate and extensive overhaul of US financial regulations .
This he proposes will Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœsmooth out the boom - and - bustÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ cycles in US financial markets .
Bernanke is the PR man of choice .
He provided support in saying that the Fed and the Treasury will take Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœany necessary and appropriate steps to ensure banks have capital to function well in even a severe economic downturnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
He wants to Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœreview capital regulations to ensure that they are appropriately forward - looking , and that capital is allowed to serve its intended role as a buffer – one built up during good times and drawn down during bad timesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Now all the market can wait for is the White House proposal for regulatory change .
Even though being long gold is probably the most overcrowded trade at the moment , many analysts are revising their prediction over the next 2 - years , some calling for $ 2,000 - 3,000 an ounce .
On the whole the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ has held in very well when one compares it to other commodities .
Gold looks set to move substantially higher as governments all around the world embark on a cycle of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœquantitative easingÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ or printing money .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that the US monetary base ( supply ) has increased more in the past 6 - months than the aggregate total over the past 20 - years .
Even China is deliberately inflating its own domestic money supply , similar to the BOE objectives .
This will make gold the ultimate safe haven from policy makerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s attempts to lower indirectly their various currencies .
With interest rates predicted to advance aggressively over time , Gold will be the only go - to play !
The US$ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.13 % and CHF - 0.20 % and lower against GBP +0.10 % and JPY +0.15 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD +0.05 % and AUD - 0.15 % .
A swift kick in the teeth for loonie bears was felt yesterday .
The CAD $ strengthened from a 5 - year low after advances in global equities and higher crude prices signaled investors are stepping up purchases of riskier assets .
The question of course , is this rally sustainable ?
Canadian Finance Minister is already prepping the public for weak employment numbers this Friday .
Earlier this week the loonie fell to its lowest level in nearly 5 - years on concerns that the global outlook may worsen led investors to take refuge in the greenback .
Year - to - date it has declined - 5.5 % , after a record - 18 % loss last year vs. its southern partner .
This global recession has depleted demand for commodities .
Nearly 50 % of all of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s export revenue is commodity based .
In FridayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s employment report , analysts expect a further loss of - 50 k jobs .
Traders continue to look for better levels to sell the CAD $ in the short term .
The AUD $ retreated from its 1 - week high after China said its trade surplus plunged as exports fell by a record , thus raising speculation that demand for the nationsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ commodities will weaken ( 0.6445 ) .
Gains were also capped in yesterdays run up as we wait for the unemployment reports for down under .
Already business confidence and falling job ads data impeded further strength of the currency as traders continue to look to sell into rallies at the moment .
Crude is little changed in the O/N session ( $ 45.69 down - 2 c ) .
As Mar. 15th approaches , investors continue to speculate that OPEC will announce another production cut .
This is expected to shore up the price of crude and lower global stocks .
This bullish commodity has only one supporter and that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s OPEC .
They pump about 40 % of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oil and have cut production 3 - times since Sept. to slow the slump in prices and prevent a glut on world markets .
Already this week , Venezuela have said that the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdramatic drop in prices has been greater than warranted by the decline in global demandÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
OPECÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Secretary General said that they must remove another +800 k barrels a day to reduce output by - 4.2 m since their objectives were established last Sept .
Some analysts do not expect this bullish run to be sustainable despite the market anticipating that OPEC will cut production further at this weekendÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s meeting .
If they do decide to reduce production targets this month , the technical charts indicate that prices may rise to $ 55 a barrel .
However , the world is awash with the black - stuff , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the storage problems that are causing concerns .
This will lead to prices remaining under pressure in the longer term .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s surprising EIA report showed an unexpected decline in US crude , this support cannot be sustainable as Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdemand destructionÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ remains .
Crude oil supplies fell - 757 k barrels to +350.6 m vs. an expected rise of +1 m barrels .
Refineries operated at 83.1 % of capacity , up + 1.8 % from the last report .
A gain in global equities has reduced demand for the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative investment for now .
A greater appetite for risk will have the commodity testing the $ 875 support level .
Expect traders to be better buyers on deeper pull backs ( $ 902 ) .
The Nikkei closed 7,376 up +321 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 3,843 down - 43 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,666 down - 50 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is a tad higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields backed up 7 bp yesterday ( 3.00 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
As anticipated Treasury prices fell as traders prepare for this weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s funding requirements .
The Treasury will auction $ 18 b in 10 - year notes today and $ 11b in 30 - year bonds tomorrow .
Global indexesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ advancing has also put pressure on the safer - heaven asset class .
Expect supply concerns to remain the order of this week !

February 12 will mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin , the British naturalist who developed the theory of evolution through natural selection .
Darwin published his treatise on evolution , On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , nearly 150 years ago .
Darwin ’s theory was controversial from the outset , and remains so among the public in his home country as well as in the U.S. and elsewhere .
Opinion polls over the past two decades have found the American public deeply divided in its beliefs about the origins and development of life on earth .
Surveys are fairly consistent in their estimates of how many Americans believe in evolution or creationism .
Approximately 40 % - 50 % of the public accepts a biblical creationist account of the origins of life , while comparable or slightly larger numbers accept the idea that humans evolved over time .
The wording of survey questions generally makes little systematic difference in this division of opinion , and there has been little change in the percentage of the public who reject the idea of evolution .
Opinions on the theory of “ intelligent design , ” however , are far more complex , making it difficult to determine how many Americans subscribe to this view of life ’s origins .
In part , this reflects the public ’s lack of familiarity with the concept of intelligent design , which holds that Darwin ’s theory of natural selection is inadequate in explaining the development of complex life forms .
A Gallup survey in August of 2005 found that fewer than half of Americans were familiar with the term .
Moreover , because the concept involves sensitive matters of faith and science , questions that attempt to indirectly measure support for intelligent design produce divergent results .
Consider for example the approaches taken by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and Gallup ( see table below ) .
The two organizations find similar numbers in favor of a creationist position — 42 % for Pew Research , 44 % for Gallup — although each describes the concept in decidedly different terms .
But Pew Research finds far more people believing in natural selection ( 26 % vs. 14 % for Gallup ) while Gallup finds more subscribing to the view that God or a supreme being guided the evolutionary process ( 36 % vs. 21 % for Pew Research ) .
These differences result from the way the options are presented .
Gallup asks respondents to choose among three views , two of which suggest a belief in God ( “ God created human beings pretty much in the present form ” and “ God guided [ the evolutionary ] process ” ) , and one that rejects God ’s involvement altogether ( “ God had no part in this process ” ) .
It seems likely that for many respondents , agreeing with this last statement could imply a denial of belief in God .
Pew Research , on the other hand , asks people initially if they believe life “ evolved over time ” or existed in its “ present form since the beginning of time ” ; the question makes no mention of God .
Those who said that life evolved over time were then asked if life “ evolved due to natural processes such as natural selection ” or whether “ a supreme being guided the evolution of living things for the purpose of creating humans and other life in the form it exists today . ”
Pew Research ’s formulation provides a significantly more positive description of the scientific position by characterizing natural selection as “ a natural process ” rather than something “ God had no part in . ”
This implicitly allows people who believe that God or a supreme being set the evolutionary process in motion , or even shaped it in some way , to still opt for “ natural selection ” as the main engine of evolution .
Confusing Concepts
Most Americans say they are familiar with creationism and evolution , but recent polling suggests that there is some confusion about the meaning of these terms .
In an August 2005 Gallup poll , 58 % of the public said that creationism was definitely or probably true as an explanation for the origin and development of life , but about the same number also said the same about evolution .
Since creationism and evolution are incompatible as explanations , some portion of the public is clearly confused about the meaning of the terms .
A 1999 Fox News poll of registered voters offered respondents the explicit option to say that both Darwin ’s theory of evolution and the biblical account of creation were true : 26 % said both were .
More recently , a July 2005 Pew Research Center poll found that a substantial 35 % minority of those who accept creationist accounts of life ’s origins nonetheless oppose removing the teaching of evolution in public schools in favor of teaching creationism ; 14 % of those who accepted natural selection favored teaching creationism instead of evolution .
The term “ intelligent design ” is still unknown to much of the public .
In the August 2005 Gallup survey , 52 % said they were either “ not too familiar ” or “ not at all familiar ” with the phrase .
By comparison , far fewer were not familiar with “ evolution ” and “ creationism . ”
Given the low level of public awareness of the term , “ intelligent design ” is rarely mentioned in polling on the origins of life .
Scientists and Evolution
A majority of the public ( 62 % in a July 2006 Pew Research poll ) believes that scientists are generally in agreement about evolution .
But fewer believe there is strong scientific evidence in support of evolution .
A March 2007
Newsweek survey found just 48 % saying evolution was both widely accepted in the scientific community and well supported by evidence .
A 2004 Gallup poll registered fewer ( 35 % ) saying Darwin ’s theory of evolution has been “ well - supported by evidence . ”
This question also offered respondents the choice of saying they do n’t know enough about the issue , an option that 30 % selected .
Teach Evolution , Other Approaches
In recent years , decisions by school boards to teach alternative accounts of the origins of life have generated much controversy .
In 2005 , a federal district court struck down a Dover , Pa. school board requirement that teachers include the teaching of “ intelligent design ” in science classes .
However , polling finds that a solid majority of Americans over the past 20 years has supported the teaching of both evolution and creationist accounts of the origins of life .
A June 1999 Gallup / CNN / USA
Today poll found that 68 % of the public favored teaching creationism along with evolution in public schools .
A more recent Pew Research poll conducted in July 2006 found that a 58 % majority held that view .
There is far less support for removing evolution from the curriculum .
In July 2005 , a Pew Research poll found that a substantial 38 % minority favored teaching creationism instead of evolution .
Relatively few questions have asked if respondents believe that evolution should be taught , perhaps because it is the status quo today .
A Gallup poll found 61 % favoring the teaching of evolution in public school science classes , while 54 % said creationism should be taught and 43 % said that intelligent design should be taught .
A survey conducted by Fox News in 1999 found nearly identical majorities of people favoring the teaching of evolution and opposing its removal from the curriculum .
In one version of the question , respondents were told that the Kansas State Board of Education adopted new standards that would remove evolution from the mandatory curriculum ; a 57 % majority of registered voters disagreed with the board ’s actions , while 33 % agreed with the removal .
The other version stated that “ the National Academy of Sciences recommended that evolution be taught to all public school students as the most convincing theory for how human beings developed ” and then asked if respondents agreed or disagreed that evolution should be taught in all public schools : 56 % agreed with teaching evolution and 35 % disagreed with it .
Thus , despite the invocation of two very different kinds of authority on opposite sides of the issue , the public opinion result was the same .
None of the polls probes deeply into what respondents are thinking when they say a particular approach should be taught .
Should standardized science tests now include sections on both evolution and creationism ?
Does support for teaching evolution ( or creationism ) mean mandatory or optional instruction ?
Unfortunately there is little public opinion research to shed light on these questions .
Revised and updated from a Pollwatch published September 28 , 2005 .

Beginning on March 1 , residents of Gainesville , Florida with newly - installed solar photovoltaic systems will be able to receive $ 0.32 per kilowatt hour of electricity produced by their system and added to the regional grid .
Yawn , right ?
Wrong .
The so - called feed - in tariff will guarantee payment for any power produced over the subsequent 20 years .
For some , the feed - in tariff is a long time coming .
Advocates see the immediate potential the policy mechanism can have on growing renewable energy generation , as well as the impact said growth can have on the burgeoning solar , wind , and other clean energy industries .
Feed - in tariffs have been responsible for meteoric rise in renewable energy generation and the industries supporting it in Germany , Spain , and Denmark , but they have yet to take hold in the U.S. , largely because of the fragmented nature of our electricity generation and transmission .
>>
Want cheap solar ?
Join the most effective community solar purchasing program in the US .
States like Michigan and Illinois have debated the merits of a feed - in and a national feed - in tariff was proposed by Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) , but none have been passed by their respective legislatures .
Will the new Gainesville feed - in tariff be popular enough to stimulate growth in the renewable energy sector ?
Apparently , yes .
Ed Regan , assistant general manager of strategic planning for Gainesville Regional Utilities , told the Gainesville Sun that people are “ lining up ” to be the first recipients of the 20 - year contract .
The ordinance sets a maximum of 4 megawatts of solar per year that could take advantage of the new feed - in .
But considering the state of Florida only has two megawatts currently installed , 4 megawatts in the Gainesville area alone , is significant .

THE room is stuffy on a sunny spring afternoon , and many of those packed into it ( see above ) must have regretted bringing their coats .
The lucky ones have taken the few seats available .
The rest are crammed shoulder - to - shoulder in this hotel - room office , listening intently to an hour - and - a - half rant on the threat of American imperialism and how the global economic crisis will result in growing confrontation between China and the West .
Sitting in front of a large portrait of a young Mao Zedong , Zhang Hongliang knows how to play to his nationalist , liberal - despising audience .
His rambling discourse ranges from adulation of Mao to scorn of America ( it has neither history nor culture ) , to warning of a “ white terror ” if rightists ( liberals ) prevail .
The economic crisis is entirely the West 's fault , and as it deepens the West will turn on China .
Now is the time to build an aircraft - carrier .
A war with America would be “ lose - lose ” , but China should not be afraid of it .
China's “ leftists ” are becoming more active as the global economy sputters .
Mr Zhang belongs to an extreme fringe that pines for Maoist egalitarianism , state ownership and the certainty that America is an enemy .
His seminar was organised by Maoflag , one of a clutch of like - minded websites in China whose nationalist , pro-communist rhetoric is suffused with a sense of their country as victim , yearning for revenge .
Frequenters of these forums took heart from a flurry of spontaneous celebrations around the country in December to mark Mao 's 115th birthday .
The government preferred to play it down .
Few would suggest that radical Maoists are poised to make a comeback .
But their nationalism has a broad appeal .
As China surveys the world , with the West in financial turmoil and its leaders seemingly desperate for cash - rich China to come to its aid , it sees strategic opportunities .
Even before the financial crisis began to hit the country late last year , nationalism had been boiling up .
It was evident in public responses to the turmoil in Tibet in March , the West 's support for the Dalai Lama , and China 's sporting triumph at the Olympic games in Beijing in August .
Now a battered West presents a gratifying target for pent - up contempt .
Even the normally cautious government is beginning to flex a little muscle on the world stage .
For most of the past two decades ( flare - ups with Taiwan in 1995 - 96 and with America in 2001 excepted ) China has played a cautious game internationally .
Its approach was summed up in the pithy four - character phrases into which Chinese policymakers love to distil their thinking .
The late Deng Xiaoping came up with a string of them : China should keep a low profile , not take the lead , watch developments patiently and keep its capabilities hidden .
Now the global economic crisis and the West 's obvious weakness are causing officials to think again .
In public Chinese leaders still try to reassure .
During a visit to Europe in late January and early February , China 's prime minister , Wen Jiabao , stressed that China 's development was no threat to anyone .
It would be , he said at Cambridge University ( an event better remembered for the shoe lobbed in his direction by a protesting German student ) , a peaceful and co-operative great power .
Some sensitive Western diplomats pricked up their ears at the phrase “ great power ” , but it is one Mr Wen has used to describe China since well before the current crisis .
In deference to foreign feelings , an English text released by the government news agency , Xinhua , used the word “ country ” instead .
On the issue of Tibet , however , China has been digging in its heels .
Having conceded a little to Western opinion last year by holding three rounds of talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama in the wake of the unrest in March , China has lost interest .
A massive security clampdown has been imposed on the Tibetan plateau to prevent any protests during this month 's 50th anniversary of the uprising that caused the Dalai Lama to flee into exile in India .
Foreign journalists ( despite pleas for access ) have been shut out altogether .
In late February China gave a warm welcome to America 's secretary of state , Hillary Clinton .
It had reason to feel proud .
Here was an important American official clearly looking for China 's help .
Mrs Clinton — who once boasted how strongly she had emphasised human rights during a visit to Beijing in 1995 — was now suggesting that China 's bad record should not get in the way of co-operation on the financial crisis and global warming .
Mr Zhang at the Maoflag seminar certainly enjoyed her new , soft tone .
Two weeks after Mrs Clinton 's departure , Chinese boats ( according to the Pentagon ) harassed an unarmed American ship , the Impeccable , in the South China Sea .
The ship was a mere 75 miles ( 120 km ) off China 's coast and was probably on the lookout for Chinese submarines .
But much as China objects , the American navy frequently deploys in international waters off China to monitor military activities .
In this case Chinese responded more aggressively than usual , surrounding the American ship and trying to stop it from withdrawing .
America later sent a guided - missile destroyer to protect the Impeccable .
A cautious poke
China clearly does not want to push this too far , mindful perhaps of the huge crisis in relations that occurred in 2001 when a Chinese fighter jet crashed into an American spyplane , forcing it to land at a Chinese airbase .
The American crew was held for 11 days .
This time China 's response was to send a fishery patrol ship ( hardly a match for a destroyer ) to the area .
But Shi Yinhong of Renmin University says the latest incident is a sign of new robustness in China 's dealing with the West .
Though China may be unwilling to give America more than a cautious poke , it is a different story with Europe .
Its abrupt decision to cancel a summit with the European Union scheduled for last December showed that , even amid the global crisis , it was prepared to deliver a powerful snub to leaders of its biggest trading partner .
The reason was a meeting between France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , and the Dalai Lama ( France then held the EU presidency ) .
The EU and China have agreed to reschedule their summit for later this year , but Mr Sarkozy is not yet forgiven .
Wen Jiabao , the prime minister , avoided France during his recent European tour .
“ I looked at a map of Europe on the plane .
My trip goes around France , ” he said .
Deng 's advice on avoiding taking the lead has by no means been jettisoned .
China has reacted coolly to suggestions that a solution to the world 's economic problems lies essentially in the hands of two powers , China and America — what some call the G2 .
Fred Bergsten , of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , raised the idea in an article in Foreign Affairs last July .
China , he argued , was continuing to act “ like a small country with little impact on the global system at large and therefore little responsibility for it ” .
Even well before the current crisis , China had been posing an increasing challenge to international rules and institutions , Mr Bergsten said : blocking progress in the Doha round of global trade talks , aiding foreign countries without regard to human rights or the environment and resisting adoption of a flexible exchange - rate policy .
Better , he suggested , that China and America work together as a G2 “ to provide joint leadership of the global economic system ” .
The head of the World Bank , Robert Zoellick , and its chief economist , Justin Yifu Lin , warmed to the G2 idea in an article in the Washington Post on March 6th .
Though they did not repeat Mr Bergsten 's criticism of Chinese “ recalcitrance ” , they said that “ without a strong G2 , the G20 will disappoint ” .
But some Chinese officials see a trap .
Liaowang , a magazine published by Xinhua , said Chinese scholars believed the idea “ would do harm rather than good ” .
America would never cede control of the world order , and in any case China would never seek to exert hegemony .
China certainly delights in the notion that its global power is growing .
As one Western diplomat put it , the meeting between President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart , Hu Jintao , in the margins of the G20 summit in London on April 2nd will be far more important than the G20 meeting itself .
China stole the limelight at the last G20 summit by announcing a 4 trillion yuan ( $ 565 billion ) stimulus package just before it .
Rumours continue to circulate that it has another up its sleeve .
That would please everyone .
But China is not ( yet , anyway ) seeking to knock America off its perch .
It is pushing for a greater say for itself and other developing countries in the IMF , over which the Americans , in effect , wield a veto .
But it is not demanding a veto of its own .
At a press conference on March 13th Mr Wen avoided saying whether China would give more funding to the IMF to strengthen its ability to deal with the financial crisis .
How much China gives , diplomats believe , will depend on how much of a say it gets .
An article in the official China Daily newspaper on March 17th quoted an influential Chinese economist , Yu Yongding , as saying China should not give much to the IMF — not least because certain countries on the IMF 's rescue list , particularly some from Europe , had an “ anti-China mentality ” .
Buying into America
Some Chinese scholars and commentators have been circulating more radical visions of how China should use the current crisis to boost its strategic influence .
A recent article in Economic Reference , a journal published by a government think - tank , said the crisis would severely weaken the economic , political , military and diplomatic power of developed countries .
This would create an “ historic opportunity ” for China to strengthen its position .
China should export capital to South - East Asian countries to strengthen their economies .
By so doing , it would help prevent political turmoil and win strategic influence in the region .
In America , the article suggested , China should buy up businesses in order to acquire sophisticated know - how .
If the American government balks at this , “ the Chinese government absolutely can use its American dollar savings as a bargaining chip to force the American government to agree to China 's acquisitions . ”
Diplomats say threats have even been heard from lower - ranking Chinese officials that China might sell off American Treasury bills if Washington angers China on Tibet ; a meeting between Mr Obama and the Dalai Lama , for example , could be a tripwire .
Few believe that China would actually risk such a self - damaging tactic , but the airing of views like this suggests that some officials are acquiring more swagger .
China 's decision on March 18th to use anti-monopoly legislation to block Coca - Cola 's $ 2.4 billion bid for Huiyuan , a Chinese juice manufacturer , will be seen as evidence of this by some in America ( see article ) .
This self - assurance was on show , too , during a visit to Latin America by Vice - President Xi Jinping in February .
During a meeting in Mexico with overseas Chinese , Mr Xi , who is widely believed to be the heir - apparent to President Hu Jintao , accused “ well - fed foreigners with nothing better to do ” of “ pointing fingers ” at China .
His country , Mr Xi said , was not exporting revolution or poverty or hunger or “ messing around ” with other countries , “ so what else is there to say ? ”
Mr Xi's more diplomatic colleagues thought this was an outburst too far ; though nationalist websites exulted , the domestic media were banned from reporting his comments .
Chinese leaders have been at particular pains to avoid giving the impression that China is wavering in its commitment to market capitalism ( albeit with a heavy admixture of government control ) .
But China 's own economy is being battered by the turmoil .
Officials estimate that some 20 m migrant workers have lost their jobs as labour - intensive industries , churning out cheap products for export , put up their shutters .
White - collar workers are beginning to suffer , too .
Some are being laid off and many more having their bonuses and wages cut .
China 's leaders still say the country can achieve 8 % growth this year , down from 9 % last year ; the World Bank , forecasting growth of only 6.5 % , still notes that China is “ a relative bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economy ” .
But the boom times are definitely over .
Adam Smith 's disciples
Throughout the crisis China 's leaders have railed against the dangers of protectionism , knowing that trade with the West is vital .
Much to the chagrin of China 's online leftists , Mr Wen has repeatedly sung the praises of Adam Smith in speeches and meetings with journalists .
In London he revealed to the Financial Times that he was carrying Smith 's “ The Theory of Moral Sentiments ” in his suitcase .

Hillary and Wen , great powers co-operating
As Mr Wen explains it , an important message of this book is that if the fruits of economic development are not shared by all , that is “ morally unsound ” , as well as a threat to social stability .
This view resonates powerfully among the many Chinese who are embittered by the very uneven distribution of the fruits of China 's own rapid growth .
Chinese leaders may be able to score points at home for standing up to their Western counterparts .
But they know they are vulnerable to criticism that they are not doing enough to help Chinese victims of the economic slowdown .
By emphasising this aspect of Smith 's philosophy , Mr Wen is trying to show he cares .
The government , however , does not want China to be roiled by the same debate that is plaguing Western governments over how to handle the crisis .
This month 's annual session of the National People 's Congress , China 's parliament , was convened for only nine days instead of the usual two weeks .
Although even the official media wanted more details of spending plans , the government - set agenda was strikingly sparse .
The parliamentary chairman , Wu Bangguo , used the occasion to launch a lengthy tirade against Western - style democracy .
“ Leadership by the Party can only be strengthened and in no way weakened , ” he told the delegates .
For Mr
Wu to get so worked up , serious voices must have been suggesting otherwise .
But few new details of the stimulus measures were revealed at the congress .
The government airily said that details of a separate massive spending programme on health - care reform ( 850 billion yuan over three years ) would be finalised only after the parliamentary session .
In a cursory nod to public concern , it revealed that spending on welfare projects would be increased from 1 % to 4 % of the stimulus package ( see chart ) .
Spending on infrastructure would drop from 45 % to 38 % .
But spending on environmental projects would also be cut from 9 % to 5 % .
China 's commitment to greenness appears to be ebbing .
The left does have some cause for celebration .
State - owned enterprises ( SOEs ) will be huge beneficiaries of the stimulus spending ( Maoflag 's supporters are still in uproar about the dismantling of many of China 's SOEs a decade ago ) .
But liberal economists in China fret that state - owned banks and their SOE cronies will carve up the spoils , leaving small and medium private enterprises by the wayside .
They also worry that reforms may stall .
The China Institute for Reform and Development , a prominent liberal think - tank , has just published a 171 - page report entitled “ The International Financial Crisis Challenges Reforms in China ” .
It describes the economic crisis as the biggest problem the country has faced in the 30 - year history of its reform - and - opening policy ( and it has faced some big ones , not least the Tiananmen protests of 1989 , the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 and the SOE restructuring which threw millions out of work ) .
The report says that , without further market - oriented reforms , the stimulus package will not only fail to achieve its goal but will also store up long - term problems .
In need of change , it says , are government controls on prices of water and power and government monopolies in industries such as telecoms , railways and aviation .
It calls for faster financial reforms such as encouraging the development of non-state financial institutions , freeing controls on interest rates and allowing the yuan to float .
On March 13th , at the end of the parliamentary session , Mr Wen said that to counter the crisis China “ would rather speed up reforms ” .
He said it should “ give full play to market forces in allocating resources ” and encourage the development of the private sector .
It must also , he said , carry on with political reforms in order to “ guarantee people 's freedom and rights ” .
But the economic crisis will not have increased officials ' appetite for change .
Many will be all the more convinced that the government 's big role in the economy ( not least its ownership of the banks ) and the country 's one - party system ( where else could a government announce such big spending plans without time - wasting debate ? ) are a help , not a hindrance .
It is more likely that , as the crisis deepens , the government will become increasingly cautious in its approach to domestic policy .
But if protectionism grows in Western countries , Chinese nationalists will be all the more inclined to demand that their government stand up to them .
A book published in China this month , “ Unhappy China ” ( with an initial print - run of 70,000 , says a publicist ) , aims to tap into what the authors believe is a widespread public feeling of disgruntlement with the West .
One of the essays argues that the financial crisis could result in an envious
West going to war with China to keep it down .
Few are quite that gloomy .
One of the book 's authors ( speaking in a branch of Starbucks in a luxury mall ) says the government worries about books like this because they fuel suspicions in the West that China is a threat .
The publishers removed one part about India 's annexation of Sikkim in 1975 because they thought it might upset India .
China would like to be number one , but it would still rather get there without making big enemies .
Is your representative speaking out against escalation of the Afghanistan war ?
Last week , some members of Congress sent President Obama a letter that urged him to “ reconsider ” his order deploying 17,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
Everyone in the House of Representatives had ample opportunity to sign onto the letter .
Beginning in late February , it circulated on Capitol Hill for more than two weeks .
The letter was the most organized congressional move so far to challenge escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
But the list of signers was awfully short .
California : Bob Filner , Michael Honda
Hawaii : Neil Abercrombie
Kentucky : Ed Whitfield
Maryland : Roscoe Bartlett
Massachusetts : Jim McGovern
Michigan : John Conyers
North Carolina : Howard Coble , Walter Jones
Ohio : Marcy Kaptur , Dennis Kucinich
Tennessee : John Duncan
Texas : Ron Paul
Wisconsin : Steve Kagen
We desperately need a substantive national debate on U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
While the Obama administration says that the problems of the region cannot be solved by military means , the basic approach is reliance on heightened military means .
One of several journalists in Afghanistan on a tour “ organized by the staff of commanding Gen. David D. McKiernan , ” the Washington Post ‘s Jackson Diehl , wrote a March 23 op - ed in support of an invigorated “ counterinsurgency strategy . ”
With journalistic resolve , he explained : “ Everyone expects a surge of violence and American casualties this year ; no one expects a decisive improvement in the situation for at least several years beyond that . ”
The commanding general , Diehl added , does not anticipate that the Afghan army “ can defend the country on its own ” until 2016 .
In effect , the message is to stay the course for another seven years :
“ The thousands of American soldiers and civilians pouring into the country deserve that strategic patience ; without it , the sacrifices we will soon hear of will be wasted . ”
And so , with chillingly familiar echoes , goes the perverse logic of escalating the war in Afghanistan .
“ Strategic patience ”  more and more war  will be necessary so that those who must die will not have died in vain .
In contrast , the letter from the 14 members of the House ( eight Democrats , six Republicans ) lays down a clear line of opposition to the rationales for stepping up the warfare .
“ If the intent is to leave behind a stable Afghanistan capable of governing itself , this military escalation may well be counterproductive , ” the letter says .
And it warns that “ any perceived military success in Afghanistan might create pressure to increase military activity in Pakistan .
This could very well lead to dangerous destabilization in the region and would increase hostility toward the United States . ”
More than 400 members of the House declined to sign the letter .
In effect , they failed to join in a historic challenge to a prevailing assumption  that the U.S. government must use massive violence for many more years to try to work Washington ’s will on Afghanistan .
An old red - white - and - blue bumper sticker says : “ These colors do n’t run . ”
A newer one says : “ These colors do n’t run the world . ”
Now , it ’s time for another twist : “ These colors wo n’t run Afghanistan . ”
But denial and evasion are in the political air .
In order to go into Taoism at all , we must begin by being in the frame of mind in which it can be understood .
You cannot force yourself into this frame of mind , anymore than you can smooth disturbed water with your hand .
But let 's say that our starting point is that we forget what we know , or think we know , and that we suspend judgment about practically everything , returning to what we were when we were babies when we had not yet learned the names or the language .
And in this state , although we have extremely sensitive bodies and very alive senses , we have no means of making an intellectual or verbal commentary on what is going on .
You are just plain ignorant , but still very much alive , and in this state you just feel what is without calling it anything at all .
You know nothing at all about anything called an external world in relation to an internal world .
You do n't know who you are , you have n't even the idea of the word you or I -- it is before all that .
Nobody has taught you self control , so you do n't know the difference between the noise of a car outside and a wandering thought that enters your mind - they are both something that happens .
You do n't identify the presence of a thought that may be just an image of a passing cloud in your mind 's eye or the passing automobile ; they happen .
Your breath happens .
Light , all around you , happens .
Your response to it by blinking happens .
So , on one hand you are simply unable to do anything , and on the other there is nothing you are supposed to do .
Nobody has told you anything to do .
You are completely unable to do anything but be aware of the buzz .
The visual buzz , the audible buzz , the tangible buzz , the smellable buzz -- all around the buzz is going on .
Watch it .
Do n't ask who is watching it ; you have no information about that yet .
You do n't know that it requires a watcher for something to be watched .
That is somebody 's idea ; but you do n't know that .
Lao - tzu says , " The scholar learns something every day , the man of Tao unlearns something every day , until he gets back to non-doing . "
Just simply , without comment , without an idea in your head , be aware .
What else can you do ?
You do n't try to be aware ; you are .
You will find , of course , that you can not stop the commentary going on inside your head , but at least you can regard it as interior noise .
Listen to your chattering thoughts as you would listen to the singing of a kettle .
We do n't know what it is we are aware of , especially when we take it altogether , and there 's this sense of something going on .
I can't even really say ' this , ' although I said ' something going on . '
But that is an idea , a form of words .
Obviously I could n't say something is going on unless I could say something else is n't .
I know motion by contrast with rest , and while I am aware of motion I am also aware of at rest .
So maybe what 's at rest is n't going and what 's in motion is going , but I wo n't use that concept then because in order for it to make sense I have to include both .
If I say here it is , that excludes what is n't , like space .
If I say this , it excludes that , and I am reduced to silence .
But you can feel what I am talking about .
That 's what is called Tao , in Chinese .
That 's where we begin .
Tao means basically " way " , and so " course " ; the course of nature .
Lao - tzu said the way of the functioning of the Tao is " so of itself " ; that is to say it is spontaneous .
Watch again what is going on .
If you approach it with this wise ignorance , you will see that you are witnessing a happening .
In other words , in this primal way of looking at things there is no difference between what you do , on the one hand , and what happens to you on the other .
It is all the same process .
Just as your thought happens , the car happens outside , and so the clouds and the stars .
When a Westerner hears that he thinks this is some sort of fatalism or determinism , but that is because he still preserves in the back of his mind two illusions .
One is that what is happening is happening to him , and therefore he is the victim of circumstances .
But when you are in primal ignorance there is no you different from what is happening , and therefore it is not happening to you .
It is just happening .
So is " you " , or what you call you , or what you will later call you .
It is part of the happening , and you are part of the universe , although strictly speaking the universe has no parts .
We only call certain features of the universe parts .
However you can't disconnect them from the rest without causing them to be not only non-existent , but to never to have existed at all .
When a one experiences oneself and the universe happening together , the other illusion one is liable to have is that it is determined in the sense that what is happening now follows necessarily from what happened in the past .
But you do n't know anything about that in your primal ignorance .
Cause and effect ?
Why obviously not , because if you are really naive you see the past is the result of what is happening now .
It goes backwards into the past , like a wake goes backwards from a ship .
All the echoes are disappearing finally , they go away , and away , and away .
And it is all starting now .
What we call the future is nothing , the great void , and everything comes out of the great void .
If you shut your eyes , and contemplate reality only with your ears , you will find there is a background of silence , and all sounds are coming out of it .
They start out of silence .
If you close your eyes , and just listen , you will observe the sounds came out of nothing , floated off , and off , stopped being a sonic echo , and became a memory , which is another kind of echo .
It is very simple ; it all begins now , and therefore it is spontaneous .
It is n't determined ; that is a philosophical notion .
Nor is it capricious ; that 's another philosophical notion .
We distinguish between what is orderly and what is random , but of course we do n't really know what randomness is .
What is ' so - of - itself , ' sui generis in Latin , means coming into being spontaneously on its own accord , and that , incidentally , is the real meaning of virgin birth .
That is the world , that is the Tao , but perhaps that makes us feel afraid .
We may ask , " If all that is happening spontaneously , who 's in charge ?
I am not in charge , that is pretty obvious , but I hope there is God or somebody looking after all this . "
But why should there be someone looking after it , because then there is a new worry that you may not have thought of , which is , " Who takes care of the caretaker 's daughter while the caretaker is busy taking care ? "
Who guards the guards ?
Who supervises the police ?
Who looks after God ?
You may say " God does n't need looking after " Oh ?
Well , nor does this .
The Tao is a certain kind of order , and this kind of order is not quite what we call order when we arrange everything geometrically in boxes , or in rows .
That is a very crude kind of order , but when you look at a plant it is perfectly obvious that the plant has order .
We recognize at once that is not a mess , but it is not symmetrical and it is not geometrical looking .
The plant looks like a Chinese drawing , because they appreciated this kind of non-symmetrical order so much that it became an integral aspect of their painting .
In the Chinese language this is called li , and the character for li means the markings in jade .
It also means the grain in wood and the fiber in muscle .
We could say , too , that clouds have li , marble has li , the human body has li .
We all recognize it , and the artist copies it whether he is a landscape painter , a portrait painter , an abstract painter , or a non -objective painter .
They all are trying to express the essence of li .
The interesting thing is , that although we all know what it is , there is no way of defining it .
Because Tao is the course , we can also call li the watercourse , and the patterns of li are also the patterns of flowing water .
We see those patterns of flow memorialized , as it were , as sculpture in the grain in wood , which is the flow of sap , in marble , in bones , in muscles .
All these things are patterned according to the basic principles of flow .
In the patterns of flowing water you will all kind of motifs from Chinese art , immediately recognizable , including the S - curve in the circle of yang - yin .
So li means then the order of flow , the wonderful dancing pattern of liquid , because Lao - tzu likens Tao to water :
The great Tao flows everywhere , to the left and to the right ,
It loves and nourishes all things , but does not lord it over them .
For as he comments elsewhere , water always seeks the lowest level , which men abhor , because we are always trying to play games of one - upmanship , and be on top of each other .
But Lao - tzu explains that the top position is the most insecure .
Everybody wants to get to the top of the tree , but then if they do the tree will collapse .
That is the fallacy of American society .
Lao - tzu says the basic position is the most powerful , and this we can see at once in Judo , or in Aikido .
These are self - defensive arts where you always get underneath the opponent , so he falls over you if he attacks you .
The moment he moves to be aggressive you go either lower than he is , or in a smaller circle than he is moving .
And you have spin , if you know Aikido .
You are always spinning , and you know how something spinning exercises centrifugal force , and if someone comes into your field of centrifugal force he then gets flung out , but by his own bounce .
It is very curious .
So , therefore , the watercourse way is the way of Tao .
Now , that seems to white Anglo - Saxon Protestants , lazy , spineless , and altogether passive .
I am always being asked when I talk about things , " If people did what you suggest would n't they become terribly passive ? "
Well , from a superficial point of view I would suggest that a certain amount of passivity would be an excellent corrective for our kind of culture because we are always creating trouble by doing good to other people .
We wage wars for other peoples benefit , and attempt to help those living in " underdeveloped " counties , not realizing that in the process we may destroy their way of life .
Economies and cultures that have coexisted in ecological balance for thousands of years have been disrupted all around the world , with often disastrous results .
Alan Watts

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela has cut ties with Israel in protest over its military offensive in the Gaza Strip , the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday .
Last week President Hugo Chavez expelled Israel ’s ambassador from Venezuela over the attacks , which have sparked international condemnation .
“ Venezuela ... has definitively decided to break diplomatic ties with the state of Israel given the inhumane persecution of the Palestinian people carried out by the authorities of Israel , ” said a statement read over state television .
Israel ’s 20 - day offensive , launched to halt rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas Islamist militants , has killed more than 1,000 Palestinians .
A Palestinian rights group said 670 of those killed were civilians .
Thirteen Israelis have been killed -- three civilians hit by Hamas rocket fire and 10 soldiers .
Socialist Chavez is a harsh critic of both Israel and the United States and has called the Israeli offensive in Gaza a Palestinian “ holocaust . ”
Bolivian President Evo Morales , a close Chavez ally , on Wednesday also cut ties with Israel to the protest the attacks .
An envoy from Israel , which is under increasing pressure to negotiate a ceasefire , is scheduled to meet Egyptian mediators in Cairo on Thursday .
Chavez in 2006 threatened to break ties with Israel over its five - week war in Lebanon in a diplomatic spat that led both countries to withdraw their envoys .
The police is looking for a doctor in connection with the outbreak A mass vaccination of some 60,000 people has begun in India 's western Gujarat state to ward off an outbreak of hepatitis B , officials say .
In the past fortnight , 43 people have died of the disease in Sabarkantha district , officials said .
Police are looking for a doctor who allegedly gave injections to many of the patients without changing syringes .
The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person .
The virus can be transmitted via unprotected sex or sharing of contaminated needles .
Pregnant mothers also tend to pass it on to their babies .
Absconding Sabarkantha district official M Thennarasan told the BBC another 80 people had been admitted to a local hospital with symptoms of hepatitis B .
He said that nearly 56,000 people in Modasa town , where people have been infected with the virus , had been vaccinated by government doctors on Monday .
The remaining 4,000 people in the town would be vaccinated on Tuesday , he said .
Federal and state health authorities are investigating the cause of the outbreak .
Early investigations had revealed that some of the patients had received injections from a local doctor who ran a clinic in the town a few months ago , Mr Thennarasan said .
" Some patients have said that the doctor had not changed syringes or used disposable ones during the injections . "
Police are looking for the absconding doctor and his clinic had been sealed .
" This could be one of the reasons behind the spread of the disease in the town .
We cannot rule out other reasons , " Mr Thennarasan said .
Earlier , officials said that there was " no pattern " in the class and work profile of the patients .
The virus can cause fever , fatigue , muscle or joint pain , loss of appetite , nausea and vomiting .
Chronic carriers have an increased risk of developing liver disease such as cirrhosis or liver cancer , because the hepatitis B virus steadily attacks the liver .

I know many of you have been waiting for this one , so here it is !
USA , USA , I 've been meaning to interview Glen Cook ever since I read Chronicles of the Black Company ( Canada Europe ) .
And I 'm just about done with The Books of the South ( Canada Europe ) , so the timing could n't be better !
Enjoy !
------------------------
- Without giving anything away , what can you tell you readers about your Black Company sequence ?
It could be a generational thing or some different way of looking at what writers do , but I do n’t understand this questions at all .
The books are there .
They are the answer .
What could be given away ?
What else needs to be said ?
Maybe you could clarify what you are asking .
- How satisfying is it to see both the Black Company and The Books of the South being reissued as omnibus editions by Tor Books two decades after their initial release ?
What about the Dread Empire omnibus editions from Night Shade Books ?
I really loathed the Black Company omnibus idea .
The books were all in print , all the time , in a format that fit peoples ’ bookshelves .
But they have been successful commercially .
The first one has been through five printings already .
The Night Shade Dread Empire omnibuses I favored because they were bringing into print books that had been gone for years .
- Will the Glittering Stone sequence get the same treatment in the near future ?
I do n’t know .
A lot of my stuff I find out about when someone asks me to sign a copy .
- What can you tell potential readers about the Instrumentalities of the Night series ?
Are there any sequels in the works ?
The setting of the series is a sort of alternate 13th century Europe shaped by counterfactual geography and the presence of ambient magical energy that makes possible the existence of all gods and devils .
It ’s also an experiment with a picaresque plot .
In addition to the 2 published titles there will be SURRENDER TO THE WILL OF THE NIGHT ( done and turned in ) and WORKING THE GODS ’ MISCHIEF , which is about halfway done .
- Tell us more about your Garrett P. I. novels .
Pretty vague query .
The books are American P. I. but set in the fantasy city of TunFaire , where all Garrett ’s cases involve the fantastic .
- What do you feel is your strength as a writer / storyteller .
I do n’t know if I have an answer .
I do n’t think about that kind of stuff .
Some people tell me it ’s plot , others character .
- If you could go back in time , what advice would you give the younger Glen Cook concerning his writing career ?
Use all the money he makes to buy Microsoft stock .
And maybe to be nicer to his wife .
Being married to a writer is n‘t easy .
- The Black Company saga has gained what can best be described as a cult following .
Since it never became “ mainstream ” , how rewarding is it to realize how successful the series has been and continues to be to this day ?
This was one of those queries I do n’t quite get .
I do like the fact that the Black Company series has never been out of print .
I am particularly pleased that it has done remarkably well overseas , whence most of my writing income springs .
- What was the spark that generated the idea that drove you to write the Black Company books in the first place ?
There was no special spark .
I get ideas .
I write some of them .
The only thing unusual here was that the viewpoint started out as that of “ the bad guys . ”
- Characters often take on a life of their own .
Which of your characters do you find the most unpredictable to write about ?
The inhabitants of the Garrett Files series are the most willful and rambunctious .
When they get moving I just sit back and let them run .
They never go where I think they should when I start .
Not one of those books is the one I set out to write .
- Were there any perceived conventions of the fantasy genre which you wanted to twist or break when you set out each Black Company series ?
( There is only one Black Company series .
The subtitle crap was made up by the publisher ) No .
Other than to tell the story from the viewpoint of the grunts , which was not some conscious Wow !
Would n’t this be a kickass twist ?
kind of decision .
I ’ve never seen the Black Company series as especially different .
Some people seem to disagree .
- In retrospect , is it safe to say that the genre was n’t quite ready for the Black Company sequence in the mid 80s ?
Fantasy was dominated by powerhouses such as David Eddings , Terry Brooks , and Raymond E. Feist at the time .
Looking back , was your series too avante - garde in style and tone ?
Another question I do n’t understand .
The world must have been ready for whatever people see as different because they never went out of print and my editors constantly carped at me to write faster .
The books are still selling well .
How about those other guys ?
- You have been writing novels and short stories for over three decades .
What has changed the most in the fantasy genre since you began your career ?
I do n’t know , except maybe the guys who made their names rewriting LORD OF THE RINGS are n’t doing so well these days .
I ’m no J. D. Salinger but neither do I pay attention to what others are doing .
I write books .
I send them to my agent .
He finds somebody to publish them .
Oh .
I have noticed that books got a lot fatter for a while , but now they ’re slimming down .
- Have the plotlines diverged much since you began writing the Black Company books , or did you have the entire plot more or less figured out from the very beginning ?
Were any characters added or further fleshed out beyond your original intentions ?
Have you made any changes to your initial plans during the course of the three series ?
After thinking about it for several days I think I have figured out what you ’re asking here .
Firstly , the Black Company started out to be a single book , that would be a novel made up of a series of novelettes .
Only one of those got published independently before my agent sold the book to Tor .
The editor there did not like the characters at all .
But she said she could n’t get the book out of her head .
So we got drunk and rowdy and worked out an agreement that I would make it a trilogy .
But the time I finished THE WHITE ROSE I knew where the story would go from there , vaguely , all the way to the end of GLITTERING STONE .
Which I expected to be one book the size of the others , but which needed six , some very fat .
I do not outline .
I usually start out with a vague notion of where I want to get and let the interactions of my characters get me there .
- Many fantasy writers do n’t read within the genre .
Is it the case with you ?
If not , what authors make you shake your head in admiration ?
Other than Steven Erikson I read nothing that resembles what I write .
Fantasy folk whose books I attack the day they come out include Tom Holt , Terry Pratchett , Diana Wynne Jones , and Tamora Pierce .
- More and more , authors / editors / publicists / agents are discovering the potential of the all SFF blogs / websites / message boards on the internet .
Do you keep an eye on what is being discussed out there , especially if it concerns you ?
Or is this too much of a distraction ?
No .
I do n’t think I could figure out how to go find something like that , anyway .
It sounds like a huge waste of time all round .
When I have time to fritter I watch a ball game , CSI , or maybe indulge one of my secret vices , like Power Rangers or InuYasha .
Or I read a book .
- Cover art has become a very hot topic of late .
What are your thoughts pertaining to that facet of a novel , and what do you think of the covers that grace your books ?
I generally hold my nose and try not to cry too much .
You have no control .
If you ’re really lucky you get an art director who will let you use Vaseline when he bends you over .
That said , I have had some fine covers .
The Hildebrandts on the first 6 Garrett books .
The covers for the French first editions of the Black Company books by Didier Graffet are genius .
The covers for the first 6 Black Company books here , because they were painted by a very good friend .
Though they ’re a little primitive they do have some actual connection with what is inside .
A few others .
Generally speaking , cover art is worse overseas .
- L. E. Modesitt , Jr. , once claimed that Tom Doherty is one of the most under appreciated men in fantasy .
Do you agree with his assessment ?
I would n’t know if Tom is under appreciated by others .
I love the man myself .
He and his crew have been very good to me .
He seems to have brought forward a goodly number of both excellent writers and writers who have been big commercial successes .
- Honestly , do you believe that the fantasy genre will ever come to be recognized as veritable literature ?
Truth be told , in my opinion there has never been this many good books / series as we have right now , and yet there is still very little respect ( not to say none ) associated with the genre .
For me this is a great steaming shovel full of I do n’t care .
Good stuff will stick around .
Not so good wo n’t .
Some professor pulling his intellectual pud over it is n’t relevant .
Jack London and Charles Dickens , Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft , were all hacks .
And they ’re all in print today .
And , for the most part , still scorned by the mutual masturbators of the literati .
From my seat high on the mountainside I think too many people associated with fantasy take the whole thing far too seriously .
A failing of Americans in general .
We all seem to be able to find a thing or two that we will insist on taking too seriously .
- How would you like to be remembered as an author ?
What is the legacy you ’ll leave behind ?
Continuing the “ too seriously ” theme , the answer here is , I really do n’t care .
I hope there ’ll be enough residual royalties to provide some extra income for my wife .
Otherwise , I expect to go the way of Bulwer - Lyton … although , come to think , he did bequeath us “ It was a dark and stormy night . ”
Maybe there is something like that somewhere in my stuff .
- What project will you be tackling next ?
Projects in hand include the final Instrumentalities book , WORKING THE GODS ’ MISCHIEF , the next Garrett novel , working title GILDEN LATTEN LOVE ( RS ) , a new Dread Empire novel , working title A PATH TO COLDNESS OF HEART , and a Black Company novel entitled PORT OF SHADOWS .
- Anything you wish to share with your fans ?
Thank you .
Stop taking it so damned seriously .
And get out there and buy backup copies of my stuff .
I have kids in college .

Au sez , " I just published a short interview with the Purchase Brothers , the Toronto guys who made that great ' Escape from City 17 ' movie featured on Boing Boing last week .
They explain more how they did it , and what they spent their $ 500 budget on .
As it turns out , that 's 500 * Canadian * dollars , so even less than most of us first assumed . "
He said all of the visual effects were done from scratch .
Many of the elements ( the background , the gunships , etc. ) were extracted from Half - Life 2 , then graphically enhanced , and incorporated into the live action with " a lot of complicated tracking and rotoscoping . "
Though the movie itself was made independently of Valve Software , the developers and publishers of the Half - Life franchise , David said the game company got involved with its promotion , plugging its premiere on Valve 's user community channel , Steam News .
The brothers plan to release part two of City 17 in 6 - 8 weeks , though the storm of attention over part one has delayed that somewhat .
" We have been getting a ton of emails and phone calls , which has slowed things down , " said David .
Judging from the brief teaser clips at the cliffhanger end of the first video , a spunky heroine joins the team – as do hordes of headcrab zombies .
( The Purchases promise to reveal details about their cast after that goes online . )
Metro gets another quarter from you — starting yesterday .

Sorry to any CHS readers caught unawares and left scrambling for change on the bus .
I ’m not a passholder but occasionally use the bus when I ’m out chasing news .
Using cash usually means a discount , btw .
I ca n’t remember the last time a driver wanted to wait for me to fumble another dollar bill into the slot .

Jiri Paroubek , the leader of the Social Democrats in the Czech Parliament , who called Tuesday ’s vote of no confidence against Mr. Topolanek , accused him of making an undiplomatic gaffe .
“ In my view , it is extremely impolite and undiplomatic toward President Obama , who we will host in less than two weeks ’ time , ” he said .
Europeans themselves are well aware of the leadership problem , having painfully negotiated a new constitution , which European voters rejected .
They then forged the Lisbon Treaty , which will create a permanent European president and foreign minister , and which was supposed to go into effect on Jan .
1 . But the Lisbon Treaty , which requires the votes of all member states , was rejected by Irish voters last June , giving the Czechs their turn in the six - month rotating presidency .
While the Irish are expected to vote again in the fall , Mr. Topolanek ’s own government has not ratified the treaty , either .
Even though he is likely to remain in office through June , when the Czech presidency of the union ends , his government ’s defeat will make it harder to ratify the treaty .
The Irish foreign minister , Micheal Martin , said in Dublin that the Czech problems would make Ireland ’s effort to ratify “ a bit more complex . ”
Mr. Topolanek ’s remarks were considered impolitic , with the German leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament , Martin Schulz , telling him , “ You have not understood what the task of the E.U. presidency is , ” and describing his comments as “ not the level on which the E.U. ought to be operating with the United States . ”
A Czech spokesman said that Mr. Topolanek meant to say that the European Union would be on the way to hell if it increased its own spending too much , rather than predicting that the United States was doomed .
Mr. Topolanek is not alone in his concern that Mr. Obama ’s stimulus package , which will push the United States budget deficit this year to 10 percent or more of gross domestic product , will put a huge strain on global financial markets .
German officials have also criticized the evolving American program , and many other European nations have declined to create fiscal stimulus programs anywhere near as large as that of the United States , arguing that too much extra money will lead quickly to inflation .
There are also disagreements between the United States and the Europeans about how much emphasis to place on fiscal stimulus as opposed to enhanced regulation of finance and tax havens .
Even so , participants have been making progress on a communiqué that will signal a rough consensus on principles in London on April 2 , officials from both sides say .

The service will be available later in the year and charge a monthly fee After seven years in stealth mode , a Silicon Valley start - up has launched a " revolutionary " video game service that offers new competition to consoles .
OnLive , which launched at the Game Developer Conference , promises to deliver on - demand video games via the cloud to the PC , Mac or TV .
The company said it could provide high quality gaming on low end machines .
" We think this moment , this day will be remembered as the beginning of a new era , " said OnLive boss Steve Perlman .
" This is huge .
This is transparent cloud computing .
This is really really important for the industry .
The MicroConsole connects the TV to the internet " This will open up creativity , allow for new experiences and new kinds of expression that have never been available before , " Mr Perlman told an audience of analysts , industry types and journalists at a ritzy unveiling of the product at San Francisco 's Museum of Modern Art .
The innovation behind OnLive rests in its video compression technology which instantly streams video via the internet so that it appears " effectively instantaneously " .
" Perpetually , it appears the game is playing locally . "
The reality is that all the heavy lifting is done by remote data centres that can be up to a thousand miles away while players use a simple PC or TV hooked up to a broadband connection .
This removes the need for paying hundreds of dollars for traditional disc - based consoles made by the likes of Microsoft , Nintendo and Sony .
" We 're giving access to people who do n't have access .
We 've moved hardware out of the equation , " said Mr Perlman .
" Digital strategy "
For around an hour Mr Perlman and his chief operating officer Mike McGarvey put OnLive through some of its paces .
To various " oohs " and " aahs " from the audience , the two men played games ranging from Crysis Wars to Lego Batman from a cheap laptop and from a Mac notebook .
So far nine big game publishers have signed up to the service
With the data being sent from servers just fifty miles away , the men boasted of being able to play with one - millisecond of lag .
Community tools like leaderboards and avatars along with the ability to share " ' brag clips " which are short videos of your game highlights , are also part of the service .
Users can also have multiplayer matches and watch other gamers play .
Users will need a high - speed broadband connection of at least 1.5 megabits per second ( Mbps ) for standard definition results or 5 M bps for high definition .
Players who want to use their television will have to purchase a small OnLive MicroConsole that connects the TV to the internet and is about the size of a pack of cards .
So far 10 publishers have signed up to provide titles for OnLive .
They include familiar names like Atari Interactive , Electronic Arts , Ubisoft , Take - Two Interactive Software and Warner Bros .
" OnLive fits our digital strategy , which is to bring content to as many distribution points as possible , " Scott Guthrie , vice president of software publishers THQ told the San Francisco Chronicle .
" Amazing "
In the run up to the Game Developer Conference , or GDC , the company has been giving demos of the service .
Sarju Shah of GameSpot has had a test run and said : " It seems pretty amazing .
From this closed test it works really well .
You can actually stream gameplay like Crysis , which is a struggle for most high end computers to do but in this scenario all you need is a little tiny box and an internet connection .
Gaming is showing strong sales despite an economy heading south " If they can pull this off in the wild , given everyone 's internet connection in the home , they will truly wreck stuff for everyone .
This is the tip of the iceberg .
If they can stream gameplay to anybody then basic stuff like streaming video , a joke .
Music ?
A joke , " stated Mr Shah .
Mr Perlman said he understood why some people might be wary of what they were selling but that he wanted people to question what OnLive could do .
" What we have is something that is absolutely incredible .
You should be sceptical .
My first thinking was this should n't work , but it does . "
Analysts believe the success of OnLive could go one of two ways depending on pricing models .
" Depending on what business model these guys adopt , they could be wildly successful or a footnote in history , " said Michael Pachter , an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities .
Mr McGarvey was coy on the issue but did say it would be subscription based and that pricing " would be worked out in due course " .
Over the next few days at the Game Developer Conference , attendees will get the chance to test out the service .
The company is also inviting gamers to sign up for an external beta over the summer .
Mr Perlman ended his presentation with one plea to the audience and the wider gaming community .
" This is thinking out of the box , help us make it out of the box .
" The benefits of what we are doing are just huge so we 've got to at least see if we can make this thing work .
It 's just too cool . "

Ivan KrstiÄ‡ , former director of One Laptop per Child and all around computer security guru , has a few humorous thoughts on the current intersection between security and programming language design in Languages and security : a short reading list .
If I had to grossly overgeneralize , Iâ€™d say people looking at language security fall in roughly three schools of thought :
1 . The " My name is Correctness , king of kings " people say that security problems are merely one manifestation of incorrectness , which is dissonance between what the program is supposed to do and what its implementation actually does .
This tends to be the group led by mathematicians , and you can recognize them because their solutions revolve around proofs and the writing and ( automatic ) verification thereof .
2 . The " If you donâ€™t use a bazooka , you canâ€™t blow things up " people say that security problems are a byproduct of exposing insufficiently intelligent or well - trained programmers to dangerous language features that donâ€™t come with a safety interlock .
You can identify these guys because they tend to make new languages that no one uses , and frequently describe them as " like popular language X but safer " .
3 . The " We need to change how we fundamentally build software " people say that security problems are the result of having insufficiently fine - grained methods for delegating individual bits of authority to individual parts of a running program , which traditionally results in all parts of a program having all the authority , which means the attack surface becomes a Cartesian product of every part of the program and every bit of authority which the program uses .
You can spot these guys because they tend to throw around the phrase " object - capability model " .
Now , while I 'm already grossly overgeneralizing , I think the first group is almost useless , the second group is almost irrelevant , and the third group is absolutely horrible at explaining what the hell theyâ€™re talking about .
A Strong 59 Percent of Americans Support President Obama 's Stimulus Bill -- and 64 Percent Approve of His Performance as President So Far --
While GOP 's Approval Rating Remains Dismal at 31 Percent , According to New USA Today / Gallup Poll ; House GOP Whip Cantor in Controversy Over Profanity - Laced Web Video
After taking back - to - back losses to the Democrats in the 2006 and 2008 elections , Republicans should be feeling pretty blue these days .
Yet Republicans on Capitol Hill ( with the notable exceptions of Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania ) appear to be heading toward electoral oblivion by fiercely opposing President Obama 's economic stimulus packacge , despite a new poll showing that a 59 percent majority of Americans support the president 's stimulus proposal and a 64 percent majority approve of his overall performance as president -- while Capitol Hill Republicans have drawn a dismal 31 percent approval rating .

UPDATE

CONGRESS GIVES FINAL APPROVAL TO COMPROMISE STIMULUS BILL WITH ONLY 3 REPUBLICANS VOTING 'YES '
WASHINGTON -- Handing the new administration a huge Valentine 's Day gift , Congress gave final approval Friday to a $ 787 billion recovery package that President Obama hopes will help boost an economy in freefall with a combination of government spending and tax cuts and credits .
Approved without a single " yes " vote by House Republicans and with only three " ayes " by GOP senators , the plan -- which went through multiple permutations as it bounced back and forth on Capitol Hill over the past week -- now goes to Obama 's desk , where he plans to sign it into law by Monday -- Presidents ' Day .
The bill was approved 246- 183 in the House and 60 - 38 in the Senate .
With Senator Edward Kennedy ( D - Massachusetts ) absent , the vote by the Senate took several hours longer than the usual roll call of its 100 members generally would , to allow Senator Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) to return to Washington on a government plane from his home state after he attended a wake for his mother .
Only three Republicans -- Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- supported the measure in the Senate .
Their support was needed to give the plan the 60 votes needed to keep it from being shut down by a Republican filibuster .

Republicans opposed to President Obama 's multi-billion - dollar economic stimulus package may find themselves jumping off a political cliff to electoral oblivion , for they 're also bucking the will of a strong 59 percent majority of the American people who support the measure , according to a newly - released USA Today / Gallup Poll .
The public gives Obama a strong 67 percent approval rating for the way in which he is handling the government 's efforts to pass an economic stimulus bill , the poll finds , while the Democrats and , in particular , the Republicans in Congress receive much lower approval ratings of 48 percent and 31 percent , respectively .
Meanwhile , the office of newly - elected House Republican Whip Eric Cantor has come under fire for posting an obscenity - laced video on the Web in response to a hard - hitting TV ad that attacked the Virginia Republican and other GOP leaders for encouraging his colleagues to " just say no " to the president 's economic recovery plan .
Cantor 's Web ad depicted the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) , the union representing public - service workers -- and one of the two main sponsors of the anti-Republican TV ad -- as bullies , complete with a foul - mouthed narration supposedly by a union spokesman .
OBAMA LIKELY TO SIGN COMPROMISE STIMULUS BILL NEXT WEEK
The new Gallup findings , based on interviews conducted February 6 and 7 , underscore the degree to which Obama appears to be maintaining the upper hand over his GOP opponents from a public opinion perspective as he and congressional leaders wrangle over the precise form and substance of the economic stimulus plan .
They also underscore the increasingly difficult political climate that House and Senate Republicans are finding themselves in after the drubbing they took in last November 's election -- and the growing risk that their continued opposition to the stimulus package could result in their party being branded obstructionists standing in the way of the voters ' mandate for a change in direction from the Bush administration .
Moving with lightning speed , the House - Senate Conference Committee reached agreement Wednesday on a final consensus version of the stimulus bill , with a $ 789 billion price tag .
The measure , designed to preserve and create millions of jobs in a nation reeling from recession , could reach Obama 's desk for his signature as early as Saturday .
The House is scheduled to vote on the compromise bill today ( Thursday ) , with the Senate likely to follow suit on Friday , before Congress takes a one - week President 's Day holiday recess .
Obama set a deadline of President 's Day on Monday for the bill to reach his desk .
The House passed its version of the stimulus bill last week without a single " aye " vote from the 178 House Republicans .
The Senate version passed on Tuesday with only three GOP senators -- Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- voting in favor .
All three GOP senators who voted yes represent heavily - Democratic states where Obama won easily last November .
The moderate Specter , Pennsylvania 's senior senator , is up for re-election next year -- and already is facing the threat , for the second consecutive election , of a bruising primary fight with a right - wing challenger for the GOP nomination .
Republican Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , nominated by Obama to be the next commerce secretary , abstained from Tuesday 's Senate vote on the stimulus bill -- but stunned Washington on Thursday when he abruptly withdrew his nomination , citing " irresolvable conflicts " with Obama over the stimulus bill .
Gregg 's withdrawal immediately sparked speculation that he would vote against the compromise stimulus bill when it comes up for a final vote in the Senate either Friday or Saturday .
REPUBLICANS ' STANDING WITH PUBLIC REMAINS DISMAL
The new polling data released by Gallup shows the sharp divide between the public 's positive views of how Obama has handled efforts to pass the stimulus bill and its negative views of how the Republicans have handled this -- a divide that has grown to a stunning 36 - point chasm that could prove dangerous to the GOP in the 2010 midterm elections .
The president 's overall job - approval rating ( 64 percent as of February 8 ) is very close to his approval rating on the stimulus .
Only 25 percent disapprove .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll released Friday gave Obama even higher marks , with 76 percent of respondents approving the president 's job performance , while only 22 percent disapprove .
The poll found that an overwhelming 80 percent of respondents say the president is providing strong leadership for the country , 76 percent say he 's doing a good job handling foreign policy , 72 percent say Obama 's doing a good job dealing with the economy and 68 percent give the president a thumbs - up when it comes to handling policies on terrorism .
In sharp contrast , the Republicans in Congress receive a much lower approval rating of 31 percent in the USA Today / Gallup Poll , while 58 percent disapprove .
The GOP 's approval rating is nonetheless six points higher than its 25 percent approval rating in a previous Gallup survey in Demcember .
These relatively positive sentiments toward Obama were reflected in recent Gallup polling that asked Americans whether their confidence in Obama 's ability to improve the economy and manage the government had gotten better or worse since his inauguration .
At least 50 percent of Americans said their confidence had increased , while only 17 percent to 18 percent said they had less confidence .
Congressional Democrats , however , did n't fare as well , with only 48 percent approving of the way Democrats on Capitol Hill are handling the economic crisis , while 42 percent disapprove .
HOUSE GOP WHIP CANTOR ATTACKED FOR OBSCENITY -LACED VIDEO
A spokesman for Cantor apologized late Wednesday afternoon amid a firestorm of controversy over an obscenity - laced video he included in an e-mail he sent out on Tuesday in response to a hard - hitting TV and radio advertising blitz by AFSCME and the labor - backed Americans United for Change demanding that Cantor and other GOP leaders get behind the president 's stimulus package and " stop saying no . "
Spokesman Brad Dayspring , who initially stressed he had sent out as a joke , issued a written apology for the video , which he insisted his boss knew nothing about in advance and that " in no way " was it an official response from the Virginia Republican to the stimulus TV ad .
" Let me be clear , " Dayspring wrote , " we know people are hurting in these trying times and House Republicans completely agree that we must pass an economic recovery bill that preserves , protects and create jobs for Americans facing these economic challenges . "
It was not clear as of early Wednesday evening what disciplinary actions , if any , would Cantor take against Dayspring .
The video is an altered version of a 1970s TV ad promoting the public - employee union .
The audio portion , which originally extolled the virtues of the union , was redubbed to a voice reminiscent of Peter Paul ( Paulie Walnuts ) Galtieri -- mobster Tony Soprano 's chief enforcer in the highly - popular HBO drama , " The Sopranos " -- that says the following :
" On your way to work tomorrow , instead of sittin ' around with your finger up your [ bleep ] , look around , " the voiceover says .
" There 's a union out there called AFSCME and they 're bustin ' their [ bleep ] s doin ' a lot of [ bleep ] work you take for granted .
" For example , we pick up your [ bleep ] in ' garbage , " the voiceover continues .
" We 've got broads [ crossing guards ] out there who keep your kids from gettin ' rolled by some [ pervert ] .
. .
We plug up the holes in the roads so that you do n't [ bleep ] up your car . . . We make sure your kids do n't drink [ urine ] from the [ bleep ] in ' water fountains .
. .
" We 're hard - workin ' taxpayers like you and we do n't take [ bleep ] from nobody , " the voiceover finishes .
" You got that , [ bleep ] hole ?
AFSCME -- the [ bleep ] in ' union that works for you ! "
Brad Woodhouse , the head of Americans United for Change , denounced the video as " a childish and disgusting response to one of the most serious crises facing America in our lifetimes . "
AFSCME President Gerald McEntee also denounced the video .
In a statement , McEntee said that Cantor " may think the greatest economic crisis in seventy years is a joke , but we do n’t .
He should talk to the people in Virginia who are losing their jobs , health care and homes . "
HOW MANY REPUBLICANS WILL CAVE IN ON STIMULUS BILL IN FINAL VOTE ?
There was no direct comment from Cantor on the video furor .
As House GOP Whip , Cantor -- along with Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) and Caucus Chairman Mike Pence ( R - Indiana ) -- have more important things to worry about -- Namely , whether they can maintain the unanimous " no " vote when the compromise version of the stimulus bill comes to the floor of the House for final passage .
To vote " no " a second time — after concessions were made in the final House - Senate compromise bill — carries heavy political risks .
House Republicans already getting pummeled by ads branding them the “ No ” party -- especially those from the hard - hit Midwest -- have to be worried about being seen as obstructionist at a time of the nation 's most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression .
Not to mention bucking a highly popular president who 's staked his still - fledgling tenure in the White House on turning the economy around and has waged a full - court press for Congress to act -- and the legions of the president 's supporters are bombarding Republicans with e-mails , faxes and phone calls demanding that they support the bill .

If there is one way in which beer falls flat to its grape - based partner in alcoholic frivolity , wine , it is in its lack of ceremony .
Popping a cork , smelling , swirling , these are all things enjoyed by wine connoisseurs with the regularity of a religious ritual .
Beer is about drinking .
It is a drink of immediate satisfaction and an accompanier of celebration , but more than likely it does so with immediacy , not decorum .
There are , however , a few notable exceptions .
No , I 'm not speaking of drawing a four - leaf clover in the top of a Guinness though I admit mastering the art borders on religious fanaticism .
I speak of bottle - fermented beers such as Rare Vos .
Being fermented in its own bottle , Rare Vos comes with a cork and a plethora of specific instructions for its consumption .
" Pour slowly , " says the bottle " so as to not disturb the yeast sediment , but with enough vigor to create a luxurious head and release the spicy bouquet . "
You mean I can't just drink it ?
We at Brew Review enjoy a little ceremony with out alcohol consumption ( we 're not wine drinkers in disguise , I swear ) but all traditional consumption guidelines aside , the question remains : is this brew worth pouring ?
Tastes : like a perfect blend of fruity notes and bitter yeast .
The back end of Rare Vos has a pepper flavor that the bottle refers to as " an elusive spiciness . "
This is a full amber ale that will leave you satisfied you 've made a good choice after one sip .
Rare Vos has an alcohol content of 6.5 % by volume .
I got mine : at Lost Leaf Gallery on Roosevelt Row for about $ 9 .
Those nine bucks bought me a 1 pint 9.4 fluid ounce bottle of the stuff which is more than enough to share ... you know , if you want to .
Goes with : Rare Vos brewer Ommegang recommends consuming this brew with bar foods including burgers , pasta , " designer pizza , " tapas , jerk chicken and an assortment of other fried delicacies .
They 've absolutely hit this one on the head .
Rare Vos is perfect for pub grub .
Order away without worrying about your food masking your beer 's flavor .
Verdict :
Taking time to enjoy the everyday moments in life is something we feel the country if not the world could use more of these days .
Take time with Rare Vos content in the knowledge that what is a perfectly fine after work drink on a particularly busy Wedensday afternoon will transcend your every day beer expectations thanks to a little ritual .
If you need help popping the cork ( and consuming the contents ) let me know .
Happy Drinking
STUTTGART , Germany , Jan. 31 ( UPI ) -- German luxury automaker Porsche has announced planned cuts in worker hours amid falling demand for its vehicles .
The company said because sales have dipped 14 percent for the six months to the end of January , and it needed to cut costs .
Porsche said it sold 34,000 fewer cars and SUVs than for the same period a year ago .
Advertisement
In the United States , Porsche 's largest market , the company had a 27 percent drop in sales , while in Germany total sales declined 26 percent , the BBC reported .
Porsche also said it will cut production by about 19 days between February and April .
The company had cut eight days of production in January at its main facility in Zuffenhausen .
Porsche is not the only car maker to trim production , the British broadcaster said .
Japanese auto manufacturer Honda is set to close one of its British factories for four months , affecting 2,500 workers .
Honda 's net profit for the three months December plunged 89 percent , the BBC said .
Production shutdown periods have been experienced at car plants owned by BMW , Bentley , Vauxhall , Honda , Jaguar , Land Rover , Nissan , Rolls Royce and Toyota .
In May 2008 , the previous government made a spineless decision to delay the entry of transport into the ETS by two years .
The decision was driven by fears of the effects of higher fuel prices on inflation , but one of the effects was to throw the supply and demand of emissions units within the ETS significantly out of balance .
How far out of balance ?
Here 's the original figures on the Supply and Demand of New Zealand Units , taken from a briefing to the Climate Change leadership Forum :
( Note that while transport enters the ETS in 2009 , and industry in 2010 , the first emissions units do not need to be surrendered until April of the following year , so the demand part of the graph is lagged by a year ) .
As designed , the ETS had a slight undersupply of units , which would either drive emissions reductions or see units purchased overseas ( which is the same thing from a Kyoto accounting perspective ) .
but the removal of two years of transport emissions - 40 million units - completely reverses this situation .
instead of a slight undersupply of 8 million units over CP1 , we now have a massive oversupply of 32 million units - more than half the anticipated demand .
So thanks to Labour 's spinelessness , our ETS is overallocated by 50 % .
This has significant consequences .
As the Europeans are discovering , emissions trading only works when there is a shortage of permits .
Where there is an oversupply , the price collapses , fatally undermining the effectiveness of the scheme .
And where permits can be " banked " ( as in New Zealand ) the effect is even worse , because overallocation now creates the opportunity for more emissions in the future .
But its worse than that , because in the New Zealand ETS these units can be sold overseas .
This has two consequences .
Firstly , it will cost us a large amount of money .
Every permit sold overseas must be " backed " by a unit from New Zealand 's Kyoto Assigned Amount .
But our net position is seriously in deficit [ PDF ] .
So we are going to have to buy those units back .
Using Treasury 's costings , that will cost us an extra NZ $ 807 million - more than doubling our expected Kyoto liability .
Secondly , under the Kyoto Protocol , the New Zealand government is obliged to hold back 90 % of its Assigned Amount as a " commitment period reserve " ( this clause was designed to stop countries from just selling their entire allocation immediately , taking the money and running ) .
Our Assigned Amount is 309.56 million units. 90 % of that is 278.61 million units .
You do n't need much maths to see that the difference - 30.95 million units - is less than the amount by which the ETS is overallocated .
So overallocation could threaten the CPR , our credibility , and our ability to engage in international trading .
( The government has said that in the event of the CPR being threatened , it will close off trading .
This creates a perverse incentive to sell immediately , so as to ensure that you can ... )
This issue was not really canvassed in official advice on the decision to delay .
I have now obtained the relevant briefings and Cabinet papers using the OIA , and nowhere do they consider the effects on the overall balance of units within the scheme or the effect on its environmental integrity .
Treasury - the primary source of advice on the decision - was concerned primarily with inflation and flow - on threats to the introduction of the scheme at all .
They noted the opportunity cost of the government holding fewer units and recognised that this meant having to buy on the international market , but they did not consider overall supply , the effect of banking on future commitment periods , or the possible threat to the CPR
If we want our ETS to work , we need to find a way of removing those units from circulation .
One way is to soak them up by restoring transport to its original timetable ( a phased entry , with fuel companies responsible for 30 % of emissions in 2009 , 65 % in 2010 , and 100 % from 2011 onwards , significantly reduces the cost ) .
Alternatively , the government can reduce free allocations to industry .
As emissions will have dropped due to the recession , the effect of this will be to rob them of the windfall profits accruing from a mass transfer of wealth from the taxpayer .
A third option is to assume permits will be banked and reduce future allocations to compensate .
Neither of these options will be popular with polluters - but if we want an ETS which functions properly , we will have to choose one of them .

Question
How do I deal with a difficult mother - in - law when I live with her ?
Community Answer
Living together is one of the hardest things to ever do when you do n't get along and can result in a dysfunctional life .
Is it possible to get her into an in - law flat in the backyard or a distinct part of the house , so that she can lead most of her life separate from yours ?
If not , you might put into place different times to use different parts of the house , to lessen the times you 're in the same areas .
In terms of communicating , be polite but do n't engage in any attempts she makes to argue , cause trouble , complain or judge you .
Shut her down with comments such as : " Well , that 's your opinion , good for you . "
Get your spouse on side , you have agreed to his or her mother living with you , so you at least get to voice your preferences about how the household is run and the amount of contact that is sufficient and what is too much .
Remember , it 's your life , do n't let this woman conduct it for you .

ABC Animals is a clever application because it can be used by children across a large age range .
I ’m not sure if the developers at Critical Matter intended this .
But , I ’ve found it can be used by children as young as 18 months , up to as old as seven – depending on their level of development .
And , given the rate at which children grow and develop during the first 7 years of their life this a decent achievement .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
The application supports children to learn their ABCs .
A child is able to flick through iPhone cards from A - Z. Each card has the letter in upper and lowercase and a cartoon picture of an animal that begins with that letter .
( Geek sensibilities are catered for a “ D ” is sometimes represented by a dragon ) .
Young children can simply flick through look at the pictures and repeat the letters and words .
While older children , by double tapping the screen can flip the card over to examples of how the letters are written .
Then , using their finger or a iPhone pen they can trace the letter , just like they do in school learning to write .
This second aspect of the application has a lot of potential ; my only qualm is that the double tap feature is not offered in any form of instructions in the application .
I discovered it by accident .
I love the fact the letters are sitting on “ lined paper ” graphics and the clear directives on how to write letters had me imagining school classrooms full of children with iPhones ( a high tech return to the " chalk and slate " that our grandparents used ) .
ABC Animals could do with some options and instructions .
Still , it offers ABC activities for young children right through their development .
Though , the developer ’s images are poorly targeted at kids .
I think the images suit children aged 8 +.
The eyes of the animals look like they belong on Bratz dolls and to better engage younger children they could use much simpler graphics
Still , another fine app , once a few refinements are made .
Worth the $ 2.99 price at iTunes because it can be used by children of different ages and stages .
Wired : An iPhone App that supports child literacy from 18 months to 7 years .
Tired :
Need instructions and the images are n’t the best for younger children .
Seen any good iPhone Apps for young children recently ?

You can download the official Windows 7 Beta release ( unofficially You could do it for some time now ) .
So I 've downloaded it , installed it ( looks cool ) , and started to play ... The first think was to checkout what changed in theexports .
I 've compared the Win7 exports with Vista SP1 , and it seems they added many functions , and removed a few too .
The removed functions :-
An undocumented function that has something to do with Asian languages and theprocess .-
Another undocumented function - it retrieves the name of the an .nls file for the given code page .
It 's worth checking out it 's implementation in the ReactOS project ( @ google / codesearch ) - Almost a wrapper on They also added some new functions .
Some of them are forwards to other DLLs , and their final implementation looks like this : .
I 'll write something more about them when I know learn something more ;D : Deus noticed that the K32 * functions are the functions from psapi.dll
The end for now .
Negative publicity could harm Phelps 's lucrative sponsorship deals
The International Olympic Committee has accepted an apology from US swimmer Michael Phelps , photographed with a kind of pipe used for smoking cannabis .
The IOC said it had no reason to doubt Phelps 's sincerity or commitment to acting as a role model .
The Olympic star has apologised for his " regrettable behaviour " , but did not say whether he had taken drugs .
A British paper said the picture was taken three months after he won eight gold medals at last year 's Olympics .
The 23 - year - old was caught on camera inhaling from a type of glass pipe which can be used for smoking cannabis .
Negative publicity
The photo , which appeared in Britain 's News of the World newspaper , was said to have been taken at a student party last November when Phelps was on a long break from training .
His actions should have no impact on the medals he won at Beijing , as smoking cannabis out of competition is not an offence under sport 's international doping laws .
But the mistake could still prove costly as Phelps is a high - profile athlete with lucrative sponsorship deals , says BBC sports reporter Alex Capstick .
Negative publicity could damage those contracts , he adds .
Phelps , the most successful Olympian of all time , has also escaped punishment by the United States Olympic Committee .
US officials said the news was disappointing but they expected him to move on and to set the type of example expected from a great Olympic champion .
Enlarge By Alan S. Weiner , for USA TODAY Rick Wallick at home in Banks , Ore. Wallick , a former software engineer , bought a $ 200,000 house in Arizona at the peak of the real estate bubble .
He did everything right : big downpayment and 15 - year fixed rate mortgage .
That house is worth only $ 80,000 now .
BOOM AND BUST BOOM AND BUST Percentage change in the average selling price of existing homes during the housing bubble and its aftermath .
Metro area Jan. 2000 - July 2006 July 2006 - Sept. 2008 Miami 178 % - 36 % Los Angeles 174 % - 33 % Washington , D.C. 150 % - 24 % San Diego 149 % - 34 % Tampa 138 % - 28 % Las Vegas 134 % - 37 % Phoenix 127 % - 39 % San Francisco 118 % - 33 % New York 115 % - 11 % Seattle 80 % - 4 % Portland , Ore. 80 % - 6 % Boston 78 % - 9 % Minneapolis 71 % - 18 % Chicago 68 % - 12 % Denver 40 % - 7 % Atlanta 35 % - 9 % Charlotte 28 % 2 % Dallas 25 % - 3 % Cleveland 23 % - 11 % Detroit 23 % - 27 % 20 - city average 107 % - 22 % Source : S&P / Case - Shiller Home Price Index
Why home values may take decades to recover Rick Wallick moved into a new , three - bedroom $ 200,000 home in Maricopa , Ariz . , in October 2005 .
Today , the home is worth $ 80,000 .
The disabled software engineer stopped making mortgage payments this month .
His $ 70,000 down payment is now worthless .
His dream house will be foreclosed on next year .
" We 're so far underwater it 's not funny , " says Wallick , 57 , who had to return to his original home in Oregon to care for a sick family member and tend to his own medical problems .
Wallick , one of the hardest - hit victims in one of the states hit hardest by the housing crisis , lost 60 % of his home 's value in three years .
His story is an extreme example , but home values have fallen so sharply since hitting a historic peak in the spring of 2006 that many Americans are wondering how much more prices can sink .
As painful as the decline has been , history suggests home values still may have a long way to drop and may take decades to return to the heights of 2 ½ years ago .
" We will never see these prices again in our lifetime , when you adjust for inflation , " says Peter Schiff , president of investment firm Euro Pacific Capital of Darien , Conn .
" These were lifetime peaks . "
The boom in home prices — fueled by heavily leveraged loans built on low or even no down payments — made it easy to forget that housing values had been remarkably stable for a half - century after World War II , rising at roughly the same pace as income and inflation .
Prices soared in most of the country — especially in Arizona , California , Florida and Nevada and metro areas of Washington , D.C. , and New York — during a brief period of easy lending , especially from 2002 to 2006 .
That era's over .
So far , home values nationally have tumbled an average of 19 % from their peak .
As bad as that is , prices would need to fall as least 17 % more to reach their traditional relationship to household income , according to a USA TODAY analysis of home prices since 1950 .
In that scenario , a $ 300,000 house in 2006 could be worth about $ 200,000 when real estate prices hit bottom .
FORECLOSURES : Drop seen in November , but bad news looms
The price plunge has wiped out trillions of dollars in home equity and caused the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Susan Wachter , professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania , fears that foreclosures and tight credit could send home prices falling to the point that millions of families and thousands of banks are thrust into insolvency .
" Homes are different than other goods and services , " she says .
" The fragility of our banking system is tied to the value of homes . "
Home values have fallen before — during the Great Depression and in Texas after a 1980s oil boom , for example — but those drops were a response to other economic forces .
This time , the housing price collapse is the cause of the nation 's broad economic troubles , not just an effect .
" If we have another 20 % decline in prices , we 'll need another bailout of banks similar to what we just did , " Wachter says .
Other economists see a brighter picture in the long term .
Wachovia economist Adam York expects home values to keep falling until 2010 but is optimistic they will recover .
" The one saving grace is the population is growing by 3 million people a year , " he says .
" They need to live somewhere .
That means more roofs . "
50 years of steady values Until recently , homes were stable , unspectacular investments , not get - rich - quick schemes .
Nationally , the typical existing home was worth roughly the same in 2000 as it was in 1950 , after adjusting for inflation , according to Yale University economist Robert Shiller .
Newly built homes generally were bigger and more expensive than older houses .
As time passed , that meant Americans lived in larger , more valuable homes overall .
But a house , once constructed , grew slowly in value .
California in the 1970s , Texas in the 1980s and Florida on - and - off for a century were conspicuous exceptions to the rule .
Despite only modest increases in value , homes were smart investments .
Owners lived in a house , then got their money back when they sold .
That 's a better deal than renting .
Borrowers got tax breaks , too , and built equity that could be leveraged into bigger houses as their incomes grew .
From 2002 to 2006 , houses went from being a tortoise to a hare in the investment world .
Home sale profits and relaxed lending standards such as lower down payment requirements and adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) made it possible for buyers of all income levels to pay more for houses .
When the housing bubble began to deflate in 2006 , history had a sobering lesson to teach .
Home values had closely tracked three common - sense measures for many years : • Income — Home values floated at about three times average household income from 1950 to 2000 .
In 2006 , the average household income was $ 66,500 .
Under the traditional model , home prices should have been about $ 200,000 .
Instead , the typical home sold for $ 301,000 .
• Rent — Homes traditionally have sold for about 20 times what it would cost to rent them for a year .
In 2006 , houses were selling for 32 times annual rent .
• Appreciation — Existing homes grew in value by less than 0.5 % per year , after adjusting for inflation , from 1950 to 2000 .
From 2000 to 2006 , home prices rose at an average annualized rate of 8.2 % above inflation and peaked with a 12.3 % jump in 2005 .
Housing prices began to fall in the second quarter of 2006 .
Inflation could help homes recapture their old prices , if not their value .
But when inflation is factored in , home prices might not return to their 2006 peak for many years .
Housing prices are meaningless if you do n't adjust for inflation , says Schiff , the investment manager .
He points out that gold peaked in 1980 at $ 850 an ounce in response to inflation and the Iranian hostage crisis .
It never recovered .
Today , it sells for about $ 750 an ounce and would have to top $ 2,000 an ounce when adjusted for inflation to match its value in 1980 .
" That 's the nature of bubbles , " Schiff says .
" The price never comes back . "
The end of inflated leverage
An extreme relaxation of lending standards inflated the housing bubble .
" Shoddy underwriting on mortgages " is the primary cause of the housing crisis , says York , the Wachovia economist .
" People got caught off - guard by how bad it was . "
Millions of home buyers — poor , rich and middle class — were approved to buy homes at prices that had been out - of - reach just a few years earlier .
Lenders offered low introductory " teaser " rates on adjustable rate mortgages and approved borrowers based on artificially low mortgage payments , not the higher ones that took effect later .
What else changed : • Optional payments on principal — In 2005 , 29 % of new mortgages allowed borrowers to pay interest only — not principal — or pay less than the interest due and add the cost to the principal .
That was up from 1 % in 2001 , according to Credit Suisse , an investment bank .
•
No verification of income — Half of mortgages generated in 2006 required no or minimal documentation of household income , reports Credit Suisse . •
Tiny down payments — In 1989 , the average down payment for first - time home buyers was 10 % , reports the National Association of Realtors .
In 2007 , it was 2 % .
Low down payments and ARMs gave homeowners enormous financial leverage to pay high home prices .
Leverage boosts buying power through debt , the same way a 100 - pound woman uses a lever to jack up a 3,000 - pound car .
Consider a couple with $ 20,000 cash .
In 2006 , they easily could get a 5 % down mortgage to buy a $ 400,000 house .
Today , a 10 % down payment would limit the couple to a $ 200,000 house .
" Leverage matters a lot when you buy a house , " says University of Wisconsin economist Morris Davis , an expert on housing prices and rents .
" We 're not going to go back to the days of only 20 % ( down payment ) mortgages , but the days of putting nothing down are long gone . "
Easy access to borrowed money reset all housing prices , even those paid by cautious borrowers .
People of all income classes moved up a notch , Census Bureau housing data show .
The sale of new homes costing $ 750,000 or more quadrupled from 2002 to 2006 .
The construction of inexpensive homes costing $ 125,000 or less fell by two - thirds .
The biggest boom was in the middle .
Homes costing $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 became affordable to millions of families .
The failed titans of home lending — Countrywide Financial , IndyMac Bank and Washington Mutual — specialized in high - risk , highly leveraged loans .
" The price correction has been severe , rapid and probably permanent because lending standards have changed , " says mortgage credit analyst Suzanne Mistretta , a senior director at Fitch Ratings , a bond rating company .
" We are not going to see 2006 peak levels for a very , very long time . "
Lessons from the Depression The Great Depression of the 1930s was preceded by a real estate bubble , also fueled by loose lending standards and shrinking down payment requirements .
Those real estate problems — and solutions — echo today's .
Florida real estate was the epicenter of speculation in the mid-1920s .
Developers ran up prices by selling to borrowers who put as little as 10 % down .
Those were shockingly risky loans at a time when the standard mortgage lasted five years and required a 50 % down payment .
The risky loans went bad first , but it was the spread of credit problems to the supposedly safe loans — five years and 50 % down — that caused the housing market to collapse .
The five - year loans required no payments to reduce principal .
Homeowners expected to refinance mortgages when the loans expired , usually with the same lender .
The stock market crash led to a " liquidity crisis " — no money to borrow — that dried up mortgage refinancing .
Millions of families lost their homes to foreclosure .
Falling prices on nearly everything — homes , farm crops , wages — made consumers reluctant to buy and banks afraid to lend .
As part of the New Deal , the government took control of millions of loans and restructured them into something new : the modern mortgage , with 20 % down and principal that is repaid over the life of the loan .
The government extended the mortgages to 15 years , then 25 and finally 30 .
When World War II ended in 1945 and the Baby Boom began the following year , the 30 - year , fixed - rate mortgage became a cornerstone of society and led to unprecedented levels of homeownership .
This resilient home finance system should recover in a few years , some analysts say .
National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence
Yun predicts home prices will keep falling in 2009 but could return to their 2006 peak in three years , not counting inflation .
He says the bubble largely was confined to four states — California , Nevada , Florida and Arizona .
" People who bought at the peak in those states will need time for prices to recover , even up to five years , " he says .
Yun says people who buy now " have much less risk of price declines and a great possibility of price gains . "
The danger of rapidly falling home prices is that — similar to the Depression — potential buyers and lenders will stay away , fueling even sharper price declines .
During the housing boom , buyers expected prices to rise , so they were quick to buy , borrow and pay a premium .
As prices drop , home buyers wait for better deals .
says economist Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington , D.C. Lenders want bigger down payments to protect against the falling value of collateral .
Homeowners lose equity , so they can't buy other houses .
" Price declines can be a self - reinforcing mechanism , " Wachter says .
An out - of - control price collapse would have dire consequences , Baker says .
Even the most conservative banks would find themselves carrying portfolios of toxic mortgage loans .
If housing prices do n't stabilize at traditional levels , financial troubles could spread everywhere — to credit cards , car loans and commercial mortgages , Baker says .
" The waves of bad debt will just keep coming , " he says .
Baker and Wachter want the U.S. government to take aggressive steps to help homeowners , not just financial institutions .
They support expanding programs that restructure troubled mortgages to prevent a flood of foreclosed homes from coming on the market and driving prices below their traditional level .
Rick Wallick is an example of how even cautious borrowers can be hurt by a price collapse .
He made a 35 % down payment on his house and got a 15 - year , fixed - rate mortgage at 5.75 % .
Arizona 's real estate mess wiped him out anyway .
Now that he's in Oregon , he 's renting out his Arizona house at a loss and can't afford to keep two homes .
Wallick 's Arizona house is surrounded by countless foreclosed homes and empty lots .
He told his mortgage company that his December payment will be his last .
" It may ruin my credit rating , but I can still buy food , " he says .
Shelley McComb used a no-money - down , interest - only ARM to pay $ 199,000 in December 2006 for a new three - bedroom home near Birmingham , Ala .
The house 's assessed value briefly rose to $ 225,000 .
Now , she needs to move to Atlanta where her husband got a promotion .
The McCombs put their home up for sale in March .
After getting no offers , they dropped their price to $ 179,000 .
They 'd settle for $ 160,000 .
Shelley McComb , 30 , who manages a doggie day care center , says , " I wish we 'd rented . "

You are standing in a store looking for a new DVD to buy .
Rather than buying it , you photograph the barcode with your phone and press a couple of buttons .
By the time you make it home , the movie is waiting for you in your torrent client .
You can with Torrent Droid .
Around a month ago , Android - orientated website Androidandme launched ‘ Android Bounty ’ , a new initiative which has led to the creation of nice little torrent app .
To find out more , we spoke to Taylor Wimberly from the site .
“ Android Bounty is a new kind of developers challenge we started for creating applications on Google Android , ” he told Torrent Freak .
“ Users submit ideas which can be voted up by others who pledge money to the bounty .
The first developer who delivers a working application is rewarded with the bounty . ”
Taylor explained the idea is similar to how users promote stories on Digg , except people vote with cash .
To start things rolling , a few days later Androidandme set a challenge to its readers – create an Android - compatible BitTorrent application to scan UPC barcodes and find related torrents on the larger BitTorrent search engines .
Users would be able to find and start torrents remotely , and the music album or movie would be fully downloaded by the time they got home .
There were some terms and conditions to the challenge .
The software would use the G1 cellphone ’s inbuilt camera to scan a retail DVD UPC barcode , and use the capture to identify the official details of the product from a database .
Once the product is positively identified , the software should be able to send the results directly to a BitTorrent search engine , such as The Pirate Bay or Mininova .
After the search results appear , the user could then choose which torrent to start .
Once selected , the .torrent file would be downloaded and sent to the webUI of uTorrent and the download would begin , hopefully ready for when the user reaches his or her home machine .
No typing input would be required for the above .
Just a few weeks later , Alec Holmes of Zerofate had stepped up to the challenge , created the app and collected the modest bounty of $ 90.00 .
“ This version of Torrent Droid is a work in progress but the video shows the core features work , ” said Alec .
The full version of Torrent Droid will be released within a month but in the meantime , here is a video of it in action .
WASHINGTON  Republican lawmakers nearly unanimously resisted supporting the president ’s $ 787 billion stimulus package , but what has proved irresistible is the temptation to take credit for at least a few of those billions .
Despite criticizing the bill as wasteful , a handful of Republican members of the House and Senate have found some provisions to cheer .
Just hours after voting against the bill on the House floor last week , Representative John L. Mica of Florida issued news releases lauding the inclusion of $ 8 billion for high - speed rail projects around the nation .
Mr. Mica said the bill would also help pay for a commuter train project in his Central Florida district .
“ If we could put a man on the moon , we should be able to move people from city to city quickly instead of wasting time on a congested highway , ” said Mr. Mica , the ranking Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .
“ I applaud President Obama ’s recognition that high - speed rail should be part of America ’s future . ”

How well I remember that horrible cold morning in early December 1980 when I turned on the radio to hear that John Lennon had been shot the night before .
Lennon was my hero .
His musical contributions to the Beatles were among my favorites .
Whether he was commenting on the apathy of the masses ( “ Day in the life ” ) , the latest religious cult ( “ Sexy Sadie ” ) , the proliferation of guns ( “ Happiness is a Warm Gun ” ) or the counterculture ( “ Revolution ” ) , Lennon spoke to my own dissatisfaction with the status quo or the “ establishment , ” as we called it back then .
I did n’t like the Beatles when I first saw them on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 .
They were too teeny bopper-ish .
There was little depth to their lyrics .
I was a hard - core Bob Dylan fan .
I wanted something more than “ She loves you , yeah , yeah , yeah . ”
Where was the poetry and social commentary of “ Blowing in the Wind , ” or “ Desolation Row ? ”
Two years later , I gained an entirely different view of the Fab Four .
During an interview with “ Datebook , ” a teen magazine , John Lennon boasted that the Beatles were “ more popular than Jesus . ”
He also wondered which would go first–rock ’n ’roll or Christianity .
In England , his words had little impact .
In America , land of looney Christian fundamentalists , they exploded like an atomic bomb .
Overnight , “ wholesome ” teens were destroying Beatle products , including albums .
Christian ministers were calling on the young to boycott their concerts .
The KKK burned Beatles paraphernalia in huge bonfires .
I suddenly fell in love with John Lennon , then the Beatles as they plunged into new musical depths with “ Rubber Soul , ” “ Revolver , ” and finally the rock masterpiece of all time , “ Sgt. Pepper . ”
Now , 42 years after Lennon ’s Jesus comment , the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano has decided to forgive him for his alleged blasphemy .
The paper , which is a mouthpiece for the Catholic rock star known as the pope , now believes that Lennon ’s remarks were merely “ showing off , bragging by a young English working - class musician who had grown up in the age of Elvis Presley and rock and roll and had enjoyed unexpected success . ”
Lennon does n’t need to be forgiven .
He was a man of peace .
His work to end the war in Vietnam , his passionate political activism and his outspokenness on social injustice and sexism all point to a man who tried to leave the world a better place than he found it .
Those who grew up in my generation are all a little better off for his efforts and his songs .
Especially his atheist compositions , “ Imagine , ” and “ God . ” I ’m sure L’Osservatore Romano is not thinking of them when it lauds what it calls the Beatles “ unique and strange alchemy of sounds and words . ”
As Lennon might have said : Christianity will one day fade away , but rock ’n ’roll is here to stay .

JERUSALEM ( JTA ) —
The reinstated bishop who has denied the Holocaust was removed as head of a seminary in Argentina , according to reports .
Richard Williamson was dismissed as head of the La Reja seminary near Buenos Aires , Argentina newspapers reported Monday , according to The New York Times .
In a statement announcing Williamson ’s dismissal , Father Christian Bouchacourt , the head of the Latin American chapter of the Catholic Society St. Pius X , said " Monsignor Williamson ’s statements do not in any way reflect the position of our congregation . "
The dismissal came on the heels of a conversation Sunday between Pope Benedict XVI and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who has been publicly critical of the pope ’s actions .
The Vatican has called on the bishop to recant his questioning whether the Nazis used gas chambers and how many Jews actually died during the period .

Japanese whalers blasted conservationists with a water cannon and hurled hunks of metal and golf balls at them in a clash today in icy Antarctic waters , an anti-whaling group said .
Two members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society were lightly injured in the early morning fracas in heavy seas about 2,000 miles south - east of the Australian state of Tasmania , said Paul Watson , the group 's leader .
A spokesman for the whalers said he had no information on the claims .
The group which follows the Japanese whaling fleet during its annual hunt in the Antarctic Ocean sent a helicopter and two inflatable boats toward one of the ships in the Japanese fleet .
The whalers began blasting conservationists on one raft with a water cannon , knocking one man off his feet and leaving him with cuts and bruises , Watson told The Associated Press by satellite phone .
Another protester was hit in the face with a large chunk of metal lobbed from a harpoon boat .
He was wearing a shield on his helmet , but still suffered bruises , Watson said .
The Japanese also aimed a " military grade " noise weapon that can cause deafness and vomiting at the Sea Shepherd crew , Watson said .
Some felt its vibrations but were too far away to be otherwise affected , he said .
Glenn Inwood , the New Zealand - based spokesman for Japan 's Institute of Cetacean Research , a Japanese government - affiliated organization that oversees the hunt , said he could not immediately confirm or deny the Sea Shepherd 's claims .
" All legal means available will be used to protect the Japanese crew and the scientists , " he said .
Japan , which has described the Sea Shepherd protesters as terrorists , plans to harvest up to 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales this season .
Under International Whaling Commission rules , the mammals may be killed for research but not for commercial purposes .
Opponents say the Japanese research expeditions are simply a cover for commercial whaling , which was banned in 1986 .
Protesters aboard the ship , named after the late Australian conservationist and TV personality Steve Irwin , set off from Australia in early December for the remote and icy Antarctic Ocean , chasing the whaling fleet for about 2,000 miles before stopping two weeks ago in Tasmania to refuel .
The group found the whalers again on Sunday and resumed their pursuit .
In December , the protesters lobbed bottles of rancid butter at the Japanese .
" I will not allow them to kill a whale while we 're here , and they know that , " Watson said .
" I 'll literally rip their harpoon off their deck if I have to . "
It 's a case that wo n't - and some say should n't - go away .
Five and a half years after some $ 80,000 worth of marijuana mysteriously disappeared from the Dracut police station , officials are still trying to determine who took it .
Recently , several officers were ordered to take lie detector tests to help determine whether any of them could be linked to the missing drugs .
Local officials say the case has caused the town embarrassment , giving the impression that police have been unable or unwilling to solve the crime and that they might even have been involved in it .
" It gives the town a black eye , " said Robert Cox , chairman of the Dracut Board of Selectmen .
At the same time , some say it 's important to get at the truth .
" We need to come to some understanding of the truth , whether the police were involved or not - hopefully not , " said Dracut Selectman George Malliaros , who first called for the lie - detector tests to be administered .
The probe is infuriating police union officials , who say it 's time for it to end so officers can return to focusing on their work .
" I think everybody 's had about enough of this investigation , " said Anthony L. Archinski , regional vice president of New England Police Benevolent Association , the local police union 's parent organization .
" I think productivity has come to a screeching halt . "
Instead of the probe to identify culprits , Archinski said , the town should call in an independent fact - finder to determine whether the theft could have been prevented and whether any police policies or procedures were violated .
Archinski , who retired as a lieutenant from the Dracut Police Department at the end of last year , having also served as local police union head , said the department 's leaders are trying to swing the spotlight from what he deems their failure to properly secure the stash .
He said the marijuana , confiscated from suspects in a drug case , was being kept in a padlocked outdoor storage container in the back of the old police station on Lakeview Avenue .
The new police station has adequate secure storage for confiscated evidence .
" The administration needs to stand up and take responsibility for it , " Archinski said .
Dracut Police Chief Kevin M. Richardson and Deputy Chief David Chartrand did not return phone calls seeking comment about the missing marijuana and the investigation .
This is the third time officials have tried to determine what happened , having come up dry the previous two attempts .
As the latest probe unfolds , townspeople are shaking their heads in wonder , says Cox .
" For the taxpayers , it 's been a coffee table conversation no matter where you go , " he said .
" They 're saying , ' What happened ?
How come nothing has transpired ? " '
While Cox understands the union 's viewpoint , he also says the situation has been difficult for Richardson , who was appointed chief in 2005 , two years after the crime , but still feels obligated to pursue the investigation .
I wanted to know what currying means in practice for programmers who are not themselves theoretical computer scientists so I asked about it here .
There were a lot of informative replies ; and the most direct answers to the question seem to be :
Anthony Cowley :
There are many cases where Curried functions can be convenient , but I ’ll just pick one class of examples .
In FP , one is often passing around bundles of state in the form of parameters to a function .
Joe Marshall :
Your best bet would be to look at existing Scheme code .
I found this example in the MIT Scheme loader : [ click link for code ]
Richard Cleis :
Currying permits repeated use of intermediate functions as an alternative to overtly managing arguments to a core function .

The bank has met targets on repaying a £ 26bn government loan
The decision to award most staff at nationalised bank Northern Rock a 10 % bonus is " indefensible " , the Liberal Democrats have said .
Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : " This is bringing the worst of the City bonus culture into a public body . "
But the Unite trade union argued the bonus , which follows an agreement with the Treasury , was a fitting reward for " hard work and dedication " .
Gordon Brown 's spokesman said it was a " matter for Northern Rock " .
Loan repayments
The bonuses are due to be paid to staff on Friday .
Northern Rock was nationalised in February 2008 after a run on the bank in 2007 .
Once Britain 's fifth - biggest home loan provider , it was taken into public ownership after it failed to find a suitable buyer from the private sector .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I certainly would n't be happy with a pay cut , but it beats redundancy !
Cindy Chaplin , Coggeshall A Northern Rock spokesman refused to be drawn on how much money was being paid out , but pointed out that the staff - wide bonus scheme had been announced in October .
He also stressed that no executives or senior management would benefit .
The reward comes after staff met targets on repaying the bank's £ 26bn loan from the government .
' Step in now '
Mr Cable said : " This is an extraordinary action from a state - owned bank which still owes billions to taxpayers .
" When millions of people are facing pay cuts or even unemployment , this is indefensible .
The government should step in to stop this now . "
But Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said : " Unite members and staff at the bank have worked exceptionally hard in extremely difficult circumstances .
" They have experienced the loss of friends and colleagues through compulsory redundancy yet have continued working solidly with dedication and commitment .
" These have been very difficult times and this bonus agreed with the Treasury was promised if targets were met .
Their dedication and commitment has meant that they have not only achieved but exceeded the targets set . "
Asked whether Mr Brown approved of the bonuses , the prime minister 's spokesman said : " Northern Rock , as I think is well known , has repaid its debts to the government at a rate faster than originally planned for .
" Operational decisions such as this are a matter for Northern Rock . "

Law enforcement in Tenaha , Texas
Police in tiny Tenaha , Texas , have pulled over 147 motorists on their way to casinos in Louisiana and threatened to charge them with serious crimes unless they surrendered their cash , jewelry , cell phones , and even their cars , according to a new class - action lawsuit .
Police say the seizures — almost all from nonwhites — target drug traffickers , even though in these 147 cases , no drugs were found .
“ We try to enforce the law here , ” said Mayor George Bowers .
Amish man 's outhouse lands him in jail
A Pennsylvania Amish man was sentenced to 90 days in jail because he refused to modernize his primitive outhouse .
Andy Swartzentruber said his religious principles forbade him from obtaining permits and installing a holding tank for waste from the facility , which was used by about 20 schoolchildren .
" I will take a stand for my religion , ” said Swartzentruber .
“ If I do n’t , it could destroy the whole church group . ”
The Italian government is in the process of examining a new bill which will restrict the right to call a strike .
The bill might become soon a law .
The bill will introduce a so - called “ virtual strike ” ( you call the strike but you go to work ) for the categories of workers considered “ essential ” and the possibility to call a strike for the workers within the public transport only for those unions which have 50 per cent of representation of the sector .
These are only two examples of the novelties this bill will lead to .
The government justifies this bill claiming that this is a necessary step in order to balance the right to call a strike with that of circulation and mobility .
Epifani , leader of the union CGIL , warns : “ the government should pay attention , the strike is a fundamental freedom ” .
We 've heard from many of you that 3D technology is something you 're interested in seeing at CES , and Sony has one of the most impressive displays of 3D at their booth ... but you wo n't learn anything about it .
" Do n't get caught up with specs , " the Sony representative told me .
" We 're not going to talk about specifications .
This is just a look at what 3D could look like if Sony decided to move in this direction . "
The idea was just to show the technology to people , to see if they would be interested in sitting at home , wearing a dorky set of black glasses , watching content in 3D .
I could n't pry details about how the 3D affect was achieved , or if the display could turn any source into 3D , but what 's clear is that , glasses or no , the 3D affect is amazing .
Sony showed off Wipeout HD running in true 3D , and I was ready to whip out my credit card right there .
Frank and I both agreed , this was one of the best demos of 3D technology we have ever seen .
As a bonus , here 's a picture of Frank modeling the glasses .
" 3D has come a long way , has n't it ? " the representative asked me .
Sure it has , but give me some details .
We can't get excited if all the press gets is a short tech demo .
The crowd around the display was large , and filled with " ooohs " and " aaaahs . "
This probably wo n't be the last 3D display we see at CES , but as a proof of concept , our appetite is whetted .
Sony claims that they have Gran Turismo Prologue playable on the display , but I just wanted to take one home .
The company is hedging its bets about how long it will take to get this level of 3D into your home , but if this tiny taste was any indication , there is a ton of promise .
We 're promised more 3D surprises from Sony 's even larger press event tomorrow , so hopefully we 'll get some more information .
Solid Snake continues to get it done for Konami .
Today , the Japanese game maker reported its results for the April - December period , saying that total revenues for the first nine months of its 2009 fiscal year grew 5.1 percent to ¥ 234 billion ( $ 2.56 billion ) .
Konami's profit margins also continued to outpace the year - ago period , given that net income rose 17.3 percent to ¥ 17.8 billion ( $ 195 million ) .
Konami's Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , which was released exclusively for the PlayStation 3 in June , continued to be one of the company 's top performers .
The top-rated action adventure helped the Metal Gear series sell more than 4.5 million units in 2008 .
( GameSpot initially reported that Metal Gear Solid 4 sold 4.5 million units by itself , but the figure includes all games in the franchise .
GameSpot regrets the error . )
For the first nine months of its current fiscal year , which runs from April 1 , 2008 to March 31 , 2009 , Konami has sold 22.35 million software units across its various franchises .
In addition to Metal Gear 's gains , the publisher has been bolstered by the success of its Pro Evolution Soccer franchise , which has sold more than 7.41 million units during the nine - month period .
Other top performers for the game company include Castlevania : Order of Ecclesia for the Nintendo DS , as well as installments in its perennial Dance Dance Revolution rhythm franchise .
Despite Konami's positive growth during the period , the publisher provided a warning to investors that the global economic downturn will have a negative impact on its full - year returns .
Citing slower consumer spending and a strengthening of the yen , Konami revised its full - year revenue and profit outlook downward .
The publisher now expects revenues to rise 3.2 percent to ¥307 billion ( $ 3.36 billion ) during the year , with profits now projected to grow a mere .3 percent to ¥ 18.5 billion ( $ 203 million ) .
Well its that time of year again when you can either conform and buy your significant other a box of chocolates and fist of flowers and watch her dreary eyed try to remember when your relationship actually was exciting or , or you could give her … … a brainfuck program !
This feat of extraordinary thoughtfulness will undoubtedly poke her memories of that juvenile lust that once saturated your affair .
So get with loop and increment your chances of popping your stack on the 14 of February !
Heap …
Moving along ; for this experiment you will need the following things :
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler ( GHC ) Graphics .HGL 3.2.0.0
Extending SamBs brainfuck interpreter with a visual representation of the brainfuck machines memory .
What we are going to do is extend this excellent brainfuck interpreter written by SamB with a UI that shows the content of the memory .
The memory will be displayed as oversized pixels varying in redness depending on their value .
First lets import two libraries we are going to need later on :
import System .
Posix ( usleep )
import Graphics .HGL hiding ( char )
We are going to use usleep so delay the execution of the program so we can see the memory cells update in realtime and HGL is for creating this display .
Next we need to change the StateT encapsulation to include our display window and the initial pointer ( this is so we can calculate which cell we are at ) .
There is no need for something fancy so we do this by just creating a nested tuple .
type BF a b = StateT ( Ptr a , ( Ptr a , Window ) ) IO b
Taking care to change the definition of the functions to satisfy this new type requirement ( change read , write etc . . ) .
Now lets add a higher - order function called update that will update both the memory and the display window .
update :: ( Storable a , Integral a ) => ( a -> a -> a ) -> BF a ( ) update f = do x <- read ( p , ( i , w ) ) <- get let n = fromEnum $ ( ptrToIntPtr p ) - ( ptrToInt Ptr i ) let a = ( f x 1 ) liftIO ( cell w n ( toEnum $ fromEnum a ) ) write a
And now the definitions of incr and decr become very short :
incr = update (+)
decr = update (-)
You may have noticed in the update function that we reference a function that is not defined ( cell ) ; so lets define it :
cell :: Window -> Int -> Word8 -> IO ( ) cell w n v = do let s = 50 ( x , _ ) <- getWindowSize w q <- createBrush ( RGB v 0 0 ) let ( a , b ) = quotRem ( n * s ) x let c = ( regionToGraphic $ rectangleRegion ( b , a * s ) ( b + s , ( a * s ) + s ) ) drawInWindow w ( withBrush q c ) usleep 500
Now if you have been enough of a £ 33 + type jockey all we will have to do is add a slightly different main function .
main :: IO ( ) main = runGraphics $ do ( name : [ ] ) <- getArgs source <- readFile name w <- openWindow " Memory " ( 600 , 600 ) tape <- ( mallocBytes 10000 :: IO ( Ptr Word8 ) ) ( either print ( `evalStateT` ( tape , ( tape , w ) ) ) ) ( parse parseInstrs name source )
Now we are good to go and if you dont have the patience to edit the source yourself here is as
they say on TV something i prepared earlier :
BrainfuckHGL.hs .
Brianfuck programs and their memory footprint .
First lets test our visualization , assuming you saved the source to a file called BrainfuckHGL.hs ; create a file called Pulse and add :
+[>-[-]+]
And to test ; run this at the shell :
runhaskell BrainfuckHGL.hs
Pulse
The output should look something like this :
with the square moving to the right and “ pulsating ” .
Now for something a little more complicated ; a program that prints out a list squares .
++++[>+++++[-]+[>+>+<>[<>-]>>>[-]++>[-]+>>>+[[-]++++++>
>>]<<<[[<++++++++>-]+<.----<-]<]<>>>>[>>>[-]+++++++++-[-[-]+[<<<] ]+]<<-]<<-]
I wo n’t bother taking a screenshot of this but if you squint a little you can make out the memory cells flashing as their values change .
If you change the definition of cell to use the color white it ’s easier to make out the values .
A portrait of the brainfuck programmer as a young man .
And now for the finale we are going to create some cheesy valentines art with brainfuck .
We have here a canvas that is 12 /12 pixles of varying degrees of redness .
The first little masterpiece we are going to create is a simple static heart :
;;
To set a cell to 255 just decrement it from 0
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>->->>>->->>>>
>>->->->->->->->->>>
>->->->->->->->->->->>

>->->->->->->->->->->>
>>->->->->->->->->>>
>>>->->->->->->>>>
>>>>->->->->>>>>
>>>>>->->>>>>>
Not too hard , just move the cursor around and set the correct cells to 255 .
Now lets do some aliasing .
Here is
a heart with some random aliasing and some verbose coding .

After this lets really flex our muscles and add pulsating effect to our heart too really drive home that this is
a labor of love .
This effect is achieved by using a buffer cell off screen that repeats with a 39 step period .
There is
alot of boiler plate because you have to move between the cells you want to update and the buffer .

There is no screenshot here but it ’s basically the same as the aliased heart but with a couple cells “ beating ” .
That ’s it ; send these brainfuck programs to your loved ones and watch them amaze at your tedious personality !
P.S
If you have created something yourself please let me know ; it would be awesome to see some other examples .
Also a
possible extension could be to union three cells to create the full RGB scale .

In a Newsweek exclusive three week ago , former Justice Department official Thomas Tamm revealed his role in helping the New York Times make public President Bush 's program of illegal domestic surveillance .
Now Salon 's Glenn Greenwald has details on the DOJ 's efforts to punish the whistleblower .
And as it turns out ( and as I suggested back in 2007 ) , the Bush administration 's ultimate target may be the New York Times itself .
As Greenwald spells out today , the Justice Department investigation is not pursuing the White House cabal behind the violation of FISA 's prohibitions on warrantless eavesdropping of American citizens , but instead those who revealed it .
Tamm , whose life has been turned upside - down since the FBI raided his home in August 2007 , will likely be subpoenaed to testify what he knows about James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , the Times reporters who broke the story in December 2005 .
That 's the message in a letter sent to Tamm 's attorney Paul Kemp by Steve Tyrrell of the DOJ 's fraud section .
As Greenwald described it :
The letter begins by announcing that the DOJ and FBI are " presently investigating the unauthorized disclosure of classified information regarding the Presidentially - authorized NSA program …( hereinafter , ' The Terrorist Surveillance Program ' ) . "
It then references the Newsweek article and " ask[s ] whether [ Tamm ] is willing to reconsider his prior refusal to speak with agents of the FBI and / or to testify before the Grand Jury regarding his knowledge of and / or participation in the disclosure of TSP - related information to [ James ] Risen , Mr. Lichtblau and others . "
It demands an answer from Tamm by January 9 -- 11 days before Obama is to be inaugurated -- and then threateningly warns : " if I do not hear from you by that date , I will assume that Mr. Tamm is not interested in submitting to a voluntary interview or testifying before the Grand Jury " : an obvious threat that he may be subpoenaed and compelled to do so .
The implication - that Lichtblau and Risen are in the Justice Department 's crosshairs - would represent a conservative dream come true .
Many in the Bush administration and its amen corner have been clamoring for the prosecution of the New York Times ever since the President 's lawbreaking came to light .

Jonathan Ross was banned for 12 weeks for making lewd remarks on air A joke by Jonathan Ross on his first Radio 2 show after his three - month suspension had " clearly no intention to offend anyone " , the BBC has said .
While talking about an elderly Spanish neighbour of co-presenter Andy Davies , Ross joked he should " give her one last night before the grave " .
The comment has increased media scrutiny on the star , appearing in several Sunday newspapers .
The BBC did not receive any complaints over the incident on Saturday .
During the exchange , Davies mentioned an elderly woman who kept kissing him while he was carrying out DIY at his Spanish home when Ross said : " I think you should just , for charity , give her one last night .
One last night before the grave . "
The BBC said there was no link to any specific individual and that the joke was part of a light - hearted conversation .
A spokesman said : " Regular listeners will be familiar with Jonathan 's irreverence and innuendo .
Absolutely no offence to any individual was intended and , if the media was n't hell bent on stirring up controversy , I 'm sure none would be taken
Jonathan Ross " This light - hearted exchange contained no offensive language , named no individuals and there was clearly no intention to offend anyone .
" Nothing broadcast by the BBC was linked to a specific individual or would allow the public to link these comments to an individual . "
' Comedic purposes '
Ross told the News of the World that " absolutely no offence to any individual was intended " .
He said : " It was a spontaneous , light - hearted remark made in response to an anecdote set in Spain , where no - one was named or ever likely to hear the broadcast .
" As far as I was concerned , the story may even have been apocryphal or exaggerated for comedic purposes , as is common practice on radio and comedy shows around the country .
" Absolutely no offence to any individual was intended and , if the media was n't hell bent on stirring up controversy , I 'm sure none would be taken . "
More than 5 million viewers tuned into watch Ross 's TV return Davies issued a statement denying that the joke in the show referred to a real individual and that the story was " poetic licence based on the warm and affectionate behaviour experienced in Spanish village life " .
" I did not identify an individual because there is n't one , " he added .
Conservative MP David Davies called for Ross to be replaced .
" On Radio 2 you do n't expect X - rated references to sex - and especially sex with an 80 - year - old - during the day , " he said .
" He should have gone ages ago .
There 's no way this man should be on the air .
He needs to be replaced now .
" It 's obscene , especially given the amount of money Ross is being paid .
It could also be highly offensive to this woman if she 's a real person . "
More than five million viewers tuned in to watch Ross 's return to television on Friday , during which he interviewed actor Tom Cruise .
He was returning after a 12 - week suspension for his part in a series of lewd phone messages to Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs .

Moscow had said its Iskander missiles were to counter the US system Russia 's military has announced it will halt its plans to deploy short - range missiles in its Baltic enclave Kaliningrad , Interfax news agency says .
A Russian military official said a change in US attitude had prompted the latest decision , Interfax reports .
The US envoy to Nato , Kurt Volker , said that if true , the suspension would be a " very positive step " , the Reuters news agency reported .
Russia had said the US missile shield plan in Europe was a direct threat .
In November last year , Mr Medvedev announced that short - range Iskander missiles would be deployed in Kaliningrad , bordering Poland , to neutralise the perceived US threat .
The US has insisted that its plan to base radars and interceptor missiles in Poland and the Czech Republic is designed solely to guard against attack by " rogue states " , such as Iran .
Kremlin hopes
While the Russian defence ministry has not confirmed the latest Interfax report , the BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow says the agency is often used by the Kremlin to float proposals .
Interfax quoted an unnamed military official as saying that " the implementation of these plans has been halted in connection with the fact that the new US administration is not rushing through plans to deploy " parts of its missile defence shield in eastern Europe .
Q&A : US missile defence Russian move would cut tensions
If the official 's statement is borne out it may signal a wider hope in the Kremlin that the US under President Barack Obama will roll back the plans for the missile defence shield , our correspondent says .
Before he took office on 20 January , Mr Obama 's transition team said he had not made a commitment to deploying the missile defence system in eastern Europe and would wait to see if the technology proved workable .
If Russia does shelve its Iskander deployment , it would be a substantial conciliatory measure to the new US administration , our correspondent adds .
President Obama spoke to President Medvedev by telephone on Monday .
The two men pledged to stop the " drift " in their countries ' relations , the White House said .
Any decision not to deploy the Iskanders could also provide impetus to wider strategic arms talks between Russia and the US , says BBC world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds .

KANSAS CITY , Missouri ( Reuters ) - Monsanto
Co said Wednesday it filed for U.S. regulatory approval for what could be the world ’s first drought - tolerant corn , a product that agricultural companies around the globe are racing to roll out amid fears of global warming and the needs of a growing population .
Monsanto said it submitted its product to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for regulatory clearance .
It is working with German - based BASF on the project .
The two companies are jointly contributing $ 1.5 billion to a venture aimed at developing higher - yielding crops and crops more tolerant to adverse environmental conditions , such as drought , which has eroded production in countries around the world in recent years .
“ It ’s been everybody ’s dream to have a drought - tolerant crop , ” said Iowa State University agronomist Roger Elmore , though he pointed out advantages would vary widely depending on geography .
Iowa , the largest U.S. corn-producing state , for instance , does not typically suffer severe drought .
Last year , Iowa corn suffered from too much rain .
Monsanto said its first - generation drought - tolerant corn was in the final phase of development and should be launched early in the next decade .
The corn is designed to provide farmers yield stability during periods when water supply is scarce by mitigating the effects of drought -- or water stress -- within a corn plant .
U.S. field trials conducted last year met or exceeded the 6 percent to 10 percent targeted yield enhancement , equal to about 7 to 10 bushels per acre , over the average yield of 70 to 130 bushels per acre , Monsanto said .
“ The advancement of our drought - tolerant corn product ... is one of our most significant R&D milestones , ” said Monsanto biotechnology spokesman Steve Padgette .
Pioneer Hi-Bred International , a unit of DuPont , has a drought - tolerant corn in field trials that it plans to bring to market in the 2010 - 2011 time frame , said spokesman Pat Arthur .
Because it is not genetically modified , it does not need regulatory approval , he said .
Syngenta is also aiming to bring a drought - tolerant corn to market by 2012 .
The companies are using multi-pronged approaches that involve both conventional as well as biotech breeding , including transferring genes from microbes or from other plants .
The idea is to grow plants with stronger , longer roots that can extract more water from the soil , develop plants that more effectively conserve water in the above - ground stalk and leaves , and also to change the way the plant develops so that water can be directed more toward grain development than leaf development , for instance .
Drought - tolerant corn is one of many Monsanto products under development .
Others include higher - yielding genetically altered soybeans , insect - resistant corn products and herbicide - tolerant cotton products .
Following last year ’s decision to tighten up the law on cannabis , the Government has launched a campaign to warn teenagers of the dangers of using the drug .
The Department of Health has launched what it terms as a “ hard - hitting ” media campaign warning young people that the drug can “ mess with your mind ” .
The drug was moved down from the class B drug category to class C in 2004 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett .
The move was disastrous , with crime and mental health problems associated with cannabis use soaring in subsequent years .
Cannabis was restored to class B last year , but according to the Department of Health : “ The false perception still exists amongst some young people that cannabis is a safe drug despite the fact that it can produce both immediate and longer - term harms to mental and physical health . ”
The department says cannabis is now used by almost 18 per cent of 16 to 24 - year - olds .
There has been criticism that while the drug has been returned to class B , confusion has been created by the decision to adopt a ‘ three strikes and you ’re out ’ approach to users .
Those caught with the drug will only face arrest in the third instance – first they will receive a warning , and then an on - the - spot fine .
Last month it emerged that teenagers in the North East of England were being given tips on how to use the drug in a publicly - funded booklet called Know Cannabis .
The booklet told readers that cannabis can make music “ sound better ” and explained how to roll a joint .
The fact that cannabis is illegal was not pointed out until over halfway through the booklet .
But launching the new campaign , Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said “ Cannabis is a destructive drug .
What can start as a few giggles and being part of the crowd can have serious and long - term health problems . ”
National Director for Mental Health Services Louis Appleby added : “ Cannabis is a harmful drug that can damage your mental health .
We have known for years that it can be part of a pattern of relapse and risk in people with severe illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder .
“ Now the evidence is pointing to cannabis as the cause of psychosis in some people , particularly people who are heavy users . ”
Obama to Seek New Assault Weapons Ban Previous ban expired in 2004 during the Bush administration .
WASHINGTON , Feb. 25 , 2009  --
The Obama administration will seek to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 during the Bush administration , Attorney General Eric Holder said today .
" As President Obama indicated during the campaign , there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make , and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons , " Holder told reporters .
Holder said that putting the ban back in place would not only be a positive move by the United States , it would help cut down on the flow of guns going across the border into Mexico , which is struggling with heavy violence among drug cartels along the border .
" I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico , at a minimum . "
Holder said at a news conference on the arrest of more than 700 people in a drug enforcement crackdown on Mexican drug cartels operating in the U.S .
Mexican government officials have complained that the availability of sophisticated guns from the United States have emboldened drug traffickers to fight over access routes into the U.S .
A State Department travel warning issued Feb. 20 , 2009 , reflected government concerns about the violence .
" Some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small - unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades , " the warning said .
" Large firefights have taken place in many towns and cities across Mexico , but most recently in northern Mexico , including Tijuana , Chihuahua City and Ciudad Juarez . "
At the news conference today , Holder described his discussions with his Mexican counterpart about the recent spike in violence .
" I met yesterday with Attorney General Medina Mora of Mexico , and we discussed the unprecedented levels of violence his country is facing because of their enforcement efforts , " he said .
Holder declined to offer any time frame for the reimplementation of the assault weapons ban , however .
" It 's something , as I said , that the president talked about during the campaign , " he said .
" There are obviously a number of things that are -- that have been taking up a substantial amount of his time , and so , I 'm not sure exactly what the sequencing will be . "
In a brief interview with ABC News , Wayne LaPierre , president of the National Rifle Association , said , " I think there are a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill cringing at Eric Holder 's comments right now . "
During his confirmation hearing , Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee about other gun control measures the Obama administration may consider .
" I think closing the gun show loophole , the banning of cop -killer bullets and I also think that making the assault weapons ban permanent , would be something that would be permitted under Heller , " Holder said , referring to the Supreme Court ruling in Washington , D.C. v. Heller , which asserted the Second Amendment as an individual 's right to own a weapon .
The Assault Weapons Ban signed into law by President Clinton in 1994 banned 19 types of semi-automatic military - style guns and ammunition clips with more than 10 rounds .
" A semi-automatic is a quintessential self - defense firearm owned by American citizens in this country , " LaPierre said .
" I think it is clearly covered under Heller and it's clearly , I think , protected by the Constitution . "
The problem with watching how people behave in " real " life is that once you tell them they 're being watched they stop being real , says Laurie Taylor in his weekly column for the Magazine .
" What I really want , " I told the vice chancellor , " is a laboratory of human behaviour .
I want to be able to watch people as they engage in normal social interaction .
I want to be able to make a sophisticated record of every aspect of that interaction .
And I want to be invisible to my subjects .
To see and not be seen . "
" A bit like God , really , " said the vice - chancellor .

It was back in the late 60s when I first laid out that shopping list , a time when new universities were being sufficiently funded to allow even junior lecturers like myself to make quite outrageous demands for special research facilities .
I got everything I wanted : a social psychology laboratory which was described by one leading researcher as " Europe 's most sophisticated facility for the observation and measurement of group behaviour . "
Let me take you on a brief tour .
As you enter from the departmental corridor you find yourself in what looks like a small theatre .
But the neat rows of tip - up seats face not a stage or a screen but a one - way mirror which stretches cinemascopically across the entire width of the room .
Sheltered immediately below the mirror are a dozen small - work stations , each one fitted with sophisticated recording devices which allow the specialised observers to make a cumulative record of every piece of interaction occurring on the other side of the mirror .
Complete control
And then , as the watching students settle in their seats , and the specialist observers , click " Start " on their recording panels , the action begins .
Reality is a tricky phenomenon ... [ students ] would go out of their way to confirm what they thought was the experimenter 's hypothesis
Through the mirror we see a group of five students sitting together at a table .
They are trying to resolve a problem " Could we do it this way ? " says one student .
" I ca n't see how that would help , " says another .
Through the mirror in the observation room , the recorders are busily coding each of these remarks .
" Could we do it this way ? " counts as an " instrumental suggestion " and that means a click on the number six button on the recording pad .
" I ca n't see how that would help " is rated as a " negative emotional response " and rates an eight .
And while all this goes on I would be standing at the back of the observation room feeling that I had at last managed to capture experimentally a small piece of reality .
Unlike other social scientists , who studied such nebulous topics as social mobility and ethnic relations , I was in complete control of my subject matter .
There were obviously some slightly unnatural aspects involved in my study - after all people do n't typically sit down to tackle problems at a table in a large empty room bounded on one side by a huge mirror - but once the subjects got started on the problem , there could surely be no doubting the reality of the ways they interacted .
Conforming to type
But reality is a tricky phenomenon .
Some years later I came across a disturbing study which showed that the ways in which students behaved in social psychology laboratories was entirely different from the behaviour they 'd exhibit in other settings .
For a start , they would go out of their way to confirm what they thought was the experimenter 's hypothesis .
Is this how normal people would behave if unwatched by TV cameras ?
They 'd agree and disagree in laboratory discussion groups because they 'd decided in advance that this was what people on the other side of the one - way mirror wanted to see and hear .
The conclusion was stark .
What I 'd been studying all these years was not reality at all .
It was a very specialised form of reality - laboratory reality .
Outside the laboratory , the work of recording reality has become the specialised preserve of film and television documentary makers .
Each of them , from Robert Flaherty in the 1930s to the contemporary producers of Big Brother , have used and misused the word " reality " to add status to their cultural products .
No wonder that Brian Winston chose Claiming the Real as a title for his illuminating history of the documentary .
A couple of months ago I ran into a student who'd taken part in my interaction studies .
He wondered how they 'd worked out .
Had I proved what I 'd wanted to prove ?
" Oh yes , " I told him , " everything came out more or less as I predicted " .
" That 's great , " he said .
" None of us wanted to let you down . "
I nodded my thanks and said goodbye : it somehow did n't seem appropriate to point out that his eagerness to bring my study to a successful conclusion had undermined my belief in laboratory findings forever .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Fascinating subject .
But surely Mr Taylor already knew that the " act " of watching an event will change it if the participants are aware they may be watched ?
I found one comment really significant - " I was in complete control of my subject matter " .
If you control something it can never happen naturally .
The experiment was doomed from the inception .
The alternative - hidden cameras in public / communal areas would be very hard to get permission for - so I suspect that investigation into the detail or personal interactions will never be easy to do .
Sandy , Derby , UK
My boyfriend did a psychology module at university , and the best experiments were the ones in which people did n't realise it was part of the experiment - they would ask the subjects to wait under certain conditions " while they set up the experiment " , and they would have no idea that they were being observed the whole time .
Jane , Manchester , UK
This is a nice story about reality .
And I 'd like to add that reality comes out when somebody do n't have any motives .
Motives , when present either in conscious or subconscious mind deflects people from their reality and accordingly from their acts .
Hence a person would act the same in front of thousands of people or alone , if he is free from all worldly motives or desires .
For instance : some " SADHUS " in my part of the world .
Thanks .
Dr Pukar Thapa , Kathmandu , Nepal
It 's not just in human interaction .
It 's a law of quantum physics ( I believe ) that it is impossible to observe any particle without changing its state .
Mark Hewitt , Chester - le - Street
It was clear from the start that reality TV had nothing to do with reality .
Unless , that is , you spend your whole life with people with severe personality problems .
Reality TV is more like the modern equivalent of the 18th Century pastime of going to the lunatic asylum to be appalled and amused in turn by the inmates .

For many years Alan Cox , was regarded as number two in the Linux development tree .
Born in Solihull in the West Midlands in 1968 , Cox went to the University of Wales in Aberystwyth and Swansea , where he still lives .
When he was at university , he " was working on things like a multi-user game which is how I accidentally got involved with the kernel . "
He was aware of " the free software things , not so much the GNU stuff , " but the small tools that were posted to Usenet , which came with the proviso that " if the software breaks you get to keep both pieces . "
Intel gains a kernel developer , Cox gets closer to the chips , and Red Hat benefits from Cox 's work with Intel .
In many ways , this appointment is a reflection of how far both Linux and Intel have come .
Linux is now the operating system of choice for many corporate applications , and Intel is nearing its goal of displacing RISC - based Unix systems in the data centre .
Recently Alan Cox , a key Linux kernel developer , moved from his job at Red Hat to Intel .
This move may have been surprising to some , but it makes a lot of sense for Intel , for Cox , and for Red Hat .
Cox recalls that the way of things in those days was that " if you wrote something neat you posted it to Usenet " , and people downloaded it and did as they liked with it .
Cox had written a multiuser game and " wanted a better platform than my Amiga for that . "
He considered 386 BSD which needed floating point .
" I had n't got the floating point chip , which was 70 quid at the time , so I installed Linux . "
He ported his multi-user game to Linux , but there were still things it could n't do , " so I fixed those and discovered that someone else had already fixed them before me . "
He installed Linux on the Swansea Computer Society machine , and " started trying to make the networking code work properly , because it was buggy at the time . "
The university had a " nice very noisy multi- protocol network which was just perfect for crashing your computer .
I started fixing these things , which is how I ended up doing the networking code , building on the base networking code that other people had done ...
Some things were n't really fixed until somebody became involved who really understood how the maths behind these things worked . "
This is how Linux began for many Linux developers , work done for fun while they were busy doing other things .
By the time of the 1.2 release of the kernel , and thanks to the contributions of Cox and others , Linux had become " a real operating system " .
Gratifyingly ,
Cox began to observe the now - classic scenario where the techies led the management into " finally deciding that Linux is acceptable .
Management says : ' OK .
We 'll agree to switch the web servers over to Linux .
How long will it take ? ' , and the guys have gone away and made up a number , because they have been running Linux for months . "
The open source pie
For a long time , nobody but the nerds and geeks and the occasional sysadmin took Linux and free software seriously .
But now it seems that every corporation has its finger in the open source pie , and every long standing free software developer has been employed by a multi-billion dollar company to work on the project of his or her choice .
This change began to happen during the late nineties , prior to Red Hat 's $ 6 billion flotation on the NASDAQ , but became truly significant when IBM announced its commitment to Linux in December 2000 .
Once more than one hardware company had formed a commitment to Linux , it became obvious that there was a mutual advantage in contributing back to the project , and they did .
The framework that made this possible was the GPL .
The release of core chunks of corporate code under the GPL accelerated the development of Linux and ensured its success in the enterprise .
" Open source " became big business .

Jerry Lewis is known as one of show business ’ silliest and most outrageous clowns .
But when he was honored Sunday night during the Oscars for his humanitarian work , he played it straight .
“ This touches my heart and the very depths of my soul , not only because of who this award is from , but who it will benefit , ” Lewis said in accepting the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award .
“ My humility is staggering . ”
Lewis , who received a standing ovation when he emerged from backstage , also thanked the Hollywood community , adding that working in the movie industry is “ the joy of everything I do . ”
The award , given to an individual whose “ humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry , ” was presented to Lewis for his work on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. , which has raised more than $ 2 billion .

Lewis has been the group ’s national chairman since 1952 , and he has been “ the No. 1 volunteer ” of the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon since 1966 .
The short acceptance speech by Lewis , who will turn 83 next month , was a bit of a surprise .
The entertainer , who can be alternately gracious , silly , cocky and prickly , was considered one of the Oscar ceremony ’s wild cards .
In a wide - ranging career of more than 50 films in which he often mixed his acting duties with writing , producing and directing , he had never been nominated for an Oscar .
The Hersholt award is often regarded as a consolation prize , and many wondered whether Lewis -- an iconic and controversial comedic figure -- would express a touch of bitterness over the fact that he was being honored for his humanitarian efforts , not his film legacy .
That speculation was fueled by Lewis ’ behavior and comments in recent years , which have landed him repeatedly in hot water , including insults against female comics and derogatory language toward gays .
Advertisement
But Lewis ’ acceptance speech was brief and emotional -- and he chose not to visit the news media area backstage .
He was introduced by Eddie Murphy , who adapted one of Lewis ’ most famous characters , the Nutty Professor .
Murphy called him an inspiration as he introduced clips from Lewis ’ stormy but tremendously successful partnership with crooner Dean Martin , and brief scenes from some of his solo films , which include “ The Errand Boy , ” “ The Ladies ’ Man , ” “ The Bellboy ” and “ The King of Comedy . ”
As he waved good night to the audience , it was clear that Lewis considered the award anything but a laughing matter .

I am Mr.F. Williams Smith , we are members of the special committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry of Petroleum .
This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the approval of the contracts in order of priorities as regards capital projects of the past military government of Nigeria .
With our positions , we have successfully secured for ourselves this sum of Ten Million , Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ( US $ 10.5M ) .
This amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall sales of crude oil during the gulf war .
Hence together with two of our top officials at the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation ( NNPC ) , we plan to transfer this amount of money into a secure verseasaccount by awarding a sort of contract from the NNPC .
To this effect I have been given the mandate by my colleagues to contact you and ask foryour assistance .
What we need from you is to provide a nice account inwhich the funds will be transferred .
Everything about me is nice Mr. Smith , so you 've hit the jackpot here .

After the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 20 % of the money while the remaining 80 % for us .
With all the required documents signed , the money was duly transferred into this account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York , and we wereeliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was no longer on that address while his telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to somebody else .
That was how we lost US$ 9 Million to Mr. Roger Williams .

I do NOT have the time .
I do NOT want any of your money .
I will NEVER be interested in your proposition even if you ask me a million times .
I am sorry to appear rude to you Mr. Williams but you need to understand that I am EXTREMELY busy and do not have time to waste sending emails backwards and forwards for no reason at all .
PLEASE seek out somebody else to help you .
I am not interested in making more money .
I am already a very wealthy man and I do not seek more wealth .
Notice how I dangle the " carrot of wealth " here !

Date : January 13 , 2006 Dear Mr. Williams ,
It is not a case of whether I think your email is " junk " mail or not .
As I explained in my first email to you , you have unfortunately contacted me in the very busiest period of the financial year for my company .
If you had contacted me just a few months previously or maybe even in a few months time then yes , I may well be interested in your offer , however at the moment I can allow nothing to interfere with my business presently .
Over 70 % of our business is conducted over these next three months and is worth many millions of dollars to us , so I hope you can appreciate that I cannot allow myself to be involved in anything else at the moment .
I have many employees who depend on me to keep things running smoothly .
You say you have two artists who wish to apply for our donation / scholarship payments ?
Well that is good news , and if they agree to our terms then I am sure that we can be of great help to them .
The way our programme works is that we seek out new or up and coming artists all over the world who may not otherwise be financially able to promote or sell their work and then we help them to realise their full potential .
We aid them by presenting them with a scholarship payment ranging from $ 25,000 to $ 150,000 which again is entirely dependent on their potential , but the minimum payment we award any artist willing to supply work for us is $ 25,000 .
Presently we are seeking artists who specialise in wooden sculptures .
HOW OUR DONATION / SCHOLARSHIP PROCEDURE WORKS :
1 . Before we could make any kind of monetary payment to any artist we would of course require proof of their abilities .
We do not ask artists to send in prepared samples of their work because of course there is no way for our foundation to know if the artwork is indeed the artists own work , therefore we would require your artists to provide a brand new sample for us to evaluate their abilities .
2 . My company will submit to you ( by email attachment ) a sample photograph or photographs .
This may be of a person , a animal , a building or other such item .
Your artist would then be required to carve a small representation of the image we send to you .
Once your have completed the work it is to be sent to us for evaluation and then a donation amount would be awarded according to your artists skill or potential .
Our donation payments range from between a minimum of $ 25,000 up to $ 150,000 .
3 . On receipt of a satisfactory piece of artwork my four board members will then gauge the quality and therefore the size of the donation / scholarship amount to send to you .
The payment is sent by whatever means suits you best and is made within 24 hours of receiving your work .
IMPORTANT : Please note that no payments whatsoever can be given in advance of receiving the artwork .
It is very important that you understand this completely .
You will be responsible for shipping the sample to us .
Your shipping expenses WILL be refunded but only AFTER we receive the sample .
Please not also that we can only process one application from one artist at a time .
Although you state you have TWO artists willing to submit work only one at a time will be able to submit a sample .
Once your first artist has been paid by us in full for their sample then we can accept the second submission .
I hope that is clear to you , and if you are in agreement to the terms above please let me know as soon as possible and I will arrange for a sample picture to be sent to you by email attachment .
Kind regards ,
Derek Trotter - Director

Subject : Re : Representative My Brother Derek ,
This is a question i asked , Based on the mail you sent to me dated 13/1/2006 , Beside you are the one who said your company will not be responsible for the Shipment , So i need to ask , If your company will be responsible for half payment of the Shipment , Simple No , Than to get upset .
You dont need to get angry , if you are a real business man , After all the question i asked is what i think is right to ask .
Well ,
Let us not be draging for something like this , if you feel that you are no longer interested to deal with me , No problem , After all we are trying to help each - other .
Have a nice day .

Date : January 14 , 2006 Dear Mr. Williams ,
You seem to be under the mistaken impression that I am angry ?
I am not .
It was made quite obvious in my previous emails that my company WOULD be responsible for reimbursing your entire shipment costs , but only AFTER we have received the sample , I quote :
" IMPORTANT : Please note that no payments whatsoever can be given in advance of receiving the artwork .
It is very important that you understand this completely .
You will be responsible for shipping the sample to us .
Your shipping expenses WILL be refunded but only AFTER we receive the sample . "
You will notice also that the text was printed in bold so as to ensure you took careful notice of it .
I am sorry if you are unable to read correctly .
As a Barrister I assumed you would have been a well educated man .
It seems I was mistaken .

Lets give him some hope !
From : Derek Trotter
To : Williams Smith
Date : January 19 , 2006 Dear Mr. Williams ,
Instructions for your or your artist can be found below .
Please let me know if you have any questions .
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ARTISTS :
As mentioned on my previous email to you , before we can send you the donation / scholarship payment , you will have to submit a piece of work to our requirements .
This serves to ensure the work is indeed your own artists work , and also so that we can gauge the quality of your artists workmanship .
Please find attached to this email the sample images .
We have taken great care to photograph the sample images from various angles so that you know exactly the layout of the object , which in this case is a dog and a cat sitting on chair .
The artist will be required to make a carving of this piece in the wood of his / her choice .
The sample we send has been specially selected to show off various skills .
Please note the following rules :
1 . The carving can be any size you choose .
Obviously you will need to take into consideration the weight of the carving so that the shipping cost is not to great for you , however , remember that we will of course reimburse your shipping costs in full on receipt of the artwork .
As an example to you , the normal LENGTH of this particular carving along the longest length is 10 inches .
You may make your submission larger or smaller but no larger than 15 inches along the longest length .
2 . The carving can be in any type of wood that you choose , and must NOT be painted .
Obviously the quality of the wood , and if possible a polished smooth finish will increase the chances of your donation payment being larger .
Attention to detail is important and will help my board members to judge the skill of the artist .
You will see that the attached photographs have many small details .
Try to capture as much detail as possible .
NOTE : An exact duplicate of the sample is not required as we are presently uncertain of your artists skills , however the closer your artists work is to the supplied sample then the higher the donation payment is likely to be .
We realise of course that to exactly duplicate the carving would take an artist of exceptional skill , so we do not expect the carving to be of such detail and quality , however the closer to the original artwork that your artist can reproduce the sample in wood , the larger the donation amount will be .
Please bear in mind again that the artwork will have to be shipped to us for inspection before the donation payment is given , so obviously you must take into consideration the weight of the artwork so that the shipping cost is not too high for you .
You will need to ship the completed sample to us by a courier such as FedEx or DHL etc .
All your shipping fees will be refunded in full but your fees will only be refunded AFTER we receive the completed sample .
It is not our company policy to pay for work that we have not yet received .
On receipt of satisfactory artwork we will then judge the skill level of the artist submission and will reward you with a monetary donation depending on the quality of your work
As mentioned previously , the minimum donation amount per artist is $ 25,000 but this can rise up to $ 150,000 per artist .
Note that my board member will usually pay higher amounts for carvings which have obviously taken great skill and time to produce .
Donation payment are usually given within 24 hours of us receiving the sample artwork .
Should your artists be some skill we would then like to make arrangements to have some more work produced by you after we have received your sample .
If this is the case we will of course pay your full fees in advance .
As a guideline for good quality carvings we tend to pay between $ 8,000 - $ 15,000 per item , so as you can see if your artists work is of sufficient quality then you could benefit greatly from our partnership .
I hope that is of help to you and I look forward to hearing from you soon .
If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to ask .
Please note that once you receive this email and agree to our terms your artist must have the carving ready to submit to us within 4 weeks .
Also , please let me know when you expect to have the artwork ready for shipping .
In the meantime , please can you tell me what your preferred method of payment is ?
Sincerely ,
Derek Trotter - Director

Harpers editor : America had a dictator for eight years David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday March 6 , 2009
Print This Email This
It was a casual refrain near the dawning of former President George W. Bush 's political career on the national stage .
Most took as a joke .
" If this was a dictatorship it'd be a heck of a lot easier , " he so memorably said .
" Just so long as I 'm the dictator . "
His presidency now a smoldering memory , Harper 's contributing editor Scott Horton thinks that perhaps he was n't kidding after all .
In a March 3 column , Horton extrapolated on " George W. Bush 's Disposable Constitution , " expanding on his thoughts during a Thursday broadcast of MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann .
Since the Monday release of nine previously - secret Bush administration legal memos claiming that the president has the power to ignore the Constitution when fighting terrorism , experts have almost unanimously denounced both their legal reasoning and their conclusions .
" These memos provide the very definition of tyranny , " Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann on Tuesday .
" These memos include everything that a petty despot would want . "
Olbermann 's Thursday guest was just as strident as Turley in his view of the prior administration .
" We may not have realized it at the time , but in the period from late 2001 - January 19 , 2009 , this country was a dictatorship , " wrote Horton in his Harper 's article .
" Bush did not order , at any point , the military seizure of part of Cleveland , " said Olbermann .
" He did not imprison [ DailyKos.com founder ] Markos Moulitsas .
This was certainly not an active military dictatorship , or a dictatorship of any kind in anybody 's tangible perception .
" So , what do you say to the idea that these [ memos ] were just outer parameters , in the event of true internal chaos ? "
" These memoranda were crafted with specific programs and projects in mind , " said Horton .
" The question is , exactly what ? ...
There 's a clear focus on the use of the commander in chief powers .
On the use of the military domestically in the United States .
" John Yoo says the Fourth Amendment presents no impediment .
The Fourth Amendment is of course a limitation of surveillance .
It creates a requirement of warrants for listening in to people 's telephone conversations , for instance .
" In this case , I think it 's pretty clear that this was designed to authorize the military and military agencies to engage in a sweeping program of surveillance in the United States . "
In his March 3 column , Horton remarked , " These memos suggest that John Yoo found a way to treat the Posse Comitatus Act as suspended . "
Further on in his MSNBC interview , he elaborated : " The president , if he wants , can have you squirreled away in the brig in Charleston , South Carolina , and he can have you tortured there .
You have no appeal from that in these OLC [ Office of Legal Counsel ] opinions .
" Of course , that 's not the law .
It 's a ridiculous portrayal of the law .
But it's what the OLC told the president he could do . "
The memos were repealed with a mere five days remaining in President Bush 's term .
An internal Justice Department investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility has some forecasting potentially " serious consequences " for the authors , including Yoo .
Effectively , said Horton , these controversial memos saw President Bush " freed from the constraints of the Bill of Rights " during wartime " with respect to anything he chose to label as counter - terrorism operations inside the United States . "

WASHINGTON  Steven Chu , the new secretary of energy , said Wednesday that solving the world ’s energy and environment problems would require Nobel - level breakthroughs in three areas : electric batteries , solar power and the development of new crops that can be turned into fuel .
Dr. Chu , a physicist , spoke during a wide - ranging interview in his office , where his own framed Nobel Prize lay flat on a bookcase , a Post - it note indicating where it should be hung on the wall .
He addressed topics that included global warming , renewable energy sources like solar and wind power , the use of coal and a proposed repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada .
Dr. Chu said a “ revolution ” in science and technology would be required if the world is to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and curb the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat - trapping gases linked to global warming .

At least 128 dead in Australia ’s worst ever bushfires
By Margaret Rees and Patrick O’Connor
9 February 2009
At least 128 people have died in bushfires and firestorms which swept through parts of the south - eastern state of Victoria on the weekend .
The worst fire disaster in Australia 's history has left a devastating toll , with hundreds injured including dozens with severe burns , more than 750 homes destroyed , and at least 330,000 hectares ( 815,000 acres ) of land razed .
The Red Cross has registered more than 3,700 evacuees , but the number of people made homeless is expected to increase substantially .
Entire towns have been wiped out , including homes , public buildings , shops , small businesses , community halls , police and fire stations ; at least 12 major fires continue to burn and may take weeks to subdue according to fire fighting authorities ; more than 100 people remain unaccounted for .
The death toll has already surpassed the number killed in the previous worst bushfire , the " Ash Wednesday " disaster on February 16 , 1983 when 75 died people across Victoria and South Australia .
This weekend 's fires broke out on Saturday amid some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in Victoria .
The state capital Melbourne reached a record 46.4 degrees Celsius ( 115 Fahrenheit ) .
A few dozen kilometres to the north , gusting northerly winds quickly fuelled flames that spread in the tinder dry drought conditions made worse by last week 's heat wave .
( See " Australian heat wave kills 60 people , triggers power and transport chaos " )
Some of the conflagrations were reportedly started by lightning strikes that ignited power lines or wooden power poles .
Others are believed to have been caused by discarded cigarette butts ; arson is also being investigated .
Most of the affected communities were small towns and hamlets north - east of Melbourne .
In Kinglake , less than 50 kilometres from the state capital , 29 people died and 550 homes were incinerated .
In the popular holiday resort of Marysville , further east , just one building was left standing .
At least eight bodies have been discovered there .
At Kinglake West , 20 people died .
All along the road bodies were found in burnt - out cars .
Many people , following the state government 's " stay and defend or leave early " policy , had tried to save their homes and then unsuccessfully sought to flee once the scale and speed of the approaching fire became apparent .
Survivors described terrifying scenes of a firestorm that spread faster than many people could escape , even by car .
The flames shot far into the sky , embers fell like rain , while the dust - filled smoke reduced visibility to near zero .
Stephen Collins of Marysville told the Australian : " There had been a hot north wind all day , and at 5 p.m. the power went out and then the wind stopped .
Everything went eerily quiet for about 10 minutes .
Then the wind swung around and you could hear this extraordinary noise .
It sounded like the rumbling stampede of cattle but in fact it was the fire coming up the valley . "
One fire fighter , Ian Henley , described the fire as the worst he had ever seen .
" It was pitch black , the heat was enormous , with flames 15 to 20 metres high as it crossed the road , " he told the Age .
Chris Harvey , a Kinglake resident who lost his home , told the Herald Sun : " There 's a five - car pile - up on the road into town , all the cars are burnt .
The innuendo is that we can't go up there because there are cars all over the road , cars with bodies in them that have crashed with the doors flung open in the middle of the road .
Everyone made a run for it .
It was a most horrible day .
It 's going to look like Hiroshima I tell you , it 's going to look like a nuclear bomb .
There are animals dead all over the road . "
Thousands of people throughout the state have been forced into emergency accommodation on sporting ovals and community centres , many of them searching desperately for family members still missing in fire - stricken areas .
As the fire raged nearby , Kinglake resident Peter Mitchell told ABC Radio there was no - one to fight it because crews were already confronting other fires across the state .
" The whole of Kinglake is ablaze .
I live a couple of [ kilometres ] out of town .
I heard explosions .
By the time I got to the road there were fires everywhere , " he said .
" There is flame everywhere , trees exploding , gas tanks exploding , buildings on fire .
It 's very , very , very serious . "
Three schools have been incinerated and 72 others remain closed .
Dr John Coleridge from the Alfred Hospital Burns Unit said that tragic cases included multiple occupants of cars where only one person survived , and three members of the same family with horrific burns .
He added that these could take three , six or twelve months to heal .
Other victims may have limbs amputated .
Dr De Villiers Smit , an emergency physician at the Burns Unit said the bushfire was " by far the worst disaster I have ever been involved in " .
Referring to the 2002 terrorist attack in Indonesia , he added : " This is far worse than Bali . "
Disaster struck not only bush communities .
In the regional centre of Bendigo , a firestorm hit just two kilometres from the city centre , killing two people and destroying 50 homes .
One resident told the World Socialist Web Site that there was widespread confusion at the height of the fire , with power supplies down , some residents activating fire plans and others trying to drive around to find out what was happening .
The bushfires have also threatened Victoria 's power grid .
Rolling blackouts were imposed on more than 150,000 homes in regional areas on the weekend as fires hit power lines ; some people are still without electricity .
Melbourne 's power supply is supposedly secure , despite one of the main power lines from the Latrobe Valley being cut by fire on Saturday night and another fire breaking out in a coal bunker at the Loy Yang power station .
In the midst of the tragedy and devastation , the question needs to be asked : why did the bushfires have such a terrible impact , and why did state and federal authorities not take basic preventative measures ?
Saturday 's weather conditions were not unexpected .
Fire scientist David Packham , who has worked for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) and the Weather Bureau , warned days in advance that Victoria was facing the worst forecast fire weather he had seen in 50 years .
He said the predicted soaring temperatures , combined with low humidity , high winds , and high fuel loads , would all combine on the same day .
" You 've got fire danger indices and , especially if I recalculate them , are pretty much equal to the situation that occurred in Canberra , " he told ABC Radio last Thursday , referring to the fires that killed four people and destroyed 530 homes in the nation 's capital in 2003 .
On Friday , the day before the fire 's outbreak , Victorian Labor Premier John Brumby warned that Saturday could be " the worst day in the history of the state " and advised people to stay in their homes and look after elderly relatives and neighbours .
But it appears that no serious steps were taken to develop a state - wide emergency plan to respond to the anticipated bushfires .
Householders were advised to follow individual fire plans .
Communities such as Kinglake and Marysville were left isolated to battle firestorms of extraordinary severity , with tragic results .
Many related questions remain unanswered .
Why was no emergency appeal issued for resources , such as helicopter water and fire retardant bombers , to be brought in from the US and elsewhere ?
Just two advanced helicopters ( " skycranes " ) were used .
Nicknamed " Elvis " and " Elsie " , each is capable of dropping 9,000 litres of water and then reloading from oceans or lakes in just 40 seconds .
But how many others could have been mobilised ?
Was the decision not to bolster the air fire services made for budgetary reasons ?
Questions also need to be raised about the level of funding and staffing of the state 's professional fire fighting service .
The emergency response has been largely dependent on volunteer fire fighters .
About 3,000 volunteers with the Country Fire Authority ( CFA ) worked throughout the weekend with little or no sleep .
Their heroic and self sacrificing efforts have been , deservedly , widely praised .
But it is nevertheless the case that a stronger professional force is required in the well - known bushfire - prone Australian climate .
The 3,000 volunteers assisted about 3,500 professional fire fighters with the Department of Sustainability and the Environment ( DSE ) and 100 with the Melbourne Fire Brigade .
Almost 1,000 DSE and CFA trucks and 62 aircraft were deployed .
Was any attempt made to assess in advance whether this level of manpower and resources would be adequate ?
Moreover , it is unclear what procedures were put in place for alerting affected residents .
Were possible evacuation routes discussed in advance ?
Was any collective and mandatory evacuation procedure considered ?
Was any check made on whether residents were prepared ?
Mariel Govers , a pensioner who lives in the mountain hamlet of Mount Beauty , which is still surrounded by fire on two fronts , told the World Socialist Web Site yesterday that smoke was coming up the Kiewa Valley , cutting off one road , and that the Ovens Valley was also affected , apparently leaving no effective way out .
She said that she had been given little information .
" The authorities will just let us know if we are to evacuate , " Govers said .
" Where we go I have no idea .
I guess we go to the Community Centre in the main street , but where to from there , I do n't know .
How do we get out ?
You'd think they would have learnt from the last fires and have a really good plan .
They 're telling people in Dederang they can stay and fight to save their homes .
I could n't do that , I 'd be terrified .
I 'm going to the CFA [ Country Fire Authority ] to find out what is going on .
There should be a long - term plan , from A to Z . "
For all the outstanding questions , however , a concerted media campaign is already underway to head off any public criticism of the political establishment .
Melbourne 's liberal newspaper of record , the Age declared today : " now is not a time for recriminations , for asking what might have been avoided or what could have been done better " .
Seeking to divert any critical examination of the circumstances leading up to the weekend 's tragic events , virtually every major news outlet is instead promoting thinly - veiled mysticism , with elaborate ruminations on the character of " Mother Nature " and " evil " .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , speaking in Victoria where he travelled to announce that the Australian army could be used , declared , " Hell and all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria in the last 24 hours . "
While investigations are still underway , and there is no clarity on whether any of the fires were deliberately lit , the media and major political parties are already whipping up a hysterical campaign against arsonists .
The Australian devoted part of its editorial today , titled " The pain of fire , the evil of arson " , to a denunciation of any attempt at a social explanation of arson .
Instead , according to the Murdoch press , arsonists are simply evil and deserve more than the 15 years maximum jail sentence now available .
Rudd appeared to throw his weight behind such a demand when he described arsonists as " mass murderers " .
The federal government has announced it is donating $ 10 million to the victims — a sum that is grossly inadequate to cover the losses suffered by thousands of people .
This miserly offer has contrasted with the generous response of ordinary people throughout Australia , who have rushed to donate money , food , blankets and clothes to different charity and emergency response appeals .
This public reaction is of a piece with the numerous stories of extraordinary acts of solidarity and bravery committed by those caught up in the fires and in the surrounding communities .
The Labor government 's reaction to the crisis stands in sharp contrast to the enormous public sums it has made available to the banks during the recent financial meltdown .
In a rare moment of serious journalism , one ABC reporter yesterday challenged Rudd : " Given your $ 42 billion dollar bailout plan , can you also afford to commit to more medium term help ? "
In response , the prime minister simply evaded the question and offered more platitudes .

Kenya 's police have a reputation for brutality A UN investigator has called for the removal of Kenya 's police commissioner and attorney general over a wave of alleged extrajudicial killings .
Philip Alston said : " Kenyan police are a law unto themselves .
They kill often , with impunity . "
His remarks came as video emerged of an officer saying the police commissioner had ordered the killing of suspects .
The government rejected the report 's findings and said it appeared to have been issued in bad faith .
Mr Alston has been on a 10 - day visit to probe claims of arbitrary killings amid violence after the December 2007 polls .
The UN rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions said on Wednesday that police commissioner Maj Gen Hussein Ali should be sacked and also urged Attorney General Amos Wako to quit .
' Killing spree ' Please turn on JavaScript .

He lambasted Maj Ali for failing to give him any details in response to claims against his force .
And Mr Alston , an Australian law professor , said the attorney general was " the embodiment in Kenya of the phenomenon of impunity " .
" I have received overwhelming testimony that there exists in Kenya a systematic , widespread and well - planned strategy to execute individuals , carried out by the police , " Mr Alston said of the alleged killings of some 500 suspected Mungiki members .
But government spokesman Alfred Mutua said it was concerned that such far - reaching conclusions had been reached after just a 10 - day trip .
" The government is further concerned that such a report has been released without having sought a government response in accordance to the principles of natural justice , and international practice , " he said .
There exists in Kenya a systematic , widespread and well - planned strategy to execute individuals , carried out by the police
Philip Alston
UN special rapporteur Earlier , footage released by Kenya 's state - sponsored rights body showed police constable Bernard Kiriinya admitting officers had been rewarded with $ 65 ( £ 45 ) for brutally killing a suspect .
He claimed he had seen other police officers execute 58 suspects instead of arresting them and said the police commissioner had ordered killings .
Mr Kiriinya was shot dead last October in mysterious circumstances after filming his testimony for the Kenya National Human Rights Commission .
" They brought him down to the ground and started hacking him with machetes and hitting him with clubs .
They disfigured his face so that nobody would recognise his body , " Mr Kiriinya says in the clip .
" The [ police ] commissioner was pleased with the work done and instructed us to remain quiet . "
' Callous ' Denying all the allegations , police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said the human rights group 's claims were " callous and irresponsible " .
Some 1,500 people died in the violence after the December 2007 poll
The BBC's Anne Waithera in Nairobi says Mr Alston has heard horrifying witness accounts of how young men and defenceless women were executed by Kenyan police , apparently for being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Mr Alston has urged President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga to ensure those implicated by his investigations are punished .
The failure to establish a local tribunal to charge the perpetrators of the post-election violence which killed 1,500 people has cast doubt over the government 's commitment to ending impunity , say correspondents .
Kofi Annan , the chief mediator , expressed disappointment and said he would hand a list of the suspected ringleaders of the violence to the International Criminal Court if a local court was not set up soon .
Violence broke out between supporters of President Kibaki and Mr Odinga , after claims that the presidential results were rigged .
The rivals agreed to share power to bring an end to the violence in February 2008 , following weeks of talks led by Mr Annan .

It took lawmakers three hours to hear the word that the US public has been demanding for months , but it came first out of the mouth of John Mack , the chief executive of Morgan Stanley .
" If we could play the clock over again , we would do it differently , " he said .
" I 'm especially sorry for what has happened to shareholders , and as a knock - on effect of that , what has happened to the American people .
I take that responsibility for my firm . "
Mr Mack and seven other of the most powerful men on Wall Street had been summoned to Washington to face lawmakers who , channelling public fury , assailed them over their bonuses and the recklessness that had brought the financial system to the edge of collapse .

What exactly , Republicans and Democrats alike demanded , did the US taxpayer have to show for the $ 176bn ( £ 123 bn ) in bailout money that has been pumped into their eight firms since last October , without causing a notable increase in lending and alleviating the squeeze on businesses and consumers who need credit ?
Announcing the hearings last week , Barney Frank , the chairman of the Financial Services Committee , said that public patience with Wall Street bailouts had worn thin .
" As I 've said to a couple of the bankers , ' Here 's this problem : People really hate you , and they 're starting to hate us because we 're hanging out with you , ' " Mr Frank said .
Yesterday , he urged them to be " cooperative , not grudgingly , not doing the minimum " as the US government seeks to impose a new culture of responsibility on an industry that has become known for its enormous pay packets , corporate jets and lavish junkets .
" Understating that there is substantial public anger and alleviating that public anger not with mumbo jumbo but with reality is essential if we 're going to have the support in the country to take the right steps , " Mr Frank said .
Public anger boiled over last month when it was revealed that the total amount of bonuses paid out to staff for 2008 was $ 18.4bn – a figure that prompted President Barack Obama to describe the pay - outs as " shameful " while banks were being propped up by taxpayer money , and led him to impose a pay cap of $ 500,000 on executives of banks that need more emergency cash .
" It is abundantly clear that we are here amidst broad public anger at our industry , " Lloyd Blankfein , the head of Goldman Sachs , said .

The chief executives before Congress included Vikram Pandit , the head of Citigroup , which received government guarantees of more than $ 300bn after coming close to collapse in December .
Mr Pandit made $ 216 m when Citigroup bought his hedge fund business to lure him to a top job at the company and paid him bonuses to sign on as chief executive in 2007 .
Yesterday , he took the lead in promising that Wall Street understands the new realities of life with the government as a significant investor .
" I 've told my board of directors that my salary should be $ 1 per year with no bonus until we return to profitability , " he said .
" We will hold ourselves accountable and that starts with me , " he said .
Outside the House of Representatives office building where the hearing took place , about a dozen protesters taunted Bank of America 's Ken Lewis .
" Hey , Ken Lewis , feel our pain , " they chanted .
" I feel more like corporal of the universe , not captain of the universe at this moment , " Mr Lewis said inside , after coming under intense questioning from the California Democrat Maxine Waters .
Lawmakers ' opening statements reflected public outrage over the economic crisis , but the questioning stayed mostly civil , in contrast to a grilling last week by many of the same lawmakers of securities regulators over Bernard Madoff 's alleged fraud .
The intensity was dialled up as the hearing went into the afternoon , however .
A Massachusetts congressman said that he wondered why the bank bosses had n't been prosecuted .
" I have some constituents who have robbed your banks , and they say the same thing , they say they are sorry , they did n't mean it , they wo n't do it again if you 'll only let me out . "
One by one the executives said that they did not take a bonus for 2008 and would not be having a salary increase this year .
Between them , the eight took home around $ 400 m in 2007 , the last year for which figures have been published .
All the talk about bonuses triggered Mr Frank 's ire , prompting him to demand why they needed bonuses at all when a good salary would do .
" At your level , why do you need bonuses ? " he demanded .
" This notion that you need some special incentive to do the right thing troubles people . "
" It 's complicated , " Mr Mack replied , citing the risks involved , the global nature of the banking business and the size of the companies .
" If you gave me no bonus for the best year , I 'd still be here . "
South Carolina Republican Gresham Barrett said : " My folks simply have not seen the evidence that the money you were given is working or making their lives better . "
But the executives insisted that money from the Wall Street bailout fund – known as the troubled asset relief programme , or Tarp – is being lent out into the real economy .
" Make no mistake :
We are still lending , and we are lending far more because of the Tarp , " Mr Lewis said .
" The American people are right to expect that we use Tarp funds responsibly , quickly and transparently , " Mr Pandit said .
In the dock :
The bank bosses facing the music
Vikram Pandit
Vikram Pandit replaced Charles Prince , who left Citigroup in November 2007 .
The bank 's shares have fallen by 79 per cent since 13 October and Citigroup , which required an emergency bailout in November after market panic on its prospects , has so far received around $ 45 bn from the US Treasury .
Pandit is foregoing his bonus for 2008 , but will still earn more than $ 400,000 .
Jamie Dimon
Jamie Dimon , chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan , joined the bank in 2004 when it bought rival Bank One , which he led .
He was paid $ 1 m a year in both 2006 and 2007 and turned down his bonus for 2008 .
JP Morgan has accepted about $ 25bn of US government bailout money , though it has emerged from the crisis stronger than some rivals , having absorbed the failed Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual last year .
Kenneth Lewis
Kenneth Lewis , Bank of America 's CEO , was hailed for his acquisition of Merrill Lynch last year , but may have been better off doing more due diligence .
Bank of America shares have fallen 76 per cent since mid-October , to a large extent on the back of write - downs related to Merrill .
Bank of America has so far received $ 45bn in bailout assistance from the US Treasury .
Lewis earned $ 24.8 m incompensation in 2007 .
Lloyd Blankfein
Lloyd Blankfein succeeded former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson as CEO of Goldman Sachs in 2006 .
Goldman
Sachs shares have fallen 19 per cent since October 13 and the bank has so far received $ 10bn from the US Treasury .
Blankfein earned a record $ 70 m in compensation in 2007 , though he and other top Goldman executives were among the first on Wall Street todecline bonuses for 2008 .
John Mack
John Mackbecame CEO of the New York - based investment bank Morgan Stanley in 2005 .
He then presided over the expansion of trading and privateinvesting .
Mack has kept the bank on its feet by securing $ 9bn from Japan 's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial .
Morgan Stanley has also received $ 10 bn from the US Treasury .
Mack has given up bonuses for the past two years but earned $ 1.6 m in 2007 .
Robert Kelly
Bank of New York boss Robert Kelly was CEO of Mellon Financial Corporation from February 2006 until its merger with BoNY in 2007 .
Bank of New York shares have fallen about 15 per cent since mid-October , making it one of the better - performing US banks in the period .
Even so , Bank of New York has received $ 3bn from the US Treasury .
Kelly earned $ 20.1 m in total compensation in 2007 .
John Stumpf
John Stumpf became CEO of the historic US bank Wells Fargo in June 2007 , just as the credit crunchbegan .
In 2000 , he oversaw Wells Fargo ' sacquisition of First Security Corp , and last year spearheaded its acquisition of Wachovia .
Wells Fargo shares have fallen 46 per cent since mid-October , as the bank has received $ 25 bn from Treasury .
Mr Stumpf earned $ 22.9 m in total compensation in 2007 .

There is a term for people who are the first ones on their block to try the latest electronic gadget , be it a DVD player , a BlackBerry , or an iPhone .
They ’re called early adopters .
But a new crop of early adopters have taken this concept into a completely different area of life .
Across North America , thousands of people have gotten wired up with electrodes in order to get their brains scanned — voluntarily — in an effort to train them .
Some , including singer Wynonna Judd , have relied on brain training to deal with addictions .
Others claim it helped address sleep and eating disorders .
Prison inmates have used this technique to overcome depression and enhance their well - being .
War veterans get wired up to cope with posttraumatic stress disorder .
It ’s called Brain State Conditioning , and it could be coming to a pharmacy near you .
Brody Rokstad , a UBC student , has undergone nine treatments at Finlandia Health Technologies , which is a Vancouver licensee of Brain State Conditioning .
In a phone interview with the Georgia Straight , Rokstad said he learned about this approach from Jeannette Barrett , a self - regulation therapist who has helped him deal with anxiety , depression , digestive problems , and loneliness .
Rokstad traces his problems to trauma he suffered in the womb when his mother learned of a death in the family .
He believes that this caused his parasympathetic nervous system — which is in the brain stem and lower spinal cord — to seize up as a survival mechanism .
This , Rokstad suggested , caused lifelong difficulties that ca n’t be addressed through counselling .
“ Language and logic are immaterial to this section of the brain , ” he said .
Rokstad claimed that his brain training has helped balance his brain and alleviate many of his earlier problems .
“ This has been nothing short of an absolutely transformative experience , ” he said .
During brain training , a person is hooked up to an electroencephalograph , which tracks waves in various parts of the brain .
A computer program converts these waves into audible sounds , which are fed back to the person as they go through various stages of thought and relaxation .
According to the Finlandia Brain State Conditioning brochure , “ Ultimately , personalized exercises are developed to optimize the brain , increasing balance and harmony . ”
The theory is that the brain readjusts itself when it becomes aware of how established neural patterns — previously necessary for survival — limit a person ’s effectiveness .
The creator of Brain State Conditioning , Lee Gerdes , says our brains can heal .
Lee Gerdes , CEO of the Arizona - based Brain State Technologies , recently published a book entitled Limitless You : The Infinite Possibilities of a Balanced Brain ( Namaste Publishing , $ 27.95 ) , in which he describes how this technology can train the brain by bringing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems into harmony .
The sympathetic system relies on adrenaline and noradrenaline , increasing the heart rate and blood pressure and triggering the release of the stress hormone cortisol and blood flow to muscles .
The parasympathetic system functions in the opposite way .
In the book , Gerdes , a self - described computer geek , likens brain training to a woman looking in the mirror to apply lipstick or a man using a mirror to avoid cutting himself while shaving .
“ Brain training functions as a mirror that enables us to balance our brain , ” Gerdes writes .
He believes that many of society ’s most serious problems — including various addictions , posttraumatic stress disorder , and even pedophilia — are often rooted in the brain being out of balance .
Undesirable behaviour driven by unconscious motivations can be the brain ’s way of self - correcting for this imbalance , he claims .
Gerdes maintains that with the right tools , the brain can heal itself .
“ It ’s not brain surgery in terms of its invasiveness , and it ’s not brain surgery in terms of its complexity , ” he quipped in a phone interview with the Straight from Scottsdale , Arizona .
Juliette Sinclair , a Finlandia technician who delivers Brain State Conditioning in a quiet office on Vancouver ’s West Side , told the Straight in an interview that she was skeptical when she first heard about the technology .
But she maintained that after undergoing several sessions herself , she has experienced significant changes .
The mother of four young children , Sinclair said she never felt she ’d had enough sleep .
She said that brain training appears to have given her more energy and eliminated those feelings .
As well , she is a nervous passenger in vehicles , and used to feel tense any time she rode the bus over the Ironworkers Bridge .
She now addresses this by meditating .
“ Now , I ’m not bothered by it at all , ” Sinclair commented .
“ I do n’t have that sinking feeling . ”
Gerdes writes that he developed the technology using himself as a guinea pig after suffering a vicious beating in San Francisco by teenagers , including one wielding a baseball bat .
He claims to have suffered the effects of this trauma for a decade before deciding to use his computer expertise and his knowledge of cognitive psychology to address the symptoms using brain - training techniques .
He discovered that it worked .
Gerdes , who studied psychology while obtaining a master ’s degree in divinity , also took the technology into the Nevada prison system .
He tried it out on six inmates with the permission of the warden and the state ’s director of corrections .
According to a report on his company ’s Web site , almost all of the inmates were gang members with a high probability of engaging in disruptive behaviour .
After the sessions , five demonstrated significant progress in achieving their stated goals .
These included managing anger , increasing attention and focus , boosting happiness and well - being , overcoming depression , increasing motivation , and improving social interactions .
One inmate remained the same in terms of anger management and sense of calm , but improved in three other areas .
“ These men were all chosen by the correctional division and they were all what you would call ” ˜bad boys ’ , ” Gerdes said .
“ None of the six have had any acts of violence in a year and a half . ”
He readily admitted that his techniques have not been subjected to independent peer review .
He said he has n’t done this because he does n’t want to give away proprietary information , which could be snapped up by competitors .
“ I ’ve been in the software biz for quite a while , and I know how fast it ’s stolen , ” Gerdes said .
Brain State Conditioning is based on the concept of neuroplasticity , which suggests that the brain continues to evolve throughout a person ’s lifetime .
In his 2008 self - published book Your Healthy Brain : A Personal & Family Guide to Staying Healthy & Living Longer , Bowen Island geriatric psychiatrist Stephen Kiraly defines neuroplasticity as the ability of brain cells to sprout and branch .
This allows the cells to make new connections , establish new functions , and take over the functions of cells that are no longer active .
“ When you exercise a muscle it gets bigger and stronger — brain regions respond the same way to increased stimulation , ” Kiraly writes .
Gerdes said he disagrees with the “ allopathic view ” that brain chemistry dictates brain function .
He claimed that by changing the brain ’s functioning , it ’s possible to change the brain ’s chemistry .
“ We do know that harmonizing the brain brings it to an optimum pattern , but I do n’t have any concept about what that will mean in specific pathologies , ” Gerdes said .
“ I only know that the person — when they ’re optimized — will have more well - being in all aspects of their lives . ”
He suggested that brain training could counteract pedophilia .
He claimed that with an EEG , he can show that pedophiles have brain patterns unlike those of the rest of the people who ’ve used his technology .
“ It was only when I started looking at brain patterns years later that I realized a person does n’t become a pedophile because they lack values , but because they have a brain imbalance , ” Gerdes writes in his book .
“ When I saw with my own eyes the tormented state of the pedophile ’s brain , and realized this state had likely been inflicted upon them in their own childhood , I was brought to my knees in terms of shame for the way I had condemned such individuals . ”
He emphasized that protecting children is “ absolutely essential ” , but also insisted that pedophiles can be cured .
“ A pedophile commits an act of pedophilia because their imbalance drives them to try to balance their brain by ” ˜stepping on the gas , ’ which takes the form of seeking control , ” he writes .
“ This is a condition that brain training can address . ”
Gerdes ’s work is likely to attract a fair amount of controversy in the coming years , not only for what he says about pedophilia , but also for his comments about schizophrenia .
According to Gerdes , one of the inmates in the Nevada prison system who underwent Brain State Conditioning had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia , and showed remarkable improvement following the sessions .
Gerdes emphasized that there needs to be a lot more research before anyone would suggest that brain training can heal people of schizophrenia , which is a devastating disease .
He added that medications people take for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be “ huge hindrances to the effectiveness of the training ” .
Finlandia ’s owner , Harlan Lahti , told the Straight in a phone interview that he decided to offer Brain State Conditioning in Vancouver to give an alternative to people who do n’t want to rely on mind - altering medications .
It costs $ 2,000 for a basic program of 10 two - hour sessions .
“ I think I can safely say too many drugs affect your brain in a negative fashion , ” Lahti said .
“ I do n’t think there is anybody who would say that ’s an incorrect statement . ”
But until Gerdes ’s technology undergoes peer review , the public will have to trust its creator ’s word — as well as testimonials from Wynonna Judd and others — that brain training is an effective alternative to medication .
Another flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance
— Kurt Vonnegut
Last week we took a look at new oil production outside of OPEC .
I found that phased start - ups are not being postponed despite a deteriorating economic situation that has resulted in low prices , large OPEC cuts and an oil glut on the world market .
I concluded that this strategy is shortsighted and self - defeating , especially if the global recession is deeper and longer than the Fed and the Treasury Department anticipate .
I view a destructive period of deflation as likely .
New oil was the term P N for conventional oil in equation 1 below .
S(t ) = P E ( t ) ( 1 - D I ) + P N ( t ) + P SC ( t )
where S = available supply over the time interval t ( a year ) , P E = the existing production base , P N = new production , P SC = spare capacity and D I = the net decline rate
In a significant update to last week 's column , secretary general Abdalla el - Badri announced OPEC project delays without being specific about what they were .
El - Badri is still hoping the large non-OPEC exporters will cut production to help boost the shaky oil price .
" We urge Norway , Russia and Mexico to give a hand , because the situation is very difficult and we cannot handle it by ourselves , " he said ...
El - Badri expressed concern about the impact of the lower prices on the oil investment plans of OPEC producing countries , disclosing that 35 of 150 planned upstream projects had been postponed beyond 2013 .
He said OPEC plans had called for 5 million b/d of new crude output capacity to be added by 2012 , but that the timing of this capacity addition would now be " stretched " because of the precipitous fall in oil prices over the past few months .
" ( We are ) postponing 35 projects to after 2013 from our 150 planned , " he said .
" Of our firm projects to 2012 , some will be delayed , " he said .
I 'll bet that most of the delayed projects are maintenance upgrades , not new oil field developments , as I discuss below .
Today I examine threats to new unconventional oil production and the effects on declines in the existing production base ( i.e. the term P E ( t ) ( 1 - D I ) ) .
Trouble at the Tar Sands
The first domino to fall when the global economy went south was tar sands unconventional oil production .
Suncor , Petro - Canada and other major players have scaled investment way back .
A Merrill Lynch analysis indicates that new tar sands oil is competitive at $ 80 / barrel .
Existing oil production is said to lose money at $ 32 , so operators are getting close to the edge should prices fall $ 4 / barrel below today 's price .
The Canadian Energy Research Institute ( CERI ) has just issued a report which estimates $ 70 ( US ) as the price at which new tar sands oil becomes viable .
Figure 1 shows CERI 's production scenarios based on future economic conditions .
The National Post ( February 5 , 2009 ) summarized the hit on investment detailed in the CERI report .
The global credit crunch and collapse of oil prices have cancelled the Alberta oil sands boom , resulting in a loss in investment of $ 97 - billion to $ 241 - billion in the next decade that will be felt throughout the Canadian economy , the Canadian Energy Research Institute said in a report Thursday .
While the Alberta deposits will still attract $ 218 - billion in spending to develop new oil production in the next 11 years , the pace of development will be much slower than was expected only three months ago , the independent research firm said .
Figure 1 — CERI production scenarios under various economic projections .
The probable production range is shown in gray .
The green line is the worst case .
I concluded that production growth at the tar sands was slowing down long before the current economic crisis ( Energy Bulletin , January 2 , 2008 ) .
The reference case ( red line in Figure 1 ) is very improbable , especially the fast growth out to 2016 .
The " unconstrained " case ( blue line ) resides in the realm of pure fantasy .
It is easy to see that in the worst economic case , which I consider likely , lost production will be in the range of 1 million barrels - per-day by 2015 .
This large number speaks for itself .
Perhaps there 's an upside to this supply - side disaster .
If climate is our chief concern , and problems with the oil supply can be postponed for a decade or longer , as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Energy Secretary Steven Chu seem to believe , the loss of tar sands oil could be viewed as a blessing , not a curse .
In fact , why not take the initiative ?
Why does n't the U.S. simply prohibit imports of dirty carbon - intensive tar sands oil altogether ?
Canada could do its part by phasing out oil sands production , which would enable them to meet their carbon emissions limits under the Kyoto Protocol .
If Chu and Salazar are right , and I am wrong to characterize the probable loss of 1 million barrels - per-day as a disaster , it looks like a win-win !
Unfortunately an unblinkered view of the loss tells a different story .
Canada is the largest exporter of oil to the United States .
Our future refining plans depend on a continuing and growing supply of tar sands oil .
Losing that much production will cause major economic headaches in the U.S. unless we prepare for it in advance .
Peak oil and climate change agendas do not always coincide .
If the world were swimming in conventional oil as it seemed during the Golden Age in the decades just after World War II , we would not need synthetic crude from the tar sands .
Lack of Investment and Decline Rates
A substantial part of oil company upstream investment goes toward field upgrades and maintenance .
This spending is necessary to maintain output or slow declines at post - peak oil fields .
Such fields are studied in the IEA 's World Energy Outlook 2008 .
Post - peak fields make up a hefty slice of world oil production .
Based on an analysis of the IHS database , the IEA 's report describes just how large this slice is —
Of a total of 798 producing fields in our field - by - field database , we prepared a dataset of 651 fields with initial reserves of at least 50 million barrels in order to carry out our analysis of decline rates .
Of this set , 580 fields were found to have passed peak production .
In other words , for each of these fields , production over the latest year of production is below the maximum level ever achieved in any one year .
These fields produced a total of 40.5 million b/d ( barrels - per- day ) in 2007 , or 58 % of the world crude oil production .
Based on raw production data , the IEA figured the decline rate at 5.1 % per year .
Generalizing their result by including fields with less than 50 million barrels in initial recoverable reserves , the IEA estimated the overall decline rate in all post - peak fields to be 6.7 % — smaller fields decline faster .
If no investment were put into maintaining and upgrading these fields , the IEA estimated that the " natural " decline rate is 9 % .
Thus for all post - peak oil fields , the term D I in P E ( t ) ( 1 - D I ) from equation ( 1 ) lies somewhere between 6.7 % and 9 % depending on the level of investment .
I prepared an abstract scenario ( Figure 2 ) to give you an idea of how investment levels might affect overall declines in post - peak fields .
Figure 2 — An investment scenario for post - peak fields .
The initial period of 6.7 % decline is replaced by a middle period of 8 % decline based on lack of investment in an economic downturn ( red line ) .
An economic upturn lifts demand and prices , and thus reinvigorates investment .
Declines are maintained at 6.7 % once again .
Notice first that the effects of the exponential decrease overwhelm the relatively small impact of an investment shortfall that raises the decline rate closer to the " natural " rate .
Lost production due to lack of investment ( the difference between the blue and red lines ) amounts to only 2.77 % of the total production over time .
Nevertheless , if the decline rate were allowed to rise to 8 % for an extended period as shown in Figure 2 , the loss over the entire period ( not the difference at the end ) would come to 1.12 million barrels per day ( 2.77 % of the IEA 's 40.5 million b/d ) .
Although this shortfall would be spread across several years in the scenario , it is not a trivial amount of lost production given that the annual production lost from post - peak fields alone is 2.71 million barrels - per-day ( 40.5 million * .067 ) after full investment .
The additional production shortfall from lack of maintenance must also be replaced by new oil each year .
Every drop counts .
There is a lot of evidence that maintenance and upgrades are suffering during the current downturn .
Oil service companies are getting hit hard .
Schlumberger forecasts hard times ahead in the Houston Chronicle ( January , 23 , 2009 ) —
Schlumberger delivered still more bad news Friday about the weakening state of the global oil and gas industry , reporting lower fourth quarter profits , additional layoffs and a glum forecast for the rest of 2009 ...
Earlier this month , Schlumberger said it would cut up to 1,000 of its 19,000 North American employees , including up to 100 of its 5,000 jobs in the Houston area .
But for the first time Friday , the company said it will cut 5,000 jobs worldwide , or almost 6 percent of its 84,000 - strong work force ...
Schlumberger also offered a downcast view of the coming year .
“ We expect 2009 activity to weaken across the board with the most significant declines occurring in North American gas drilling , Russian oil production enhancement and in mature offshore basins , ” [ CEO Andrew ]
Gou [d said in a statement .
With oil and gas prices so low , many emerging resource plays , like heavy oil projects in Canada , also will not be economic , he said .
[ emphasis added ]
Gould 's remarks about Russia should give us pause .
Last year 's production fell 0.7 % compared to 2007 and January came in 0.9 % below the same month last year .
I 've got a bad feeling about this .
As for mature offshore basins , Shell has announced some delays .
The company postponed investment decisions on upgrading its deepwater Mars platform in the Gulf of Mexico and developing the Pierce field in the U.K. ’s North Sea as it waits for industry costs to decline .
Rig counts are also down .
The latest Baker Hughes data indicates that —
The number of rotary rigs drilling for oil is down 26 at 283 .
The number of rigs targeting oil is 41 less than last year 's level of activity .
Rigs currently drilling for oil represent 21.0 % percent of total drilling activity .
[ Note - the large majority of rigs in service are drilling for natural gas , not oil ]
We are closer to the beginning of the severe recession than we are to its end .
Inactivity at oil services companies or falling rig counts should be regarded as preliminary indicators , not the end of the story .
The scenario shown in Figure 2 clearly shows that money put toward maintenance of post - peak fields would be far better spent on new oil projects if investment is constrained by deteriorating economic conditions and low oil prices , especially for the larger oil companies ( IOCs or NOCs ) .
Therefore it is far more profitable for TNK - BP to put the Verkhnechonsk field in Eastern Siberia on - stream than it is for them to maintain output in their aging Western Siberian fields .
Unfortunately this new oil may help drive down prices and maintenance will suffer at the same time as investment diminishes .

Do you ever get the feeling you 're being watched ?
Walking down the street , do you sense that someone somewhere is keeping an eye on you ?
These days , chances are , you 're right .
A growing number of cities across the United States and abroad have installed networks of closed - circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras .
Police monitor the video in an effort to prevent crime and catch lawbreakers in the act .
You 've probably seen the cameras ; they 're intentionally made conspicuous .
Signs let you know your actions are being recorded .

This law enforcement trend started in the United Kingdom in 1986 with three cameras in a 1 - square - mile area in a town called King 's Lynn [ source : Nieto ] .
Today , England has more CCTV cameras than any country in the world , with half a million making up its network , nicknamed the " Ring of Steel " [ source : Nieto ] .
Many U.S. cities , including New York , Philadelphia and Chicago , followed suit and began installing the police surveillance cameras in the early 1990s .
Even the Jewish Holy Land in Jerusalem is wired with CCTV systems [ source : National Institute of Justice ] .
These systems transmit live signals to television monitors at police stations .
The cameras are similar to the ones commonly found in convenience stores and banks , which police and security departments have used for decades to solve crimes .
CCTV systems sales jumped by almost 700 percent from 1980 to 2000 [ source : National Institute of Justice ] .
As you can imagine , crime cameras do n't come cheap .
In fact , Great Britain 's Ring of Steel cost more than $ 330 million from 1999 to 2001 [ source : Welsh and Farrington ] .
­ With all the money being pumped into these mechanized eyes , you might wonder how well they curb crime .
That depends on who you ask .
Law enforcement officials generally support them , citing significant drops in violent crime .
On the other hand , comprehensive studies by the American and British governments have shown otherwise .
Why do these reports of effectiveness vary so much , and who 's right ?
Read on to find out the answers , along with why some Americans feel the cameras violate the Constitution .
Junichi Sato ’s face clenched when he recalled opening the reeking box of whale meat -- all 50 pounds of it .
“ At first we thought it was someone ’s dismembered body , ” Sato said .
“ It was quite depressing . ”
He and fellow Greenpeace activist Toru Suzuki had tracked the package to a mail depot in northern Japan after tipsters told them it contained whale meat bound for the country ’s black market , smuggled by crew members of a ship commissioned to kill the mammals for scientific research , not profit .
But when they held a cameras - flashing news conference last spring to turn the meat over to police , the officers instead arrested the activists for trespass and theft .
Advertisement
That put them at the center of a bitter face - off between environmentalists and the Japanese government , which many believe wants to severely punish the pair as a warning to citizens who question the country ’s controversial whaling policy .
Japanese officials say the men -- dubbed the Tokyo Two -- are eco-terrorists who stole the meat from a legitimate transporter to falsely malign the nation ’s whaling establishment .
The pair faced a pretrial hearing in their case this week ; they could receive up to 10 years in jail if convicted .
“ These men have been painted as heroes , ” said Joji Morishita , consulate for the Japanese government ’s powerful Fisheries Agency , which sponsors the whale hunts .
“ They ’re not heroes . ”
The case has shifted the front lines of the war over Japan ’s whaling program from the frigid waters off Antarctica , where 100 whales are culled by Japan each winter , to the streets of Tokyo and the court of public opinion .
Advertisement
It also is a rare occurrence of Japanese taking the lead in protesting their government ’s environmental policies .
In a culture where demonstrations are rare and a premium is put on polite public discourse , Sato and Suzuki ’s actions have raised eyebrows .
“ Usually it ’s Australians , Americans or British taking action , not the Japanese themselves , ” said Keiko Hirata , a political scientist at Cal State Northridge who specializes in Japanese foreign policy .
Along with putting Japan ’s whaling practices on trial , experts say , the case calls into question the tactics of activist groups such as Greenpeace , which are often viewed here as meddling outsiders .
Although commercial whaling was banned in 1986 , Japan is permitted to kill the animals for “ lethal research ” on their migratory and other habits in anticipation of a return to sustainable commercial hunts .
Norway and Iceland also cull a limited number of whales each year .

Environmentalists routinely harass Japanese whaling boats during the hunt for the nation ’s disputed annual harvest of 935 minke and 50 fin whales .
The group Sea Shepherd has been accused of tactics such as firing acid , mud , nails and water cannons at the vessels .
After the arrest of the two activists , Greenpeace supporters sent 250,000 letters to Japanese prosecutors and a delegation handed a letter of protest to the office of Prime Minister Taro Aso .
“ This has become a very political case , ” Suzuki said .
“ The government wants to destroy Greenpeace . ”
Morishita responded icily to Greenpeace assertions that the men have not been treated fairly .
“ If they do n’t trust our police , ” he said , “ there is no basis for further discussion . ”
Advertisement
Japan has hunted whales for centuries , and officials say the culls are a part of the national identity .
But consumption of the meat , once a staple of the country ’s diet , is now restricted to a few upscale restaurants and coastal whaling villages .
The whaling issue has strained relations between Japan and allies such as New Zealand and Australia , which have publicly expressed displeasure with the annual hunt .
Britain has hinted that it might take the matter to the United Nations .
Japanese officials say they are the target of emotional propaganda .
“ Critics say the whale is a special animal to be protected .
We ’d like to treat it exactly like any other wildlife hunted worldwide , such as deer or kangaroos , ” Morishita said .
Advertisement
“ What would the Americans say if India suddenly said they should stop eating beef because the cow is special to their culture ? ” he asked .
“ That is what is happening to us . ”
Polls show that 56 % of Japanese approve of eating whale meat .
More men than women support the practice , which is also more strongly backed by people older than 40 .
“ Much of this support is n’t because people are pro-whaling or are willing to eat whale meat , ” said Atsushi Ishii , a professor at Japan ’s Tohoku University who specializes in the nation ’s environmental policies .
“ People are against the anti-whalers .
They do n’t like being told what to do by the outside groups . ”
Sato , a 32 - year - old former English teacher , said he was unaware of the international protest against Japan ’s whaling until he joined Greenpeace a few years ago .
Advertisement
“ The more I read about the issue , the more I realized that what the Japanese government is telling the public is a lie , ” he said .
“ I wanted to make this a Japanese issue . ”
He said activists received a tip last year that a package labeled as having “ cardboard ” contents would contain illegal whale meat .
They intercepted the box and later opened it at a nearby hotel , shocked at what they found inside .
But they were more stunned by the backlash against their actions in the Japanese news media .
Apparently tipped off by authorities , TV cameras accompanied police who arrested the men and searched Greenpeace offices .
“ We expected the media to support us , ” said Suzuki , 42 , who once owned a motorcycle repair firm .
“ But they turned against us . ”
Advertisement
Both men were held for the maximum 23 days without being charged , and said they were interrogated for as long as 12 hours a day while handcuffed and tied to chairs .
Suzuki refused to speak for 13 days and waged a weeklong hunger strike , maintaining that he was a political prisoner .
Lawyers say the men ’s rights were violated .
“ They took a stand against Japan ’s national policy , ” defense attorney Yuichi Kaido said .
“ So they are being harshly punished . ”
Since their release , the men have been banned from talking to each other or other Greenpeace activists .
They cannot leave home for extended periods or travel abroad and can only speak with journalists separately , in the offices of their lawyers .
Advertisement
Both say they have been constantly followed by undercover police officers and received anonymous threats after their addresses were reported by the news media .
“ In Japanese society , being arrested means a lot , ” Sato said .
“ People see a guy on TV in handcuffs and assume he ’s guilty . ”
Sato , a father of one , and Suzuki , whose wife is expecting their first child , refuse to back down .
“ The government ’s killing of these whales is wrong , ” Suzuki said .
“ There is no justification for it . ”
Sato said that no matter what , they achieved their goal of bringing the alleged whale meat scandal to public light .

“ We achieved that , ” he said .
Then he added softly : “ Perhaps we overachieved . ”

San Diego ’s Stem Cell Startup Reports Hair - Regrowth Results
Xconomy San Diego —
San Diego - based Histogen CEO
Gail Naughton is presenting encouraging preliminary results today at a stem cell conference from the startup ’s first human trial of its hair regrowth treatment , ReGenica .
The company says it is in the midst of conducting a five - month clinical trial somewhere outside the United States to assess the safety of ReGenica .
After 12 weeks , the company says , patients using the treatment show increased , thicker hair growth , with no adverse reactions .
ReGenica is an injectable liquid product made by culturing cells from newborns and collecting growth factors , so - called wnt proteins , and other molecules that the cells secrete .
In mice , wnt proteins are involved in triggering stem cells in the skin to form hair , according to Histogen ’s press release .
About 25 subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 trial .
They are all men , from 18 to 45 years old , with varying stages of male - pattern baldness .
Naughton is reporting the results at the 4th Annual Stem Cell Summit in New York .
Histogen says its goal in conducting the study outside the country is to obtain human safety data for the under - the - scalp injections more rapidly , and thereby speed development of the product .
Naughton told me in November her early focus is developing products for cosmetics , dermatology , and plastic surgery industries to generate revenue needed to support long - term development of living tissue skin grafts and other products .

Leave it to the Japanese to freeze a pair of testicles from a famous Gifu bull known for his delicious buttery marbled - textured meat , extract living cells 13 years later , and have the beast mooing again .

In fact , three of them , mooing , destroying the ozone layer with their gases , and ready to go into the grill .
Actually , the last part would be impossible , as Japanese law expressly prohibits cloned animals to get into the food chain again .
Yasufuku - go , the name of the prized bull , had his testicles frozen 13 years ago .
The team of researches and the Kinki University in Osaka were able to extract living cells from frozen meat , which according to project leader Teruhiko Wakayama " means we can clone cows using frozen beef sold at supermarkets . "

Yes .
You can " resurrect " animals from frozen animals .

[ Mainichi via Pink Tentacle ]
In a ceremony yesterday in Washington , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Secretary of State Robert Gates , and USAID Administrator Henrietta Fore signed off on the U. S. government 's new Interagency Counterinsurgency Guide – a handbook for policymakers that is supposed to reassert the primacy of " soft power . "
Put differently : if the famous FM 3 - 24 , the Army / Marine Corps counterinsurgency manual , was supposed to turn the military on to irregular warfare , now it's the diplomats ' ( and USAID's , and everyone else 's ) turn .
This is significant for a number of reasons .
Number one , the guide is being signed at the highest level , lending weight to a document that is supposed to distil the principles of counterinsurgency doctrine , as well as the lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan .
And the guide was complete in time for the new administration – which , by the looks of it , will be seeded with counterinsurgency advocates like Michele Flournoy , recently tapped as the Pentagon 's policy chief .
Counterinsurgency – at least according to theories that are back in vogue – is primarily a political strategy , not a military effort .
This manual is part of a belated effort to get the rest of government involved ( instead of the uniformed military , which has been doing all the heavy lifting ) .
Australian counterinsurgency guru David Kilcullen was a driving force behind this new document .
FM 3 - 24 often reads more like a guide to 20th century Maoist - style insurgencies ; Kilcullen led a series of drafting sessions to produce a document that took a more contemporary view of the problem .
Not everyone , of course , is a true believer when it comes to counterinsurgency .
Col. Gian Gentile , for one , thinks the military is in the grip of a new orthodoxy .
In an excellent web - only story for Foreign Policy , he argues :
This narrow approach – known in the current military vernacular as clear , hold , and build – dominates the Army so much that it permeates the service 's professional journals .
Now , whenever a problem of instability or insurgency presents itself , it 's the only approach that seems to be considered , yet different situations might call for different methods .
In this sense , the Army has become dogmatic .
Now that the " whole - of - government " counterinsurgency doctrine is done and dusted , it will be interesting to see how this debate continues .

Be careful about spreading gossip because it could hurt your career .
Do you know what TMI is ?
Chances are you 're either guilty of it or have been its victim .
It stands for " too much information " and it 's making daily life awkward for people across the country .
Just think back to a recent uncomfortable conversation you had with someone -- a friend , family member or total stranger .
Things were going well until the other person just laid it all out there : an unnecessary peek into his or her financial situation , sex life or health problems .
No matter what you do , your view of an oversharer is forever changed .
If you have n't suffered through one of these conversations , your time will come ... or you are a walking diary .
Painful chitchat on a train is one thing , but workplace TMI is its own monster .
At work , oversharing can damage your reputation , make your co-workers avoid you in the hallway and even damage your career .
Here are 13 things you should n't share while on the clock :
1. Medical history : Hospitals and human resources departments are prohibited by law from giving out your medical information for a reason .
People have a tendency to adjust their behavior when they find out you have , or had , a medical condition .
They might treat you like a sick child or make you an outcast .
2. Confidential work information :
Hey , did you hear who 's getting fired ?
You -- because you could n't keep private information to yourself .
3 . Plans to quit :
When you 're hunting for a new job , do n't let co-workers know .
Loose lips or devious motives can mean your secret search finds its way to the boss .
Possible outcomes : you 're let go before you 're ready or you 're quietly pushed out , which is what happened to Ron Doyle .
He mentioned to some co-workers that he and his wife were deciding if one of them needed to quit .
Doyle was just thinking aloud and had no intention of turning in his resignation letter quite yet .
" Within 48 hours , I noticed the meetings through the office window -- every administrator present except one -- me , " he says .
" Communication on critical issues came to a halt and the separation was palpable . "
When he eventually quit , everyone was surprised .
He explained how ostracized he felt , but they insisted that they had no idea they were acting that way toward him .
" Never tell them you might leave -- subconsciously or otherwise , they 'll act as if you already have . "
4 . Online venting sites :
If you use your social networking profile or a blog to release frustration about your personal and work life , do n't send your co-workers a link .
You 'll have to clean up your digital dirt ( even more than it already should be ) and censor yourself from now on .
5 . Matters of the heart : Soap operas are fun to watch on TV , but they 're not fun to live .
Your reputation will suffer if you come into the office in tears one day because you broke up with your significant other and then you dance down the hall the next week because you met the love of your life .
Your love life is n't as interesting to anyone else as it is to you , and people may be unable to separate your romantic life from your professional one .
6. Politics :
You 've seen how out of hand political discussions can get with your family at the dinner table .
Do you really want to start that kind of drama at work ?
Keep in mind that while your family is obligated to love you no matter what , co-workers are not .
7. Salary information : Money 's a weird topic in our culture .
As eager as we are to find out what other people make , we 're not as ready to divulge our earnings .
Salary is associated with worth , and when your salary 's known , it invites speculation of whether you 're being over - or undercompensated .
Why are you getting paid that much when another person with the same qualification earns much less ?
Vicky Oliver , author of " Bad Bosses , Crazy Co-Workers and Other Office Idiots , " also cautions that your accomplishments can be downplayed if this information is public .
" You do n't want your co-workers to snivel about how you ' do n't need the money ' every time your boss wants to give you a bonus . "
Avoid the drama and gossip and keep your salary to yourself .
8. Religion : See politics .
9 . Your privileged life :
Along the same lines of keeping salary information to yourself , your enviable pull with society 's high rollers should also stay private .
Although you have the good fortune to know powerful business leaders and social butterflies , bragging about how many doors they 've opened for you will tarnish your image .
" Do n't rub your privilege in other people 's faces , " Oliver warns .
" People should be rewarded on the basis of merit . "
Bragging about how you got into an Ivy League school or even in your current position will put doubt about your qualifications .
10 .
Therapy sessions : Keep your visits with a therapist a private matter .
Petty co-workers can start rumors about you or make snide remarks behind your back .
No need to put yourself in that situation .
11 . The Rubik's Cube that is your personal life : When Marci Diehl worked as a recruiter , she encountered a job seeker who came in to register with the staffing agency -- and she still remembers her over a decade later .
The woman came in and explained that her boyfriend was waiting outside with her child because she did n't have a car and that speed was of the essence .
Also , her son was not the boyfriend 's child .
" Somehow in this tale about the boyfriend , she told us that the boyfriend was not a happy camper , because her 6 year old slept with them every night -- and they 'd only been going together for a few weeks , " Diehl remembers .
Naturally , the agency had a difficult time placing her because she was a risky employee who did n't know when to keep her thoughts to herself .
12 . Gossip :
One of the big reasons you want to keep important information to yourself is to avoid the gossip it can spur .
Well , do n't play the gossip game either .
Spreading rumors or secrets that you 'd want kept secret is n't going to help your career .
13 . Your Chris Rock routine :
In an episode of " The Office , " Michael Scott gets in trouble for repeating , verbatim , a Chris Rock stand - up routine full of racially charged jokes and cuss words .
Comedians get paid to be edgy , daring and even offensive .
You get fired for it .

Moneyed Chinese come house hunting

Cash - rich Chinese coming to do some house hunting
Call it a bailout from the East .
Approximately 40 Chinese real estate investors are winging their way from Beijing today looking to snap up foreclosed and otherwise " distressed " properties in the Bay Area and California .
The trip , put together by Beijing real estate portal SouFun Holdings Ltd. and Fortune Group Realty Co. in Pittsburgh , is one of several such Chinese house hunting groups to visit the U.S. periodically .
But the timing of this one appears to be particularly fortuitous , on both sides of the Pacific .
" It 's good for Chinese investors who see lots of opportunities , " said Fortune Group vice - president Andrew Hang Chen .
" It 's also good for the American economy , at least on a small scale . "
Homes , apartment buildings and other commercial property in the region are on the shopping list .
First stop on the 10 - day trip is Los Angeles , followed by the Bay Area , then to Las Vegas .
Apparently , the group wo n't have to worry about mortgages and such .
" They have cash , believe me , " said Chen .
Fear factor : Portfolio manager Shawn Taylor says he 's never experienced the kind of calls he 's been getting from clients lately .
" They 're asking me if they should they take their money out of banks altogether , is their principal safe , even , quite , literally , where they can buy a block of gold ? " said Taylor , who manages $ 2.2 billion in large - cap stock funds for Navellier & Associates , a Reno money management firm with an office in San Francisco .
Those calls , which Taylor described to me when he was in the Bay Area last week , may explain in part the mentality that 's driving the stock market lower and lower and gold prices higher and higher .
Taylor added that a number of calls are coming from account holders at Bank of America Corp. , the focus of nationalization talk in the past few days , along with Citigroup Inc .
Taylor also notes that customers are pulling money out of previously untapped bank credit lines , " just to park the money somewhere else . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Every little bit helps : Wells Fargo Corp. is opening a branch in San Francisco 's Rincon Hill neighborhood today , creating five San Francisco jobs in the process .
It may not do much for the overall unemployment picture , but it 's better than the alternative .
Branch address : 303 Second St .
Sauce for the goose ... :
As The Chronicle 's City Insider notes , S.F. 's Planning Commission gave thumbs up to a Whole Foods Market in Noe Valley , which the Texas company says will be ready in October .
Supervisor Bevan Duftysaid the national chain - 278 U.S. stores and counting - is desirable , in the column 's words , because " the alternative might have been no store at all . "
Funny , that 's precisely the outcome of Dufty and the Planning Commission stiff - arming American Apparel 's bid to open on Valencia Street , just 0.9 miles to the east .
No store at all , joining the five other empty , no - store shop fronts on that less than " magical " block of the Mission .
Conway 's Law is an underrated , or at least , underused design observation .
In short , it asserts that :
Any organization that designs a system ( defined broadly ) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization 's communication structure .
In other words , the interfaces between components mimic the interfaces between the component teams .
This may seem a little trivial at first , but I find it the basis for numerous significant design decisions .
Does your proposed design confound existing organisational structure ?
Interfaces between internal teams are often not taken as seriously as they ought to be .
It 's assumed that people will talk , resolve their problems and everything will work out in the end .
Even with the best will in the world , not all developers will be able to reconcile the various demands placed on them .
For example , the desire to add features for one colleague whilst maintaining compatibility for another can be harder than it sounds .
Suitable design can alleviate these tensions and allow effective communication and development .
Conway 's
Law should help keep us focused on the fact that design matters at development - time , not at runtime ( so much ) .
Do you want to be constrained by existing organisational structure ?
The flip - side of designing in a way that appeals to your communication structure is to organise your teams , or allow them to organise themselves , so that both they and the software meet an emergent structure .
I believe it can be extremely productive to move developers into the same team when both sides of an integration task are being undertaken simultaneously .
However , this has to be kept in check with suitable review ; the emergent software design should n't become inconsistent or tightly - coupled as the organisational structure shifts to maximise short - term productivity .
Does your design suggest a fantasy organisational structure ?
Many software systems need to be able to support requirements that did n't contribute to their original design .
This does n't necessarily suggest modular frameworks , however .
The provision of a modular system is appropriate to organisational structures where release schedules can't be aligned , communication is best undertaken via SLAs and APIs or the extraction of a core set of features can demonstrably add value ( ie , to more than one team ) .
I 've seen , and written , numerous systems that will theoretically support all kinds of requirements through the addition of suitable modules .
Those systems would have had to have become as popular as , say , the Eclipse IDE in order to reap any rewards from this design decision ( they did n't become that popular and were n't required to ) .
While some abstractions serve to contain complexity , others may be introduced to generate needless complexity : will your organisation ever develop your system in a way that will make your design appropriate or is the set of other possibilities more likely ?
The link between design and team structure is critical to maintaining a productive development practice .
It 's particularly important at the level of the system architecture where the organisational structure is far less driven by the needs of your particular project but dependent on your design choices nonetheless .
HEALTH INSURANCE
If you get fired , your company is required , thanks to a law known as Cobra , to allow you to pay to keep your health insurance , generally for up to 18 months .
The problem is , it can cost you $ 1,000 a month or more to keep the coverage .
Now , the federal government will subsidize 65 percent of the premium for up to nine months .
To be eligible , you need to have been forced out of your job between Sept. 1 , 2008 , and Dec. 31 , 2009 .
Also , your income in the year you receive the subsidy cannot be more than $ 125,000 for individuals or $ 250,000 for married couples filing their taxes jointly .
If you lost your job after Sept. 1 , 2008 , and declined Cobra coverage , you ’ll now get another chance .
Call your former company in the next two months to find out how this will work .
You need not keep an eye on the mail for a subsidy check from the government , according Kathryn Bakich , senior vice president in Washington of the Segal Company , a benefits consulting firm .
Instead , your former employer will collect the money from the government .
SOCIAL SECURITY
In 2009 a number of retirees and disabled people , including Social Security recipients , will receive a $ 250 refundable tax credit .
The money would arrive within 120 days of the bill ’s signing .
CAR BUYER TAX DEDUCTION
For the rest of 2009 , you ’ll be able to deduct the state and local sales and excise taxes you pay on the purchase of a new ( not used ) car , light truck , recreational vehicle or motorcycle .
This will be an “ above - the - line deduction , ” according to Clint Stretch , the managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte L.L.C. in Washington .
That means that you can take it regardless of whether you itemize other deductions on your tax return .
There is so much static in my office right now that every time I walk in its a light show .
Tech question : the sound that it makes , is that related to the noise lightening makes ( the crack ) which , as I understand it , is the splitting of the air as the lightening moves though it ?
I know someone here will know .

The many colours of prejudice
by Thanos Kalamidas
Print - Comment - Send to a Friend -
More from this Author I have said it before that despite his participation in George W. Bush ’s administration , I came to believe that the former US Secretary of State Colin Powell was used in the worst possible way and made one of the most noticeable comments about his colour than any I have ever heard .
Powell did it in a forum for young people when he was asked how he feels to be the first black Secretary of State in the history of the USA , he answered that he feels proud to be the Secretary Of State who happens to be black .
In one sentence the man captured the whole meaning of anti-racism .
Since then I have used this sentence too many times for too many reasons and somehow I wish everybody could have it in mind and understand it , actually I really believe that it should be taught in every school all around the world and analyze it ; it should be a lesson for everybody .
The man with this phrase went beyond colour and semantics and most of all I wish the media , the very same media that used this phrase , had learned something about it .
I ’m really really sorry to say that they have n’t !
Over the last few days all the news agencies , all the talk shows , even all the life style programs , have shown the most racist attitude making headlines that the new Prime Minister of Iceland , Mrs. Johanna Sigurdardottir , is gay !
Nobody has asked if she can be a P.M. in a country that goes through a dramatic crisis that might lead them to a total economic catastrophe , nobody is talking about her ideas and how she ’s going to help her country survive this hit but everybody seems to care if she is gay or not !
Why ?
I ’m sorry I find it hard to understand .
Is being gay going to help her deal with the recovery of her country or is being gay the nemesis of Iceland ?
Over the last one year all of us fought all the prejudice and we all said that it is not about the colour , it is not about gender but it is about change .
And when I say all of us I especially mean the media who were pioneering this with gigantic headlines , fighting fear and ignorance and the very same media this moment point that it is not about solution , it is not about change since obviously what failed in Iceland was the conservative government and the Bush economic dogma they used but that the new P.M. is openly gay .
The financial catastrophe of the people in Iceland does n’t count as long their P.M. is gay .
Oh yes of course everybody mentions her very successful participation as a government social affairs minister but I did n’t see it making headlines and make her practices making an example to the rest of the world .
I did n’t see anywhere any headline pointing that the woman has been active in human rights fights and elected in the Iceland ’s parliament since 1978 but what I saw it is comments like “ our voters are pretty liberal ! ” and I feel like laughing hysterically .
So what is liberal ?
To my poor mind that the voters do n’t care for her personal life and sexual orientation is something that we should all do since we live in countries where the citizens have absolutely equal rights and we do respect each others ’ privacy as long it does n’t intrude our privacy and I do n’t think Mrs. Johanna Sigurdardottir sexual preferences have anything to do with anybody else except her self .
It really makes me wonder when are we going to learn and I was so optimistic after Obama ’s election that the headlines about the new Icelander P.M. came as a slap in the face .
Oddly due to all the work she has done in Iceland for the underprivileged Mrs. Johanna Sigurdardottir the locals call her Saint Johanna and her political life is full of her fight , apparently she left the Socialist Party creating her own party because she did n’t agree with the more conservative turn of the party that in the name of the power forgot the people and ignored their needs risking a fifteen years successful political career .
That ’s what they forgot ; they forgot that she made it her target to zero unemployment and give back the dignity they missed the underprivileged of the Icelandic society .
They forgot to say that Mrs. Johanna Sigurdardottir is one of the most respected and popular politicians in the history of Iceland !
So Colin Powell is very current with something he said I think five years ago and I wish just everybody would read it and understand it most of all feel the reality behind the words .

Indeed , it has always been a sign of small - minded individuals ( and even institutions at times ) that when they cannot deal with a complex issue they descend to personal idiosincracies and attacks .
Unfortunately , with some exceptions , that is the place the media is presently : it is the media of entertainment news , the news of the paparazzi , of celebrities celebrating their inanities and their nihilism , of journalism degraded to gossip column .
For shame .

Control Tower Bitching About Craigslist
There are a bunch of unhappy hookers out on Aurora Avenue , and it's all Craig Newmark 's fault .
So you 'd think , anyway , from reading news stories about Craigslist 's recent policy changes and the angry responses on sex workers ' blogs .
Craigslist now requires phone verification and a five - dollar fee , payable by credit card , to post ads in the " Erotic Services " section .
Some sex workers are loudly protesting this move , calling the fee and the loss of anonymity unfair .
I would n't call it unfair .
It 's unfortunate , certainly .
But the decision actually represents a compromise .
Forty states ' attorneys pressured Craigslist to eliminate all Erotic Services ads .
CEO Jim Buckmaster agreed some ads were " crossing the line " and agreed to curb — but not ban — such postings .
Craigslist says the fee will go to charity , and that creating a paper trail will help fight human trafficking and sexual exploitation of minors as well as help " curtail illegal activity . "
I doubt it 'll cut down much on people trafficking in children and unwilling women .
Trafficking is organized crime — you think traffickers can't get stolen phones and credit cards ?
It may discourage minors from attempting to sell sex by themselves , which is good .
But it 's mainly a token concession to the moral - outrage types and an attempt to staunch the never - ending flow of bad press about Craigslist prostitution stings .
Does it create more hoops for advertisers to jump through ?
Yes .
But the hoops are n't many nor high , so it 's no life - ruiner for most women who choose to do sex work .
However , women like Maxine Doogan , founder of the Erotic Service Providers Union , think differently .
Doogan says Craigslist provided a place where sex workers could anonymously and safely connect with clients for free .
" They always end up further pushing into poverty the class of workers who do n't have access to those tools of capitalism , " she says .
" Back to the streets — that 's what 's going to happen . "
But as far as safety goes , clients from Craigslist are no less likely to assault women than any others , and hardly a week goes by without a Craigslist advertiser getting busted .
And I 'm skeptical about the assertion — which I 've heard from several other women — that Craigslist 's new policy will drive sex workers who 've been getting clients online " back to the streets . "
It certainly does n't have to .
The Erotic Services section was a bit like Napster , pre-2001 .
The law caught up with Napster , but people still swap files online .
Sex workers can still get clients online too .
Yes , Craigslist was free , and now it wo n't be .
But it 's five dollars — not exactly exorbitant .
Do n't want to use a credit card with your legal name ?
Go elsewhere .
The Stranger takes money orders for adult ads , or you can walk in and pay cash .
Eros-Guide.com , a popular online escort directory , also takes money orders .
" But Matisse , what if a woman is so poor that she does n't have five dollars , a phone , or a credit card , and she has to post an ad right now ? "
Yes , we can construct a scenario where Craigslist is a mustache - twirling villain , evicting the helpless hooker out into the snow on Christmas Eve .
But the vast majority of sex workers are n't victims :
If sex - work activists want people to view sex work as a morally and socially neutral option , then continually suggesting that women fall into it as a last - ditch survival mechanism is counterproductive .
It 's more useful to fight poverty itself than it is to fight the policies of an organization that 's trying to strike a balance between the law and a lot of different users .
I have compassion for this hypothetical woman , but if she 's that desperate , selling sex on Craigslist is not the answer to her problems — it 's likely to make things worse , since desperate women are at higher risk to get hurt or arrested .
The money Craigslist collects from those of us who can afford it should go toward creating other options for women like this .
Look at it this way , professional ladies :
If you had a client who got out of hand , you 'd make more rules to keep him in line .
And you 'd probably raise the price : the asshole tax , I 've heard it called .
Sex workers bitching about Craigslist 's policies is like a rambunctious client bitching about being reined in .
How about if we do n't be assholes about it ?

Although there was much buzz in the days leading up to the Oscars about whether or notwould attend - attend she did .
Aniston dazzled in a silver Valentino gown and Jimmy Choo sandals , exuding modern glamour as she arrived on the arm of boyfriend John Mayer .
Once inside however , Jen nervously stumbled through her lines with Jack Black as the two presented the awards for Best Animated Film and Best Animated Short Film .
Perhaps she was uncomfortable with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie sitting in the front row , as the cameras panned to Jolie not just once , but twice while Aniston was onstage .

Jesus and Zacchaeus
1As Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it , 2a man named Zacchaeus appeared .
He was a leading tax collector , and a rich one at that !
3 He was trying to see who Jesus was , but he could n’t do so due to the crowd , since he was a short man .
4So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus , who was going to pass that way .
5 When Jesus came to the tree , he looked up and said , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down !
I must stay at your house today . ”
6 Zacchaeus came down quickly and was glad to welcome him into his home .
7 But all the people who saw this began to complain : “ Jesus is going to be the guest of a notorious sinner ! ”
8 Later , Zacchaeus stood up and announced to the Lord , “ Look !
I ’m giving half of my possessions to the destitute , and if I have accused anyone falsely , I ’m repaying four times as much as I owe . ”
9 Then Jesus told him , “ Today salvation has come to this home , because this man is also a descendant of Abraham , 10 and the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost . ”
The Parable about the Coins
11As they were listening to this , Jesus went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and because the people thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately .
12 So he said , “ A prince went to a distant country to be appointed king and then to return .
13 He called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins .
He told them , ‘ Invest this money until I come back . ’
14 But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation to follow him and to announce , ‘ We do n’t want this man to rule over us ! ’
15 “ After he was appointed king , the prince came back .
He ordered the servants to whom he had given the money to be called so he could find out what they had earned by investing .
16 The first servant came and said , ‘ Sir , your coin has earned ten more coins . ’
17 The king told him , ‘ Well done , good servant !
Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing , take charge of ten cities . ’
18 “ The second servant came and said , ‘ Your coin , sir , has earned five coins . ’
19 The king told him , ‘ You take charge of five cities . ’
20 “ Then the other servant came and said , ‘ Sir , look !
Here ’s your coin .
I ’ve kept it in a cloth for safekeeping 21 because I was afraid of you .
You are a hard man .
You withdraw what you did n’t deposit and harvest what you did n’t plant . ’
22 The king told him , ‘ I will judge you by your own words , you evil servant !
You knew , did you , that I was a hard man , and that I withdraw what I did n’t deposit and harvest what I did n’t plant ?
23 Then why did n’t you put my money in the bank ?
When I returned , I could have collected it with interest . ’
24 “ So the king told those standing nearby , ‘ Take the coin away from him and give it to the man who has the ten coins . ’
25 They answered him , ‘ Sir , he already has ten coins ! ’
26 ‘ I tell you , to everyone who has something , more will be given , but from the person who has nothing , even what he has will be taken away .
27 But as for these enemies of mine who did n’t want me to be their king — bring them here and slaughter them in my presence ! ’ ”
The King Enters Jerusalem
( Matthew 21:1 - 11 ; Mark 11:1-11 ; John 12:12 - 19 )
28 After Jesus had said this , he traveled on and went up to Jerusalem .
29 As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples on ahead .
30 “ Go into the village ahead of you , ” he said .
“ As you enter , you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever ridden .
Untie it and bring it along .
31 If anyone asks you why you are untying it , say this : ‘ The Lord needs it . ’ ”
32So those who were sent went off and found it as Jesus had told them .
33 While they were untying the colt , its owners asked them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
34 The disciples answered , “ The Lord needs it . ” 35 Then they brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it , and Jesus sat upon it .
36As he was riding along , people kept spreading their coats on the road .
37 He was now approaching the descent from the Mount of Olives .
The whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the miracles they had seen .
38 They said ,
“ How blessed is the king
who comes in the name of the Lord !
Peace in heaven ,
and glory in the highest heaven ! ”
39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd told Jesus , “ Teacher , tell your disciples to be quiet . ”
40 He replied , “ I tell you , if they were quiet , the stones would cry out ! ”
41 When he came closer and saw the city , he began to grieve over it : 42 “ If you had only known today what could have brought you peace !
But now it is hidden from your sight , 43 because the days will come when your enemies will build walls around you , surround you , and close you in on every side .
44 They will level you to the ground — you and those who live within your city limits .
They will not leave one stone on another within your walls , because you did n’t recognize the time when you were visited . ”
Confrontation in the Temple over Money
( Matthew 21:12 - 17 ; Mark 11:15 - 19 ; John 2:13 - 22 )
45 Then Jesus went into the Temple and began to throw out those who were selling things .
46 He told them , “ It is written , ‘ My house is to be called a house of prayer , ’ but you have turned it into a hideout for bandits ! ”
47 Then he began teaching in the Temple every day .
The high priests , the scribes , and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him , 48 but they could n’t find a way to do it , because all the people were eager to hear him .
Concerts seem to be getting more and more expensive every year , especially for all these big name acts .
CD sales are down , so more money must be made from live shows and merchandising .
Personally , if I ’m going to go and listen to music , I ’d rather go see a smokin ’ hot local band play for 10 bucks , but sometimes these big name acts are often worth it just for the stage show .
Here are the top 10 most expensive concert tickets of 2008 , according to average resale ticket prices from Ticketmaster :
Madonna : $ 378 Elton John : $ 306 The Eagles : $ 279 AC / DC : $ 263 Tina Turner : $ 263 Celine Dion : $ 240 Bruce Springsteen : $ 235 Coldplay : $ 217 Neil Diamond : $ 217 The Police : $ 216
The award for the most expensive tickets ever sold would go to Led Zeppelin , whose tickets for their reunion tour were auctioned offfor £ 83,000 ( $ 164,929 USD ) for a pair in 2007 .
Later , three more pairs of tickets to see Led Zepplin were auctioned off with a reserve price of £ 5,000 ( $ 9,935 USD ) .
By the way , if you are looking to buy ( or sell ) concert or sports tickets , try StubHub , it ’s a much safer way to deal with ticket transactions than eBay .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Diplomacy will play a bigger role in U.S. efforts in Afghanistan in future even as the Pentagon announced a significant troop increase , President Barack Obama said Tuesday in an interview on Canadian television .
President Obama says al Qaeda threatens American from the Afghan - Pakistani border .
" I am absolutely convinced that you cannot solve the problem of Afghanistan , the Taliban , the spread of extremism in that region solely through military means , " Obama told journalist Peter Mansbridge as part of a wide - ranging interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation .
" We 're going to have to use diplomacy .
We 're going to have to use development . "
The Pentagon said Tuesday that Obama had approved a significant troop increase for Afghanistan , which is expected to include 8,000 Marines and 4,000 Army troops .
An additional 5,000 troops will be deployed at a later date to support combat forces , bringing the total to 17,000 , the Defense Department said later in the day .
Canada has about 2,800 troops in Afghanistan , but parliament has voted to pull them out by 2011 .
Obama suggested he will take up the issue with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper when the two meet Thursday in Ottawa .
" My hope is that in conversations that I have with Prime Minister Harper , that he and I end up seeing the importance of a comprehensive strategy , and one that ultimately the people of Canada can support , as well as the people of the United States can support , " Obama said .
The White House is reviewing America 's strategy in Afghanistan , according to the president , who said the situation " appears to be deteriorating . "

Do youths have " war fatigue " ?
Obama also addressed Canadian concerns about protectionism in Washington 's economic stimulus package .
Canada is America 's largest trading partner .
See what CNN's Barbara Starr says about the increase on the AC360 blog
A " Buy American " provision requires the use of U.S. - produced iron , steel and other manufactured goods in public works projects funded by the $ 787 billion package .
Obama said Canadians should n't be too worried about the provision .
" My administration is committed to making sure that even as we take steps to strengthen the U.S. economy , that we are doing so in a way that actually over time will enhance the ability of trading partners , like Canada , to work within our boundaries , " he said .

Obama has also been critical of the North American Free Trade Agreement , or NAFTA , saying during a debate with then - Sen .
Hillary Clinton that the United States should abandon the treaty if it could not be renegotiated .
During another debate with Republican opponent Sen. John McCain , Obama said he believes in fair trade , but added , " NAFTA did not have enforceable labor agreements .
...
We should make them enforceable . "

Environmental and labor protections are side agreements to NAFTA .
" My argument has always been that we might as well incorporate them into the full agreement so that they 're fully enforceable , " Obama said in the CBC interview .

UN agency recommends world stop ' trivializing ' marijuana dangers Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday February 19 , 2009
Print This Email This RAW STORY plans follow - up examination of report 's claims .
VIENNA ( AFP )  A UN drugs agency warned Thursday against underestimating the dangers of cannabis .
" The international community may wish to review the issue of cannabis , " the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) wrote in its annual report .
" Over the years , cannabis has become more potent and is associated with an increasing number of emergency room admissions , " the report stated .
Cannabis was often the first illicit drug taken by young people and was frequently called a " gateway drug , " in that it could lead to later use of hard drugs .
" In spite of all these facts , the use of cannabis is often trivialised and , in some countries , controls over the cultivation , possession and use of cannabis are less strict than for other drugs , " the INCB said .
Indeed , many countries allowed the " recreational " use of cannabis , and public perceptions of the so - called " medical " uses of the drug and its recreational use " are overlapping and confusing , " it said .
The agency also expressed " alarm " at the development of " rogue " or illegal Internet pharmacies .
The agency said it had long been concerned about the role of the Internet in the sale and distribution of controlled and uncontrolled substances and was aware of numerous cases involving illegal Internet pharmacies .
While it recognised " that purchasing pharmaceuticals online can be beneficial , especially in areas where hospitals and pharmaceutical services are widely dispersed , ( the INCB ) is alarmed that ' rogue ' pharmacies are encouraging drug abuse among vulnerable groups . "
The report called for international action " to address the illegal sale of drugs on Internet pharmacies and websites . "
It also urged governments to " stimulate " the controlled use of opiate - based painkillers to help " alleviate unnecessary suffering of millions of patients . "
" Although the access to controlled medicines , including morphine and codeine , is considered by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) to be a human right , it is virtually non existent in over 150 countries , " the report said .
" The WHO estimates that at least 30 million patients and possibly as many as 86 million annually suffer from untreated moderate to severe pain . "
The report also highlighted a big increase in drugs being trafficked through eastern Europe .
" The smuggling of cocaine through Eastern European countries has significantly increased in the past few years , " it said .
Western Africa had also become a " major hub " for cocaine smugglers on the route from South America to Europe , the INCB added .
According to the study , some 27 percent , or 40 tons , of the cocaine consumed every year in Europe transited through western Africa .
This was due to its geographic location but also to " weak governmental structures that have limited capacity to defend themselves against drug trafficking and its consequences , such as corruption and drug abuse , " it added .

Incest dad Josef Fritzl kept his mum locked in a sealed room for 20 years until she died in revenge for allegedly abusing him .
He made the astonishing revelations to a psychologist preparing a report for his trial next year .
Fritzl , 74 , claimed : “ She used to beat me until I was lying in a pool of blood .
“ I never had a kiss from her or a cuddle . ”
He originally told friends she died in 1959 but now reveals it was 1980 – meaning she was imprisoned for two decades .
He said : “ I locked her up at the top of the house .
I then bricked in the window so she never again saw the light of day . ”
Fritzl locked up daughter Elisabeth for 24 years near Amstetten , Austria .
He raped her and forced to have his seven children .
He told the psychologist : “ I was born to be a rapist . ”
She is recommending he is never freed .
I could only think of one thing when I saw this hands - free cellphone holder called Cell Mate : Ahahaha haha HA !
Apparently , they have a booth at CES — worth a Giz visit , methinks .

European banks sitting on £ 16.3 trillion ( $ 24 trillion ) of toxic assets may suffer massive losses , according to a confidential Brussels document .
A secret 17 - page paper discussed by finance ministers , including the Chancellor Alistair Darling on Tuesday , also warned that government attempts to buy up or underwrite such assets could plunge the European Union into a deeper crisis .
National leaders and EU officials share fears that a second bank bail - out in Europe will raise government borrowing at a time when investors - particularly those who lend money to European governments - have growing doubts over the ability of countries such as Spain , Greece , Portugal , Ireland , Italy and Britain to pay it back .
“ Estimates of total expected asset write - downs suggest that the budgetary costs – actual and contingent - of asset relief could be very large both in absolute terms and relative to GDP in member states , ” the EC document , seen by The Daily Telegraph , cautioned . “
" It is essential that government support through asset relief should not be on a scale that raises concern about over - indebtedness or financing problems . ”
European Commission officials have estimated that “ impaired assets ” may amount to 44 pc of EU bank balance sheets .
The Commission estimates that so - called financial instruments in the ‘ trading book ’ total £ 12.3 trillion ( 13.7 trillion euros ) , equivalent to about 33 pc of EU bank balance sheets .
In addition , so - called ' available for sale instruments ' worth £ 4trillion ( 4.5 trillion euros ) , or 11 pc of balance sheets , are also added by the Commission to arrive at the headline figure of £ 16.3 trillion .
Banks account for their assets in different ways .
Assets put into the “ trading book ” have to be marked to current market values , while those in the “ banking book ” are loans and other assets which the institution believes it can hold to maturity .
Other assets are classified as “ available for sale ” , which are also marked to market values .
The Commission figure is significant because of the role EU officials will play in devising rules to evaluate “ toxic ” bank assets later this month .
New moves to bail out banks will be discussed at an emergency EU summit at the end of February .
The EU is deeply worried at widening spreads on bonds sold by different European countries .
In line with the risk , and the weak performance of some EU economies compared to others , investors are demanding increasingly higher interest to lend to countries such as Italy instead of Germany .
Ministers and officials fear that the process could lead to vicious spiral that threatens to tear both the euro and the EU apart .
“ Such considerations are particularly important in the current context of widening budget deficits , rising public debt levels and challenges in sovereign bond issuance , ” the EC paper warned .

Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul ( perhaps some others ) refused to attend the secret session of Congress .
In an interview with Democracy Now ! ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgnbFCbnB24 ) , Kucinich talked about how these things go down .
The entire place and every member of Congress are swept for bugs or wires ; absolutely no information is supposed to leave .
He goes on to say that he wo n't attend any secret meeting because what happens is that Congress - members are lied to and fed propoganda under the pretext of a national security secret .
I guess that last bit is one answer to your question .
If the leaks are to be believed , they originated from members who were so outraged and afraid by what took place that they felt compelled to anonymously leak the information to independent news organizations .
The mainstream media would n't talk about it and the information finally came from a media outlet in Australia .
There are some interesting C - SPAN clips from the debate prior to the meeting : Two clips from a radio show discussing the purported contents of the secret meeting : I 'm really not sure what to make of all this , but clearly the first bullet point in that list has come true and we 're on the cusp of the second .
I 'm certainly not one to trumpet conspiracy theories ( far from it ) , but to dismiss this amid everything that 's been said and has happened is just as silly .

FBI agents served the complaint from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Texas billionaire Allen Stanford in Fredricksburg , Virginia , an FBI spokesman said on Thursday .
FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said the FBI acted at the request of the SEC and that Stanford had not been arrested .
He has not been charged with any crime .
The complaint , accusing Stanford of an $ 8 billion fraud , was served on him by agents from the FBI 's office in Richmond , Virginia .
Kolko said .
Stanford is accused of cheating some 50,000 customers out of $ 8 billion dollars .
Thursday 's action comes after raids Tuesday of his financial empire in Houston , Memphis , and Tupelo , Mississippi .
Stanford and three of his companies were charged with fraud in a civil complaint filed in federal court in Dallas , Texas .
Carl Wilhelm Hahn ( 1786 -1835 ) was a German zoologist and artist .
Following a short stint in the armed services , Hahn completed a PhD and took the unusual step of setting himself up as ' freelance natural historian ' .
Biographical details are in short supply but it appears
Hahn was at least acquainted with the leading naturalists from Nuremberg and his most important early work involved preparing an ornithological publication on bird species from America , Asia and Africa .
It is probable that Hahn contributed artwork to a number of books on insects , spiders and birds .
Hahn 's most significant publication was the dual - titled ' Monographie der Spinnen / Monographia Aranearum ' ( Monograph of Spiders ) which was issued in instalments between 1820 and 1836 .
Of the eight or so ( near - ) complete copies of this work in the world that have survived , none is apparently a definitive version .
The history of the publishing is complicated , involving a change in printers following a quarrel , a small number of subscribers , unauthorised episode issues and , when combined with a sixteen year period of publication , the scarcity of complete works becomes understandable .
' Monographie der Spinnen ' was the first ever German monograph on spiders and one of the earliest publications anywhere devoted solely to spiders .
Hahn provided the original descriptions of a number of previously unknown spider species together with accurate illustrations , so the work is regarded not only as an important historical scientific document , but is still cited today as a primary source in the field of arachnology .
[ Nb .
The title tags for the above illustrations were taken from the illustration plates but are n't necessarily consistent or accurate in the ' naming sense ' .
They were simply chosen quickly to distinguish between the images . ]
The excruciating , blood - soaked ordeal suffered last summer by Cheye Calvo , his wife , Trinity Tomsic , and Trinity 's mother , Georgia Porter at the hands of out - of - control law - enforcement officers received the in - depth treatment it deserves this past Sunday in the Washington Post .
If April Witt 's story of an utterly pointless marijuana raid that resulted in the deaths of two dogs does n't make your blood boil , you 're either bloodless , or part of the problem of paramilitary law - enforcement .
But will this be the case that finally convinces Americans the problem needs to be addressed before matters get even worse ?
Without going into detail -- the Washington Post story does that , and you need to read it -- Calvo was targeted because Prince George 's County police had intercepted a box of marijuana addressed to his home .
Even though police knew that smugglers often pick addresses at random , intending to divert the shipment before it ever arrives , they used the marijuana -- which would have been a non-violent transgression even if it belonged to Calvo -- as a pretext for a violent raid .
Calvo 's dogs , Payton and Chase , were killed and his family terrorized before county police -- who never checked with their local counterparts -- conceded that they might have made an error .
Calvo 's story is n't unique .
People have been terrorized , injured and killed in similar raids across the country .
Salvatore Culosi was killed during a SWAT raid over sports gambling , Ryan Frederick is about to discover his fate after fatally shooting a police officer in a panic as people who turned out to be police broke down his door while investigating charges that he was growing marijuana .
Ninety - two - year - old Kathryn Johnston was murdered by uniformed raiders who planted drugs in her house after the fact to conceal their error .
All too many cases like this were documented in Radley Balko's book , Overkill : The Rise of Paramilitary Police Raids in America .
The Cato Institute maintains an interactive map of similar incidents on the Web .
But Cheye Calvo is the mayor of his town of Berwyn Heights , he 's squeaky clean , an extremely able public speaker who is fighting mad over the incident , and the raid occurred almost within spitting distance of the nation 's capital , within the orbit of major media .
So Cheye Calvo is , for the moment , the poster child for reforming law - enforcement tactics .
And reform is needed .
Take , for example , this account of the initial moments of the raid from Witt 's story .
It was past 7 p.m. , but late sun still streamed through the large kitchen window as Georgia stood at the stove stirring her simmering tomato - artichoke sauce .
Georgia turned , catching a glimpse of something out the window that sent a jolt of fear through her .
Hooded , armed men , dressed in black , were fanning across the back yard .
Still more men , crouching low , moved around the side of the house .
Georgia 's mind raced to make sense of the strange tableau .
Was someone playing an elaborate practical joke ?
One of the men spotted Georgia gaping out the window .
He lifted his high - powered assault rifle and pointed it directly at her , she recalled .
Georgia -- still clutching her wooden spoon -- threw both hands up in the air and screamed .
" Cheye , I think it 's SWAT ! "
Cheye was sitting on the edge of his bed in his boxers .
He was just about to put on his black dress socks , when he heard Georgia scream something that made absolutely no sense .
He looked out a bedroom window to see armed , masked men running .
He was still wondering if they were home invaders when he heard his front door shatter .
In the kitchen , Georgia spun to face the sound of the splintering door .
Men in black burst through the front door and into the living room .
Georgia stood trembling in front of the kitchen stove .
Payton , who had been stretched out in a corner of the living room farthest from the front door , his head resting near the threshold to the kitchen " turned toward the front door when I turned , " Georgia recalled .
" He did n't have time to do anything else . "
Almost instantly , men in black ran forward and shot Payton in the face , Georgia said .
" They kept shooting , " she recalled .
" I did n't know how many times they shot Payton because there was so much gunfire . "
" Down on the ground ! " Georgia recalled someone screaming at her .
She was too terrified to move .
Chase , always timid even when there was nothing to fear , did what he did best -- he ran .
He ran away from the men in black , zipped past Georgia at the stove , Georgia recalled .
The screaming , running men followed Chase , shooting as he tried escaping into the dining room , Georgia said .
She watched in horror as men in black rushed the dining room from all directions .
" I could hear Chase whimpering , " Georgia said .
Then she heard someone shoot at Chase again , she said .
Note that this raid took place during an investigation into the smuggling of 32 pounds of marijuana .
There 's no suspicion of crimes against people or property .
There 's no talk of the threats against police or the presence of weapons .
Yet police stormed in like it was D - Day with guns blazing .
Beloved animals died .
People could have died , as they have elsewhere .
Is it that hard to knock on the door , which is still , in this country , supposed to be the default means of serving search warrants ?
Apparently it is .
In many places in the country , including Prince George 's County , most drug warrants are served with a sound of splintering wood and a rush of armed and armored members of SWAT .
Is it any surpise that the practice comes with a body count ?
The natural reaction for many innocent people , when they are under attack , is to fight back .
Kathryn Johnston opened fire , so did Ryan Frederick , so did Vang Khang , and so did Cory Maye .
All too often , police point to these incidents of people resisting armed assault as further evidence that SWAT needs to be deployed for every interaction with the public .
But here 's the unpleasant truth : People have the moral right to defend themselves against violent attack , even if their attackers are wearing uniforms .
The level of force used in these raid is unjustifiable , and the potential for injury or death at the hands of the raiders is all too real .
There is no moral obligation on anybody 's part , no matter what the law says , to submit to brutal treatment .
It would have been unwise for Cheye Calvo to shoot police officers as they stormed into his home , but he would have been perfectly justified in doing so .
And if his neighors , seeing his distress , had rallied to his support with shotguns in hand , they would have been in the right , too .
A badge is not , and cannot be , a license to abuse and kill .
If the law says otherwise , than the law becomes illegitimate .
Really .
The natural right to protect yourself and your loved ones trumps any vote ever taken by a legislative body .
It does n't need to come to this .
People should n't have to rely on the gun in the nightstand as a deterrent against those who are supposed to be protectors .
One of the people who came to Calvo 's assistance during and after the raid was Berwyn Heights Officer Amir Johnson .
Troubled by what he saw , he parked himself in the middle , saying , " I wanted to personally witness what is going to happen to my mayor , so if they try to say this guy went for a gun -- and he did n't -- it 's not going to happen on my watch . "
Even the police know the situation is out of control , and the good ones are starting to keep at least an occasional watch on the stormtroopers .
But an Officer Johnson here and there wo n't keep peaceful people 's doors on their hinges , or keep humans and animals from ending up in pools of their own blood .
That will have to come from a change in policy and culture at the nation 's police departments .
Police and politicians can do that on their own , or they can wait for the day when the neighbors of a future Cheye Calvo take matters into their own hands .
In the video below , Cheye Calvo tells his own story .

The SHO must go on .

The SHO must go on .
SHO me the money .
It 's SHO time !
We 've heard them all during the months of speculation leading up to this moment .
Without further ado , we present to you the 2010 Ford Taurus SHO .
That 's right , Ford has decided to revive the moniker once affixed to the sports sedan that wowed the automotive world way back in 1989 .
The original SHO survived three generations of Taurus models , was sold for 10 years straight and attracted over 100,000 buyers .
But just as the Taurus itself devolved from America 's best - selling car to a rental fleet afterthought , the original SHO ended production in 1999 having gone from a budget sports sedan to an overpriced , underpowered executive whip .
Ford is working on rehabilitating the Taurus name with a significant redesign that debuted last month at the Detroit Auto Show .
Using that sedan as its canvas , the new SHO may also restore respect to a name that has fallen too far .
A 365 - hp twin -turbo EcoBoost V6 , all - wheel - drive and plenty of upgrades is a good place to start .
Follow the jump to learn everything there is to know about the return of the SHO .
Ford is currently in the process of stuffing its new 3.5L EcoBoost V6 into any that fits .
The
That model designation originally meant Super High Output , which definitely applies to the modern version .
Whereas the original SHO used a high - revving 220 - hp 3.0L V6 ( later a 235 - hp 3.4L V8 ) developed and built by Yamaha , the new SHO 's advanced engine turns a relatively small 3.5 liters of displacement displacement and a lot of pressure into 365 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 350 ft. - lb of torque at 3,500 rpm .
That makes this version of Ford 's 3.5L EcoBoost V6 the most powerful one available with 10 more horsepower than its other applications .
Unlike the original SHO , however , this new one is about much more than just the engine .
Backing up the potent powerplant is a torque - sensing all - wheel - drive system mated to Ford 's 6F55 six - speed SelectShift automatic transmission .
The tranny is augmented by a manual mode that can be controlled either by the console shifter or paddle shifters , and will also rev match downshifts and hold gears even when the tach is bouncing off the engine 's redline .
The SHO further separates itself from lesser Taurus models with a beefed up suspension that includes SHO - specific shock absorbers , springs , stabilizer bars and strut mount bushings .
Furthermore , the new SHO also features Ford 's new SR1 suspension setup with MacPherson front struts and a multi- link set up in the rear .
We 'll have to wait for a test drive to determine for sure , but the SHO 's suspension should be noticeably sharper than that of the standard Taurus and its other platform - mate , the
New wheels are one of only a few items that will visually set the SHO apart from lesser Taurus trim levels .
The grille features a dark grey finish that matches the wheels and new parking lamp bevels are SHO - only items .
There 's also a decklid spoiler out back along with a simple SHO / EcoBoost badge on the trunk lid .
One of the exclusive colors available will also be Atlantis Green , which Ford says was inspired by the Deep Emerald Green seen on many second - generation ( 1992 - 1995 ) SHO models .
While the exterior styling adheres to the same sleeper philosophy as the original , the new SHO interior is a bit more outgoing .
The seats are leather - trimmed and two - tone with Mike Suede inserts , which Ford proudly points out are produced from post - consumer yarns made of plastic soda bottles .
The dash and door panels also feature acres of aluminum trim , and SHO branding appears on the floor mats and passenger - side dash panel .
Those are basically the lengths to which Ford has gone to transform its new Taurus into a modern day interpretation of the original SHO .
There is some bad news , however , some of which will likely not go over well with the SHO faithful who live on websites like
For one , the original Yamaha 3.0L V6 ( upper left ) was one of the most gorgeous engines ever created with an overlapping system of intake runners that is a marvel to behold .
The 3.5L EcoBoost V6 in the new version ( upper right ) is covered by a boring , black plastic shroud with SHO branding .
Also , aside from the aforementioned availability of a SHO - inspired shade of green , there 's not much that visually connects the
Then there 's the question of whether another Ford product might have been a more appropriate choice for a modern day SHO .

The 2010 Ford Taurus SHO will start at $ 37,995 when it goes on sale this summer .
That 's a lofty price tag for a Taurus , but not for a 365 - hp , all - wheel - drive sedan stuffed with this much tech and luxury .
The original SHO stickered for just under $ 20,000 in late 1988 , which was also considered a big premium to pay for Ford 's bread - and - butter family sedan .
But auto pundits of the day quickly realized that the SHO was a performance bargain compared to more expensive cars from brands like
Ford is currently in the process of stuffing its new 3.5L EcoBoost V6 into any that fits .
The Ford Flex Lincoln MKS and upcoming Lincoln MKT are all getting it .
Being based on the same platform as the MKS , it was a no- brainer that the redesigned 2010 Taurus would also get the twin - turbo , direct - inject engine that Ford promises will deliver V8 power with V6 fuel economy .
Rather than simply affix the EcoBoost badge to the Taurus ' trunk and call it a day , Ford product planners decided that this model would be the perfect vehicle to once again wear the letters S - H - O .
That model designation originally meant Super High Output , which definitely applies to the modern version .
Whereas the original SHO used a high - revving 220 - hp 3.0L V6 ( later a 235 - hp 3.4L V8 ) developed and built by Yamaha , the new SHO 's advanced engine turns a relatively small 3.5 liters of displacement displacement and a lot of pressure into 365 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 350 ft. - lb of torque at 3,500 rpm .

We 'll have to wait for a test drive to determine for sure , but the SHO 's suspension should be noticeably sharper than that of the standard Taurus and its other platform - mate , the Lincoln MKS .
There will even be an optional Performance Package that includes better brake pads , recalibrated steering , a " Sport Mode " for the stability control system and shorter 3.16 to 1 final drive ratio .
Nineteen - inch wheels wrapped in Goodyear Eagle rubber will be standard , while 20 - inchers wearing Michelin high - performance summer tires will also be available .
New wheels are one of only a few items that will visually set the SHO apart from lesser Taurus trim levels .
The grille features a dark grey finish that matches the wheels and new parking lamp bevels are SHO - only items .

Those are basically the lengths to which Ford has gone to transform its new Taurus into a modern day interpretation of the original SHO .
There is some bad news , however , some of which will likely not go over well with the SHO faithful who live on websites like SHOtimes.com SHOforum.com and BringBackTheSHO.com , and who Ford also claims it listened to during the car 's development .
For one , the original Yamaha 3.0L V6 ( upper left ) was one of the most gorgeous engines ever created with an overlapping system of intake runners that is a marvel to behold .
The 3.5L EcoBoost V6 in the new version ( upper right ) is covered by a boring , black plastic shroud with SHO branding .
Also , aside from the aforementioned availability of a SHO - inspired shade of green , there 's not much that visually connects the new car to the original .
Though the first - and second - gen SHOs did not look drastically different than a standard Taurus , there were certain SHO elements that have become associated with the car , specifically the " slicer " wheels that debuted in ' 90 / '91 and were standard on all second - gen models .
Then there 's the question of whether another Ford product might have been a more appropriate choice for a modern day SHO .
The Fusion , for instance , is smaller , lighter and less expensive than the current Taurus .
While the redesigned 2010 Fusion does offer a Sport model with a big V6 , we envision a more balanced Fusion SHO that honors the original with front - wheel - drive , a manual transmission and high output 2.0L EcoBoost four - cylinder .
It might be nice , but it 's not the way Ford went .
The 2010 Ford Taurus SHO will start at $ 37,995 when it goes on sale this summer .
That 's a lofty price tag for a Taurus , but not for a 365 - hp , all - wheel - drive sedan stuffed with this much tech and luxury .

Based on what we 've learned so far , the same thing will likely be said of the new one .
KDE UserBase provides the perfect opportunity to refine the process of creating documentation for apps such as Amarok and the KDE 4 desktop
Most software developers , whether open source or proprietary , would agree that the success or failure of any endeavour depends on building a community .
This may be a community of fellow developers , advocates or just users , but unless a significant number of people take a project to their hearts , it 's unlikely to make an impact .
If you 're an elite coder who dreams in C++ , making your mark on a free software project could be relatively easy ; you take the code – magically available under the GPL – and work out how to do something new or more efficient with it and then bash out your edits on a keyboard .
You release your patch and the community sings your praises while you begin the process over again with the same or another project .
For those of us who dream in boring old pictures , making an impression may seem like a pipe dream , but there are ways that end users can get involved in free software development and help improve not just the software itself , but also the experience of other users .
In this case , it 's not our ( lack of ) coding skills that are of use , but the diverse ways we use software and the experiences we can bring to the community .
Enter UserBase and Anne Wilson .
The former is a collection of pages dedicating to helping users everywhere get the best experience when using KDE .
The latter , meanwhile , is a retired teacher with a passion for Linux , learning and KDE who has become a key contributor to UserBase .
She says UserBase aspires to being the first - stop site for KDE users in search of hints and tips , userfriendly discussion pages and evolving information about applications :
" There has traditionally been a great deal of information on the web about KDE applications , " she says .
" But its scattered nature has made it difficult for users to find , and difficult for developers to maintain . "
UserBase ,
Anne says , is an integral part of the " great reorganisation " going on in the KDE documentation project to address these problems .
Linux Format : How are contributors organised ?
Anne Wilson : Organised ?
What 's that ?
Seriously , this is a wiki .
We , the smallish group of original contributors , use the Recent Changes RSS feed to keep in touch , and encourage people to use the Discussion pages when an issue needs resolving .
It 's no more organised than a chat in the pub , but it works , and it 's productive .
It was mid-September when we had our first few pages up and ' went live ' , inviting contributions .
Recently we saw our 200th page arrive , and the statistics page tells us that there have been a total of 197,132 page views !
It 's easy to set up a wiki , but difficult to acquire and keep users and contributors .
How have you managed to build and retain a successful userbase ?
Time will tell whether we have managed to do this .
In the end it will depend on two factors – whether users find it helpful , and whether developers find it easy to use for end user documentation .
The first problem was to define clearly the focus of UserBase in terms of what belongs there , and what does n't .
KDE had a wiki previously , but the focus was never defined , and it descended into chaos .
Users felt that it was not for them , and developers could n't work out whether to put information into the wiki , into TechBase , or both , which they clearly did n't want to have to do .
Are there plans to integrate the project further into the KDE experience ?
An excellent idea , but help files do n't get written too often , so it will take a little time for that .
Currently , though , if you search for an application and find an external project site you may well find that the Documentation page links to UserBase .
This is proving the preferred route for many smaller projects .
Large projects like Amarok need to keep their own pages , but that 's no problem either , as UserBase simply links to project pages .
The idea is to make it simple for the user to find the information they need .

" The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid basis of the consent of the people .
The streams of national power ought to flow from that pure , original fountain of all legitimate authority . "
-- Alexander Hamilton
Apparently several U.S. States have taken the first steps to claim sovereignty under the United States Constitution 10th Amendment .
You may not have seen or heard about this from the Main Stream Media , but the ripple is as real as a sunrise .
Arizona , New Hampshire , Missouri , and Washington state are in various stages of legislatively declaring their sovereignty .
Several states are giving notice the Federal Government should actually abide by the terms enumerated in the U.S. Constitution .
They probably wo n’t succeed any more than Ron Paul did , but both the states rights movement and the Ron Paul reality are seeds that have been planted … and require attention and nurturing .
A long time pet peeve has been ( and remains ) , officials who swear a sacred oath to “ preserve and protect ” the Constitution of the United States of America and then , in thought , word and deed , undermine , usurp and abrogate the very principles to which they have sworn an oath .
This states rights movement is not just the erotic dream of constitutionally conservative patriots .
It is a necessary ( overdue ) beginning of the restoration of the republic .
The framers of the Constitution were colonial revolutionaries who were courageous and brave in ways our contemporary congress can only fantasize through revisionist rationalizations .
The brave men who walked onto the Lexington green knew the time and place to " lead , follow , or get out of the way . "
The congressional thespians posturing for sound bites , ( and the complicit main stream media enablers ) along with a form over substance President who is way more sizzle than steak , lack the courage to lead , lack the brains to follow , and suffer an abundance of ego which denies them the ability to get out of the way .
Abuse of power under the color of authority is nothing new .
However , it has grown geometrically for a long time .
I used to think the big push by the controllers started in 1913 but it really probably started with Lincoln .
The oligarchy that controls us is not partisan … but they are serious as a heart attack and insidious as cancer .
The media that is “ supposed ” to be our watch dog has become an enabling co conspirator .

New Hampshire ’s HRC6 notes , “ That the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their General Government … whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force ; that to this compact each State acceded as a State .. ”
Herewith are the links to each state ’s resolution :
• Arizona State resolution ;
• New Hampshire State resolution ;
• Missouri State :
• Washington State :
• Oklahoma .
This is not the first time states have dusted off the 10th Amendment , and for sure it wo n’t be the last .
Also , notwithstanding the sincerity , commitment and principles of those courageous souls at the pointed end of the spear , it will not succeed … right now .
Many of us have been grousing about abuse of power from the District of Criminals for decades .
We have been marginalized , “ tut - tutted ” and smiled at as either amusing constitutional history buffs or right wing wackos .
However , Dr. Paul did the republic a great service despite having failed in his efforts to win his party ’s nomination .
Paul actually exposed a wider audience to the intrinsic constitutional facts that establishment types have cavalierly ignored .
The oligarchy poohbahs have known for decades they cannot impose their dream quest unless or until they can sufficiently dumb down the masses .
Ron Paul offered us the red pill or the blue pill .
The United States is not a democracy .
The framers specifically shunned democracy and gifted us with a republic .
They also wisely chose ( after General Washington refused a crown ) to create three co-equal branches of government .
Greed , inertia , and laziness have bastardized each branch into hybrids the framers would not recognize .
This struggle is not a partisan battle .
Both Democrats and Republicans have conspired to enhance the Executive branch .
Both Democrats and Republicans have despoiled the Judiciary .
The framers of the Constitution did " ordain and establish " the document in an effort to " insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity . "

Better men than ourselves sacrificed to " secure the Blessings of Liberty " for a posterity that has become increasingly jaded , myopic and derelict .
BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- A 13 - year - old Chinese girl tried to commit suicide because she wanted her family to donate her liver to her cancer - stricken father , state media reported Thursday .
The girl , Chen Jin , swallowed more than 200 sleeping pills after she discovered a medical note in her mother 's purse that said her father was dying of liver cancer and had three months left to live , the news agency Xinhua said .
Jin 's mother returned home after visiting her husband in the hospital to find the front door locked .
The mother climbed in through a back window and found two empty bottles of sleeping pills .
" Mom , I 'm sorry I could n't stay with you any longer , " read a note that the teen had left next to her .
" Please give my liver to dad and save him after my death . "
The incident occurred January 24 in Jiangsu province in east China .
The teen was taken to the same hospital as her father , where she remains in intensive care , drifting in and out of consciousness , Xinhua said .
Doctors say that even if she pulls through , she will need surgery for burns she suffered from an electric blanket on her bed when she lost consciousness , the China Daily newspaper said .
According to Chinese media reports , the family -- whose monthly income is about 1,000 yuan ( $ 146 ) -- has already spent nearly 100,000 yuan ( $ 14,600 ) in medical expenses since the father was diagnosed with cancer more than a month ago .
The mother , who is also in poor health , retired early more than eight years ago .
The woman told China Daily she is now trying to keep her husband from learning of their daughter 's desperate act of love .

P.T. Barnum may have coined the phrase “ There ’s a sucker born every minute , ” but Wall Street titans have leveraged that principle and banked it in the Caymans .
And do n’t think that the recent stimulus package provision aimed at reining in CEO compensation is going to stop them .
Recently , President Barack Obama , tapping into a source of public fury , decried the “ shameful ” excesses of Wall Street and proposed capping the cash component of executive compensation at $ 500,000 for those running firms set to receive money under the Treasury Department ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) and other federal bailout initiatives .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also blasted big bonuses when he introduced a light - on - details plan for the next phase of the Wall Street bailout .
And Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , chair of the Senate banking committee , tucked compensation constraints for the top 5 senior executives and 20 highest paid employees at firms receiving more than $ 500 million in TARP money into the stimulus package .
( Meanwhile , though , he removed Obama ’s pay cap idea , opting instead to restrain bonus compensation until TARP funds are repaid . )
But all this is window dressing , for Wall Street will , in all likelihood , still find imaginative ways to hand its execs huge sums of money in the years to come .
Cash typically comprises only a small percentage of an executive ’s compensation package .
Thus , it ’s no hardship for Wall Street execs worth millions to forgo a year or two of bonuses to get the government off their backs .
Ask former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson .
In 2005 , while serving as the CEO of Goldman Sachs , he received just $ 600,000 in cash — but $ 38 million in other forms of compensation , such as $ 30.1 million in restricted shares and 220,000 stock options .
( His car and driver cost almost $ 154,000 that year , a bargain compared to Tom Daschle ’s limo expenses of $ 182,520 . )
Currently , in the media and parts of the government , a twisted line of reasoning persists that warns against attaching too many strings — like compensation caps — to the TARP funds .
The argument goes that doing so will reduce the talent pool available to the Street or make institutions too nervous to seek government assistance when they need it .
Whatever action the government takes on executive compensation , Wall Street is anticipating a weak bonus year for 2009 , and probably for 2010 as well .
First , anyone who can evaluate a decaying asset at all knows that the banking system will deteriorate further in the near term .
Second , banks still owe money they borrowed using their inferior assets as collateral .
Yet once all that ’s out of the way , bonuses will rebound .
They always do .
Over the past three decades , there have been four periods of decreased bonuses , which were inevitably followed by increases that made up for the declines .
During the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s , 747 banks were shuttered , the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation went bust , and the Resolution Trust Corporation swooped in to collect bad ( mostly real estate ) assets .
Ultimately , this rescue cost the American public half a trillion dollars .
Wall Street bonuses were down 21.3 percent in 1988 from 1987 levels .
By 1991 , though , bonuses doubled from the previous year .
Similarly , in 1994 , during the Mexican peso crisis , Wall Street bonuses were cut 15.7 percent , only to bounce back 26.8 percent the following year .
The pattern repeated in 1998 when , during the Russian debt crisis , the Federal Reserve bailed out the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management to the tune of $ 3.65 billion .
Wall Street cut bonuses by 18.8 percent .
They jumped 48.5 percent the next year .
In late 2001 and 2002 came the triple play of the Enron and WorldCom scandals , a recession caused by a spate of corporate bankruptcies , and a nervous post - 9/11 stock market .
Bonuses dropped 33.5 percent and 25 percent , respectively , during those two years .
By 2004 , they zoomed back to pre-recession levels .
Bonuses nearly doubled over the next two years as subprime assets , collateralized debt obligations , and credit derivatives fueled the market .
In 2006 , a record year for Wall Street profits , bonuses reached new highs .
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein , who led the group of supposedly contrite CEOs who testified before Rep. Barney Frank ’s banking committee last week , bagged more than $ 110 million for 2006 and 2007 .
Last year , bonuses shrank by 44 percent , but fell only to 2004 levels — and Wall Street still managed to reward employees with $ 18.4 billion .
This despite a complete Wall Street meltdown , the near - fatal condition of the country ’s largest bank ( Citigroup ) , the collapse of two major investment banks ( Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns ) , and the immensely reckless merger of Merrill Lynch into a terminal Bank of America .
In the Merrill Lynch - BoA deal , former Merrill CEO John
Thain grabbed a $ 15 million signing bonus and other perks , and he paid $ 4 billion in year - end bonuses to Merrill Lynch employees before the merger went through .
Regardless of the strictures that might be placed on Wall Street bonuses in the future , there are multiple ways for corporate leaders to get around cash caps by using restricted shares , offshore companies , and other devices .
To ensure that executive compensation is in line with the public interest , it ought to be taxed or constrained in every possible form .
And to stop the Wall Street bleeding from further infecting the entire economy , we ought to make banks disclose all their positions rather than talk about future transparency and “ stress testing . ”
The next step is to divide firms dealing with public deposits and loans from other financial institutions — and only give the traditional banks federal assistance ( and make renegotiation of residential home loans mandatory ) .
It would be like reinstituting the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 , which created a wall between banks that collect deposits and make loans and those institutions that engage in other , more speculative financial endeavors .
That system worked pretty well until its bipartisan death in 1999 .
It could work once again .
Posted on 24 February 2009 by HansKlopek
Well , with the Oscar build - up finally done with , we actually get some time to sit back and reflect on the ups and downs of the ceremony .
I have to say , it was pretty sweet .
One of the best that I have seen in years .
Let ’s run down some of the high points of the evening .
I ’ll give you the lows tomorrow .
High Point # 1 : Hugh Jackman
Why did n’t someone tell me that Wolverine sang and danced in addition to mauling people with his adamantium claws ?
I ’ve been a Jackman fan for a long time , and it was n’t because of X - Men ( though I liked X2 quite a bit , and The Last Stand was much better than I was expecting ) but because of the stuff that he did off of X - Men .
I ’m talking about The Fountain , The Prestige , Scoop , the stuff that sold him not only as an action star but as a magnificent leading man .
After the Oscars though , it ’s going to be hard to look at him and not think of him as Curly in the opening shots of Oklahoma !
spouting “ Oh what a beautiful morning ! ” That was classic .
Hugh Jackman ignited the Oscars with a gleeful energy that I have n’t seen before .
Sure , Billy Crystal did some similar stuff when he was hosting every year , but it always came with a standup comedian ’s wink .
Jackman was n’t trying to fill anyone ’s shoes , but to bring a new set of shoes to the party .
That opening song and dance trip through the year ’s big nominees was absolutely priceless , and a signal that this year ’s ceremony was going to bring a new spirit of fun and spectacle to it .
They need to get Jackman back for next year .
No excuses .
High Point # 2 : The Design
The stage last night was bigger and better than anything I ’ve seen at the Oscars in the 15 years or so that I have been watching it consistently .
It was just so elaborate and imaginative .
The crystal overhang was enough ostentation to feed Somalia for several generations , but I was completely awestruck by it–it ’s the type of design that lets you know you are in for a different type of experience .
Putting the band onstage and moving the seats up was great as well –it allowed Jackman and the presenters to more directly involve the audience .
Some of the backgrounds might have been trying too hard , but I admired the impulse to have a different look and not just to hand out awards .
Cudos for upping the ante on this year ’s show .
High Point # 3 : The Presenters
I was a big fan of how they handled presenters this year ; instead of arbitrarily doling out these duties to whoever is hot ( though using Zac Efron and Robert Pattinson was pushing it a little much ) in their careers or just in general , they actually tried to make each presentation interesting in its own way .
Steve Martin and Tina
Fey were easily the presenting highlight of the night as they passed out the screenplay awards .
Having Martin adopt a pretentious , holier - than - thou air while telling Fey “ do n’t fall in love with me ” as she stared longingly at his profile was a masterstroke .
I enjoyed the Jack Black / Jennifer Anniston bit as well .
The line about Black taking all of his money from a Dreamworks project and bringing to the Oscars to bet it on Pixar might have been lost on some , but was inspired Oscar - favoritism humor .
Even though the Indy Spirit Awards beat the Academy with the Joaquin Phoenix on Letterman bit ( they did it better as well , staging a batsuit - clad Christian Bale berating Phoenix for his loutish behavior ) , I had to admire Ben Stiller ’s commitment in wandering the stage with a scraggly beard and sunglasses as Natalie Portman read off the nominees .
The choices were n’t perfect .
Will Smith was very bland and did n’t seem to know much about what he was presenting ( a movie is edited before the sound is mixed , Will ) .
Bill Maher was also a very bad choice to present documentary , projecting his usual smugness while pimping Religulous , his own documentary that should be objective but is really just another episode of Real Time .
I give the Academy credit for trying to improve on this part of things , though .
High Point # 4 : The Acceptance Speeches
Acceptance speeches are generally pretty hit or miss every year –you either get someone who is extremely calm and has obviously rehearsed it , or you get a rampaging emotional lunatic who had n’t prepared for the moment and takes about twenty minutes to get it together ( I ’m not looking at Halle Berry or Adrien Brody at all ) .
The awards recipients last night found a very happy medium of not too flabbergasted but not too rehearsed .
They pulled themselves together well and delivered speeches that were not only elegant but also , at times , emotionally profound .
Dustin Lance Black , who won the Best Original Screenplay award for Milk , probably typified this best with his statement about the legal and cultural oppression of homosexuals in America .
He was making a point that his film probably made better , but it came from a place of such deep feeling and experience that it was one of the most poignant moments of the ceremony .
Heath Ledger .
We all knew this moment would bring the house down , and it was handled with such class by the Academy that I could n’t help but let a tear fall .
With Ledger ’s father , mother , and sister accepting his award for Best Supporting Actor , you still got the sense of fresh grief and despair over the loss of their son and brother .
The faces of Ledger ’s peers in the audiences really did say it all : an amazing actor is gone at the peak of his powers .
Kate Winslet ’s speech was probably my favorite of the night .
After seeing her at the Golden Globes , I could n’t help but expect a little bit of a weepy , Halle Berry - style affair , but she handled things better than I expected .
After personalizing the moment with the bit about play - accepting the award as an eight - year - old with a shampoo bottle standing in for Oscar ( “ I guess it is n’t a shampoo bottle anymore ” ) she proceeded to elegantly thank key members of the team that worked on The Reader , finally dedicating the award to it ’s fallen producers , Anthony Minghella and Sidney Pollack .
It really was a great moment that Winslet handled wonderfully .
I was particularly fond of her asking her dad to whistle so she could wave to him in the audience .
Sean Penn did the unthinkable –he was gracious while still managing to be himself .
After jokingly calling the Academy a bunch of “ commie , homo - loving sons of guns ” he made probably my favorite remark of his speech : “ I realize how difficult I may make it for you to appreciate me . ”
Top marks , Sean .
I forgive you a little bit for bitching the Academy out in Rolling Stone about not giving more love to Into the Wild .
Penn ’s social justice statement about gay rights was predictable , but was handled intelligently by him as he did not go off on a political tangent .
He also threw a tip of the hat to his friend and fellow nominee Mickey Rourke , saying “ Mickey Rourke has risen again and he is my brother . ”
Nice speech .
I ’ll be back tomorrow where we can investigate some of the low points .

“ In the spring of 1945 , I realised that I was pregnant .
I told John and he offered to marry me .
But it was out of the question . ”
John F. Kennedy ’s rather zealous love life is once again in the limelight after more claims emerge from an 87 year old woman .

Lisa Lanett has claimed she fell pregnant in 1945 during a passionate two year affair with JFK ’s while he recovered from wartime injuries .
The affair began after they met in Phoenix Arizona while JFK was recovering from back surgery .
He required the operation after his torpedo boat was rammed by a Japanese Cruiser during the Second World War .
On hearing the news that he was to become a father , he asked her to marry him , but she refused the offer .
“ I had a wonderful life at that point and did n’t want to give it up .
Marriage was out of the question for me . ”
Although he did not marry her , Lisa claimed he kept close to the family , seeing them “ now and then . ”
Apparently he even paid the tuition for the child to attend a private military school outside New York .
Lisa admits that she has no way to prove the affair although it is true that Kennedy did indeed visit Arizona for a few weeks during his recuperation .
She has yet to provide an explanation as to why she has kept an affair with such an illustrious historical figure quiet for so long .

Tony Bohler , 63 , the alleged son and retired art dealer , was told that a Mexican man was his actual father .
A fact that the son found hard to believe .
" My mother always told me her former husband , Juan , was my father .
I 'd always had my doubts because he , being a Mexican , looked very Mexican . "
Senator Edward Kennedy , his brother , who was asked to comment on these allegations , has yet to respond .
This is not the first claim regarding ‘ an old flame ’ from Kennedys past .
It comes a year after similar allegations were made by a Canadian man .
Jack Worthington says that his mother had an affair with Kennedy following his election into office in 1960 .
However his mother Mary Worthington , a former Texas teenage beauty queen , has strenuously denied these allegations .

Manchester United ’s dominance of English football , on and off the pitch , is underlined today with the release of a financial survey that shows a £ 45 m leap in United ’s year - on - year income .
Thanks in large part to last season ’s Premier League and Champions League double , United ’s turnover grew by 21 per cent in the 2007 - 08 season to £ 257.1 m .
This makes United by far the highest - earning club in Britain , ahead of Chelsea ( in second place , with income of £ 212.9 m in the same period ) , Arsenal ( £ 209.3 m ) and Liverpool ( £ 167 m ) .

The figures are revealed in the latest Football Money League report by Deloitte , in a survey that shows Real Madrid remain the world ’s richest club in terms of revenue , ahead of United in second , then Barcelona , Bayern Munich and Chelsea .
Only a drastic slump in the value of sterling has prevented United from reclaiming the title of “ world ’s richest club ” from Real .
Real Madrid ’s income for 2007 - 08 rose a relatively modest four per cent to 365.8 m euros , or £ 289.6 m when converted at the June 2008 exchange rate of £ 1 = 1.2632 euros .
United ’s income at the same rate equated to 324.8 m euros .
But sterling has crashed significantly , and if Deloitte had used the same exchange rate as in their previous report ( £ 1 = 1.4856 euros , from June 2007 ) , United ’s latest income would have been 381.9 m euros against Real ’s 365.8 m euros .
One of the most intriguing aspects of today ’s report is that Deloitte , rather than the clubs themselves , has become the vehicle of choice for headline income figures to be released .
United will provide more details of their results in due course , including data on large profits , but Chelsea are expected to remain conspicuously quiet this week about their own results .
A press conference and briefing , scheduled for Friday , has been indefinitely shelved , and it is understood that this is partly because of the sacking of Luiz Felipe Scolari .
His pay - off , of around £ 7.5 m , would not have been in the 2007 - 08 accounts but would have prompted embarrassing questions about Chelsea ’s huge and ongoing losses .
An annual loss of £ 74.8 m in 2006 - 07 on turnover of £ 190.5 m meant the club had posted cumulative losses of £ 384 m in four years .
Haemorrhaging of money at such levels has always heaped ridicule on the long - standing claims of Chelsea ’s chief executive , Peter Kenyon , that the club can break even by 2010 .
Yet further losses in the tens of millions are expected in the 2007 - 08 figures .
And combined with the latest change in manager and wobble in form ( and the financial ramifications of both ) any suggestions of financial self - sufficiency soon are hollow jokes , as , increasingly , are Kenyon and Roman Abramovich themselves .
As the Deloitte report points out , Chelsea ’s annual income growth of 12 per cent ( £ 22.4 m ) in 2007 - 08 was driven mainly by increased TV cash , “ but the club needs new successes with its match day and commercial revenues to deliver future growth and keep pace with its biggest European rivals . ”
The best league in the world is back .

I did make the drive up to Oregon once last year and it was nearly as brutal as the comic depicts .
I knew I could n’t survive driving back , so we flew and loved every minute of it .
For the record , Ray lives 930 miles from me , so flying is the only sane option .
Anyway , hope enough of you have played Oregon Trail at one point in your childhood / education .
I always loved the hunting minigame the most , but also got lots of enjoyment out of seeing loved ones drown or die of diseases I could n’t pronounce .
How did that pass as acceptable in elementary school , I wonder ?
After getting halfway into this one , I was worried it was the wrong comic to follow up Richard ’s with , but I think this one turned out well .
Apparently making really crappy - looking images is more difficult for me than my usual style .

Is Mexican Coca - Cola the real classic ?
Have a taste of the real thing – sugar , that is

Is Mexican Coca - Cola the “ real thing ” ?
That ’s been a persistent question since the Coca - Cola Co. changed its original formula in 1985 , replacing it with New Coke .
A few months later , after petitions and boycotts , the company acknowledged its blunder and re-marketed Coke made with the old formula .
They failed to mention , however , that Coca - Cola Classic , as it has been known since then , was n’t exactly the old formula , because it no longer contained cane sugar .
Instead it was sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
Regardless , sales skyrocketed and order was restored to the universe .
Now , decades later , iconic glass bottles of Coca - Cola sweetened with cane sugar have been appearing on store shelves around the U.S.
Ironically , this arguably more real version of the real thing happens to be made in Mexico , where soft - drink bottlers still use cane sugar .
The surge of popularity of Mexican Coca - Cola in the U.S. does n’t make the corporation happy , partly because of territorial rights , but more important , because cane sugar is a more expensive ingredient in this country than HFCS , thanks to tariffs and farm subsidies .
HFCS is cheaper because it comes from corn .
The sweetener is made in a complex process that uses enzymes to partially convert nearly pure glucose corn syrup into fructose ; the fructose is then recombined with glucose to create a high - fructose mixture of varying percentages , depending on the intended use .
The soft drink ingredient , for example , contains 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose .
Cane sugar , on the other hand , is sucrose , a disaccharide of glucose and fructose obtained from sugar cane , which is not widely grown in the U.S .
Manufacturers of cane sugar contend that it is a “ natural ” sweetener and HFCS is not .
The FDA has n’t yet determined what “ natural ” is .
However , the Center for Science in the Public Interest threatened a lawsuit against Cadbury Schweppes for claiming that 7 Up , which contains HFCS , was “ all natural ” — and the soft - drink manufacturer changed its label . .
Some scientists claim to have identified compounds in HFCS that lead to obesity and diabetes , and they are concerned by the genetically modified components in corn and in the enzymes used in the conversion process .
Other scientists counter that HFCS has exactly the same calories , component sugars and taste as cane sugar , and that there is no conclusive evidence that it is more harmful than any other sweetener .
“ The problem with high fructose corn syrup is that it does n’t taste as sweet as sucrose .
The tendency is to add more and more , ” says chef Rudolph Spiess , Baking and Pastry professor at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park , N.Y .
“ A little bit of HFCS is OK in the diet , but we just use too much of it .
It is in everything . ”
In fairness , it should be noted that excess consumption of cane sugar is n’t recommended by dietitians , doctors or dentists , either .
It may be the total of all the sugars we consumethat is causing the increase in diabetes and obesity in this country .
Health issues aside , what about the taste ?
Mart Martin , a spokesman for Coca - Cola ’s North American division in Atlanta , says there is “ not a perceivable taste difference ” between U.S. and Mexican Coca - Cola , according to the San Diego Union Tribune .
To find out , we conducted a blind tasting of Mexican and U.S. Coca - Cola with the help of the Culinary Institute of America in San Antonio .
Unmarked samples , both taken from glass bottles , were served to the students and faculty , who rated their relative sweetness and overall flavor .
Interestingly , people who had been raised in or near Mexico often instantly identified the Mexican Coca - Cola and universally preferred it , while those raised in the States preferred the U.S. - made Coca - Cola .
In other words , we tend to like what we ’re used to .
One thing that was n’t tested is how much influence the shape of the Mexican Coca - Cola bottle and the label might have on taste perception .
After all , nostalgia is a thirst for something sweet from the past .
Mexican Coca - Cola is available at Central Market and some Mexican restaurants and markets .

Teaching Creationism to Children
Taken from the book " Creation Activities for Kids " by Wayne Spencer
General Suggestions
Following are some excellent practical suggestions for teaching children about creation , evolution , and Genesis .
The ideas in this section come from the work of women very experienced teaching children about creation in both church and school settings .
The ideas here are based on various workshops conducted on how to teach creation .
Addressing creation and evolution can be a frightening subject .
Often , parents and children 's workers do n't know how to answer the creation - related questions asked by children .
Because evolution is accepted in our society and taught in public schools , this tends over a period of years to lead children away from faith in the Bible .
So , it is important to address creation versus evolution so that children understand that all of the Bible can be trusted and learn about God 's greatness as Creator .
It can be a great joy to do this with kids if some preparation is put into it and if a hands - on approach is used .
It does require a lot of planning .
A " hands - on approach " means using a variety of materials , crafts , and resources to give the children tangible things they can see and touch and do that will reinforce creation concepts .
As in any children 's ministry , music is very important .
In relation to creation , music serves to help kids appreciate the beauty and order that God made and worship Him in response to it .
People teaching creation to children do not have to be science experts .
Rather , they should be able to enjoy learning with the kids .
This can not be stressed too much .
It is OK if you have to say " I do n't know , I 'll have to look into that " in response to a child 's question .
Of course , the responsibility of teaching children should not be taken too lightly , but you cannot let it stop you that you are not an expert .
Rather , be willing to learn and let God use you .
So , in teaching kids about creation , let go , GET EXCITED , and enjoy yourself !
It is also best many times to use questions to lead kids in their thinking so that they can discover truths for themself rather than just listening .
It is necessary for the workers to have someone to go to answer their creation questions .
For this , perhaps a local creation organization can be consulted .
For any major event , such as a Vacation Bible School program centered around creation , preparation should begin about 3 months in advance .
The workers may themselves need to be taught about creation .
The workers need their questions answered first .
But , realistically , there is no way to have all the answers to all the questions , regardless of how much training you get or how much planning ahead your workers do .
Even the most knowledgable creationists in the world can only speculate and guess about many detailed questions .
But , there are certain things the Bible ( and the scientific evidence ) make very clear -- we must be clear on these things .
Anyone using this who would like help in locating the creation organization nearest them can contact Foundation Ministries for assistance .
The ideas in this section are best suited to special events such as Vacation Bible Schools , weekend conferences , or Day Camps .
However , many of them could be used in other children 's programs or in Sunday Schools just as well .
Using Learning Centers
A very effective way of teaching children is to arrange lessons and activities into centers in which the children move from one center to another , staying at each center for perhaps about 20 minutes .
Several centers can be set up and children can be rotated from center to center in groups .
It is good to have a " counselor " who can go with a certain group of children for an entire program , to build a relationship with the kids .
A fossils center could have some actual fossils for the kids to see and touch while they are taught about fossils and rapid burial of creatures by Noah 's Flood .
It is also important to have visual aids , posters , and hands - on activities at centers .
One or more centers could be some sort of craft , made relevant to Genesis or creation in some way .
Also , it is very important to incorporate scripture wherever possible and appropriate .
The Bible contains many things that speak to science or focus on who God is as Creator .
The children need things to do and look at while the leader or teacher explains some simple creation points .
For older children , a chart of the geologic column could be included as a way to explain evolution as it relates to rocks and the age of the earth .
Children can also dig in sand boxes for bones or plastic skeleton pieces while being taught about fossils and what paleontologists do .
Live animals are always winners with kids , and make great centers .
But , to relate them to spiritual lessons and creation , the adults or teacher / s at the center should relate the animals to the creation days , the question of how much living things can change , our responsibility to care for animals ( Genesis 1:26 ) , or intelligent design .
God 's goodness and creativity are shown by how animals are so well suited to their particular way of life .
Sometimes it is very effective to put children in pairs with an older child going with a younger child , teaching and helping them .
Vocabulary and Identifying Creation and Evolution
It is very important to teach kids how to recognize creation and evolution terms and help them be able to recognize the differences between the two when they look at a book , for instance .
One very good system is to use different colored stickers for books to help kids know the difference between a creation book and an evolution book .
Pat McCombs , who has worked with many children in both churches and public schools , uses green stickers on creation dinosaur books , red stickers on evolution dinosaur books , and yellow on books that are " just for fun " that do n't deal with origins very much but are fun or valuable in general .
Terms like " millions of years , " " descended from ... , " or " ape - men " usually refer to evolution .
Children do not recognize that these mean evolution unless they are taught so .
Also , terms from evolutionary science may not mean the same thing as they do when used by creationists .
The biological classification term " species , " does not mean the same thing as " kind " as in Genesis 1 .
Involving the Parents
It is safe to assume that the parents will not know what the children are being taught about creation , in almost all cases .
Thus , it is necessary to get the parents involved in some way .
Sending some handouts home prepared specifically for the parents can be valuable .
Parents should be told where they can obtain creation materials .
Many creation organizations operate lending libraries of videos and books , for instance , for check out .
Wayne Spencer at Foundation Ministries can help in locating these sort of resources .
Another wonderful way to get parents involved is to provide a time when the parents can go through the learning centers or activities with their kids .
In this , it is amazing how much the children will teach their parents !
Making it Age - Level Appropriate
Two main objectives of teaching children about creation are 1 ) to help them visualize what the world was like at the time of creation and the Flood , and 2 ) to get them to associate things and animals we have today with the creation days and therebye learn about the creation days .
Before beginning to teach them anything , it can be helpful sometimes to do something to show you what their concept is about creation , dinosaurs , and the world as it was in the beginning .
Younger children can be told to draw a dinosaur and show the kind of area it lived in .
Older children can be told to write out some answers to some questions .
You want to find out , in this , if they put people and dinosaurs together , if dinosaurs are portrayed as mean and dangerous , whether they lived in a jungle or near water , etc .
This can be done again at the end of your program after all the lessons .
Many things can be done to help them visualize and imagine what the earth was like at creation , what Noah 's Ark looked like , or what the Flood was like .
For instance , it is very enlightening to children and parents alike to measure off the actual size of Noah 's Ark in a field and go walk around the perimeter of it .
( See other information about making a scale model of the Ark in this book . )
You may be able to find a building or telephone pole or something in your area that is approximately the same height as the Ark ; this can be pointed out to the kids .
You can also divide the kids into 3 groups and have each group plan out where they would put everything on Noah 's Ark in its three decks .
Large long sheets of paper are good for this .
For young children , the emphasis is on imagining things at the beginning , learning about what Genesis teaches , and seeing God 's power , goodness , and creativity .
More detailed questions like " Are the Genesis 1 days literal days ? " , or " What about ape - men ? " are not appropriate for very young children .
Middle school - aged kids , or high schoolers , on the other hand , will have these type of questions .
However , young children can have some tough questions , which you must answer as best you can .
But young children have not yet heard much about evolution and have not learned what it means .
Thus , young children should be learning what the Bible teaches and as they learn about all God made , they should learn to see what nature teaches us about God himself .
One common question related to the origin of living things can be very difficult to answer at the level of young children .
That is the issue of how do the many races of people come about ; or , it can be put in terms of animals -- how do the many types of dogs we see come about from only one pair or a few pairs of dogs ?
This is actually a rather complex matter from the science of genetics , but it can be related to kids to some extent .
When God created Adam and Eve , he made them with the ability to have descendants of all possible races and varieties of physical characteristics .
They had this ability from having a combination of genes in their chromosomes that was sort of " neutral " or not specialized .
This is why they probably had a sort of brown or intermediate complection .
Kids do n't know about genes and chromosomes , so it 's probably best not to even try to really get into genetics information like that unless you deal with high school kids who have had biology .
God created unchanging " kinds " but he did not create living things so that they are totally static and cannot change at all .
All living things , including plants , animals , and even humans are able to change to a limited degree to adapt to the environment they live in .
Thus , the first people to live on the continent of Africa were not necessarily black in skin color , but they carried genes that allowed for that possibility .
Over time , those who had dark skin had an advantage in that climate so dark skinned people became most prevalent .
Other factors enter into this issue , but the important thing is that God 's word says each living thing " multiplied after its kind . "
God has built into living cells mechanisms that prevent a creature from becoming something really different .
There are even mechanisms designed into cells that correct mutations before they can be copied !
All this fits right in with Genesis .
Creation books can help answer many of the questions that are asked .

More than 130,000 inflatable breasts have been lost at sea en route to Australia .
Men 's magazine Ralph was planning to include the boobs as a free gift with its January issue .
The cargo is worth about $ 200,000 , which is another blow for publisher ACP 's parent company PBL , which is already in $ 4.3 billion of debt .
A spokeswoman for Ralph said the container left docks in Beijing two weeks ago but turned up empty in Sydney this week .
The magazine has put out an alert to shipping authorities to see if they have the container , but if they do n't turn up in the next 48 hours it will be too late for the next issue , she said .

NEARLY everything you ’ve been led to believe about Gaza is wrong .
Below are a few essential points that seem to be missing from the conversation , much of which has taken place in the press , about Israel ’s attack on the Gaza Strip .
THE GAZANS
Most of the people living in Gaza are not there by choice .
The majority of the 1.5 million people crammed into the roughly 140 square miles of the Gaza Strip belong to families that came from towns and villages outside Gaza like Ashkelon and Beersheba .
They were driven to Gaza by the Israeli Army in 1948 .
THE OCCUPATION
The Gazans have lived under Israeli occupation since the Six - Day War in 1967 .
Israel is still widely considered to be an occupying power , even though it removed its troops and settlers from the strip in 2005 .
Israel still controls access to the area , imports and exports , and the movement of people in and out .
Israel has control over Gaza ’s air space and sea coast , and its forces enter the area at will .
As the occupying power , Israel has the responsibility under the Fourth Geneva Convention to see to the welfare of the civilian population of the Gaza Strip .

THE BLOCKADE Israel ’s blockade of the strip , with the support of the United States and the European Union , has grown increasingly stringent since Hamas won the Palestinian Legislative Council elections in January 2006 .
Fuel , electricity , imports , exports and the movement of people in and out of the Strip have been slowly choked off , leading to life - threatening problems of sanitation , health , water supply and transportation .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California ’s gay marriage ban could open the door to legal discrimination against unpopular groups if the state Supreme Court allows the voter - approved measure to stand , blacks , Latinos , Asians and other minorities said .

The November 4 vote , supporting an end to legal same - sex marriage in the most populous U.S. state , has caused a nationwide furor as opponents of the measure decry what they consider a civil rights violation .
California ’s highest court agreed on November 19 to hear a challenge , based on whether the state constitution requires support from the legislature -- as well as a majority vote of the people -- to strip rights from any group .
The court had recognized such marriages in May , and about 20,000 same - sex couples wed before the November vote .
Those marriages may now hang in the balance .
Connecticut and Massachusetts are the only states that allow gay marriage .
Legal scholars say the measure , which defines marriage as between a man and a woman , breaks new ground by limiting the courts ’ ability to protect minorities .
“ They could take away any right from any group , ” said University of Southern California Law Professor David Cruz , who filed a brief in favor of gay marriage in an earlier case .
EQUAL PROTECTION ‘SUBVERSION ’
The ban , California Proposition 8 , amended the constitution with 52 percent support -- less than is required to approve some state bond measures .
“ The entire purpose behind the constitutional principle of equal protection would be subverted if the constitutional protection of unpopular minorities were subject to simple majority rule , ” read a brief by black , Asian and Hispanic groups challenging the ban .
“ This case is not simply about gay and lesbian equality . ”

It is unlikely that relatively liberal California would approve restrictions on racial and religious minorities , especially ones that clash with the protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution , Cruz and others say .
“ We are past that as a realistic matter .
We just elected an African - American president , for Christ ’s sake , ” said University of California , Berkeley , law professor Jesse Choper , who also filed on behalf of gay advocates in the original gay marriage case .
Other groups -- from prisoners to undocumented workers -- might not have public opinion on their side .
“ The history of California demonstrates with sobering clarity the potential for disfavored minorities to be subjected to oppression by hostile majorities , ” the minority groups say in their brief , pointing to segregation laws and one excluding Asian - Americans from land ownership as examples .
‘ TRACK RECORD ’
“ It is not hypothetical .
It ’s a track record , ” said Stanford University law professor Jane Schacter , who has not filed briefs in the case .
Indeed , a central argument in support of the gay marriage ban is that majority - vote constitutional amendments can change rights .
“ That power is broad and deep and , by nature , populist .
It has often been used to be make significant changes in state government and to override judicial interpretations of the Constitution with which the people disagree -- including interpretations involving basic constitutional rights , ” lawyer Andrew Pugno argued in court papers .
He also argued that defining marriage as between a man and a woman simply re-established the situation before the court recognized gay marriage in May .
The California high court could hear arguments in March .
Berkeley ’s Choper says it will be an uphill battle to persuade the judges that the measure requires legislative action .
Choper said he understands why the groups are fighting the ban and he is sympathetic , “ but that ’s not the way the system works . ”
Pico Satellite Swarms
Swarms of ' pico satellites ' smaller than a softball are being designed to work as teams .
A group small satellites , which each cost about $ 100,000 to build , could complement and expand the features of large satellites that are much more expensive .
A swarm of small satellites could perform activities that large satellites could not ; for example , they could take multiple , distributed measurements of weather phenomena or the Earth 's magnetic field .
A prototype of a pico satellite is shown below .
The finished satellites will be about the size of a softball , and are scheduled to launch in 2009 .
This research project is headed by Norman Fitz - Coy , an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Auburn University .
The pico satellites are capable flying in formation dynamically .
These small satellites , able to maneuver autonomously and fly in formation , remind me of the buzz droids shown in Star Wars : Revenge of the Sith .

Stephenie Meyer dreamed up Edward Cullen , a vegetarian vampire who sports a beige jacket and poloneck , while Stephen King gave us Kurt Barlow , the ancient master vampire who wreaks havoc on the town of ' Salem 's Lot .
The two bestselling authors were never going to see eye to eye over their portrayal of bloodsuckers , but this week King went so far as to rubbish Meyer 's writing abilities in an interview .
King compared the Mormon author to JK Rowling , saying that both authors were " speaking directly to young people " .
" The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn .
She 's not very good , " he told an interviewer from USA Weekend .
King also drew a comparison between Meyer and Perry Mason mystery writer Erle Stanley Gardner .
" He was a terrible writer , too , but he was very successful , " he said , going on to criticise prolific thriller author James Patterson - " a terrible writer but he 's very successful " - and fellow horror author Dean Koontz , who although he " can write like hell " , is sometimes " just awful " .
Meyer 's quartet of books - Twilight , New Moon , Eclipse and Breaking Dawn - trace the love story between ordinary girl Bella and vampire Edward , throwing in a pack of werewolves , a coven of vampire royalty and a vampire baby for good measure .
They have sold millions of copies worldwide , with sales receiving a huge boost from the film of the first book , Twilight , which was released late last year .
King went on to say that it was " very clear " Meyer was " opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books " .
He told USA Weekend : " It 's exciting and it 's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because they 're not overtly sexual .
A lot of the physical side of it is conveyed in things like the vampire will touch her forearm or run a hand over skin , and she just flushes all hot and cold .
And for girls , that 's a shorthand for all the feelings that they 're not ready to deal with yet . "
Meyer 's fans have rushed to her defence .
" Steven [ sic ]
King does n't know what a real book was if it hit him in the face .
He 's just a bloody guy who is jealous of Edward 's good looks , " wrote poster Kiki Alice Cullen .
" King is no Gabriel Garcia Marquez so I do n't understand why he gets to say who is a good writer and who is not , " agreed another , while a third , who wished she could " just hit this guy " , suggested that " we twilighters should send him tons of hate mail ... just to show him how many twilight fans he just pissed off .

Being anxious to be called Scrooge and worse , and not having enough e-mails that criticize me in every which way , I bring you a page or two of , I hope , truthful observations on a verboten subject : pay cuts .
If pay cuts sound too cruel , let us call them pay reductions .
I no longer work for a living .
I was a salaried employee at a public university or two .
I have not been a wage - earner .
I have never experienced wage reductions .
I am not living hand - to - mouth or in poverty .
Readers who demand certain solidarity qualifications from me may stop reading at this point .
For approximately 18 years of my adult life , my income was very small .
Budgeting and economizing were habitual and pervasive .
This extended , among other things , to eating liver rather than steak , walking instead of driving , and having roommates .
After getting a decent paying job , I experienced significant wealth losses , tantamount to pay cuts , due to unanticipated inflation , taxation , and tax increases .
I exacerbated this by being silly enough to save .
I also failed to take on debt that was tax - deductible and that I could have paid off with cheaper dollars .
None of this qualifies me either to speak on the politically incorrect subject of wage cuts .
Salary and wage cuts are a politically incorrect subject in America because they are inconsistent with the reigning orthodoxy of Keynesianism and worship of government solutions .
In a world with downward flexible wages and salaries , the unemployment that occurs in a depression is brought to an end more quickly .
It is when wages and salary reductions become off - limits and are kept high that the unemployment is prolonged .
The anti-pay cut attitude is intentional among statist economists .
It opens the door to the Keynesian " solution " of inflation and government spending , which is what they support .
In a depression , prices of goods decline .
They cannot be produced profitably unless costs also decline , and labor costs are the largest part of costs of many goods .
Asking too high a price for one ’s labor puts one out of work .
After a while , the unemployed accept lower pay anyway in order to get work .
Many unemployed end up finding new and different jobs at lower pay .
If they had stayed at their old jobs for which they were trained and in which they had skills , and accepted lower pay , they often would have been better off .
Pay cuts are not a norm in our society .
They are frowned on .
Executives are reluctant to institute them .
Those who are paid for their labor resist them mightily .
The public is taught to resist pay cuts and support those who resist them .
We should change these attitudes .
We are hurting ourselves .
These ideas play into the hands of big government .
The government becomes bigger and more intrusive by discouraging wage cuts , supporting labor in its resistance to wage cuts , and promising an inflationary remedy to unemployment .
It gets to spend what are now trillions .
This " remedy " worsens the economy .
If it works at all , it works very badly .
Economist W. H. Hutt explains this in great detail in The Keynesian Episode .
A week or two ago , a bullish development occurred .
It went little - noticed or remarked .
It was that Korea was embarking on pay cuts of about 20 percent .
This , it seemed to me , was very good news .
This will speed the end to the depression in Korea .
Somewhere in the world there was some enlightenment .
When people keep working , even at a reduced pay , they produce product in demand .
The worth of this product , which is shared by the factors of production that include labor and capital , provides the wherewithal to buy the production of others .
The true and sustainable and non-inflationary source of demand for the goods of others is one ’s own production .
And since there is a multitude of goods in any economy whose prices are in constant adjustment to one another , these kinds of demands are in tune with consumer wants .
They involve a minimum of waste and a maximum of satisfaction of wants .
By contrast , the Keynesian answer , which is a government attempt to stimulate the economy , to the extent that it works at all , is unsustainable , inflationary , wasteful , and not focused on consumer wants .
Throwing money at public projects does not resolve the specific dis-coordination and specific mal - investments of the prior boom .
It results in some people making more money who service these projects , while many others end up employed at lower - paying jobs .
It ends up with a larger and less efficient government sector with taxes permanently higher .
The Keynesian answer , which is general inflation , supports unions , especially those with cost - of - living protection .
It helps public sector unions that deal with cronies in government .
It hurts non-union labor .
It hurts the general public .
It hurts the economy as a whole .
And it produces all the many pernicious effects of inflation .
The price system in free markets works for the general betterment .
The price system works even better and even faster if pay falls when the situation calls for lower pay .
In that case , the economy will come out of the depression faster .
This means that real incomes can increase at a faster pace .
The U.S. economy could get past the slow and anemic recoveries that it has been experiencing in which unemployment and under - employment drag on for years on end .
If the federal and state governments really wanted to spur the economy , they could hold out for salary and wage cuts of their employees along with concomitant tax rebates .
There is no doubt that governments should be cutting their costs too .
When government employees , who are already overpaid , keep getting the same pay , it means that taxes remain as high as ever .
The tax burden goes up relative to private income .
Those taxes increase the discouragement of work and effort in the private economy .
They raise unemployment .
We are seeing salary and wage cuts in the U.S. and this is a good thing .
They will speed the end of the depression .
There is news of reductions in the states of Michigan and New York .
There is news at a number of specific companies and other organizations such as hospitals and symphonies .
There are pay cuts occurring in Estonia .
The cuts are 10 to 20 percent .
I am certain that a complete search will turn up many more cases .
In the article on Estonia , one executive says the following :
" At times I do n’t understand what ’s the fuss around the salary cuts .
It ’s normal that salaries rise when the economy is doing well .
It ’s normal that currently , when the economy is doing bad , salaries fall .
I think that those companies , which do so , want to be effective . "
This is a down - to - earth and sensible way of looking at it .
In bad times when prices fall , the price of labor has to fall too , or else the unemployment will go on and on .
If pay reductions in these times are a good idea , as they are , then resistance to them is a bad idea .
Beware rationalizations of holding pay where it is and fighting pay cuts .
That is counterproductive .
A prime example is before Congress today .
The Senate is voting on an amendment proposed by Senator Vitter
" … that would require members to vote publicly on their annual pay increases instead of the current system that lets it kick in automatically .
While it may seem like a political no - brainer , if the amendment passes and changes the underlying bill , Democratic leaders have suggested they ’d pull the bill from the floor .
u2018 This system of automatic , auto - pilot pay raise really is offensive to the American people , ’ Vitter said in a speech on the Senate floor .
u2018 There never has to be any inconvenient debate , any inconvenient votes whatsoever .
They just happen automatically , no votes . ’ "
Government , which should serve people , instead rules people and serves the interest of the rulers .
In this time of economic distress , the Senate should be leading the way by cutting its own pay .
If by maintaining their high pay and pensions , we , their supposed employers , saw fit to lay them off permanently , that would be even better .
However , we have yet to gain control over them or our government .

SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) - A prominent fashion designer has sparked outrage in Chile by dressing up models like the Virgin Mary -- in some cases with ample , near - naked breasts .
The Roman Catholic Church condemned Ricardo Oyarzun ’s plans for a show featuring the models , and a conservative group tried unsuccessfully to block it in court .
Oyarzun said he had received telephone threats and had excrement smeared on his doorstep .
“ There is no pornography here , there ’s no sex , there are no virgins menstruating or feeling each other up , ” Oyarzun said ahead of the catwalk show set to be held at a Santiago nightclub later on Thursday .
“ This is artistic expression . ”
He said his designs -- which include halos , look as though they come from a nativity scene and include religious icons -- were inspired by the Virgin Mary but not intended to represent her .
“ We look on with special pain and deplore those acts which seek to tarnish manifestations of sincere love toward the Virgin Mary , which end up striking at the dignity of womankind by presenting her as an object of consumption , ” Chile ’s Episcopal Conference , which includes Catholic bishops , said in a statement .
The show is more evidence that Chile , heavily influenced by the church for decades , is shaking off its reputation as one of the most socially conservative countries in Latin America .
We ’ve updated this guide with the new privacy settings just launched by Facebook .
You can get the new Facebook privacy guide now .
Everyday I receive an email from somebody about how their account was hacked , how a friend tagged them in the photo and they want a way to avoid it , as well as a number of other complications related to their privacy on Facebook .
Over the weekend one individual contacted me to let me know that he would be removing me as a friend from Facebook because he was “ going to make a shift with my Facebook use – going to just mostly family stuff . ”
Perhaps he was tired of receiving my status updates or perhaps he did n’t want me to view photos from his personal life .
Whatever the reason for ending our Facebook friendship , I figured that many people would benefit from a thorough overview on how to protect your privacy on Facebook .
Below is a step by step process for protecting your privacy .
[ likebox text = ’Become a fan of All Facebook to stay up to date on the latest Facebook privacy changes . ’]
1. Use Your Friend Lists
I ca n’t tell you how many people are not aware of their friend lists .
For those not aware of what friend lists are , Facebook describes them as a feature which allows “ you to create private groupings of friends based on your personal preferences .
For example , you can create a Friend List for your friends that meet for weekly book club meetings .
You can create Friend Lists for all of your organizational needs , allowing you to quickly view friends by type and send messages to your lists . ”
There are a few very important things to remember about friend lists :
You can add each friend to more than one friend group
Friend groups should be used like “ tags ” as used elsewhere around the web
Friend Lists can have specific privacy policies applied to them
I ’ll touch on each of the things listed above in more detail later .
A typical setup for groups would be “ Friends ” , “ Family ” , and “ Professional ” .
These three groups can then be used to apply different privacy policies .
For example , you may want your friends to see photos from the party you were at last night , but you do n’t want your family or professional contacts to see those photos .
Using friend lists is also extremely useful for organizing your friends if you have a lot of them .
For instance I have about 20 friend lists and I categorize people by city ( New York , San Francisco , D.C. , Tel Aviv , etc ) , where I met them ( conferences , past co-workers , through this blog ) , and my relationship with them ( professional , family , social , etc ) .
You can configure your friend lists by visiting the friends area of your Facebook .
2. Remove Yourself From Facebook Search Results
My mom is a teacher and one of the first things she asked me when she joined Facebook is how she could make sure her students could n’t see that she was on the site .
Understandably my mom does n’t want her middle school students to know what she ’s up to in her personal life .
There are numerous reasons that individuals do n’t want their information to show up in search results on Facebook , and it ’s simple to turn off your public visibility .
How to Remove Yourself From Facebook Search Results
Now that you ’ve decided that you would like to remove yourself from Facebook ’s search results , here ’s how to do it :
Visit your search privacy settings page Under “ Search Visibility ” select “ Only Friends ” ( Remember , doing so will remove you from Facebook search results , so make sure you want to be removed totally .
Otherwise , you can select another group , such as “ My Networks and Friends ” which I believe is the default . )
Click “ Save Changes ”
By default , Facebook makes your presence visible to the network you are in .
Frequently , people are n’t aware of their visibility , so this is one of the first settings that users wish to modify .
By selecting “ Customize ” from the search visibility drop down you can make your settings even more granular .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli shelling killed more than 40 Palestinians on Tuesday at a U.N. school where civilians had taken shelter , medical officials said , in carnage likely to boost international pressure on Israel to halt a Gaza offensive .

The Israeli army accused Hamas of using civilians as “ human shields ” and said its troops had fired mortars at the premises after gunmen mortared their positions from inside al - Fakhora school in Jabalya refugee camp .
Citing intelligence reports , it named two men it said were Islamist gunmen killed in the attack .
A spokesman said the army did not know how many others died .
People cut down by shrapnel lay in pools of blood in the street .
Witnesses said two shells exploded outside the school , killing at least 42 civilians and wounding dozens among people who had taken refuge there and residents of nearby buildings .
Within hours , Egypt , backed by France and other European powers , proposed an immediate ceasefire and talks that could address Israel ’s demands that Hamas be starved of rockets and other weapons smuggled over the Egyptian border .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French President Nicolas Sarkozy made the move at a joint news conference .
There was no immediate response from Israel or from Hamas .
As bitter combat on the ground went into a fourth day after a week - long aerial bombardment , the bloodshed took Palestinian deaths in 11 days of violence to over 600 .
They also prompted U.S. President - elect Barack Obama to break his silence on the offensive , to say the loss of life among civilians was “ a source of deep concern ” for him .
As momentum gathered behind a European truce plan that could starve Hamas of arms , the outgoing Bush administration said it wanted an “ immediate ceasefire . ”
But it stressed conditions that have characterized the distance between the United States , Israel ’s close ally , and European and Arab demands for an instant halt to the offensive .
Obama , who takes over from George W. Bush on January 20 , said he would not engage in policy until he was in office but vowed to work rapidly thereafter to secure peace in the Middle East .
Some commentators have said the U.S. presidential transition has exposed the United States to greater risks from Israel ’s action in Gaza .
Al Qaeda second - in - command Ayman al - Zawahri called on the Internet for Muslims to “ hit the interests of the Zionists and Crusaders wherever and in whichever way you can . ”
Washington ’s allies in Arab governments have condemned the Israeli assault , which has contributed to rising oil prices , and the always vocally anti-American Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , another OPEC member , called it a “ Holocaust . ”
COMBAT
A fourth day of a ground assault , launched after a week of air strikes , still failed to end Hamas rocket salvoes , which again caused damage and some injury in southern Israel .
Families huddled for shelter in homes and schools , where classes have been halted , and explosions and gunfire crashed and rattled along the 40 - km strip of Mediterranean coast all day .
A senior U.N. official in Gaza said 350 people had been sheltering at the Fakhora school and the United Nations regularly gave the Israeli army exact geographical coordinates of its facilities to try to keep them safe from attack .
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said : “ Unfortunately , ( Hamas fighters ) are hiding amongst civilians . ”
She added that Israel was trying to avoid civilian casualties .
The army ’s chief spokesman said : “ Hamas and its senior commanders are turning their citizens into bulletproof vests for their personal use . ”
His office released video which it said showed gunmen firing from another U.N. school in Gaza in 2007 .
The deaths in Gaza , home to 1.5 million , raised to 77 the number of Palestinian civilians killed on Tuesday , medics said .
The spike in civilian casualties could prove to be a turning point in Israel ’s “ Operation Cast Lead , ” launched on December 27 with the declared aim of removing the Hamas rocket threat .

The killing of 28 unarmed Lebanese in Israeli bombing in the village of Qana in the 2006 Lebanon war drained foreign support for its campaign against Hezbollah guerrillas .
PEACE EFFORTS
International efforts already under way to end the fighting have focused on securing a deal that would meet Israel ’s demand that Hamas , an Islamist group elected in 2006 and now in sole charge of the Gaza Strip , could not rearm once hostilities end .
“ If there is an end to terror , an end to the smuggling of ammunition from Sinai to Gaza , the Israeli fighting will stop , ” Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said , referring to arms Hamas obtains through tunnels under the Gaza - Egypt border .
In fighting on Tuesday , Israeli forces pushed into the southern town of Khan Younis and battled Hamas militants on the outskirts of the city of Gaza .
According to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip , at least 631 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,700 wounded since Israel began its offensive .
Ten Israelis , including three civilians hit by rocket fire , have been killed in the conflict .
At least five rockets landed in Israel on Tuesday , including one that hit the town of Gadera , 28 km ( 17 miles ) from Tel Aviv .
A three - month - old baby was hurt .
In Gaza , an infant of similar age was among children killed .
A senior Israeli official , speaking before Sarkozy and Mubarak ’s statements , were pursuing “ a serious initiative ” for a ceasefire .
Talks were focusing , the official said , on the size of an “ international presence ” along the Gaza - Egypt border .
Tony Blair , the Middle East envoy of major powers sponsoring Israeli - Palestinian peace talks , said Sarkozy , the European Union and the United States were all in agreement that new anti-smuggling measures would be needed to clinch a ceasefire .
Hamas , which has rebuffed Western demands to recognize Israel , end violence and accept existing interim peace deals , has demanded a lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip in any future ceasefire .
It seized the territory in 2007 , 18 months after it won a Palestinian parliamentary election .
Most of the deaths reported by Gaza hospitals in recent days have been civilians .
The Israeli military said it killed 130 militants since it began the ground assault , a figure that suggested the total Palestinian death toll might be close to 750 and that bodies could still be on the battlefield .
Many of the Gaza Strip ’s 1.5 million people lack food , water or power .
In southern Israel , schools remained closed and hundreds of thousands of people have been rushing to shelter at the sound of alarms heralding incoming rockets .
Norway ’s government has decided to raise a Nazi submarine that sank off its shores in the North Sea during World War II because it contains a massive quantity of mercury .
The U - 864 German sub was hit by torpedoes from the British submarine HMS Venturer as it tried to get to Japan with its cargo in 1945 .
The Norwegian government wants to remove the sub because it is an obvious environmental hazard .
“ The fact that the wreck contains about 67 tons of mercury poses a significant threat to the environment , ” Norwegian Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs Helga Pedersen told AFP .
“ We took this decision out of concern for the environment , the fishermen and the local population , ” she added .
In addition to the mercury that was destined to be turned into weapons in Japan , the sub was carrying blueprints for a new class of German jet fighter , the Messerschmitt Me 262 .
When the Nazi sub was sank , the vessel broke in two pieces killing all 73 sailors on board .
The sub now lies two nautical miles off Fedje Island at a depth of 150 metres .
The sub was located in 2003 , and was discovered to have been leaking several kilograms of mercury per year .
This will eventually be an ecological disaster , so Norway will remove the sub in 2010 at an estimated cost of one billion kroner .
The same outfit that lifted the Russian Kursk submarine will handle this operation .
Yep .
You heard correctly .

I have mentioned a few times that BDSM need not be expensive , that a trip to the local dollar store or the hard ware store can be exciting and fun , your imagination is the limit you place on what can be used and what can not be , and if you are practical then the possibilities are endless .
One of the things I keep mentioning is clothes pegs , these cheap and versatile tools carry a multitude of uses and the cheaper ones are perfect for beginners to BDSM as their springs are not as tight , I have found the wood ones better as a started and then the plastic ones for those more used to this type of play .
A trip to an office supply store will find you with ‘ bulldog clips ’ or ‘ office clip ’ and even a trip to the dry cleaners can provide you with the hangers from your neatly pressed pants which can be used as well .
The only limit to your enjoyment is your imagination and your sub or slaves pain threshold , so while taking care to make sure that your sub / slave is comfortable with what you are doing , experiment , start with the pegs and see where it takes you both , but above all have fun whilst you play .

A TRANSSEXUAL , angry at an NHS advertising campaign that depicts a man wearing makeup , says her lifestyle has been exploited for the sake of a poster .
Lucy Smith thinks the NHS should have been more sensitive to the transsexual community in Warrington when it developed a poster warning women drinkers they could end up looking like men .
“ It ’s hard enough living in Warrington without this , ” said Lucy , a pre-op male to female transsexual .
“ People see the posters on the bus and it draws attention to me sat there .
I walk down the street and everyone ’s looking or shouting , ” she said .
Transsexuality is recognised as a medical condition , and the NHS pays for transgender operations .
That NHS Warrington would put up the posters while knowing about the problems transsexuals face has upset Lucy and her friends in the transsexual community .
Not a day goes by without a violent incident or abusive comments towards Lucy , aged 23 , and the posters have only brought transsexuality to the forefront of people ’s minds , she said .
“ They have these pictures that stand out a mile and people will see it and start pointing and making comments and laughing , ” she said .
The posters were brought in as part of a hard - hitting campaign to lower excessive drinking levels in women .
Warrington is one of the worst towns in the country for the high level of women who drink too much , and research has shown that excessive drinking can introduce male characteristics to women .
The person on the poster is fictional , made up of different images that were merged together by an artist , a spokesman for NHS Warrington said .
NHS Warrington sent the poster to national equality and diversity groups and consulted with the national lead for the transgender community , the spokesman said .
The groups did not find any reason for NHS Warrington not to use the posters .
Similar campaigns used elsewhere in the country have been successful in reducing harmful drinking levels in women , the spokesman added .
Lucy has asked both NHS Warrington and Warrington Borough Transport to remove the posters , but was told the campaign had been effective and would not be removed .
Transsexual men and women want to establish a permanent role as a member of the opposite sex , and many have gender reassignment surgery to complete this .
This transition can take years .
But now Telstra and Internode have said they would not take part in the trials .
iiNet has said it would take part only to prove to the Government that its plan would not work , while Optus will test a heavily cut - down filtering model .
The Government plans to introduce a two - tiered censorship system of filtering from the ISPs ' end .
The first tier would be compulsory for all Australians and would block all " illegal material " , as determined by a blacklist of 10,000 sites administered by ACMA .
The second tier , which is optional , would filter out content deemed inappropriate for children , such as pornography .
Experts say this second tier will have the most marked effect on network performance because every piece of traffic handled by the ISP will need to be analysed for " inappropriate " content .
Optus confirmed it would start a live pilot early next year but stressed it would test only the first tier and even then it would only block the current ACMA blacklist of 1300 URLs , as opposed to the Government 's expanded 10,000 URL list .
Details are scant but the trial will operate in a specific geographical area and customers will be given the option to opt out .
Senator Conroy 's office could not explain why it was telling people that the trials would not involve actual customers , which would give little indication of the real - world impact of the filtering plan .
Senator Conroy himself has consistently dodged questions about his policy in Parliament .
" How on earth could you conduct a ' live ' trial if there are no customers to assess ? "
Opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin said .
" The minister also continues to be deliberately vague and cryptic about the definition of unwanted content and now he is unable to clarify how this so - called live trial will be conducted , even though he wants it to start before December 24 . "
The Greens today called on the Government to abandon its internet filtering trial , saying it was flawed and doomed to failure .
The plan is opposed by the Greens , Opposition , the internet industry , some child welfare advocates , consumers and online rights groups .
They fear the blacklist will be expanded to include the blocking of regular pornography , political views , gambling and pro-abortion sites .
" This trial is simply all show .
It wo n't give any meaningful indication of how mandatory internet filtering would work in practice , " Senator Ludlam said .
Colin Jacobs , vice - chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia , said yesterday 's incident in Britain , in which virtually the entire country was unable to edit Wikipedia because the country 's Internet Watch Foundation had blacklisted a single image on the site , illustrated the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering .
Senator Conroy has said that , under his filtering plan , Australia would sign up to the same IWF blacklist .
" In Australia , not only would the Government have the ability to secretly add any site to our blacklist , but an unaccountable foreign - based organisation would as well , " Mr Jacobs said .
" Given that the traffickers of genuine abuse material will not let themselves be slowed down by a filter and are already covering their tracks , the net result that will be achieved here is exactly this : inconvenience , chaos and expense with absolutely no dividend for the children . "
Senator Ludlam said in a phone interview he believed Labor would drop the mandatory filtering policy in the new year once the now scaled - back trials were completed .
He said the Government could not abandon it now " without losing significant political face " .
This Saturday anti-censorship protesters are planning to picket in Australia 's capital cities , including Sydney 's Town Hall and Melbourne 's State Library .
It has now been 12 days since Israel began its bombardment of the Gaza Strip .
On January 3rd , the Israeli Defense Force ground troops began entering Gaza , soon cutting the territory in half .
Israel 's stated goals are to end rocket attacks originating from Gaza - which had increased sharply following the end of a cease - fire agreement in December .
As Israeli troops began entering Gaza , foreign reporters and photographers were denied entry to the territory by Israel , halting any reports originating from Gaza except those coming from Palestinians .
As of today , since the beginning of this campaign , there have reportedly been over 650 deaths in Gaza , and 10 Israelis killed , including 7 soldiers .
Israel suspended operations for a few hours today , to allow humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza .
Officials from France , Egypt and Turkey are working with Israel and the Palestinians to draw up a cease - fire plan , but many details still remain unresolved .

Development / Computer - related Content .
Not much else to say , really .
This is the third part in a series of posts for non-experts about setting up an Ioke development environment on Linux .
Please see the previous posts to start at the beginning :
The emacs - starter - kit is a set of base configuration for Emacs .
It contains a number of useful elisp libraries , with a slight focus on dynamic languages .
To install it , perform the following steps ( note that we move any existing Emacs configuration out of the way first to avoid stomping what you currently have ) :
~/work/emacs$ cd ~$ mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.old ~$ mv .emacsrc .emacsrc.old ~$ git clone git://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit.git .emacs.d
If you now start Emacs again you ’ll see that the menu bar and the toolbar is gone .
This is the default in emacs - starter - kit as most Emacs users do n’t find them useful .
For new users the menu bar can sometimes come in handy , to get it back temporarily , just press F1 .
Configuring Emacs
If you want to add your own customizations to Emacs when using emacs - starter - kit , just add an Emacs LISP file called username.el , or hostname.el , in the ~/.emacs.d directory .
For instance , to make the menu bar always visible :
Open Emacs , if it ’s not open already .
Press C-x C-f and type in : ~/.emacs.d/username.el
Where username is the name you log in with ( for instance , in my case the complete filename is melwin.el ) .
Type in the following in the file : ( menu - bar - mode 1 ) And save the file with C-x s .
Now quit ( C- x c ) and restart and you ’ll see that the menu bar is shown .
Working with Magit
emacs - starter - kit includes , among many other things , the very nice Magit Git mode for Emacs , which gives you a nice interface for working with a Git repository .
Let ’s use this mode to commit our recent changes to the configuration file to our local clone of the emacs - starter - kit repository .
This helps us track changes we make and also makes a backup of the file in case we screw ( sorry , mess ) something up .
Note 1 : To move easily between Emacs windows using the keyboard , just press Shift and the arrow key pointing in the direction you want to move .
Note 2 : To only show the current Emacs window - press : C-x 1
Inside Emacs , press `C - x g` to run `magit - status` and enter the directory ( note that ` Tab` auto - completes ) : `~/.emacs.d`
Put the cursor over the `username.el` in the list of ` Untracked files` .
Press `s` to Stage the new file - this adds the file to the Git staging area , from which all files are committed .
Press `d` and then accept to diff against HEAD - this will show you a diff view of the changes we have staged - just the add of a single file .
Press `c` to perform the commit .
This opens a new buffer into which a commit message can be added .
Write something like : ` Add personal configuration file .`
Now press `C - c C - c` to commit the file .
That ’s it - now the change has been committed to the local clone of the emacs - starter - kit Git repository .
To see the log of all commits , press l ( lowercase L ) in the magit - status buffer :
To look at a certain commit - just press Enter on it and a view of the diff will be shown .
This makes it quite easy to browse through commits in a repository .
At the top of the log is the most recent commit , which in this case is the file we just added .
To update emacs - starter - kit with the latest changes in the GitHub repository , just press F in the magit - status buffer or run git pull in the ~/.emacs.d directory .
Summary
Now that we have Git and Emacs set up we can finally move to Ioke .
In the next post we ’ll go through installing the latest Java JDK and getting and compiling the Ioke source code .
Join me then !

An Indiana businessman and a race car - driving chauffeur have built what they and the World Record Academy call the world 's fastest street - legal car , a 1,600 - horsepower beast that does zero to sixty in just 2.1 seconds .
That 's right .
Two - point - one seconds .
Designer Marlon Kirby and financier David McMahan unveiled the Maxximus G - Force this morning in Beverly Hills , and they 'll happily sell you one for $ 3 million .
That kind of money buys you a car with a 7 - liter twin turbocharged Chevrolet V8 engine powerful enough to leave the Ferrari Enzo , McLaren F1 and even the mighty Bugatti Veyron in its dust .
When Kirby let 'er rip at Rockingham Raceway in North Carolina a few months ago , the car did zero to 100 in 4.541 seconds and peeled off a zero - to - 100 - back - to - zero time of 8.861 seconds .
" Racing the Maxximus G - Force , well , it 's like coming down from the top of a roller coaster ride , " Kirby told Wired.com .
" You 're experiencing so many Gs that there is just no other way to describe it . "
Kirby is the founder of Maxximus Technologies .
McMahan is the president and CEO of Argent Funds Group .
The two met when Kirby was driving the limo that carried McMahan home from the airport in Indianapolis .
They started talking about cars and discovered they shared a dream of building a record - breaking street - legal car .
" Building a record - breaking performance car is something I always dreamed of as a kid , ever since I was strapping motors to my Radio Flyer to the time when I was drag racing Studebakers at Paradise Airport , " said McMahan .
" So , we exchanged numbers in the limo , and I called Marlon back about two weeks later , agreeing to finance his next project . ' "
Kirby spent four years developing and building the car .
He started with an Ultima GTR 720 , a British super - exotic already capable of zero to 60 in 2.6 seconds .
Kirby yanked the Ultima 's drivetrain , gearbox and a good portion of the chassis because , he said , they could n't handle the acceleration he was looking for .
Maxximus uses an all - aluminum 434 - cubic inch small - block V8 and two Turbonetics turbochargers to produce 1,600 horsepower at the flywheel .
Power flows through a custom - made paddle - shifted three speed transmission .
Six -piston AP
Racing calipers grab 14.2 - inch rotors to bring the car to a stop .
The mid-engined car weighs 2,700 pounds and will suck the fuel tank dry in 9 minutes .
McMahan calls building the car a dream come true .
And though it costs about twice as much as the Veyron - which does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds - McMahan says he's had a couple of inquiries from buyers in the Middle East .
Perhaps that 's why the car will be featured at the Big Boy 's Toys Super Show in Abu Dhabi on April 30th .

John Carew has issued a bullish message ahead of tomorrow 's pivotal meeting with Chelsea by claiming that Aston Villa have already demonstrated they are the " better team " this season and are intent on proving it . .
The striker used the league table to support his argument and pointedly suggested that Villa 's success highlights how team spirit can be more valuable than having a squad replete with star names .
" They all know what it 's about and we do as well , " said Carew , who is confident of a victory today that would open a five - point gap over Chelsea .
" It 's a big game and they are closest to us now .
But there 's a reason why we are two points ahead of them – we have been better than them this season .
I think we are going to go out and show that .
In the long term we have been the better team .
That 's why we are ahead of them and that 's how we should think about it . "
The Norwegian 's positive mood was also reflected by his manager , Martin O'Neill , who claimed there was " plenty of confidence " within the Villa squad and added : " We think we can win . "
The Northern Irishman made similar remarks before Villa were comprehensively outplayed at Stamford Bridge in October and later admitted he was " daft " to believe his side could beat Chelsea .
Much has changed since them , however .
" We 've won a lot of matches and I think we have picked up , " he said .
The table illustrates as much , with Villa in a lofty third place and unbeaten in 13 league games before Chelsea 's visit .
Carew believes that the run of form shows that a galvanised dressing room can be worth more than a multimillion pound squad .
There had been reports of divisions within the Chelsea ranks before Luiz Felipe Scolari was dismissed .
Carew says the mood could not be better in the Villa camp and that there is no fear about taking on Guus Hiddink 's side .
" Why should we be worried ? " said the striker , who is expected to start in preference to Emile Heskey in attack .
" Look at the table .
It 's not always about the stars ; it 's about the team .
Villa is very strong as a group .
I 'm not talking [ just ] about the players but the fans .
Villa is a big family and everyone supports each other and we 've created a brilliant group . "
O'Neill , who refuses to entertain talk of his own side mounting a title challenge because of their lack of experience , believes Chelsea must secure their first victory in 10 years at Villa Park to have any chance of overhauling Manchester United .
Even then he predicts that Hiddink 's side would need to remain unbeaten for the rest of the campaign and drop no more than four points .
" I think Chelsea need to win to stay in the race , with Manchester United having completed the same number of games and opened up a five - point gap at the top and another five points on Chelsea , " said O'Neill .
" I think they will say that to stand any chance they have to be unbeaten in their last 13 matches and probably win 11 .
But , if Chelsea needed rejuvenating , the calibre of someone like Guus Hiddink should generate that . "
O'Neill accepts that much of the hype around the game will surround Hiddink 's arrival but he also made it clear that the stakes are just as high for Villa .
" Our need to win the game is as great as Chelsea 's , " he said .
" But I am not so sure a defeat will knock the stuffing out of us .
I still think we could pull it around .
It is a tough run -in but I do n't think we will lose out through courage , either moral or physical . "
Sloppy male kissers may have a method behind their messiness .
Men in general seem to like wet kisses with more " tongue action , " said anthropologist Helen Fisher of Rutgers University .
This could be because modern males are instinctually using kisses to pick up traces of estrogen in a woman 's saliva and thus gauge her fertility .
Wet kisses could also be an unconscious attempt to transfer testosterone to the woman , which would stimulate her sexual interest , Fisher said Friday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago .
" Men see kissing early in a relationship directly as a step to copulation , " she said .
Sloppy smooching could therefore be an " all - purpose mechanism " to get the reproductive juices flowing .
Kiss of Death
Kissing may also serve as a way to assess the quality of a mate , said Wendy Hill , a neuroscientist at Lafayette College in Easton , Pennsylvania .
Technique aside , the chemical cocktail of saliva may tell us if the person we 're kissing is a genetically appropriate choice to mate with .
In fact , Rutgers '
Fisher said , research has shown that the majority of men and women rate their first kiss as either " the kiss of death " or the blossoming of a new relationship .
The idea adds to mounting research that shows humans are naturally drawn to certain people based on biological cues that run deeper than looks .
Using statistics from 40,000 people on the Internet dating site Chemistry.com , Fisher recently developed a personality test that measures four universal temperaments .
Each temperament type was linked to activity levels of the brain chemicals dopamine / norepinephrine , serotonin , testosterone , and estrogen / oxytocin .
Fisher found that a person 's temperament guides which type of mate they select — boosting her belief that love involves some very powerful brain chemistry .
" People sing for love ; they dance for love ; they write about love ; live for , kill , and die for love , " Fisher told National Geographic News .
the Fastest in - production shipping SSDs - © STORAGEsearch.com
rackmount SSDs Earlier versions of this document only listed the single fastest rackmount SSD in each u-size ( 1U , 2U etc ) - but there were some disadvantages in that method .
So instead this now includes a mini list of the most important companies and product lines in this market space which covers a range of different interfaces and architectures .
You 'll have to look at each vendor 's own offerings to get the exact specifications - but these are the vendors who are positioning themselves as the companies to beat in terms of latency and throughput .
ultrafast rackmount SSDs ( RAM SSDs ) :- Kove 's XPD fast rackmount SSDs ( fastest flash systems ) : -
IBM's FlashSystem
Mangstor 's NX - Series
EMC's DSSD
SanDisk 's ION Accelerator
Violin's 6600
Speed has a different value in fault tolerant rackmount SSDs - where the raw latency and IOPS may be outweighed by user preferences about the exact design and consequences of the differing FT architectures .

NVDIMM SSDs
For RAM SSDs in this form factor see the hybrid DIMMs page .
For flash SSDs and other nvm SSDs in this form factor see the memory channel SSDs page .
PCIe SSD cards
See also :- the article -
Memory technology , generation level ( 2 , 3 or upcoming 4 ) , the number of lanes and the API integration with critical apps are some of the vital filters in assembling any list of really fast PCIe SSDs .
And that 's before you get you controller architecture .
In the RAM SSD category - the fastest PCIe SSD is PMC's Flashtec NVRAM drive family .
This RAM SSD in PCIe form factor has a x8 lane , PCIe 3.0 host interface - 16GB capacity - rated at over 10 million IOPS .
In the flash based PCIe SSD category - the fastest flash based PCIe SSD ( at the time of writing - September 2015 ) is Mangstor 's MX - Series .
This is the fastest according to either IOPS or latency when compared to any of the previous industry leaders in this category listed in these pages .
3.5 " Although the 3.5 " form factor was at the sharp end of SSD performance in earlier phases of SSD history - it is no longer a launchpad for new high speed products .
Although you will find some older legacy 3.5 " SSDs which were fast at the time they were launched - they are mostly EOL - or simply available for old designs .
Instead you 'll get better results by installing one or more smaller SSDs in a 3.5 " carrier module .
1.8 " The question arises - what kind of interfaces are available for 1.8 " SSDs ?
At the time of writing this I 'm unaware of any 1.8 " PCIe SSDs .
That leaves the speed race to SAS SSDs . .
M.2 SSDs
This form factor is becoming a surprising hotbed of innovation and ( surprisingly ) even speed .
fastest M.2 SSD ?
Aupera Technologies - low capacity SSD implemented using MRAM instead of flash .
Kingston - enterprise M.2 flash SSD using SSD controller from by Liqid .
Citigroup Inc. is in talks with federal officials that could result in the U.S. government substantially expanding its ownership of the struggling bank , according to people familiar with the situation .
While the discussions could fall apart , the government could wind up holding as much as 40 % of Citigroup 's common stock .
Bank executives hope the stake will be closer to 25 % , these people said .

Nokia 's media sharing site Share on Ovi is seen working within Facebook in this computer screenshot taken in Helsinki August 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Tarmo Virki
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Nokia on Sunday removed one of the key obstacles for takeup of its new Internet offering , combining sign - ins for its overall services site Ovi.com and for its media sharing service .
Nokia has bought a dozen companies -- including an $ 8.1 billion acquisition of mapping company Navteq -- to jump - start its Internet business as growth in the mobile phone market stalls .
The handset maker has gathered access to all of the services to its Ovi.com site , but so far they have all demanded additional usernames and passwords , something analysts see as one of the major obstacles for takeup .
“ We are pleased to announce that as part of improving your experience with Share on Ovi , we have merged our sign - in system with Ovi.com , ” Nokia said in a letter to clients .
“ This is a key step in integrating Ovi , ” Nokia said .
Nokia said earlier this month it aims to make annual revenue of at least 2 billion euros ( $ 2.79 billion ) from Internet services in 2011 , focusing on navigation , music , games , messaging and media -- but is battling with more established rivals such as Google , Apple and Yahoo .
Nokia has not unveiled user numbers for its Internet services , which created revenue of 115 million euros in July - to - September quarter .
( $ 1=.7164 Euro )
Mine was an uneasy childhood .
My father was schizophrenic and had bouts of manic depression .
He and my mother both died when I was 10 years old , and my siblings and I moved from Scotland to Ireland , to live with my mother ’s relatives .
As a teenager , I started to find the idea of an all - encompassing God and protector alluring , and in 1984 , moved to a small village in Germany .
Here , I discovered Scientology .
I was in a bad way one afternoon , walking the streets of Stuttgart , when a young lady approached me : “ Do you have a good memory ? ” she asked .
I agreed to join her at the local Scientology centre , to find out .
The centre was filled with friendly , efficient people .
It all seemed very official and scientific .
I took tests which revealed I needed counselling , or “ auditing ” .
I found the “ science ” aspect very seductive , and quickly became involved in the group .

After two weeks , I was taken with the teachings of [ Scientology ’s founder ] L Ron Hubbard .
He was my guru , and I started to see less of my girlfriend and friends .
I worked for the Scientologists from 9 am to 11 pm , for the equivalent of £ 15 per week .
Within months of that first meeting , I was recruited to the Sea Organisation – a central management group within the association .
My work for them included administration and PR .
I lived in a commune in Los Angeles with the Sea Org for a while .
It was a highly disciplined , enclosed environment .
We were self - sufficient : building our own computers , growing our own food – we had very little contact with the outside world .
I was transferred all over the world , and in 2000 was living in Dorset when I made a discovery .
Scientology works on a strictly hierarchical basis .
All through my membership , I was told there was a revelation I was being built up to , Hubbard ’s theory of creation .
When I became privy to the details of the story , I was shocked that this was the carrot on a stick that had kept me with the organisation for so long .
His ideas seemed ludicrous , and when I stumbled upon other details of Hubbard ’s biography , I was appalled .
It took five more years to gather the courage to leave .
For two decades this had been my life .
I had no skills , no cultural references ; I ’d become institutionalised .
In 2005 , I made my escape in the middle of the night .
Facing the outside world was terrifying .
But slowly , I began to rebuild my life .
I went back to Ireland and got to grips with the basics : how to cook and shop .
Now I have a wonderful partner , I ’m enrolled at university , and I ’m learning to be a human for the first time ever .
It ’s like having a new lease of life .

Group A
Group A , dubbed the “ group of death ” by basically anyone who closely follows sports analytics Catan players , saw @chuurveg win the first two games of the group making the third game nothing more than a victory lap for @chuurveg .
Though he almost pulled off the sweep in round one , @sethwalder pulled out a victory in game 3 to advance to the round of 16 .
Group B
@jacksoslow and @yuorme took all the wins in this group with the only other competitor finishing with a second @scott_bush .
Group C
@dangroob tore through group C posting 3 wins in his 3 games .
@chibearsstats also advance on the back of 3 second place finishes .
Fan favorite @statsinthewild disappointed throughout the first round .
Needing a win in his third game to advance , all he could manage was 5 points and a tie for second .
He ’s going to have to answer a lot of questions about whether he even deserved to be in this tournament in the first place .
Group D
@cfbnate and @hausinthehouse advance out of this group in what was probably the most exciting group of the first round .
Both of the first two games of this group saw ties for second at 9 .
After two games @stat_ron was sitting on 18 victory points with no wins .
He then finished dead last in game three to not advance .
His 23 victory points in the first round are the most of anyone who did not advance ( tied with @kfloyd34 from group H ) .
Group E
Group E saw three different winners in three different games .
@zbinner_NFLinj one the first game of the group and , like an injured NFL player referenced in his screen name , limped across the finish line to somehow win the group with only 22 victory points .
@mtm1013 won game 2 and after his 2nd in game 1 , he was very likely to advance to the next round barring some craziness in game 3 .
Game 3 saw @chiefsanalytics , whose Twitter name is not @arrowheadanalytics , went big in game 3 for the win , but it was n’t enough to advance .
Kansas
City will just have to be happy with their Super Bowl win this year because the city wo n’t be bringing how a Settlers of Catan Championship this year .
Group F
Wow .
What a wild ride this group was !
@punkrockscience wins the group after putting up a 3 spot in game 1 .
Even more bizarre , she won the group with the lowest victory point total of the group ( 21 , 22 , 23 , 23 ) !
She is the only competitor to win their group and NOT have the most total victory points .
Additionally , @sabinanalytics waited until the very last minute to advance by winning game 3 leaving game 1 winner @nflsharptampa as one of only two people to win a game and not advance ( @chiefsanaltics is the other ) .
@necesarypaper , who ultimately finished 4th in the group , was actually in really good shape to win the group going in to game 3 as a win in game 3 would have put him in first as he had finished second twice already and would have moved him into first place all alone with a win .
@neccessarypaper ends their tournament as the only player to score 7 or more points in all three of their games and not advance out of the first round .
Group G
With one game left to go in Group G , @jPohlkampHart has already won the group , but that coveted second place is the last spot available for the round of 16 and any of the other three in the group ( @msubbiah , @dtrainor4 , and @nickwan ) can still claim it .
Game 3 will be win an advance for the three unqualified contenders .
If @JPohlkamHart can win game 3 , @msubbiah will advance unless @dtrainor can finish alone in 2nd AND make up the 3 victory deficit behind @msubbiah .
@nickwan , the worlds greatest Catan streamer , needs a win and only a win to advance .
Group H
Last , and kind of least , group H featured @sethpartnow dominating the first two games of Group H , making the third game in the group a exhibition game for Seth .
The second spot was up for grabs with a win an advance scenario for the other the other three in this group .
Ultimately , @ Hharris3419 took the other spot with a 10,9 , 9,6 win in the final game to move on .
Here is a summary of the first round ( color is what place they finished in the group ( gold , silver , bronze , and red ) ) :
Round of 16
Group I
Group I features the winners of group A and B and he runners up in groups C and D .

VIDEO : Moving ' Do n't Divorce ... ' campaign hopes to send message to anti-marriage bigots ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/5/2009 , 8:16 pm PT
Last December , following the passage of Prop 8 in California , Ken Starr ( yes , that Ken Starr ) filed a legal brief with the CA Supreme Court , on behalf of the so - called " Prop 8 Legal Defense Fund " , seeking to nullify the legal marriages of 18,000 same - sex couples in the state .
Arguments will be heard beginning on March 5th , and the Courage Campaign is asking for you to send your opinion to the Supremes ( deadline : Valentine 's Day ) , in hopes that they will invalidate the civil rights abomination that is Prop 8 , on Constitutional ( if not moral ) grounds .
When the Courage Campaign launched their " Do n't Divorce ... " campaign , they asked members to " send pictures with a simple message for Starr and the Prop 8 Legal Defense Fund . "
Here 's the resulting , and moving , 4 - minute video ...
JERUSALEM , March 7 ( Reuters ) - Israel accelerated its " illegal annexation " of East Jerusalem last year through municipal and security policies that discriminated against Palestinian residents , an EU report said .
The internal report by European diplomats , dated Dec. 15 , 2008 , was obtained by Reuters as fresh controversy simmered over Israel 's plan to demolish scores of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem , part of territory seized in the 1967 Middle East war .
The number of building tenders issued by Israel for Jewish homes in East Jerusalem increased by a factor of 40 in 2008 over 2007 , the report said , while Israeli authorities placed " severe restrictions " on construction permits for Palestinians , who were also denied municipal funding proportionate to their population .
The report also criticised Israel for constructing a barrier that runs through Jerusalem , saying it cut off thousands of Palestinians from the occupied West Bank .
Israel says the barrier keeps out suicide bombers and has vowed to complete the Jerusalem section by 2010 .
The 20 - page report acknowledged Israel 's security needs but said its " actions in and around Jerusalem constitute one of the most acute challenges to Israeli - Palestinian peace - making " .
Israel annexed East Jerusalem as its capital , a move not recognised internationally .
Palestinians want to found a state in the West Bank and Gaza with its capital in East Jerusalem .
The Jerusalem municipality said last month it planned to demolish 88 Palestinian homes , though not immediately , that were built without permits in another section of Silwan , near the walls of Jerusalem 's Old City , to create a public garden .
U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed to revive peacemaking and his secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , who visited the region this week , called the planned demolitions " unhelpful " .
Israeli officials deny there is a campaign to drive out Palestinians , who make up 34 percent of Jerusalem 's population .

Cramer is PROUD of his stock manipulation .
That video is astonishing .
This same Jim Cramer rallied Bear Stearns on television , told folks to hold onto that stock and it tanked to 2 bucks a share .
He also was the one with his shock and awe on those now " worthless " internet stocks , telling folks to hold onto to the stock that is now toilet paper .
Just amazing that this joke is still running around here , giving financial advice .
This from Huffington Post .
Here are some gems :
- On manipulating the market : " A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund , and I was positioned short , meaning I needed it down , I would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures , "
- On falsely creating the impression a stock is down ( what he calls " fomenting " ) : " You ca n't foment .
That 's a violation ...
But you do it anyway because the SEC does n't understand it . "
He adds , " When you have six days and your company may be in doubt because you are down , I think it is really important to foment . "
- On the truth : " What 's important when you are in that hedge fund mode is to not be doing anything that is remotely truthful , because the truth is so against your view - it is important to create a new truth to develop a fiction , " Cramer advises .
" You ca n't take any chances . "
Since he is in a pissing contest with Jon Stewart and dragged the morning joke , Joe Scarborough in this , he needs to sit down and shut up , but more importantly he is totally discredited .
Who is listening to this guy ?
I sure would n't if I lost my money listening to him about holding onto Bear Stearns stock .
And of course , Cramer on video blabbing away , all the above :
( CNN ) --
In times past , Jerry Borbon would not have thought twice about the backpack - wearing young man he spotted strolling down a street in his Miami , Florida , community .
Jerry Borbon , Scruff , McGruff the Crime Dog and police officers at a Westchester neighborhood celebration .
But times have changed .
Now he 's learning to trust his suspicions more .
A neighbor saw the man trying to break into a house and called police .
" There was nobody at home at the house , " Borbon said .
" [ The alleged thief ] did n't know that a neighbor was watching from her window . "
Borbon is a Citizens ' Crime Watch volunteer for his Westchester neighborhood in south Miami , where residents have been trained to be alert to suspicious behavior and report it promptly to police .
With the economic downturn , neighborhood watch groups are proving to be a first line of defense in battling property crimes .
The Police Executive Research Forum , a Washington , D.C. - based independent research organization made up of local and state police officials , released a survey in January showing that 44 percent of police departments reported increases in crimes they believed could be attributed to the economic crisis .
Of the departments surveyed , 39 percent reported an increase in robberies , and 32 percent said they had seen a rise in burglaries .
Those surveyed also reported a 40 percent increase in thefts , including those of GPS devices from cars and other " opportunistic " crimes .
See how you can protect yourself and your property »
The survey also revealed that while quality - of - life crimes are rising , budget money is falling .
Of the 233 responding police agencies , 63 percent said they expected their total funding for the next fiscal year to be slashed .
And as police departments grapple with budget cuts and hiring freezes , neighbors are stepping up and battling back against burglary , theft and vandalism .
Police Chief Dean Esserman of Providence , Rhode Island , said that for a time , his department saw a dramatic increase in copper thefts resulting from empty , foreclosed homes and the increased value of copper on the commodities market .
Things have gotten much better in Providence , Esserman said , but other communities have n't been as fortunate .
" Most cities are having a tough time , " said Esserman , who added that his department is dedicated to community policing and has a strong partnership with neighborhood watch groups .
" In the last year or two , the economics have been really rough . "
Borbon said his community has definitely noticed more criminal activity .
" We 've never had so many problems before , " he said .
" Nowadays , you have so many people just walking around pretending , leaving fliers , doing marketing surveys or some such baloney .
But what they really are doing is looking for opportunities , watching to see who is or is n't in their homes . "
Matt Peskin is executive director of the National Association of Town Watch , a nonprofit crime prevention organization that works with law enforcement and crime watch groups around the country .
Peskin , who estimates that there are about 20,000 neighborhood watch groups nationwide , said there has been an increase in requests for information on starting groups from all over the country including urban , suburban and rural communities .
" In a lot of cases , there are so many communities out there that already have groups that when you start to get new ones , you know that something 's up , " he said .
" It does seem to be somewhat tied to the economy . "
Martin Floss , a professor and director of the Institute for Law and Justice at Hilbert College in Hamburg , New York , said that for the past 15 years , crime rates across the board have dropped to historically low levels .
Floss , a former crime prevention coordinator for a neighborhood in Buffalo , New York , said that as the economy worsens , property crimes tend to increase .
Well - trained neighborhood watch groups can be great assets to local law enforcement , Floss said .
" If you can get them to organize , to look out for each other and to work closely with the police , that is only going to do good things , " he said .
A spate of vandalism and petty theft in his Las Vegas , Nevada , neighborhood prompted Doug Puppel to organize a neighborhood watch program in his area .
Like Florida , Nevada has been hard hit by the crumbling economy and housing market crisis .
Puppel said residents in such areas are motivated by concern for their families and community .
" What 's going on is not unique to Las Vegas , but what 's unique that I 'm seeing is that people are pulling together , " he said .
" It 's probably easier for a person to start a neighborhood watch today than it would have been if times were better . "
Crystal Zohner lives in a gated community in Las Vegas and said her neighbors are rallying to send a clear message that they are united against crime .
" It seems like now , since the economy has changed , [ thieves ] are getting a little bit more sophisticated and a little more brazen , " she said .
" It 's time to get back to simpler times , when we did look out for each other . "
Robert Thompson , neighborhood captain for a watch group in Roswell , New Mexico , said that with police so busy and resources stretched so thin , members know they have to be vigilant when they patrol their neighborhood .
But they also know that they are not the police , he said .
" They are not going to confront anybody , but they are the eyes and ears , " Thompson said .
" I feel a sense of satisfaction because I am trying to make a difference in my community . "
The key to reducing crime in communities may be found in history books .
University of Arizona economist Price Fishback has studied urban crime rates during the Great Depression and said there was a correlation between getting people back to work and decreasing crime .
" If you are worried about crime , training programs and things that take people 's time up help to reduce crime rates during a period when things are getting worse , " he said .
" For a 1 percent increase in employment , you found about a 1 percent reduction in the crime rate . "

FLASHBACK : Australia To Enforce Mandatory Chinese - Style Internet Censorship
AUSTRALIA
’S mandatory net filter is being primed to block 10,000 websites as part of a blacklist of unspecified “ unwanted content ” .
Some 1300 websites have already been identified by the Australian Communications and Media Authority .
Communications Minister Senator Conroy revealed details of the Rudd Government ’s proposed web filter as he called for expressions of interest from internet service providers ( ISPs ) for a live trial of the technology , the Courier - Mail reports .
ISPs will test ways to filter the web using volunteer subscribers .
The trial will start before Christmas and is expected to last six weeks .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The pilot will specifically test filtering against the ACMA blacklist of prohibited content , which is mostly child pornography , as well as filtering of other unwanted content , ” Senator Conroy told Parliament today .
“ While the ACMA blacklist is currently around 1300 URLs , the pilot will test against this list – as well as filtering for a range of URLs to around 10,000 – so that the impacts on network performance of a larger blacklist can be examined . ”
Electronic Frontiers Australia board member Colin Jacobs said his civil liberties group was concerned at what would be deemed “ unwanted content ” .
“ Conroy said the list would contain illegal and unwanted content but we still have to see what would end up on that list .

Sharpening the emerging debate over how to reshape the country ’s healthcare system , the major group representing insurers unveiled a proposal Wednesday for covering all Americans in a more centralized insurance market .
The plan offered by America ’s Health Insurance Plans , a trade group representing companies that together insure more than 200 million people , comes a decade and half after the industry helped kill the last major healthcare reform campaign -- pushed early in the Clinton administration .
And Wednesday ’s proposal for a form of universal insurance coverage reflects the intensifying interest among groups like insurers , businesses and healthcare providers in having an active role in shaping the reform effort .
Democratic lawmakers and President - elect Barack Obama have said that upgrading the country ’s healthcare system will be a priority next year .

“ The nation is on the eve of a national discussion about healthcare .
This comes around once every generation , ” said Karen Ignagni , president of AHIP .
“ We are coming to the table with a specific set of proposals .
We believe reform needs to be comprehensive , and it needs to happen now . ”
On Capitol Hill , aides to Sens. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , who have said they plan to push sweeping healthcare legislation next year , also said the AHIP plan would help advance the effort .
But swift criticism of the proposal from several consumer groups Wednesday also highlighted how contentious the debate over systemic changes to the healthcare system could become .
AHIP would require all Americans to get coverage , a new mandate that Obama rejected during the presidential campaign .
Advertisement
In exchange for such a mandate , insurers would agree to longtime demands from consumer advocates that they no longer reject people with preexisting medical conditions .
The group is urging Congress to set up an advisory organization to identify ways to cut the increase in healthcare costs by 30 % over the next five years .
It also backs expansions of Medicaid and the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , which Democrats plan to tackle soon after the new Congress convenes in January .
Potentially most controversial , however , is the insurance industry ’s call for a new “ portable health plan ” that would not be subject to the minimum coverage standards set by individual states .
Advertisement
Many states require insurers to cover myriad services such as cancer screenings and obstetric care .
Some also guarantee patients the right to an independent medical review if an insurer denies coverage .
But the standards can vary widely from state to state , a longtime complaint of insurers and some businesses that have to deal with 50 different sets of regulations .
AHIP ’s Ignagni said Wednesday that the new portable coverage , which the group calls an “ essential benefits plan , ” would make it easier for small businesses and workers to keep their insurance .
“ We want to create more - flexible products for small business but that also provide the . . . safety net for workers , ” she said .
Advertisement
That approach is encouraging , said Amanda Austin , who manages legislative affairs in Washington for the National Federation of Independent Business , an influential group that represents about 300,000 small businesses nationwide .
“ There needs to be a discussion about the broad variance of mandates across state lines , ” Austin said .
Like the insurers , NFIB played a key role in defeating Clinton ’s healthcare plan in the early 1990s .
Many consumer groups , however , see moves to change the state - based system of insurance regulation as a way to weaken the health coverage that residents of states like California now are guaranteed .
The groups also fear that a mandate requiring Americans to get insurance could force people to buy unaffordable coverage unless state or federal authorities can regulate how much insurers charge .
AHIP ’s proposal does not address regulation of premiums .
Advertisement
Several consumer groups sharply attacked the insurance group ’s plan on Wednesday .
“ The health insurance industry ’s vision of healthcare reform lets them keep charging whatever they want and increase their profits while sticking families and taxpayers with high costs , ” said Richard Kirsch , national campaign manager for Health Care for America Now .

The cousin of alleged 9/11 hijacker Ziad al - Jarrah has been exposed as a long standing Israeli spy in yet another startling intelligence connection between the Zionist state and the attacks on New York and Washington .
A New York Times report details how Ali al - Jarrah was a highly valued spy for Israel for no less than 25 years , sending reports and taking clandestine photographs of Palestinian groups and Hezbollah since 1983 .
According to the article , “ From his home in this Bekaa Valley village , Mr. Jarrah , 50 , traveled often to Syria and to south Lebanon , where he photographed roads and convoys that might have been used to transport weapons to Hezbollah , the Shiite militant group , investigators say .
He spoke with his handlers by satellite phone , receiving “ dead drops ” of money , cameras and listening devices .
Occasionally , on the pretext of a business trip , he traveled to Belgium and Italy , received an Israeli passport , and flew to Israel , where he was debriefed at length , investigators say . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
To emphasize how highly regarded he was by Israel , Israeli officials even assured Jarrah that his town would be spared at the outset of the 2006 Lebanon - Israel conflict and that it was safe for him to stay at home .
“ I never suspected him before , ” said Raja Mosleh , the Palestinian doctor who was his partner for years in a school and health clinic .
“ But now , after linking all the incidents together , I feel he ’s 100 percent guilty . ”
Despite living the life of an apparent downtrodden pauper and sympathizing with the plight of the Palestinians , Jarrah was actually in receipt of over $ 300,000 for his work from Israel .
Jarrah ’s brother Yusuf was also accused of being a spy by Lebanese officials and arrested with Jarrah last July .
Ali al - Jarrah
Which other members of the Jarrah family were working for Israel as intelligence assets ?
Surely not Ziad al - Jarrah , one of the infamous “ laughing hijackers ” and the alleged pilot of Flight 93 ?
Al - Jarrah ’s paper passport was one of those that miraculously survived to be legible , apparently avoiding being consumed by fires that were so intense that it took over 6 months just to identify the actual victims of Flight 93 .
Israeli intelligence connections to 9/11 can be traced back to the five “ dancing Israelis ” who were witnessed setting up video camera equipment pointed at the World Trade Center in New York before the first plane hit the tower .
The men were seen jumping and high - fiving with shouts of “ joy and mockery ” as Flight 11 and Flight 175 slammed into the buildings .
They were later seen posing for photographs in front of the debris .
After the men were arrested , the FBI discovered maps of New York City with certain places highlighted , box cutters ( the same items that the hijackers supposedly used ) , $ 4700 cash stuffed in a sock , and foreign passports .
There were also Israeli news reports that the men were driving a white van packed with explosives that were intended to be detonated on the George Washington bridge .
The men were found to have been working for a removal company called Urban Moving Systems , the owner of which immediately fled the U.S. for Israel after the attacks and was subsequently placed on an FBI terror suspect list .
As the What Really Happened website notes , “ The Jewish weekly The Forward reported that the FBI finally concluded that at least two of the detained Israelis were agents working for the Mossad , the Israeli intelligence agency , and that Urban Moving Systems , the ostensible employer of the five Israelis , was a front operation .
This was confirmed by two former CIA officers , and they noted that movers ’ vans are a common intelligence cover .
The Israelis were held in custody for 71 days before being quietly released . ”
Ziad al - Jarrah infamously appeared in the “ laughing hijackers ” video with alleged lead hijacker Mohammed Atta , which was released by Pentagon front group IntelCenter in October 2006 .
The tape showed Atta and Jarrah allegedly attending a 2000 Al - Qaeda meeting and reading their last will and testament .
Segments of the video that were interspersed with footage of the “ laughing hijackers , ” Jarrah and Atta , showing Bin Laden giving a speech to an audience in Afghanistan on January 8 2000 , were culled from what terror experts described as surveillance footage taken by a “ security agency . ”
News reports at the time contained the admission that the U.S. government had been in possession of the footage since 2002 , while others said it was found when the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 , and yet it was still bizarrely reported that the tape , bearing all the hallmarks of having been filmed and edited by undercover US intelligence and having admittedly been in US possession for five years , was released over the weekend of September 31 / October 1 by “ Al - Qaeda ” .
The video also contained segments that were first broadcast in a British documentary called The Road to Guantanamo , which was originally aired in March 2006 .
The context of the corresponding scene in the dramatized documentary featured U.S. interrogators attempting to coerce Gitmo detainees into confessing Al - Qaeda membership by showing them fake videos where their likeness had been computer generated to appear as if they were in attendance during Bin Laden ’s January 8 2000 speech .
Ziad al - Jarrah was questioned by UAE authorities at the request of the CIA in January 2001 , eight months before 9/11 , about his alleged terrorist activities , but was subsequently released .

That is when he leaves for his European visit , with the First Lady , the end of the month .
HE Queen is to give Barack Obama a private “ getting - to - know - you ” audience next month .
Her Majesty will meet the new US President in advance of an economic summit in London .
The private meeting is highly unusual because Mr Obama will not be on a State visit .
But advisers believe it is important the Queen — who opened an interchange in Hull yesterday — meets him before any official trip .
A source said : “ There is a wish to do these things as discreetly as possible in the first instance . ”
President Obama , famed for his Yes We Can slogan , will fly with wife Michelle on Air Force One to Stansted , Essex .
The private talks will be held the next day at Buckingham Palace .
Mr Obama will then join the G20 leaders for a Downing Street dinner on the eve of the summit on April 2 .

Red Bull is a fascinating brand .
In less than a decade they were able to go from being a relatively obscure brand in a nonexistent category into a brand that ’s known and loved world - wide .
What ’s really amazing about that feat is that they have largely discarded the traditional methods of mass marketing , which many think largely contributes to their mass appeal .
In the past , I ’ve referred to some of my own experiences with the brand and how the creation of these experiences provide a means for Red Bull to always be moving and changing what and how they are interact with consumers , but still maintain a consistent image .
Rob Walker , in his book Buying In , calls this Red Bull ’s projectability , or basically the way that they let consumers fill in the blanks about what their brand means .
Red Bull University is one of the many ways that Red Bull puts their brand into consumers hands to let them fill in the gaps .
It ’s a 275 + national student network that are employed at university ’s across the country to build the Red Bull brand on campus .
All of these “ student brand managers ” are passionate advocates for the brand , always pushing the limits of how they can bring Red Bull experiences to their campus .
I was able to get in touch with Sam Bennett , who is a Student Brand Manager for Red Bull at Loyola Marymount Univeristy and ask him a few questions about the program .
Here ’s what Sam had to say :
——
So , what is Red Bull University ?
Sam Bennett : Red Bull University is kind of like the online school of choice for our Student Brand Managers .
Red Bull U is where we take classes .
We study the things college students are into … share , and collaborate on how to give wiiings to any college student in need .
What does it take to become a student brand manager ?
SB : It takes the right person to fit the position … to fit the brand …
Some of us may not have a 4.0 in our academics , however we all have a 4.0 in life .
We love our school and know our campus like the back of our hand .
And I think we ’re also the kind of people who just are n’t satisfied with the traditional path .
Are student brand managers provided any rules or guidelines for how they are to represent Red Bull ?
SB : It is a topic of daily discussion at the Red Bull University .
We are all accepted because our personalities match those of Red Bull , however we are all in it to learn more and broaden our horizons .
We push the limits and sometimes take it too far … which you have to do sometimes to figure out what the limits even are .
What involvement do student brand managers have in popular Red Bull events , like Flügtag , Crashed Ice , and the soapbox races ?
SB : Student Brand Managers live for this stuff .
But involvement in these sorts of national events is up to the individual .
Some of us travel the country just to witness the experience only Red Bull can offer .
If we are part of the local market where this event will be taking place , then some of us might look to help out the event by working in which ever way possible .
But one thing that we all make sure to do is share the experience with as many students as we can no matter how much involvement we have .
It ’s good stuff .
Can student brand managers start their own on campus Red Bull events ?
If so , what kind of support and resources do they receive from Red Bull to ensure that the event is a success ?
SB : Yes .
And we do it often .
When it comes to these things , we do n’t just think outside the box …
We think outside our minds .
That sounds unusual … but really , our actions are only limited to our imagination , wit and understanding of the brand …
However we are sworn to secrecy on our techniques for success .
How important are the grassroots efforts of Red Bull U brand managers to the continued success of Red Bull ?
SB : Handing a friend a cold can of Red Bull is what we’d be doing even if we did n’t have this job .
We really just want all college students , including ourselves , to enjoy life … we want to make sure everyone gets through each year and says , “ man … this year f*** ing rocked . ”

Do n't call us ' dogs ' : Indian ' slum dwellers ' riot over Slumdog Millionaire film
Slum dwellers objecting to the word ' dog ' in the film ' Slumdog Millionaire ' have attacked a cinema hall .
Protesters tore down posters and ransacked a movie theatre showing the rags - to- riches tale of a Mumbai slum dweller .
Hundreds of slum dwellers shouted slogans saying the film 's title was humiliating and must be changed for protests to end .
Residents of a nearby slum demonstrate outside the office of Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor , one of the main casts of the movie Slumdog Millionaire , demanding that the name of the film be changed
Tateshwar Vishwakarma , a social activist said : ' Referring to people living in slums as dogs is a violation of human rights . '
' We will burn Danny Boyle ( the film 's director ) effigies in 56 slums here '
Police said they have deployed armed police outside cinemas in the state to thwart any further attacks in eastern Indian state Bihar .
Last week , Vishwakarma filed a case against an actor , the music director and two other people associated with ' Slumdog ' in a local court .
The case will be heard in a Patna court on February 5th , police said .
Simon Beaufoy , the screenwriter , said last week : ' I just made up the word .
I liked the idea .
I did n't mean to offend anyone . '
The hit film has been nominated for 10 Oscars and won top prize at the Screen Actors Guild over the weekend .
Meanwhile , the parents of actors Rubina Ali and Azharuddin Ismail have accused producers of exploiting and underpaying the child stars .
Boyle recently revealed that he has set up trust funds as well as paying for the education of the eight - year - olds .
But it has since emerged that the children , who play young couple Latika and Salim , were only paid a total of £ 2,100 .
Ali was only given £ 500 while Ismail received £ 1,700 for their roles , which took a year to film , the Daily Telegraph has reported .
The pair currently live a few hundred yards from each other in makeshift shacks along Mumbai 's railway tracks .
But their parents hoped the film deal would be a way out of living in squalor .
Ismail 's father has claimed that they never received any details of the trust fund .
Mohamed Ismail told the Telegraph : ' We feel that the kids have been left behind by the fill .
They have told us there is a trust fund but we know nothing about it and have no guarantees . '
Ali 's father , Rafiq Ali Kureshi added : ' I am very happy the movie is doing well but it is making so much money and so much fame and the money they paid us is nothing .
' They should pay us more . '
Boyle released a statement confirming he had carried out the agreed financial arrangements for the children .
He said : ' The children had never attended school and in consultation with their parents we agreed that this would be our priority . '
' Since June 2008 and at our expense , both kids have been attending school and they are flourishing under the tutelage if their dedicated and committed teachers .
' Financial resources have been made available for their education until they are 18 . '
There 's a new front on the beer vs. wine wars : the dinner table .
The increasing presence of complex , flavor - packed brews has made that beverage just as viable a food - pairing option as wine .
Waitpersons might not be inquiring , " Will we be having fermented grapes or fermented grains with dinner ? "
But many diners have moved light years beyond Bud and brats .
" Beer can be just as complex and just as interesting and just as , well , fancy as wine , " said Scott Pampuch , who recently ramped up the beer list at his Corner Table restaurant in south Minneapolis .
Pampuch particularly likes the way certain beers work with food such as " the dreaded , you 'll - never - pair - wine - with - this green beans . "
" Anything with an acidic tone , instead of battling with a riesling or other white German wine , " he said , " throw out a real nice , caramelly beer with toasty undertones . "
Another acidic , wine - busting dish , salad with a sharp vinaigrette , melds splendidly with an India Pale Ale , said Jason Alvey , owner of the craft - beer store Four Firkins in St. Louis Park .
" The flavor - profile range is incredible .
Beer is physically more complex [ than wine ] , has more ingredients , more stuff going on , " said Alvey , citing the spices and fruits that might go into a brew along with the grain and hops .
But as complex as some of the offerings have gotten , Alvey said , it 's still , well , beer .
" It 's not elitist .
It 's not intimidating like wine , " he said .
" If a beer label says it tastes like chocolate or licorice , it slaps you in the face with chocolate or licorice .
The flavors are very , very obvious .
With wine , people are going ' I 'm not getting this black cherry . ' "
Beer has another advantage over still wines : bubbles .
Especially with spicy foods , a swell match with India pale ales ( IPAs ) .
" The carbonation helps to strip those pepper oils off the tongue , " said Linda Haug , owner / manager of Café Twenty Eight in Minneapolis ' Linden Hills neighborhood .
" It serves as a palate refresher , like champagne . "

TIP 's ad campaign is designed to encourage the world community to work for a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis and to increase awareness that Iran is largely responsible for training , arming and funding Hamas , which has fired 6,500 - plus rockets at Israeli civilians since Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in August 2005 .
The ad is scheduled to begin running Monday on CNN , CNN Headline News , Fox News Channel and MSNBC , and will be broadcast more than 600 times overall .
Yesterday , in her confirmation hearing , Secretary of State - Designate Hillary Clinton also focused on the need to stop the threat of Iran .
By promoting killing , murder , dehumanization of Palestinians , starvation , torture , geographic walled imprisonment , cutting off of electricity , water , bulldozing houses with humans in them , stealing the land of entire towns of human beings .
Yes .
Creating the conditions to attack Iran is a number one priority .
Iran is the one thing that prevents Israel from killing every single Palestinian .
Eliminating Iran has the added benefit of allowing Israel to kill every single inhabitant of Lebanon and taking the entire country as their own .
And the United States and the United Kingdom are completely responsible for promoting , arming , and funding the terrorist government of Israel .

And Israel has fired thousands and perhaps millions of tons of technologically advanced munitions at the indigenous Semitic population of Lebanon and Palestine for over 60 years , massacring thousands of human beings , taking their land , and spitting in the face of the world .
The leaders of Israel were and are terrorists .
The Israeli nation was created by terrorists and terrorism .
It is organizations such as " The Israel Project " that have re-written history through psychological programming of the masses and changed the Israeli terrorists of the 1930s and 1940s into the heroes and leaders of Israel .

Shared ideology
The terrorist organization and the Islamic Republic share " a close ideological vision of the Middle East . "
For example , neither entity recognizes Israel 's right to exist and have explicitly called for Israel 's destruction .
In 2005 , Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Israel should be " wiped off the map " and that attacks by Palestinians would destroy it eventually .
The Hamas charter of 1988 calls for Israel 's destruction " at the hands of Islam . "
On April 16 , 2006 , Khaled Mashaal , Hamas ' exiled political leader , said Hamas would " never recognize Israel . "

Israel 's Hidden Agenda in the war in Gaza
In the first hours of the attack , Israel repeated the same messages to the wider world .
Livni and the Labour defence minister , Ehud Barak , were widely quoted on international TV .
The government 's national information directorate sought to focus foreign media attention on the 8,500 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel over the past eight years and the 20 civilians they have killed , rather than the punishing blockade of Gaza and the 1,700 Palestinians killed in Israeli military attacks since Jewish settlers were pulled out of Gaza three years ago .
Lobby groups , such as the British Israel Communications and Research Centre ( Bicom ) in London and the Israel Project in America , were mobilised .
They arranged briefings , conference calls and interviews .
The Israeli military posted video footage on YouTube .
Israeli diplomats in New York arranged a two - hour " citizens ' press conference " on Twitter for thousands of people .
At the same time , Israel in effect barred foreign journalists from witnessing the results of its strategy .
Israel 's Madness - War with Iran
They are capable of anything .
Nothing is a matter of conscience .
Conscience is for the weak of mind .
Anything that furthers their goal is good .
Truth has no objective existence on its own .
Truth can be anything they say it is .
Anyone not agreeing with them is an enemy and can rightly be killed .
Iran stands in Israel 's way of their greater goal , ownership of all of Palestine .
To achieve their goal there must be war in Palestine , all life in the land must be extinguished .
Iran , war with Iran , is the method and the means .
A propaganda battle designed to promote the plan to spread war throughout the greater Middle East is now under way and will soon hit the airwaves in the United States .
The plan will be presented as a television advertising campaign to promote Israel as the victim of terrorism backed by the government of Iran .
The advertising campaign is due to air on television during the inauguration period of President - elect Barack Obama .
The organization responsible for this soon to be aired propaganda is " The Israel Project " .
" The Israel Project " touts themselves as an international non-profit organization that " provides journalists and leaders accurate information about the Middle East " .
For some reason they make a point of declaring to the public that they are " not related to any government or government agency " .
Information about the Psychological Conditioning Media piece from " The Israel Project 's website Could anyone be more biased , more fear mongering , and blatantly in your face with the schizophrenic mind programming as presented by the minds of the backers of this psychological management organization ? " encourage the world community to work for a peaceful solution " " to the Iranian nuclear crisis " " and to increase awareness that Iran is largely responsible for training , arming and funding Hamas " " which has fired 6,500 - plus rockets at Israeli civilians since Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in August 2005 " The central theme of the propaganda here is this :
And what better way to further this agenda than to broadcast it directly into the minds of Americans viatelevision spots ?
Iranian bombs and missiles are coming to kill you America .
You must kill them first .
Spread the war .
We want all the land of Palestine .
This is how we are going to do it .
From " The Israel Project " website , its leadership states what the organization is about From the press release page announcing the release of this propaganda effort can be found this factual unbiased inclusion regarding Iran : The " Wiped Off the Map " lie was created by the same psychological control entity that this organization is a part of .
" The Israel Project " repeats this lie over and over .
The " wiped off the map " phrase associated with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad occurs on no less than 117 different pages and press releases on The Israel Project 's website .
Islamic linguists and scholars the world over have shown this translation to be a lie .
Its continued promotion is just one more piece of evidence demonstrating the psychological manipulation being used in the service of the pathologicals ' minds promoting it .
The " wiped off the map " lie is right up there with the " Iraq has WMDs " myth .
Yet the lie was so useful that it even got the robots in the U.S. Congress to attempt to pass a resolution to call on the " United Nations Security Council to charge Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide " .
All from a lie .
A lie that The Israel Project continues to promote .
SOTT .net carried Jonathan Steele 's excellent analysis of this issue in his article , " Lost in translation " .
The propagation of this lie and the continued ethnic cleansing going on in Palestine is no surprise , as " The Israel Project " is part of a vast Hasbara Network designed to blindly promote the policies of the Israeli terrorist government and to make us believe that its pathological policies are good for us and that we are just like them with such similar shared and common values .
But the purpose and goal of the Israeli leadership is but one and has never wavered .
The plan is " War in Palestine , " the goal being , to " ethnically cleanse the indigenous Semitic people of Palestine and take their land " .
The Israel Project does not care how blatantly racist its support for killing Palestinians is .
If you repeat and propagate lies enough , over and over , they become the mental constructs of the targeted minds , our minds , regardless of the actual facts .
The Israel Project and the Hasbara minions worldwide are as blatant and ruthless as the pathological minds that have created Israel .
They do not care about facts .
They make them and project them into our minds so that we do not know the truth .
The following is but one example that the historical facts are to be hidden from us .
The pathological drive behind the cause to ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people from their land has a long and rich history .
Its history is itself the evidence of the psychological pathology of the minds who are behind it .
A modicum of research finds direct evidence of the goals and purpose of this effort .
The purpose and the goal has been from its beginning a goal to murder the people of Palestine and to steal their land .
How many times do even one of the above factual quotes occur on The Israel Project website ?
Where is the outrage from the United States Congress ?
Where are the congressional resolutions condemning Israel , its leaders , and asking for trials on the crime of genocide ?
These are not single comments in a vacuum by the Israeli leadership .
It is a continued mindset over years and many decades .
True observation of the Israeli actions over these many decades only confirms the depravity of mind reflected in the above quotations .
It is the evidence of a historical and current pathology .
The Israel Project website is filled with countless statistics screaming in our faces regarding the number of rockets and mortars and bombs that have been aimed at Israel .
The website contains hundreds of pages portraying the Palestinians as terrorists and anyone the pathological forces wish to portray as terrorists , which consequently over the past few years has been Iran .
How many articles are on The Israel Project website covering the historical facts , the one hundred year history of the creation of Israel built on the fact that ethnic cleansing and murder has always been the method and objective of the creators of Israel ?
How many Israeli bullets have been spent in Palestine ?
How many Israeli mortars ?
How many Israeli bombs ?
How many Israeli artillery shells ?
How many Israeli missiles ?
How many Israeli rockets ?
How many Israeli cluster bombs ?
How many Israeli white phosphorus bombs ?
Hundreds of thousands ?
Millions ?
Tens of millions ?
How many Palestinians have been incinerated , vaporized , blown to pieces , murdered , and ethnically cleansed ?
Where on The Israel Project website can this information be found ?
And where can the following be found ?
Instead of any historical facts of Israel 's terrorist roots and continued terrorist actions , what can be found at the Israel Project 's website are dozens and dozens of articles , most of which contain the words , " Iran - backed terrorsists " and " Iran - backed Palestinian terrorists , " all putting the blame for the current situation on the Palestinians and Iran for Israel having to kill the Palestinian people .
The Israel Project website has a spin , an excuse , a deception for each and every genocidal act carried out by the Israeli government .
When the Israeli government planned the operation that has lead to the current crisis and carried it out purposefully while the U.S. and the world were enraptured with the U.S. presidential elections , it was of course the Palestinians fault .
The synchronicity of it being deliberately carried out on election day is to be ignored .
The fact that Palestinians retaliated for the killing of their people is of no concern .
All the facts that the rocket fire from Gaza was almost non-existent for nearly five months until the Israeli operation was carried out is not a fact .
The only thing that matters is Israel and enabling the continuance of the pathologically deviant minds that have built the country for over one hundred years .
That is all that matters .
Where do we go from here ?
It has become apparent over the last few years , that a vital piece of the current planning is to remove Iran from the equation .
The right - wing U.S. Neocon and Zionist factions and the government of Israel have been pushing the " Iran is Terrorist " propaganda for several years now .
We must blow up Iran because they have Nuclear weapons .
We must stop Iran before they kill us .
" Iran backed terrorists " .
Iran supplying IEDs to Iraqi opposition .
Iran wants Israel " wiped off the map " .
It does not make any difference to a pathological mind what the rest of the world thinks .
It makes no difference that independent international organizations find no evidence that Iran is building nuclear weapons .
The CIA assessments can't find the evidence .
The International Atomic Energy Agency assessments can't find the evidence .
Dec 2005 Sep 2006 Sep 2006 Sep 2006 Nov 2006 Nov 2007
Nov 2007 Dec 2007 Dec 2007 Dec 2007 Dec 2007 Dec 2007 Dec 2007Dec 2007Dec2007
Then again there was absolutely zero evidence for WMDs in Iraq , none , zero and it did not make any difference .
Israel does not have to abide by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as they have never signed it .
The International Atomic Energy Agency has no oversight over Israel 's Nuclear program so Israel is allowed to do as it pleases .
It is no longer a secret that Israel has at least 150 nuclear weapons .
Pathological minds with pathological aims require no objective truth and if the world begins to see the pathological mind for what it is , the diseased mind will often setup an incident to achieve their aim .
The current name of the television advertisement due to hit the airwaves is , " " .
It is full of fear and pure psychological manipulation .
The organization behind it , " The Israel Project , " is clearly an arm of the Hasbara Network and its ties probably go much deeper .
It is no secret except to the unaware that the arm of the Israeli government and its policies are deeply embedded throughout the western world and especially Britain and the United States .
If you by chance are not aware , here is one of the many places it is pointed out :
This current article has mentioned the fact that The Israel Project repeats the " wiped off the map " lie on their website in no less than 117 different pages and press releases .
Searching their website also reveals a few more interesting statistics for phrase occurrence : " Iran - backed terrorists " occurs on no less than 34 pages and press releases " Iran " itself occurs on no less than 2240 pages and press releases " Iran " and " Nuclear " occurs on no less than 329 pages and press releases
Here is a lesson from careful observation and study of 100 years of the actual actions and deeds of the pathological minds of those responsible for the creation and continued existence of Israel as it is :
As for this propaganda piece coming soon to a television near you for your own personal pleasure - filled mind absorption , be frightened and be forewarned .
Consider this advertisement a warning .
Not a warning about Iran , but as a warning of what pathological minds are capable of implementing in the process of achieving their aims .
You may even consider it a veiled threat of the deeds that such deviant minds are capable of carrying out themselves when all else fails to get them what they want .
It is well known what they want .
They want Iran dead and they want Palestine as their own .
7 Facts You May Not Know About the TARP Capital Purchase Program
I was reading an article by Fortune magazine about the TARP funds and one fact caught my eye .
Did you know that the TARP application is only 2 pages ?
I mean , is it 2 separate pages with fields on the front and page of each page ?
Then I found the official TARP form , and all was clear .
It is 2 pages with 20 fields to fill out , half of which are things like company name , signatures and contact information .
This got me to research a little more and here are 7 interesting facts about the beloved TARP .
Application for banks to receive tax payers money ( TARP funds ) is only 2 pages while we mail 30 + ( at least ) page packages each year to pay taxes .
No banks provided specific answers to where the TARP money was spent when Associated Press asked 21 banks that got at least $ 1 billion in TARP money .
Some banks just say “ I do n’t know ” ( according to wikipedia ) Ken Lewis ( CEO of Bank of America ) wanted to back out of the Merrill Lynch deal and was told by Bernanke and Paulson that BofA had to close the deal .
Those two even told Lewis that renegotiating a better price for BofA is not an option ( according to Fortune magazine ) NY Times is keeping tabs on who is getting TARP funds , while the government does n’t have a list publicly .
( The government does sent out notices , but not when funds are committed .
They just let the public know in batches . )
Before the Obama administration ever took office , $ 379.8 billion of the whole TARP fund has already been committed .
( see NY Times link ) I thought any funds over the first 350 billion was supposed to be voted and approved by congress before the treasury department can use it , but for some reason I never heard of news on that .
( I could ’ve missed it , so could someone point me to mentions of it ? )
Last week , Eizabeth Waren of the Congressional Oversight Panel said that the government paid $ 254 billion for assets that were worth only $ 176 billion in 2008 .
So much for making money on these things .
Maybe we should just sit back and relax because it ’s not like we can do anything about it anyway .
I wonder if they can at least streamline the unemployment application because at least more people can benefit from that .
A 2 - pager would be nice .

Reader Feedback
Interview about the book .
Lambda the Ultimate , 12 feb 2010 , commenting on a draft version of the book :
" The introductory chapters are probably going to be unnecessary for LtU readers , but once things get going there is a lot to learn here if you are interested in formal semantics of natural language , especially in the Montague - style .
And if this does n't ring a bell - just search for ' continutation ' in the manuscript , and be prepared to meet old friends ( you know who you are ) in a new context . "
Sofy Moradi , Teheran , Dec 18 , 2010 :
" Let me use this opportunity to give you my feedback on your wonderfully nice job : Computational Semantics with Functional Programming .
I have n't read the whole book , but I used parts to get familiar with some complicated ideas ( complicated for me , that is ) that were expressed so simply and nice that I really enjoyed my reading .
Great job ! "
Tom Morgan , Australia , Nov 24 , 2010 :
" I think it is a splendid book and I will be happy to sing its praises on Amazon once I have worked through it . "
Daniel de Kok & Harm Brouwer , Groningen , March 22 , 2010 :
" We are currently reading the draft of ' Computational Semantics with Functional Programming ' , which we really appreciate for its clarity and approach . "

In its on - going legal battle with Apple , upstart clonemaker Psystar has won its first victory in many a month .
It was a minor victory , to be sure : a US District Court judge has allowed Psystar to continue copyright - but not monopoly - arguments in its countersuit against Apple .
But hope springs eternal for the Doral , Florida clonemaker .
It 's been a tough seven months for Psystar .
Last July , Apple filed a complaint in US District Court , accusing the company of " copyright infringement , induced copyright infringement , breach of contract , trademark infringement , trade dress infringement , and unfair competition . "
Apple told the Hacintosh maker : " Stop installing our operating system on computers you sell , stop making people who buy your stuff criminals for using it , and stop using the term Mac OS X and its good - looking logo to sell your products . "
In the seven months since Apple filed the suit , Psystar has had little to celebrate .
In August , the company countersued , wielding the big stick of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Clayton Antitrust Act and claiming that Apple was indulging in " restraint of trade " by tying its operating system to its hardware .
If Psystar wins , $ 554.99 will buy you an ugly - but - serviceable Hackintosh
Of course , Apple did n't agree .
In late September , the company filed a motion to dismiss Psystar 's countersuit , claiming that the cloner was " ignoring fundamental principles of antitrust law , and the realities of the marketplace . "
The big blow came in November , when the US District Court Judge handling the case , William Alsup , agreed with Apple and dismissed Psystar 's countersuit .
In sum , Alsup said that Psystar 's claims that Apple was a monopoly were baseless since Apple is not alone in the personal computing business - there are plenty of other competitors , both of hardware and operating systems .
How accurate was Alsup about a thriving world of operating - system competitors ?
We 'll let Linux fans chew on that .
Alsup did give Psystar one final shred of hope , however , by allowing the company to provide a counter - argument by early December , which he would respond to in early 2009 .
However , less that a week before Psystar 's counter - argument deadline , Apple muscled - up their original complaint by adding the allegation that Psystar was in violation of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act ( DCMA ) .
This amendment asserted that Psystar had hacked Apple 's copyrighted software - protection schemes .
And that 's when things started to get odd .
The stress of long hours may be a factor Long working hours may raise the risk of mental decline and possibly dementia , research suggests .
The Finnish - led study was based on analysis of 2,214 middle - aged British civil servants .
It found that those working more than 55 hours a week had poorer mental skills than those who worked a standard working week .
The American Journal of Epidemiology study found hard workers had problems with short - term memory and word recall .
This should say to employers that insisting people work long hours is actually not good for your business
Professor Cary Cooper
University of Lancaster Lead researcher Dr Marianna Virtanen , from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health , said : " The disadvantages of overtime work should be taken seriously . "
It is not known why working long hours might have an adverse effect on the brain .
However , the researchers say key factors could include increased sleeping problems , depression , an unhealthy lifestyle and a raised risk of cardiovascular disease , possibly linked to stress .
The civil servants who took part in the study took five different tests of their mental function , once between 1997 and 1999 , and again between 2002 and 2004 .
Those doing the most overtime recorded lower scores in two of the five tests , assessing reasoning and vocabulary .
Cumulative effect
The effects were cumulative , the longer the working week was the worse the test results were .
Employees with long working hours also had shorter sleeping hours , reported more symptoms of depression and used more alcohol than those with normal working hours .
Professor Mika Kivimäki , who also worked on the study , said " We will go on with this study question in the future .
" It is particularly important to examine whether the effects are long - lasting and whether long working hours predict more serious conditions such as dementia . "
Professor Cary Cooper , an expert in workplace stress at the University of Lancaster , said it had been long established that consistently working long hours was bad for general health , and now this study suggested it was also bad for mental functioning .
He said : " This should say to employers that insisting people work long hours is actually not good for your business , and that there is a business case for making sure people have a good work - life balance .
" But my worry is that in a recession people will actually work longer hours .
There will be a culture of " presenteeism " - people will go to work even if they are ill because they want to show commitment , and make sure they are not the next to be made redundant . "
Harriet Millward , deputy chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " This study should give pause for thought to workaholics .
" We already know that dementia risk can be reduced by maintaining a balanced diet , regular social interactions and exercising both our bodies and minds .
Perhaps work - life balance should be accounted for too . "

Yeti evidence is ' convincing ' says wildlife expert Sir David Attenborough
Sir David Attenborough says there is ' convincing ' evidence the yeti exists
Sir David Attenborough believes there is ' very convincing ' evidence that yetis exist .
Speaking on Friday Night With Jonathan Ross , the revered wildlife expert said : ' I 'm baffled by the Abominable Snowman - very convincing footprints have been found at 19,000ft .
' No - one does that for a joke .
I think it 's unanswered . '
The yeti is an ape - like creature said to inhabit the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet .
A photograph of a mysterious footprint , rumoured to be that of the yeti was taken in the Menlung Basin in the Himalayas in 1951 .
A team of mountaineers travelled to the region on a reconnaissance mission before attempting to conquer Everest for the first time , a feat achieved two years later .
Eric Shipton recorded the footprint , and Tom Bourdillon , passing on the evidence to his friend Michael Davies , wrote : ' Dear Mick , Here are the footprint photos : sorry for the delay .
We came across them on a high pass on the Nepal - Tibet watershed during the 1951 Everest expedition .
' They seemed to have come over a secondary pass at about 19,500 ft , down to 19,000 ft where we first saw them , and then went on down the glacier . '
In 1954 , the Daily Mail reported the discovery of hair specimens from what was said to be the scalp of a yeti .
Professor Frederick Woods Jones , an expert in human and comparative anatomy , failed to reach a conclusion , but said the dark brown hair was not from a bear or an anthropoid ( manlike ) ape .
Yeti ?
The footprint spotted by Eric Shipton
Alleged sightings and debate has continued through the decades - but so far no - one has been able to produce a clear , definitive photograph of the world 's most elusive being .
Tibetan folklore has it that the yeti is nocturnal , whistles , and can kill with a single punch .
Investigators believe that at least two types of yeti exist : the dzu - teh ( ' big thing ' ) , which is 7 ft - 8 ft tall , and the nich - teh , which is 5 ft - 6ft
Fur blur : A recent sketch of the Yeti thought to be prowling around the Himalayas
Sir David also spoke about not being able to halt climate change .
He said : ' We can never go back , there 's no doubt about that ... it 's the speed at which we 're changing .
' Before , it was thousands of years and now it 's decades ... but we can slow down the rate at which we change . '
Heavy drinkers are receiving nearly one in four of the UK 's liver transplants , it was revealed last night , igniting a furious row about the ethics of allocating organs to people with alcohol problems .
Figures show that transplants for heavy drinkers have risen by more than 60 % in the past decade , while waiting lists have lengthened .
In December 1997 , 180 people in the UK were awaiting a liver transplant , compared with 325 in the same month last year .
Dr Tony Calland , chairman of the British Medical Association 's medical ethics committee , said surgeons are within their rights to refuse transplants to anyone with alcohol - related liver disease if they do not demonstrate a genuine desire to stop drinking .
And the mother of a young woman whose organs helped to keep five people alive after she died said it was " offensive , terrible and unfair " that an increasing proportion of livers were going to people with serious alcohol problems .
Eunice Booker , whose 26 - year - old daughter , Kirstie , died in a car crash in 2006 , said : " I find it offensive that one in four of the livers donated go to alcoholics .
If there are two people side by side wanting a liver , and both have the right tissue match , and one is an alcoholic and one is n't , there 's no contest - you take the one who 's not an alcoholic , they are more entitled . "
Official figures that show in the year to 31 March 2008 , 151 liver transplants , out of a total of 623 carried out across the UK , went to people with alcohol - related liver disease - 23 % of the total .
By contrast , in the year to March 2007 , there were 94 liver transplants for people with alcohol - related liver disease , just 14 % of the overall total .
Calland acknowledged that the trend was raising new questions for surgeons , who are within their rights to insist that anyone with alcohol - related liver disease demonstrates a genuine intention to address their problem before the operation is approved .
" Organs are precious resources and should be used where the clinical outcome - the patient 's health - justifies the use of something so scarce , " Calland said .
" You have to have very definite evidence that the person is going to stop drinking .
If someone wo n't promise , you could refuse them the transplant on clinical rather than ethical grounds . "
Concerns about alcohol - related health problems in Britain are increasing .
A report by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine two years ago suggested that deaths from cirrhosis of the liver were rising faster in Britain than anywhere else in Europe .
The rise was especially sharp in men and women aged under 45 , where death rates now exceed the European average .
Last month , Alison Rogers , chief executive of the British Liver Trust , warned that " the death toll from alcohol remains unacceptably high " and that twice as many people are dying from alcohol as 15 years ago .
Some have questioned whether livers are being allocated fairly .
Professor Nigel Heaton , the surgeon who performed a liver transplant on alcoholic footballer George Best , said at the time that new measures were needed to identify patients likely to abuse alcohol after their operations so that medical staff could make an assessment as to whether there were more suitable candidates .
" If you knew someone was going to be recidivist , you would n't take them on for a transplant , " he said .
A spokesman for NHS Blood and Transplant , the special health authority that oversees transplants , said the decision to allocate each organ was made on a case by case basis :
" The patient 's surgeon assesses whether that person is fit physically and is able to cope with the rigours of living after a transplant . "
Liberal Democrat shadow culture , media and sport secretary Don Foster , who obtained the new transplant figures , said only by increasing the cost of alcohol could the nation 's health be saved from Britain 's binge - drinking culture .
" These figures are a stark warning about the impact alcohol is having on health services in this country , " he said .
" Recent studies have proven that the cheaper alcohol is , the more we all drink .
None of us wants to pay more for our alcohol , but with an alcohol crisis on our hands we have to look again at raising the price of the cheapest alcohol . "
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japanese electronics maker Pioneer Corp 6773 .
T said it would cut 10,000 jobs and pull the plug on its loss - making flat TV business , a move that could signal a further shake - out in the battered sector .
Pioneer , a niche player in the plasma TV market and one of the world ’s top makers of car electronics , also warned of a record annual loss of 130 billion yen ( $ 1.4 billion ) after being hit , like its rivals , by weak demand and a strong yen .
The company , unable to keep up with larger , more efficient producers like South Korea 's Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and Japan's Panasonic Corp 6752.T , said it would withdraw from the flat TV business by March 2010 .
Pioneer launched the world ’s first plasma TV in 1997 and for a short while carved out a valuable niche in high - end models .
“ It is extremely painful to give up a business we have built up as a pioneer in the industry , ” President Susumu Kotani told a news conference .
Pioneer controlled just 5.9 percent of the plasma TV market in the first nine months of 2008 , compared with Panasonic ’s 37.2 percent and Samsung ’s 22.8 percent , according to research firm DisplaySearch .
Other second - tier makers may also be forced out .
Those struggling to gain traction in the flat - TV market include Mitsubishi Electric 6503.T , JVC Kenwood Holdings 6632.T and Hitachi Ltd 6501.T .
“ Since Pioneer ’s flat TV operations are relatively small , this does n’t mean things will get better for remaining Japanese TV makers .
They will still face stiff competition from overseas makers , ” said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Yoshiharu Izumi .
“ The trend seems to be that only big players can survive in the flat TV industry .
It is getting really difficult for mid-sized makers to distinguish their products from rivals ’ with technological expertise alone . ”
FIVE YEARS OF RED INK
Pioneer said it would cut 6,000 regular employees and 4,000 temporary and contract staff .
Those cuts will come on top of the 5,900 jobs it already shed between last March and December and which reduced its global workforce to 36,900 .
Pioneer also said it was in talks with Sharp Corp 6753 .
T to set up an optical disc joint venture , and its home electronics operations will be scaled back to handle only such products as audio equipment and cable TV set - top boxes .
The decision to pull out of flat TVs was flagged by the company on Saturday when it said it was weighing various options including all - out withdrawal and termination of in - house TV production .
Pioneer now plans to focus resources on its car navigation systems and other auto electronics products .
Pioneer ’s car electronics division had until recently been profitable , in contrast to its home electronics operations .
But profitability at the cash cow operations came under pressure in recent months due to slumping car sales worldwide .
The company expects the division to post its first ever annual loss for the year to March .
Pioneer warned on Thursday that it now expected to post a net loss of 130 billion yen for the year to March 31 , its fifth - straight year of annual loss , compared with the company ’s prior forecast for a loss of 78 billion yen .
It cut its sales forecast by 20 percent .
Pioneer said it was likely to remain in the red in the next business year starting April 1 due to restructuring costs but aimed to turn profitable in the year beginning April 2010 .
Prior to the announcement , shares of Pioneer closed up 0.6 percent at 178 yen .
The benchmark Nikkei average . N225 lost 3 percent .
Maintain Your Investment
When you hire and train someone , you spend a significant amount of time and money getting them up to speed , creating a positive resource for your company .
Many times , the person suffering from addiction began as one of your top producers .
Over time , the quality of their work may have diminished , but you still rely on them because they have relationships that are meaningful to your bottom line .
Still , you ca n’t run your business effectively or profitably if your CFO is n’t giving you accurate numbers or your COO is distracted by a spouse suffering from addiction rather than paying close attention to your business systems .
The best way to maintain your investment in the people you hire is to offer them effective addiction treatment .
Not only will you return a valued employee to the highest levels of productivity , you ’ll also build loyalty from your employee and his / her loved ones .
Treat your employee ’s adult child for addiction , or the employee him / herself , and you ’ll have an employee who believes in and wants to be involved with your company for life .
" Kontoauszug " für Daten gefordert : Sammelwut soll transparent werden
Datenschützer fordern einen jährlichen Kontoauszug , der Auskunft über gespeicherte Daten gibt .
Darin sollen Firmen und Behörden auflisten , welche Daten sie zu welchem Zweck speichern .
BERLIN taz Haben Sie bei der Registrierung fürs Einkaufen bei Amazon auch eigentlich nur Ihre Adresse angegeben ?
Und wundern sich , warum das Internetversandhaus trotzdem weiß , welche Vorlieben Sie haben ?
Verboten ist den Unternehmen das Sammeln personenbezogener Daten zwar nicht .
Angenehm , was Firmen alles über einen wissen , aber auch nicht .
Der scheidende Landesdatenschutzbeauftragte von Baden - Württemberg , Peter Zimmermann , fordert Abhilfe für den Kunden und schlägt die Einführung von sogenannten Datenschutzkontoauszügen vor .
Damit werden Firmen und Behörden verpflichtet , einmal im Jahr den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern eine Auflistung zu schicken , aus der genau hervorgeht , welche Daten gespeichert und für welche Zwecke sie verwendet werden .
" Klingt zwar aufwendig " , sagt Zimmermann , angesichts des zu befürchtenden bürokratischen Aufwands - immerhin hieße das : Von Polizei über Sozialamt bis zur Krankenkasse wäre jede Behörde verpflichtet , einen solchen Datenschutzkontoauszug zu erstellen .
Wenn die Gesetzgeber das Grundrecht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung aber ernst nehmen , sei dieser Vorschlag nur " folgerichtig " , so Zimmermann .
" Zumindest sollte dieser Vorschlag weiter diskutiert werden . "
Was der baden - württembergische Landesdatenschutzbeauftragte aufgegriffen hat , ist in einschlägigen Internetforen unter dem Begriff " Datenbrief " bereits eine seit langem konkret ausformulierte Forderung : Verpflichtet werden müsse jede Firma und Behörde , die personenbezogene Daten von mehr als 500 Personen speichere oder verarbeite , fordert ein Nutzer ( www.frank.geekheim.de).
Zudem müsse der Datenbrief ein " Nein , ich will nicht - Formular " enthalten .
Auch eine Auskunft im Datenbrief , an wen und warum die Daten weitergegeben wurden , soll zu dieser Mitteilungspflicht gehören .
Damit das Ganze auch " Biss " bekommt , so die Forderung , müsse eine Schadenersatzpflicht von 10.000 Euro anfallen - zahlbar an den Betroffenen pro Einzelfall .
Auch Constanze Kurz , Sprecherin des Chaos Computer Clubs , unterstützt diese Forderung seit langem .
Sie sieht beim Datenbrief zwei Effekte : Dem Bürger wird bewusst gemacht , wie viele Daten inzwischen von ihm gespeichert werden .
Und er würde als Folge dessen viel häufiger auf sein Widerspruchsrecht auf Löschung der Daten pochen .
Dieses Widerspruchsrecht existiere zwar auch jetzt schon , so Kurz .
Doch kaum einer nehme es in Anspruch .
Vielen fehle einfach der Überblick , " wer alles hinter den Rücken der Bürger Daten sammelt " , kritisiert Kurz .
" Wir drehen den Spieß um . "
Wie viele Daten vor allem im kommerziellen Bereich inzwischen gesammelt werden , zeigen Umfragen .
Ihnen zufolge hat jeder Bundesbürger im Schnitt rund 20 Behörden oder Unternehmen seine Daten zur Verfügung gestellt .
Das wären rund 1,6 Milliarden Datenbriefe , die in Deutschland jährlich verschickt werden müssten .
Der unbekannte Blogger sieht darin kein Problem : " Werbung bekomme ich sowieso .
Da können sie mich auch gleichzeitig über den verarbeiteten Umfang meiner Daten informieren . "
Update : WE WON !
[ the following is now for historical interest ]
Uh oh .
Ministers are about to conceal MPs ’ expenses , even though the public has just paid £ 1 m to get them all ready for publication , and even though the tax man expects citizens to do what MPs do n’t have to .
They buried the news on the day of the Heathrow runway announcement .
This is heading in the diametric wrong direction from government openness .
You can help in the following three ways :
1 . Please write to your MP about this www.WriteToThem.com – ask them to lobby against this concealment , and tell them that TheyWorkForYou will be permanently and prominently noting those MPs who took the opportunity to fight against this regressive move .
The millions of constituents who will check this site before the next election will doutbtless be interested .
2. Join this facebook group and invite all your least political friends ( plus your most political too ) .
Send them personal mails , phone or text them .
Encourage them to write to their politicians too .
3 . Write to your local paper to tell them you ’re angry , and ask them to ask their readers to do the above .
mySociety ’s never - finished site http://news.mysociety.org might be able to help you here .
NB .
mySociety is strictly non-partisan , by mission and by ethics .
However , when it looks like Parliament is about to take a huge step in the wrong direction on transparency , we ’ve no problem at all with stepping up when changes happen that threaten both the public interest and the ongoing value of sites like TheyWorkForYou and WhatDoThey Know .
Update : Every page on TheyWorkForYou , our biggest site , is now strongly encouraging people to join the protest .
Update :
We ’ve sailed past 1000 members to our Facebook group .
Onward and upward !
Update :
And now past 3000 members !
Also , some MPs are claiming that they need to vote for this Order to protect their addresses , even though they already changed to law to do this .
Doh !
Update :
Now we ’re past 6500 , and our supporters have mailed their constituency MPs in over 90 % of the constituencies in the UK .
And rather helpfully , President Obama has just given us a concise explanation for MPs why this is a much bigger issue than some bits of paper and some minor embarrassment :
“ And those of us who manage the public ’s dollars will be held to account – to spend wisely , reform bad habits , and do our business in the light of day – because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government . ”

National Service Corps Bill Clears Senate Hurdle
Posted on by melt
Following overwhelming
House passage last week , the Senate tonight voted 74 to 14 on a procedural move that essentially guarantees a major expansion of a national service corps , a cornerstone of volunteerism that dates back to the era of President Kennedy .
It s akin to a call to arms by President Obama , who has harkened back to those early days to demand giving back by those who voted for him .
In fact , Senator Edward M. Kennedy , the senior Democrat from Massachusetts whose battle with brain cancer has oft kept him absent from the Senate these days , appeared on the floor to welcomes all around as he cast his approving vote as a co-sponsor .
From President Kennedys days to the creation of Americorps by then President Bill Clinton , the notion of public service has become a rallying cry .
Tonights vote , propelled by President Obamas urging of an expansion , would mean a growth in such work from 75,000 community service jobs to 250,000 .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , the cost of the Senate bill at least would be an outlay for the fiscal year 2010 of $ 418 million to about $ 5.7 billion from 2010 through 2014 .
It s an historic vote in the sense that a national service corps , an army dispersed to help with education , health services and the environment , would vastly enlarge the notion of community organizing ,  and allow , as Senator Barbara Mikulski , Democrat of Maryland , said tonight , for about 7 million people to be engaged in such work .

But Mr. Obama has also said his recovery plan must make down - payments on his campaign promises for permanent changes that will reshape the economy , especially for the good of low - wage and middle - class workers .
Such changes could carry permanent costs for new energy , education , health care and tax policies .
For example , Mr. Obama previously indicated that he would seek money to develop a national energy grid to harness and distribute power from wind , water and other local alternative energy sources .
Additional money to subsidize local governments ’ education costs in the downturn could become a fixture , increasing the once - small federal role beyond its expansion under President Bush .
Besides money for school construction and renovations , Congressional aides said they expected an increase in financing to educate students with disabilities and special needs .
Officials also are exploring potential increases for Head Start childhood education programs and Pell Grant scholarships for college students .
Rather than propose a one - time tax rebate for all but the most affluent Americans , Mr. Obama is likely to propose what he called during his campaign a “ Making Work Pay ” tax credit of $ 500 for eligible individuals and $ 1,000 for couples .
Those who earn too little to pay federal income taxes would receive the credit in the form of a check , intended to offset the payroll taxes they pay for Social Security and Medicare .
Disputes also are percolating in the Obama camp and between Congressional committees over what constitutes spending earmarks for special projects , which Mr. Obama has sworn to oppose .
The disputes are similar to , if less testy than , past tiffs between Mr. Bush and Congress .
Democratic leaders in Congress say they are serious about helping Mr. Obama keep the emerging legislation free of the pork - barrel projects that could invite criticism from Republicans and foster public skepticism .
“ Every dollar will have to be justified as to whether it is targeted to our economy , ” Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California , said last week .
“ This is not a bill that will be an excuse to put things in that otherwise might not be justified . ”
Some Western diplomats had expected Mr. Biden to announce a strategic review of the planned missile defense system as a way to defuse tensions between Washington and Moscow .
Although Mr. Biden did not go that far , he did leave room in both the speech  and an interview afterward  for unspecified changes in the plan put forward by the Bush administration .
“ We will continue to develop missile defenses to counter a growing Iranian capability , provided the technology is proven and it is cost - effective , ” Mr. Biden said during the speech .
Foreign policy experts said that the Obama administration was most likely averse to making any outright concessions on the antimissile system just days after the Kyrgyz announcement , fearing it could be interpreted as a sign of weakness .
Mr. Biden , they said , seemed to be balancing the need to appear firm with the administration ’s hopes to reverse the several - year slide in American - Russian relations .
Russian cooperation is considered important to American attempts to keep Iran and North Korea from continuing with their nuclear programs .
The missile defense plan as it had been envisioned by the Bush administration would place missile interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic .
The Russians balked at the placement so close to their border , saying it was proof that the system was meant to combat their nuclear arsenal , rather than a missile threat from Iran as President Bush had said .
Mr. Biden did not say in his speech where he expected the system to be based .
In an interview after the speech , Mr. Biden declined to say what changes might be considered .
“ What I did say in the speech is that we would consult with our European allies as well as consult with the Russians , ” he said .
Jesus Christ , some people just dont know how to control it .
The worst part is that there was no security staff in that place .
Mr Berlusconi says that the number of sexual assaults fell 10 % last year Italy 's government has rushed through a decree to crack down on sexual violence and illegal immigration after a spate of rapes blamed on foreigners .
The decree sets a mandatory life sentence for the rape of minors or attacks where the victim is killed .
It also establishes rules for citizen street patrols to be conducted by unarmed and unpaid volunteers .
The number of sexual assaults fell last year , but three high - profile rapes last weekend sparked national outrage .
These included the rape of 14 - year - old girl in a park in Rome on Saturday , allegedly by two men from Eastern Europe .
A Bolivian woman was raped in Milan by a man described as North African , while in Bologna , a Tunisian who had just been released from prison was re-arrested for allegedly raping a 15 - year - old girl .
Volunteers who take part in patrols will not be armed but they will have mobile phones and radios
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni
Italy torn by racial strains Italy 's migrants slowly integrating
The decree , passed by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 's conservative government , goes into effect immediately but must be approved by both houses of parliament within 60 days .
It speeds up trials for sex offenders caught in the act , takes away the possibility of house arrest , and gives free legal assistance to victims .
It also sets rules for citizen street patrols , in which officials said retired police and soldiers would play a major role .
" Volunteers who take part in patrols will not be armed but they will have mobile phones and radios for reporting things to security forces , " said Interior Minister Roberto Maroni , a member of the anti-immigrant Northern League .
Local mayors would decide " how , where and when to use these volunteers " , he said .
Critics say the measures could effectively legitimise vigilantism and xenophobia .
The Vatican has warned against anything that turns innocent foreigners into convenient scapegoats .
Extended detentions
Many recent rapes have been blamed on foreigners , especially Romanians .
Violent attacks on immigrants have since been reported .
Police say a mob of around 20 masked men beat up four Romanians outside a kebab restaurant in Rome on Sunday in an apparent vigilante attack .
The government has pointed to official statistics saying immigrants committed as many as 35 % of crimes in Italy in 2007 .
Life in Italian Roma camps
In pictures
But analysts and opposition parties say many of these are related to breaches in immigration rules , and that foreigners have often been unfairly targeted amid a xenophobic backlash from right - wing politicians and the media .
The Roma ( Gypsy ) community , many of whom are long - standing Italian residents , have often borne the brunt of this reaction , they say .
Authorities in the capital began dismantling unauthorised camps housing Roma groups amid an outcry over recent rapes earlier this week .
Officials statistics put Italy 's Romanian community at more than 600,000 , making it the largest immigrant group in the country .
Some Roma are Romanian , but many are from other Balkan countries and some hold Italian citizenship .
Romanian Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu was reported as rejecting on Friday an Italian proposal that his country take back Romanians blamed for crimes in Italy .
He said 33 convicted Romanians were currently awaiting repatriation .
The Romanian government and the EU have both expressed concern at Italy 's recent immigration policies .
Friday 's decree also allows authorities to detain immigrants for six months , up from two months , as they try to identify them and process asylum requests .

Paradoxes of Infinity in “ The Annotated Turing ” January 13 , 2009
New York , N.Y .
A couple readers have emailed me about an apparent contradiction on page 32 of my recent book The Annotated Turing : A Guided Tour through Alan Turing 's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine , and of course the problem area involves that nasty thing we call " infinity . "
Mathematicians , metaphysicians , philosophers , and just plain folk have been wrestling with infinity for at least a couple thousand years .
The big problem is that we can't make any analogies with the real world because infinity does not exist in the real world .
The universe consists of a finite amount of mass / energy and occupies a finite ( although expanding ) space .
One of the wisest people to illuminate the subject of infinity was Aristotle , mostly in Chapters 4 though 8 of Book III of Physics , which I quote in Chapter 16 of The Annotated Turing .
Aristotle differentiates an actual or completed infinity — which he contends does not exist — and a potential infinity , which is the type of infinity we associate with the natural numbers :
Generally speaking , the infinite exists by one thing being taken after another .
What is taken is always finite on its own , but always succeeded by another part which is different from it .
( trans . by Robin Waterfield , Oxford World Classics ed. )
And check out this brilliant statement :
Infinity turns out to be the opposite of what people say it is .
It is not " that which has nothing beyond itself " that is infinite , but " that which always has something beyond itself . "
Regardless of Aristotle 's warnings , we still toss around words like " infinite " and " infinity " as if these concepts actually mean something .
When we refer to an " infinite set " we do not mean that the set contains an infinite number of elements .
What we really mean is that we are never finished constructing the set .
For example , consider the set of natural numbers :
{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , ... }
The ellipsis suggests the process of constructing the set .
Constructing this set is a never - ending process , a fact that is clearly demonstrated by a little computer program written in pseudo - code to generate the natural numbers :
num = 0
while ( true )
{
print num
num = num + 1
}
I 'm assuming that num can get as big as it needs to get , but obviously at some point we 'll run out of available resources in the universe .
At some point there will not be enough mass or energy in the universe to continue running the program .
Does it make sense to discuss the number of elements in this set of natural numbers ( referred to as the set 's cardinality ) ?
Perhaps not , but if we feel we must , let 's use the symbol Georg Cantor chose for this purpose .
The cardinality of the set of natural numbers is
ℵ 0
called " aleph null . "
That 's the first of Cantor 's transfinite numbers .
Now let 's construct another infinite set : the set of real numbers .
Oh , too big ?
Let 's make it easier :
Let 's construct the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 .
We can symbolize such as set similar to the way we symbolized the set of natural numbers — by writing down the first few elements followed by an ellipsis , like this :
{ 0 ,
and Yikes !
What 's the second element ?
We do n't know , and this problem is serious :
Not only will we never finish constructing the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 ; we can't even get started !
That 's why we can't symbolize the set of real numbers like we symbolize the set of natural numbers .
That 's why there 's a special symbol for the set of real numbers :
ℝ
The set of real numbers is a non-enumerable set .
We can't list the elements of the set the way we can begin listing the elements of the set of natural numbers .
We can't construct the set of real numbers , and for that reason , some mathematicians ( like L.E.J. Brouwer ) do not consider the set of real numbers to be a set at all !
( And I tend to agree , in case you 're curious about my personal philosophy of mathematics . )
If you think about this stuff long enough , you might suddenly bolt out of bed at 3:30 AM one morning and shout " Eureka !
I know how to write a program that generates all the real numbers between 0 and 1 ! "
It looks something like this :
denominator = 2
while ( true )
{
numerator = 1
while ( numerator < denominator )
{
print numerator / denominator
numerator = numerator + 2
}
denominator = denominator * 2
}
The first time through the outer loop , the program prints 0.5 .
The second time , it prints 0.25 and 0.75 .
The third time , it prints 0.125 , 0.375 , 0.625 , and 0.875 .
Et cetera .
It appears that this program is progressively filling up the real number continuum between 0 and 1 , but it 's not quite adequate .
Every number printed by this program is a rational number .
The program never never never prints a non-rational number .
It will never print the square root of 2 , for example , or π .
This is not a way to generate the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 .
( And this is what I assert in the footnote on page 32 of The Annotated Turing . )
Georg Cantor proved that there is no way to generate a set of real numbers , and this fact is essential to the proofs in Turing 's paper .
The problematic part of page 32 is n't the footnote , but the main text the footnote hangs on .
This is where I attempt to derive the cardinality of the set of real numbers .
This derivation is n't really necessary to the rest of the book , but it's an interesting result nonetheless .
Unfortunately , I make a statement that sounds as if a process of generating numbers conceptually similar to my second program does indeed generate all the real numbers between 0 and 1 .
This is only true if it 's treated as a completed infinity , and that is not proper .
It makes more sense to view this problem from the other direction :
Even if we can't actually construct the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 , let 's assume we have such a set anyway .
Let 's represent these numbers in binary .
Each of these real numbers consists of a infinite string of digits , where the digits are 0 and 1 .
In each of these real numbers , the number of digits is ℵ 0 .
Because each of these ℵ 0 digits can be either 0 or 1 , then the cardinality of the set of real numbers is :
2ℵ 0
But the most important lesson is that the cardinality of the real numbers is way bigger than the cardinality of enumerable sets like the rational numbers .
That 's the essential knowledge for understanding Turing 's paper .

A MOB of Britain 's finest eccentrics will gather in central London on February 28th .
Their ranks will include outspoken novelists , radical lawyers and fed - up judges .
David Davis , an unusual MP who left the shadow cabinet to wage guerrilla war from the backbenches , will be there ; so will Shami Chakrabarti , the relentless head of Liberty , a pressure group .
Several of those attending can sometimes seem pious ; but in a stubborn , deeply English way , many are rather magnificent .
The occasion is the “ convention on modern liberty ” , an event designed to rally opposition to the ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms in Britain ( there will be similar meetings in other cities ) .
It might not seem the best moment for the ragtag gang to make its stand .
The hour of the leviathan is nigh : the financial crisis has given the state permission to meddle in places that would once have seemed indecent .
Economic “ fairness ” has eclipsed most talk of the judicial kind .
Even in the fat times , often it was only the eccentrics who seemed to care about habeas corpus , due process or the use of anti-terrorist laws to quell hecklers at the Labour Party conference .
Surely the slump is not the time to reclaim liberties that were casually cancelled during the boom ?
Precedents in Britain and elsewhere do indeed suggest that freedom often contracts in line with GDP .
People get angry .
They misbehave : crime may rise , as a leaked Home Office memo predicted last year .
They march , demonstrate and occasionally riot : newspapers this week reported lurid police warnings about a forthcoming “ summer of rage ” .
They become more susceptible to extreme , xenophobic voices : there is widespread anxiety in British politics about a breakthrough by the loathsome British National Party at the European elections in June .
Capturing a Euro - seat would represent a triumph for the far right greater than any achieved by Oswald Mosley and his blackshirts in the 1930s .
The big risk to civil rights could come in the way the government responds : in the methods it uses to contain the wrath , to cater to it and to distract the wrathful .
It would , sadly , be unsurprising if ministers were to echo far - right rhetoric about immigrants instead of wholeheartedly repudiating it ; they might tout even more inhumane policies towards asylum - seekers and terrorist suspects .
Demos may be met with harsh counter - measures ( Liberty was formed to protest against police treatment of the “ hunger marchers ” who came to London during the Depression ) .
Any such crackdowns will have to be orchestrated on a tight budget .
But that might make them harsher : a home secretary who can't afford to recruit police officers might instead give the ones she does have yet more intrusive powers .
As Mr Davis satirically puts it , “ if you can't stop violent crime , at least make bloodcurdling noises about what you 'll do to the few violent criminals you do manage to catch . ”
Eternal vigilance
That is the gloomy prognosis for civil liberties in the lean years .
Yet there is a rosier one .
To begin with , even if penury encourages ministers to take shortcuts , a lack of cash for security projects will help .
The technology of unfreedom is costly : number - plate recognition systems , identity cards and the government 's assorted , panopticonic databases of DNA and other information are hugely expensive ( always much more so than is at first estimated ) .
They will be a much harder political sell when spending in other areas is being cut .
Faith in such databases has anyway been undermined by civil servants ' unfortunate habit of leaving discs and computers on trains , by the pool , etc .
That incompetence has contributed to a general loss of confidence in government .
The campaigners ' hope is that , as public disenchantment sharpens , it will take in a scepticism about over - mighty criminal - justice policy as well as about economic oversight .
And the downturn , some say , may make liberty seem more precious rather than less .
Two foreign holidays a year and the odd flat - screen television , the argument runs , may once have represented ample freedom for many .
Britons may care more about , say , the abuse of surveillance powers by local councils when their bank accounts give them less freedom to shop and travel .
The hope , in other words , is that voters will prove able to think about more than one issue at a time .
Conversely , the government may be too embroiled in the economic mess to waste time in Parliament and use up the ebbing goodwill of Labour MPs on illiberal measures .
The abandonment , last autumn , of its bid to ram through an extension of pre-charge detention for terrorists could be a case in point .
Gordon Brown himself has had a somewhat anguished relationship with such initiatives , seeking to justify them intellectually even as he exploits them politically .
The recession offers ample cover for him to ditch some ( ID cards , for example ) without losing face .
As for the Tories , they are recent and wavering converts to the eccentrics ' cause .
Chris Grayling , the new shadow home secretary , has made manly noises about wanting “ fewer rights , more wrongs ” .
Other leading Tories are privately more authoritarian than their party 's officially liberal line .
But they have made some commitments — to scrap ID cards , for example — that will be difficult to disavow , if and when they take office .
The Liberal Democrats , who have assorted ideas for unwinding Labour 's nastier inroads on liberty , should help to keep them honest .
The credit crunch has shaken the kaleidoscope of British politics .
Banks have been nationalised ; ridiculed leaders have been lionised , then ridiculed again .
It will doubtless have further unpredictable side effects — including , maybe , a creeping victory for the eccentrics .
Perhaps rights and liberty will remain a marginal concern , which few in a pinched Britain have the time or inclination to worry about ; yet it may be the price of restricting freedom that proves too high for politicians .
Liberty could turn out to be one of the few things that prosper in the slump .
Anna Giabanidis says law and order has broken down in Athens Dozens of people have been injured and hundreds of properties torched in days of rioting across Greece over the police shooting of a 15 - year - old boy .
Trainee lawyer Anna Giabanidis has met the anarchists responsible for some of the violence and explains their perspective on events .
The views are the personal views of the contributor and do not intend to represent any one group in Greece .
Anna Giabanidis has been along to protests but has not taken part in any violence .
What I have to say may be easily misunderstood - I 'm not with the anarchists .
But I sympathise with what is happening right now .
The feeling here is if you have money and status you can pretty much do what you want
I think these people have been very much misunderstood .
Everything has escalated since the death of Alexis , as we know him over here .
It all dates back to about 1984 / 5 .
I do n't know the full details as I was n't born then but there 's a deep - seated and long - standing concern about the way things have been handled by the police and the authorities , and the death of the teenager has made things worse .
The feeling here is if you have money and status you can pretty much do what you want .
We have a saying here : " If you 've got money , you 're innocent . "
There 's a feeling that it 's the rich versus the rest , and there 's unity between those who are n't rich .
You just have to look at the reaction over the last few days to see how people have come together .
There are three groups involved .
There are the communists , who believe in peaceful protest and are not damaging property .
They are the ones who try to stop the others destroying buildings or burning banks .
The anarchists are the ones you may have seen on television wearing masks .
They are burning the banks and state property .
They do have support from some communists .
There 's been a total breakdown in law and order .
Send us your comments Greek voices : Protests and chaos Greece riots :
Your pictures
The third group are the younger people who like to think that they are anarchists but they do n't know what they stand for .
They are the ones who have been looting - they are neither anarchists nor communists .
They are calling themselves anarchists but making things 20 times worse .
I sympathise with them .
I went inside the university and spoke with some of them .
They feel the only way to make themselves heard is to do these things .
People have lost faith in the authorities or anyone in government - they are so angry .
They have started smoking and drinking on the metro - all rules are out .
There 's been a total breakdown in law and order .
I put an empty plastic bottle into a bin and somebody laughed and asked : " Why are you doing that ? "
Even ordinary people are questioning authority and I can't see it getting back on track for a long time .
We 'll need an election to get things back on track , we need a government response .
I fear it could escalate , I think someone 's going to die , because what I see first hand is not safe at all .
I 'm making Greece my home - I 've lived half and half between the UK and Greece but I want to live here permanently .
I love the people , the life and the culture - it matches my personality .
If anything , what is happening here now has strengthened my desire to make Greece my home .

What you see here is the result of a long and complicated search , but with an enormous amount of help from Daniel M. German I 've able to construct the conformal projection of the cube .
If your first reaction is to mutter : " " or just " " , and if you are interested , please follow these explanations ... You may have seen before panoramas projected in a cube : in flickr for example , there is a " foldables " group and I have some myself ( including other polyhedra ) .
These panoramas have all in common the use of the gnomonic orprojection : in this type of projection straight lines stay straight .
This is great for architectural photos , but as you can see for the model on the right , you get broken lines in the sides of the cube ( the columns of the cathedral seem to be broken ) .
It is possible in theory to devise a conformal projection that would show the sphere as a cube .
However it is very difficult to find information on such a projection .
The usual internet cartography sources , if they mention this projection , give no clue at all how it can be constructed .
The only reference is in this PDF file where a planisphere projected conformally in the cube is given , only quoting John Parr Snyder is the most precious reference for mathematical cartography available on the web , and though he died in 1997 his personal BASIC program used to generate maps is the only trace left of how he constructed the conformal cube ... mostly undocumented , and of course not portable at all .
Furthermore , the formulas used in that program are alltransformations , whereas the projection of an image needs theformulas .
But a reference was there !
a 1976 paper in Cartographica titled " Conformal Projections based on Elliptic Functions " by L.P. Lee ( another incredibly talented cartographer , " who retired in 1974 as Chief Computer in the New Zealand Department of Lands and Survey " ) seemed to be the source for these polyhedral globes .
Daniel German was very very helpful in locating this rather obscure publication ( and others ) , and I have to thank him for that !
The conformal projection uses an incredible 1872 theorem by Hermann Schwarz who showed that " the spherical triangles into which the surface of the sphere is divided by the planes of symmetry of the regular polyhedra can be conformally represented on the infinite half - plane by algebraic transformations of the stereographic projection on the central plane so that the vertices are represented by the points 0 , 1 , infinity on the real axis " .
Unfortunately the paper is in german and is probably even harder to get , so I will able to look how Schwarz showed this ... ( the source image for this shot is from the Notre - Dame - de - Reims Cathedral in Reims , France )

Consistent Hashing in memcache - client
2009-01-14
One of the most important features needed to create a scalable memcached infrastructure is consistent hashing .
I recently added consistent hashing to the Ruby memcache - client project and I want to take a moment to explain why this is important .
The Naive Approach
Memcached is simple in principle : just like a hashtable , a unique key maps to a value .
This is simple when you have a single memcached server , but what do you do if you have two servers ?
Which server is the key / value pair stored on ?
The naive approach is to hash the key to an integer and do a modulo based on the size of the server set .
For a given key , this should return the same , random server from the set every time .
idx = Zlib.crc32(key ) % servers.size
This works great – if the server set never changes .
Where It All Goes Wrong
Now our website is doing great and getting tens of hits per day so we find ourselves needing to add a new memcached server in order to handle the surge in traffic .
We add the new server , restart our daemons and soon the database disk ( s ) grinds to a halt .
What happened ?
When you change the server set , the modulo value for most of the key hashes changes .
This means that memcache - client goes to the “ wrong ” server , the lookup misses and that expensive operation you are caching needs to be performed again .
You essentially get a storm of recalculation as your cache contents shift from their old server to their new server .
Enter the Continuum
The better algorithm , instead of using modulo , uses a predefined continuum of values which map onto a server .
We select N random integers ( where N is around 100 or 200 ) for each server and sort those values into an array of N * server .size values .
To look up the server for a key , we find the closest value >= the key hash and use the associated server .
The values form a virtual circle ; the key hash maps to a point on that circle and then we find the server clockwise from that point .
Results
Assume we have 3 memcached servers and want to add a fourth .
The continuum approach will invalidate 1 / 4 or 25 % of your keys .
The modulo approach will invalidate 3 / 4 or 75 % of your keys .
The more servers you have , the worse modulo performs and the better continuum performs .
The Future
I ’ve checked in this change into GitHub but have n’t released a new version yet .
I ’m waiting on one set of fixes and then I ’ll release 1.6.0 to RubyForge .
Tom White has a more in - depth explanation of consistent hashing .
Thanks to him for the image above .
I based my implementation on the explanation of libketama .
Dubai Developing World 's First Rotating , Energy - Efficient Building
February 13th , 2009 by Amiel Blajchman
Dubai has plans to build the world ’s first rotating building with independently moving floors .
What ’s more , plans call for it to be completely energy independent .
The self - powered Dynamic Tower will have revolving floors , with each one powered by wind turbines located in between the floor .
This will lead to the building looking radically different every time you look at it ( sort of like a constantly evolving Dali architecture ) .
Besides having wind turbines powering the skyscraper , photovoltaic cells will be installed on the roof of each of its apartments , allowing for each unit to produce electricity .
Engineered to be constructed from pre-fabricated pieces , architect David Fisher envisions that it will only require 80 workers in total to erect the structure .
Construction is anticipated to be finished by 2010 .

有別於一般我們常見的對於麗江的觀點，人們總是認為到了麗江，就會有豔遇，就會變得很脫俗，就會變成很與眾不同，就會覺得這才是人生，麗江彷彿被意識形態化了，因而在回到現實之後，我寫下了這篇文章...
很多人看了電視節目以及一些文藝書籍的介紹與感召，對麗江有一個被置入性的印象，認為這就是一個人間仙境，只要到麗江開一個客棧或者酒吧就可以理想的過一輩子，到了這裡彷彿可以忘卻所有不愉快的事情，從現實中脫離出來，其實在到麗江之前，我也有過這種想法，然而我覺得其實這只是一個非常成功的行銷案例而已...
現實中的麗江，除了漂亮的風景之外，我很抱歉的說，只屬於遊客，以及取悅遊客的商家而已，如果你無法接受我的觀點建議不要看下去，因為實際走在麗江的街上，才會發現客棧之多令人瞠目結舌，而如果你想經營好一家客棧，甚至是酒吧或其他的商家，首先你必須非常外向好客，喜歡結交四海各地的朋友，要有過人的公關能力，因為遊客是老大，幾乎沒有選擇的能力，否則你無法在這個過度競爭中的環境內生存下去...
而至於說，所謂的在麗江有許多的藝術家，比如說：歌手、樂團、畫家或其他的，或許可以說都是用以吸引遊客而已，他們的過人之處在於創造了一個差異化品牌，讓遊客趨之若鶩，是一種商業化的藝術文化，硬說的話只是所謂的通俗藝術，屬於消費品，或許我的觀點也是偏見，但真的想去找一些真正文化的東西，除了少數民族的一些文化之外，赫然發現連一家像樣的書店都沒有，比如說內地最知名的文化雜誌「城市畫報」也從缺，這點讓我感覺到有點不可思議...
或許可以這麼說，幾天的假期曬曬陽光，泡上一壺滇紅茶或者雲南小粒咖啡，坐在窗檯邊發發呆，或者在帶上一本流浪行走書籍，是一個不錯的選擇，讓人淨空一下，也藉這個機會讓自己的思路更為清晰，享受所謂的慢活，那麼這是非常好的地方，不過由於過度置入性的麗江印象，很多人都認為到麗江就是一種時尚，一種對於人生的追求，這或許就言過其實了...
我遇到了一些到麗江逃離現實的人，他們什麼都不做，整天關在房間內聽音樂、看書或者上網，美其名是重新找到自己，然而或許這麼做過於矯情，因為如果在自己每天會接觸到的環境容易壓抑自我，想要換一個環境，在自己生活週遭就很容易找到，可以找一家在生活週遭的咖啡廳或者休閒場所，就可以讓自己有不一樣的體驗，沒有必要大老遠的跑到麗江一趟...
可以這麼說，麗江就是給人這麼不現實的感覺，所以人們迷戀上了麗江，然而麗江並無法給人們太多期望中的東西，或許在麗江得到了短暫的海闊天空，但這或許也只是短暫的迷失或者說沉淪，這很可能只是你選擇了自我封閉、自我逃避而已，你可以選擇一直逃避，選擇活在自己的世界中，然而有一天你還是必須回歸現實來面對這些被你忽視的現實狀況...
麗江讓所有的遊客或者過客都會非常懷念，甚至比其他的旅遊勝地都有過之而無不及，或許這也是一種假期綜合症候群，過度美好的東西經常是短暫的，正因為人生不如意十之八九，正因為平凡中見偉大，所以人生才真實...
人們心中的麗江，已經跟真實社會中的麗江脫節，而且甚至美化了許多，人們想要的是在心中幻想的麗江，而可以說這個麗江一直都在你的心中，只是人們對其視而不見，大家都過於期待每天過著轟轟烈烈，或者是很不一樣的生活，或許改變個心境，平凡才是最美，這種心態會讓人更加的健康...

照片中的客棧僅供參考，我也不是住這家，呵呵...

Iran and the West : A History of Violence
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
Iran is celebrating the 30th anniversary of its historic Islamic revolution after three decades of siege warfare by the western powers .
To understand why relations between Tehran and the West are so bitter , we must understand their historical context .
Iran ’s jagged relations with the West began during World War II .
In 1941 , the British Empire and Soviet Union jointly invaded and occupied the independent kingdom of Persia , as it was then known .
This oil - motivated aggression was every bit as criminal as the German - Soviet occupation of Poland in 1939 , but has been blanked out of western history texts .
The Allies deposed Iran ’s ruler , Reza Shah , and installed his weak , pliant son , Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , on the throne as the latest puppet ruler in the British Empire .
But in 1951 , a highly popular Iranian democratic leader , Mohammed Mossadegh , became prime minister and promptly nationalized Iran ’s British - owned oil industry , ordering its profits be used to lift Iran from poverty rather than enriching Britain .
The Shah and his entourage of western advisors fled .
Two years later , US and British intelligence mounted a coup that overthrew Mossadegh , ending Iran ’s first democratic government .
The Shah was restored to the Peacock Throne .
Iran ’s oil wealth returned to British and , now , US control .
Washington and London proclaimed they had won an important victory against " Communism . "
Washington and London set about turning Shah Pahlavi into the " gendarme of the Gulf " to protect their oil interests .
The Shah quickly blossomed into a megalomaniac , styling himself the " Shah of Shahs , " and " Imperial Light of the Aryans " ( Iranians are an ancient Indo - European people ) , comparing himself to the ancient Persian emperors , Darius and Xerxes .
The Shah ’s relatives and Iran ’s tiny ruling , western - oriented elite looted the nation , living like pre-Revolution Russian royalty .
Wives of the elite flew to Paris to have their hair done for gala parties .
The nation ’s oil revenues went to buy large amounts of US and British arms and build gaudy palaces .
The rest of Iran remained mired in abject poverty as the nouveau riche royal court flaunted its wealth .
Iran ’s elite put on European airs and dismissed Islam as a backwards faith of superstitious peasants .
In this sense , they much resembled today ’s so - called " secular " Turks who bitterly oppose Islam .
Iranians who objected to the court ’s lurid ostentation , Iran ’s status as a Western puppet , or the looting of its oil wealth , were branded Communists or Islamic fanatics .
Savak , the vastly powerful security agency , imposed a reign of terror on Iran .
American and Israeli experts advised and taught Savak .
Real and imagined opponents of the Shah , the Shia clergy , and leftists all fell victim to Savak , whose tortures and brutalities were legendary , even by brutal Mideast standards .
Iran and Israel , both hostile to their Arab neighbors , became very close allies , to the fury of deeply religious Iranians and the Shia clergy , which strongly supported the Palestinians .
The Shah even negotiated to buy Israeli missiles with nuclear warheads in exchange for a steady supply of oil .
Washington offered to sell Iran 26 nuclear reactors .
By the late 1970 ’s , the Shah ’s imperial pretensions , the arrant corruption of his corrupt family , and the elite ’s scorning of Islam brought Iran to a boil .
In 1979 , an exiled Shia religious leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeni , returned from exile in France and led a popular revolution that quickly overthrew the hated Shah .
The US was caught flat - footed by Iran ’s revolution .
It had relied entirely on Savak for political information .
Popular fury quickly turned against the Shah ’s primary supporter , the US .
Mobs stormed the US embassy , taking hostages and bringing the two nations close to war .
The shredded CIA documents patiently pieced together by Iranian women showed the amazing extent of the CIA ’s influence over Iran .
All the CIA ’s networks were rolled up .
Ayatollah Khomeini proclaimed his nation ’s oil wealth would be devoted to social programs .
He called on the US - backed Arab oil states to follow the Koran ’s teachings and share their wealth with poor Muslims everywhere .
He called for the overthrow of other Mideast rulers , whom he damned as illegitimate apostates and western puppets .
Washington and London immediately began planning the overthrow of Iran ’s new revolutionary Islamic government which directly threatened the Anglo - American domination of the Mideast — what I call in my new book , American Raj .
The CIA sought to mount a number of military coups .
Forty percent of Iran ’s government leaders were assassinated by the Marxist " People ’s Mujahidin . "
In 1980 , when these efforts failed to overthrow the Islamic regime , the US , Britain and their Arab oil clients got another US " gendarme " — Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein — to invade Iran .
The resulting bloody , eight year Iran - Iraq war cost Iran one million casualties , half of them dead .
Iran suffered more dead in this war than the US did in World War II .
So violent and desperate was the World War I — style trench fighting that 12 - year old Iranian boys and old men went forward to clear Iraqi minefields with their bodies .
The US , Britain , and the oil Arabs financed and helped arm Iraq .
Israel sold Iraq a reported $ 5 billion in US arms and spare parts .
Europe supplied Iraq with chemical weapons , food and arms .
After the US Navy entered the war on Iraq ’s side , Iran was forced to sue for peace .
Iran lay in financial and emotional ruins , with an entire generation killed in battle or horribly maimed by Iraq ’s western - supplied chemical weapons that included the burning agents mustard gas and Lewisite , chlorine , cyanide , and a variety of modern nerve gases .
Rightly or wrongly , most Iranians blame the West for their historical suffering .
They see the Western powers and Israel continuing efforts to overthrow their government , isolate Iran , and seize its oil .
Or even launch a long - awaited air blitz against Iran ’s so - far civilian nuclear program .
A former commander in the Iran - Iraq War , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who led many dangerous missions behind Iraqi lines , is today the president of Iran .
While Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains the nation ’s real executive power , the bombastic , anti-Western Ahmadinejad speaks for much of Iran ’s people .
President Barack Obama , who says he wants to open serious talks with Iran and establish better relations , will have his work cut out for him .

The Best of Eric S. Margolis
With the stronger stun guns and the civilian - oriented TASER brand devices now on the market , such as the C2 , X26C and the new TASER brand X3 Home Defender device , whose ‘ Semi- Automatic ’ mode allows users to strike and incapacitate up to three people without reloading , law enforcement needs to be protected from this emerging threat .
G Squared Consulting is excited about providing our outstanding line of cutting edge multi- threat energy protection items , including our Thorshield apparel , to law enforcement .
With more and more stuns guns and TASER brand devices in the hands of the civilian population , as well as the ever present risk of an officer having their TASER brand device used against them , we know that we are offering valuable products .
The unparalleled multi - threat protection our products and technology offer law enforcement is something they really need .
So carrying it is a real value add for manufacturing and distributing companies .
More Uzi-clubbing : a counter­example
Last year I wrote an article about iterating over a hash , searching for a certain key .
Larry
Wall called said this was like " clubbing someone to death with a loaded Uzi " , because the whole point of a hash is that you do n't have to scan all the keys to find the one you want .
I ended the article by saying : I had already realized that you could , in principle , commit this error with a regular array instead of with a hash , but I had never seen an example until ...
Just recently I saw another example , which I think is interesting because it seems to be a counterexample .
It 's part of a somewhat longer Java program .
The crucial section is : ... LINE : while ( ( line = in.readLine ( ) ) != null ) { String [ ] fields = line.split ( " \t " ) ; ... for ( int i = 0 ; i < fields .
length ; i++ ) { if ( ! is Empty ( fields [i ] ) ) { switch ( i ) { case 0 : citation.setCitationType(fields[i ] ) ; break ; case 1 : setAuthors ( citation , fields [i ] , personHome , false ) ; break ; case 2 : citation.setPublishYear( Integer.parseInt(fields[i ] ) ) ; break ; case 3 : citation.setTitle( fields[i ] ) ; break ; ... case 19 : citation.setURL(fields[i ] ) ; break ; case 20 : citation.setDoi( fields[i ] ) ; break ; default : warn ( " Empty field expected , found : " + fields [ i ] + " for line : " + line ) ; break ; } } } } ...
The Perlishness of this Java code might lead you to think that I wrote it , but I did not .
My temptation here was to replace the loop and the switch with code like this : citation.setCitationType(fields [ 0 ] ) ; setAuthors ( citation , fields [ 1 ] , personHome , false ) ; citation.setPublishYear( Integer.parseInt(fields[ 2 ] ) ) ; citation.setTitle( fields [ 3 ] ) ; ... citation.setURL(fields [ 19 ] ) ; citation.setDoi( fields [ 20 ] ) ;
We lost the warnings , but there were only 4 of those , so we can add them back explicitly : if (! is Empty ( fields [ 13 ] ) ) warn ( " Empty field expected ... " ) ;
This might have been an improvement , except that we also lost the isEmpty tests on the nonempty fields .
To get them back we must spend at least all our gains , possibly more : if (! is Empty ( fields [ 0 ] ) ) citation.setCitationType(fields [ 0 ] ) ; if (! is Empty ( fields [ 1 ] ) ) setAuthors ( citation , fields [ 1 ] , personHome , false ) ; if (! is Empty ( fields [ 2 ] ) ) citation.setPublishYear( Integer.parseInt(fields[ 2 ] ) ) ; if (! is Empty ( fields [ 3 ] ) ) citation.setTitle( fields [ 3 ] ) ; ... if (! is Empty ( fields [ 13 ] ) ) warn ( " Empty field expected ... " ) ; ... if (! is Empty ( fields [ 19 ] ) ) citation.setURL( fields [ 19 ] ) ; if (! is Empty ( fields [ 20 ] ) ) citation.setDoi( fields [ 20 ] ) ;
So at least in this case , my instinct to eliminate the loop - switch was not helpful .
There are plenty of Java - esque techniques for cutting up the complexity and sweeping each little piece underneath its own little carpet ( " Replace fields with an object !
Or with a series of 20 objects ! " ) but nothing that actually reduces the entia multiplicantis .
There may be ways to easily improve this code , but I have not been able to think of any .

Palm is replacing its legacy operating system with an innovative new Linux - based webOS platform that will support application development with web technologies .
We got some early clues about the platform SDK from a developer shortly after the launch , but those few tantalizing hints were n't enough to satisfy the techno - lust of those of us who are eagerly awaiting the public SDK launch .
Fortunately , Palm has decided to give us a sweet hit of the good stuff with new technical details that have been published at the Palm Developer Network website .
The new documentation is the first chapter of a book about webOS that is being authored by Palm CTO Mitch Allen in collaboration with the O'Reilly publishing company .
The chapter provides a basic overview of the webOS platform and introduces its intriguing application model and some of the basic terminology behind its user interface paradigms .
Palm 's webOS leverages standards - based web technologies and allows third - party developers to build complete applications using a mix of HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
It uses a custom JavaScript framework called Mojo and bundles some popular third - party JavaScript libraries , including Prototype .
Stages and scenes
WebOS applications are displayed on " stage " elements , which are described with HTML and contain various " scene " elements .
Scenes are organized in a stack and can be displayed or removed programmatically with push and pop actions that are executed through the JavaScript scene assistant .
Basic widgets are described in HTML by inserting a div element with a custom x-mojo- element attribute that specifies the name of the widget .
The user interface elements are accessible through the DOM and can be styled with CSS .
Various widget events can be bound to JavaScript callback functions .
Access to underlying platform capabilities is provided by the Services API , which is accessible through a JSON bridge .
This gives applications access to the device 's geolocation , telephony , and camera capabilities .
The Service API system seems to be a generalized abstraction layer through which a wide range of external services and data sources can be exposed .
According to the chapter , it can also be used to access web services and data from various applications on the device .
It seems likely that it 's extensible , but no details have been provided yet to indicate how that works .
The platform supports headless background services that interact with the user through passive notifications and interactive dashboard elements .
Persistent data storage in webOS is facilitated by the HTML 5 database features .
The platform 's integrated media server supports audio and video playback through the open source GStreamer media engine .
Applications are organized into a particular directory structure and are bundled with various resources and an appinfo .
json file that will include application metadata .
Although many aspects of the webOS platform are built on existing standards , this is one that is not .
It 's a little disappointing that Palm did n't adopt the nascent w3c web widgets spec .
Applications will have to be signed in order to run on the device .
The signing services will be provided through the Developer Portal and applications will be deployed to end users through Palm 's new Application Catalog .
From the details available in the chapter , it seems as though there is not going to be a single official IDE for building webOS applications .
The SDK will include command - line tools and some plugins to aid webOS development with a variety of existing HTML editors including Eclipse and Aptana Studio .
After reading through all nine pages of the first chapter , I 'm moderately impressed with what I 've seen .
It appears as though webOS significantly lowers the barriers to entry for new developers and makes it easy to adapt and reuse existing JavaScript code .
I still have some doubts about the performance implications of using web - based technologies pervasively throughout the platform , however .
Unfortunately , Palm has still not yet disclosed any technical details about the inner workings of the application runtime .
The additional details that have been released in this first chapter have answered quite a few of my own questions about webOS application development .
It 's starting to look like a very promising platform and I 'm looking forward to exploring it in greater detail when the SDK is released .
WASHINGTON -- Frustrated by Republican unity against his economic - stimulus plan , President Barack Obama toughened his rhetoric Thursday and moved to wield his personal popularity to overcome opposition in Congress .
Mr. Obama 's recent courtship of Republicans gave way to blunt derision of their ideas for the stimulus , as he tried to raise the political pressure to pass a measure with a price tag of over $ 900 billion in the Senate .

Robert Knight was about to install wireless transmitters on eight new drilling rigs joining the thousands that dot the ravines and mesas here when he got the startling news :
All but one of the rigs were coming down .
Falling natural gas prices had led energy firms to abruptly curtail their work here last month , battering the last sector of the U.S. economy that had prospered despite the recession .
“ Boy , it was quick , ” said Knight , who has a business installing communication equipment and who serves as the town manager .
“ It was like the difference between night and day . ”
The sky - high oil and natural gas prices that burdened consumers during much of the decade were a blessing to residents of this tiny town and other energy - rich communities from Alaska to Arkansas .
Even as the national economy went into a tailspin in early 2008 , home prices in boomtowns like Parachute kept rising and the streets were packed with shiny new pickups .
Advertisement
But prices suddenly began to drop in September -- natural gas is down 50 % from its peak and oil has plummeted from a high of $ 136 per barrel to about $ 40 .
The plunge brought some relief to recession - racked consumers , but has raised anxieties in Parachute , a town of 1,500 that bears the scars of busts that followed previous energy booms .
In better times , “ you could n’t find a hotel room , you could n’t find a campground , you could n’t find a place to rent , ” said Laura Diaz , the town planning clerk .
That ’s changing fast .
“ On Christmas Day there were three U - Hauls in my neighborhood , ” she said .
“ It is a little frightening for the people who have been here and know the history . ”
Advertisement
According to the energy service company Baker Hughes , the number of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the U.S. has dropped 13 % since its peak in August .
Gary Flaharty , the company ’s director of investor relations , said the decline matches the industry ’s response to previous price drops .
Energy experts say the state of the economy could prolong this energy downturn .
“ The boom , absolutely , is over for the moment , ” said Pete Stark , vice president for industry relations at IHS in Englewood , Colo .
But energy - rich communities still have stronger economies than much of the rest of the nation .
The seven states with budget surpluses can thank the energy industry , said Arturo Perez , a budget analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Wyoming posts the nation ’s lowest unemployment rate , 3.4 % -- less than half the national rate .
Nonetheless , the reversal has been striking .

Last summer , New Mexico held a special legislative session to spend a $ 200 - million surplus fueled partly by energy revenue .
Now it is scrambling to close a $ 400 - million deficit .
Alaska , which socked away billions in oil revenue over the last decade , warns that unless oil prices rise , it will face a budget deficit .
In Parachute , 200 miles west of Denver , the change has been dramatic .
The town straddles I - 70 along the Colorado River , in the shadow of massive mesas and buttes .
On the slope of one mesa sits a subdivision of about 5,000 people that relies on Parachute businesses .
Built to house expected oil and gas workers in the 1980s , the development emptied out when the energy industry killed oil shale exploration in the Grand Valley in 1982 .
Advertisement
It had filled back up by this decade , as high natural gas prices made exploration in the rugged land of the Piceance Basin economically feasible .
The streets of Parachute and similar towns were clogged with flatbed trucks hauling drilling equipment .
Hotels were booked for months in advance .
The region barely felt the recession that followed the dot - com bust in 2001 , the recovery that followed , or the brutal downturn that began in late 2007 .
“ We ’ve had an economic bubble over us for some time , ” Knight said .
“ We ’ve been pretty well sheltered . ”
Then in December , it all changed .
Rumors began circulating about energy companies cutting jobs .
“ For Rent ” notices appeared on homes and in local newspapers .
Three hotel projects were put on hold , and the few existing hotels began to post vacancies .
Advertisement
“ We were known as the only one - stoplight town that had a traffic congestion issue , ” Knight said .
“ Compared to that , it ’s almost like a ghost town . ”
At VJ ’s Outlaw Ribbs , the regular flow of customers slowed to a trickle .
Some began stopping in to say goodbye -- they ’d been laid off and were heading back to their home states of Texas , Louisiana and elsewhere .
“ People we used to see every day , we just do n’t see anymore , ” said waitress Lori Ross .
She tried to look on the bright side -- when she rented a house last year there were 50 applications per open rental .
Now , she said , “ there are rentals everywhere . ”
Last week , Del Dawson , a local real estate agent , did what had been unthinkable in Parachute for several years :
He cut the prices on two homes .
Advertisement
Like some other local business leaders , Dawson remains optimistic about the region ’s long - term prospects .
He expects energy firms to redouble their efforts when the price of gas creeps back up -- local expectations are that will happen this summer or spring 2010 .
And many companies are maintaining a sizable workforce for their already drilled wells .
“ We still feel it ’s a boom , ” said Hayden Rader , a developer who has two projects underway in Parachute .
“ People are saying there ’s not enough work here , but we ’ve still got more than anyone else . ”
Yet residents are feeling the pain .
Amy Beasley and her husband run the Old Mountain Gift & Jewelry store downtown and a neighboring shipping business .
Their revenue has fallen this month , and people they know in the energy industry who had talked about an unending boom have abruptly lost their jobs .
A fourth - generation Parachute native , Beasley , 35 , has been ambivalent about the industry that keeps the town alive but has industrialized the wild lands where her family homesteaded .
She and her husband have discussed whether to close their shops given the severity of the downturn .
Advertisement
“ We ’re going to stick it out and try to weather the storm , ” she said .
“ It may slow down for a few years , but it ’s going to be back .
They ’re never going to leave us alone . ”

Artist 's Statement
It goes without saying that drugs are bad and that we at The Pain do not in any way condone their abuse .
Let the record show that the hooch did William Faulkner ’s prose , health , and complexion no favors , and he ended up cowering from invisible dive - bombing Jerries ; that Miles Davis mostly sat around watching TV while on heroin and only returned to making music after successfully kicking it ; and that as Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler made some very poor policy and strategic decisions , at least some of which might be attributed to the daily injections of amphetaimes his doctor had him on after ’ 42 or so , and that the bad end to which he ultimately came was a direct result of his own poor judgment .
Among others , he committed the most famous of the classic blunders : Never Get Involved in the Land War in Asia .
A textbook meth - head move .
In a clichéd denoument straight out of so many drug education filmstrips , he ended up shooting his wife and himself in an underground bunker while the Russian army closed in around his crumbling empire and his body was doused in gasoline and set on fire , and now he is the most hated person in world history .
" You see ?
You see what happens , Larry ?
This is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass . "
- Walter Sobchak .
Nevertheless , I felt a faint echo of the at - first - bemused - then - increasingly - alarmed disbelief , that creeping disconnect from consensual reality , that I felt back during the darkest days of the Bush administration when I read the recent expressions of what I can only assume was 100 % pro forma outrage and remorse over the Michael Phelps “ scandal . ”
Is this really national news --“ 23 - YEAR - OLD MAN SMOKES POT ” ?
( It reminds me of a time when my friend Boyd mocked my namby - pamby fears of getting somehow busted for an ill - advised fling : “ What kind of ' scandal ' are you imagining --‘ MAN FUCKS WOMAN !’? ” )
Who , exactly , is shocked by this revelation — eight - year - olds ?
Do eight - year - olds control the culture now ?
Do we all have to pretend we have the moral sensibilities of eight - year - olds for their benefit ?
And why are n’t we all publicly reviling and shunning the real villain in this story , the loathsome little tattle who sold the photo ?
Also , not sound to all Revenge - of - the - Nerds here , but why do we expect professional athletes to be role models for young people ?
Athletic excellence , like artistic excellence , is an amoral achievement .
Any asshole can do it .
( In fact being an asshole is far from a hindrance to achievement and fame . )
Also , the guy just won eight freaking Olympic gold medals .
And he has to know , on some level , that this is as good as his life will ever get .
That ’s got to be a hard thing to grapple with at age twenty - three .
Does anyone seriously expect him not to celebrate / console himself by getting fucked up ?
It seems to me that we as a nation are missing the real moral here , which is that this Olympic record - setting athlete smokes pot and was not immediately transformed into a subhuman junkie -- or , worse , as the teen propaganda always warns ( knowing that this is the worst imaginable thing for its target audience ) A Loser .
Or , as my colleague Emily Flake , a hard drinker who never misses a deadline , put it : " Being on drugs is no excuse for not getting shit done . "
I suspect that what gives drugs their irresistible allure for kids is less their “ role models ” using them than the hysterical overreactions of the most contemptible , hypocritical , censorious bullying authority - figure adults .
I mean , with lame - os and squares like that trying so desperately to keep you totally ignorant about something , you know that thing has got to be fun .
Hey , it was true for sex .
But s ee , now I ’m getting all apoplectic now over something really trivial and tabloidish .
This is what you get for paying attention to the news .
It 's just that , as someone who does n’t have kids , does n’t much like them , and resents having to live in a world that often seems to revolve around them , I have no patience for matters of grown - up law and policy being decided on the basis of what is n’t even actual concern for the well - being of children but rather inhibited adults ’ fantasies about childhood innocence .
Comedian Adam Carolla , after a visit to Europe , began referring to it as " AdultWorld , " because the government trusted you to drink a beer in the park without going apeshit and running amok looting and raping .
As a cartoonist , it is my natural and proper rôle to act as a cheerleader for unrepentant libertinism and vice .
But I am aware that my cartoon is read by the Impressionable Young , so let me step out of my official persona for a moment to say , in all seriousness , that drugs are to say the least something of a mixed bag , and the unfair fact is that one that is harmless and fun for your friend might turn out , because of some bullshit genetic diathesis , to be a deadly addictive poison for you .
And that in any event they tend to destroy rather than enhance ambition and talent over the long haul .
There is , appparently , no such thing as a neurochemical free lunch .
If I were you 'd maybe lay off them at least until you graduate high school .
Give your brain a chance to actually finish growing first before you begin the life 's work of demolishing it .
However , if you ever do achieve the ne plus ultra in your chosen field and become the idol of millions and get set up cushily for life with endorsement contracts , you have my official sanction to Do Bong Hits .

You think that do n't hurt ?
It hurts .
The longer a site has been around , the more content it tends to accumulate .
As website operators , we walk a fine line : too much content on every page and your site will look cluttered .
Too little , and users wo n’t be able to find all your website has to offer .
A tabbed box like the one pictured above is a nice bridge between the two extremes .
It allows you to show off a large amount of content without cluttering up a lot of space .
And this tabbed box has extra niceties that are sure to help your content get noticed .
What it Does
At the end of this two - article series , you ’ll be able to build a tabbed content box of your own that :
Is easily customized to fit the size and color scheme of your website .
Is either fixed or variable height .
Can automatically rotate through the tabs to draw interest .
Pauses its rotation when the user interacts with it .
This article will show you how to take the tabbed box from Photoshop to XHTML and CSS , and how to apply the basic jQuery functionality to make the tabs operate .
The next article will show you some advanced jQuery techniques to make your tabbed box even more dynamic and eye - catching .
The Photoshop Mockup
Like most of my projects , this one started life as a drawing roughly sketched out on a piece of paper .
Despite all the cool tools we web developers have at our disposal , paper and pencil are still by far the fastest way to rapidly prototype a new idea .
Here ’s a crappy iPhone photo of the drawing :
This is what I mean when I say I ’m not a designer , people .
Once you have a good idea as to what you ’re looking to do with your tabbed box , it ’s time to move into Photoshop ( or a similar editing tool ) .
If you ’re looking for an extremely barebones tabbed interface you can probably skip this step entirely , but I wanted my tabs to have a little pizzazz .
Here ’s a look at my Photoshop document :
It ’s nothing fancy : just two layers with gradients , a layer creating my borders , and my text .
Of course , your layout may be more complex than mine .
When I ’m working in Photoshop , I like to stop and think about how I ’m going to actually develop what I ’m building ( and I ’d advocate you do the same ! ) .
In this case , I knew that I wanted gradients on both my unselected tabs as well as the content box and that my unselected tabs should appear faded .
Once I had a pretty good mockup in place , I could start to visualize how my XHTML and CSS would work together to produce the result I was looking for .
The XHTML
Here ’s the basic XHTML I decided on for my tabbed box :
< div class = " tabbed - box " > < ul class = " tabs " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Tab #1</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Tab #2</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Tab #3</a></li> </ul > < div class=" tabbed - content " > < p >
Here 's my content for tab 1</ p> </div > < div class=" tabbed - content " > < p >
Here 's my content for tab 2</ p> </div > < div class=" tabbed - content " > < p >
Here 's my content for tab 3</ p> </div > </div >
I wanted to keep my XHTML as simple as possible , so that if I ever wanted to update the content my tabbed box , I would n’t have to dig through a lot of extra code to do so .
The box has three basic components : a wrapper div ( tabbed - box ) that holds my entire box together , an unordered list with links that will function as my tabs , and a series of divs ( tabbed - content ) to function as the containers for my tabbed content .
I decided early on to stay away from extra IDs on all my elements as much as possible , to keep the updating process as simple as possible .
Of course , that meant my jQuery would have to work smarter to figure out how the box works … but we ’ll get to that later .
The CSS
Developing the CSS for this box does take a little math and a good understanding of the box model , but it ’s not overly complex .
First we ’ll style our container box :
. tabbed - box { width : 302 px ; background : # fff url ( tabbed - body - bg.jpg ) repeat-x bottom ; border : 1 px solid #ddd ; }
The width here is the most difficult number to determine .
To come up with the number , I need to know two things : how much space I have to work with , and the number of tabs I plan to have .
( I could probably calculate all this dynamically in jQuery , but I prefer to use CSS to accomplish as much as possible before turning to scripting . )
The space allotted is determined by the size of the tabbed box ’s containing element : I built this box with CSS Newbie ’s sidebar in mind , which gave me just over 300 px of breathing room .
Next up , I need to consider the number of tabs I ’ll have .
My box will have three tabs .
If each of those tabs are 100 px wide , they then use 3 * 100 ( 300 ) pixels of space .
But do n’t forget : according to our design , two of those tabs will need a border on one side to create the tabbed effect .
This results in another two pixels added to our width , for a total of 100 * 3 + 2 ( 302 ) pixels .
But remember , with the borders I added to my tabbed - box class , my final overall width is 100 * 3 + 2 + 2 ( 304 ) pixels .
Next up , we ’ll style our tabs :
. tabbed -box .tabs li { list - style : none ; float : left ; } .tabbed - box .tabs li a { display : block ; width : 100 px ; padding : 5 px 0 ; font - weight : bold ; text - align : center ; text - decoration : none ; color : # 888 ; background : # fff url ( tabbed - tab - bg.jpg ) repeat-x bottom ; border - left : 1 px solid #ddd ; border - bottom : 1 px solid # ddd;} . tabbed - box .tabs li:first - child a { border - left : none ; }
First I ’m removing the list style and floating my tabs to the left to get them lined up horizontally .
Next I ’m making them block - level , so the entire tab becomes clickable .
Then I ’m setting them to the appropriate width ( 100 px in this case ) , giving them some padding , styling the text , applying my gradient background , and applying my borders to the left and bottom sides .
Next I have a rather specific rule : I ’m removing the left border on the first - child element : this means that my very first tab wo n’t have a border on its left side , since the containing box has a border there and we do n’t want to double up .
Of course , first - child is n’t supported by Internet Explorer 6 … but do n’t worry , we ’ll account for that in our jQuery .
Then all we have left to get our tabs in working order is to set how they behave in three states : hover , focus , and “ active ” :
. tabbed -box .tabs li a :hover { color : # 333 ; } .tabbed - box .tabs li a : focus { outline : none ; } .tabbed - box .tabs li a.active { background : # fff ; color : # 333 ; border - bottom : 1 px solid # fff ; }
I ’m giving my tabs a slightly darker text color in the hover state , to help the user see when they ’re hovering .
The focus state is there simply to remove the resulting outline in Firefox when the user clicks a tab : if you ’re one of those who insist on having a focus state , feel free to leave this rule out .
And finally , we have an active class .
This class will be applied by our jQuery to the tab that is currently open .
Here we ’re removing the bottom border and changing the background color to give it the appearance of an open tab .
And last but not least , we need to apply some styles to our tabbed - content divs :
. tabbed - content { padding : 3 em 1em 1em 1em ; display : none ; }
The padding simply pushes the content away from the edges of our box .
You can set this to whatever you wish .
And our display rule hides all our content , until it ’s called upon by our jQuery .
The jQuery
Since we ’re using the jQuery library to do most of our heavy lifting here , you ’ll need to include the jQuery library somewhere above the following code .
Because I decided to write my XHTML without a lot of extra IDs and classes , my jQuery is going to have to be a lot smarter when it comes to figuring out which tabs display which content .
My rationale is pretty straightforward : the first anchor in my unordered list should open the first tabbed - content div , the second one the second , and so on down the line .
Because our logic is so straightfoward , I can rely on the jQuery index functionality to do a lot of the hard math .
var currentTab = 0 ; function openTab( clickedTab ) { var thisTab = $ ( " .tabbed-box .tabs a " ).index(clickedTab ) ; $ ( " .tabbed-box .tabs li a " ) .removeClass ( " active " ) ; $ ( " .tabbed -box .tabs li a:eq ( " + thisTab + " ) " ) .
addClass ( " active " ) ; $ ( " .tabbed-box .tabbed -content " ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( " .tabbed-box .tabbed - content:eq ( " + thisTab + " ) " ) . show ( ) ; currentTab = thisTab ; }
I start out by declaring a global variable that I ’ll use throughout the script : currentTab .
The currentTab variable will hold the index ( an internal counter , like in an array ) of the tab we ’re currently on .
It will also serve later to decide which tab we open by default .
Our function looks more complicated than it is .
It requires one variable to be passed it : the clicked Tab variable , otherwise known as the tab the user just clicked on .
It then calculates the index of that tab ( if it was the 3rd tab , the index would be 2 ) and saves that number as thisTab .
Next , the script cycles through all our tabs and removes any instances of the “ active ” class if finds , before cycling through a second time and applying the active class to the tab that has the same index number as the tab that was clicked on ( in other words , the same tab ) .
This ensures we only ever have one active tab at a time .
Then we cycle through our content boxes , hiding them all before cycling through again and showing only the one box that has the same index as our tab … meaning if the third tab was clicked , the third box will open .
That bit of math is what saves us from having to apply IDs to all of our tabs and content boxes .
Then we set the currentTab variable to our newly open tab ’s index .
Now that our function is written , we can get our tabbed box ready for prime time :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .tabs li:eq ( 0 ) a " ) .css ( " border - left " , " none " ) ; $ ( " .tabbed-box .tabs li a " ).click ( function ( ) { openTab ( $ ( this ) ) ; return false ; } ) ; $ ( " .tabbed-box .tabs li a:eq ( " +currentTab + " ) " ) .
click ( ) } ) ;
The first line in our document ready function removes the left border of the first tab .
Our CSS handled this for all browsers but IE6 , but this bit of code takes care of IE6 as well .
Next , I ’ve written a click function that will fire any time anyone clicks on any of our tabs .
It only has two parts .
First , it fires the openTab function , sending it a variable called “ $ ( this ) ” .
In jQuery , the $ ( this ) variable in a function is always populated with the element on which the function was applied .
So if the user clicks on the 2nd tab , our $ ( this ) variable would contain that element .
The “ return false ” after our function prevents the browser from trying to go to whatever we put in our anchor ’s href .
And last but certainly not least , our final line forces a click on the tab with an ID that matches currentTab .
In my example , that ’s the first tab , but you can set currentTab to whatever you ’d like to start , so long as currentTab is at least one less than the total number of tabs ( since we start counting at zero ) .
And with that , we have a functioning tabbed box !
You can see this box in action here .
The demo contains all the XHTML , CSS and jQuery you need to get this box up and running on your own site .
My next article will cover some advanced tricks you can do with this box , like getting it to cycle through automatically to catch the user ’s eye… and how to stop the box from cycling once it has the user ’s attention .

To look at me , you would n't guess that I am disabled .
I 'm a strapping ex rugby player , 5ft 10 in tall .
But beneath my skin , my bones tell a different story .
They are liable to fracture or break at the slightest knock .
At 50 , I have the bones of an 80 - year - old .
My sudden physical deterioration occurred seven years ago .
I 'd taken my wife , Jean and our daughter , Lauren , then four , on a surprise holiday to the Dominican Republic to celebrate our first wedding anniversary .
One evening out , I found myself being dragged on to the stage to take part in a ballroom dancing competition with Jean .
I 'd never been much of a dancer , but it seemed churlish not to take part .
Halfway through the performance , I felt a giant blow to the middle of my back , accompanied by a noise which , to me , was as loud as a gunshot .
Had someone struck me with a sledgehammer ?
Shot me ?
I turned around to check , but all I saw was the audience clapping and cheering .
I managed to stagger to the back of the stage where I promptly passed out .
When I came round a couple of minutes later , the curtains on the stage had been drawn and a crowd of people had gathered around me .
They all thought I 'd had a heart attack , but Jean knew it was my back .
She told me later that she had felt it shatter as she clung on to my shoulders during the dance .
I had no feeling in my legs and the bits of my body that I could feel were in agony .
As we waited for help , I tried to calm myself that it was probably a trapped nerve .
There 's nothing that makes you appreciate the NHS more than falling ill in a less - well - off country .
The " ambulance " was more like a minibus with a light on top .
They did n't even have a stretcher so the paramedics had to roll me on to a sun lounger that they had swiped - I would have laughed if I had n't been in so much pain .
After I 'd been x-rayed at the hospital , I overheard one of the doctors say that my back was broken so badly , it was as if I 'd fallen three storeys .
I had just 25 % of my vertebrae left .
A week passed before I was deemed fit enough to fly home .
During that time I remember crying down the phone to my boss and wondering whether I 'd ever walk again .
Back in the UK , I had test after test to try and establish what had caused my back to shatter without warning .
Doctors initially suspected cancer , but the tests came back negative .
Meanwhile , I was still in pain , wondering if I was going to be able to walk my daughter down the aisle and , in my bleakest moments , whether I 'd even live to see her get married .
My pain was made worse by not knowing what had caused it .
Four months after my collapse , I had major surgery to replace my damaged spine with a titanium cage .
For two months afterwards , I had to lie flat on my back .
Even to cough was agony .
It was during my recovery that I finally got my diagnosis .
I was suffering from severe spinal osteoporosis .
The doctor told me it was one of the worst cases that he had ever seen .
What he did n't go on to explain was that once your body deteriorates into old age , so does your lifestyle .
I had to take early retirement from my job as a sales director .
I was used to travelling up and down the UK , meeting new people .
Now my world was confined to the living room .
I could n't even go to bed at night because it hurt my back to lie flat .
I spent my days and nights in a reclining chair , staring at the TV or doing crosswords .
It was as if time had rushed ahead of me somehow , wiping out 40 years of my life and rejoining me again as an old man .
It did n't help that there was no one I could talk to who really understood what I was going through .
As osteoporosis is more prevalent in women , all the literature about it was geared towards them .
Jean was supportive , even giving up her job as a hairdresser to be with me , but I resented having to rely on her .
Before the accident I had taken pride in being able to provide for my family .
My pride had shattered along with my back .
I 'd sit in my chair for days on end without speaking .
Aside from losing three inches in height , my illness has n't changed my physical appearance .
Because of this people find it difficult to grasp how weak I really am .
I felt that if I smiled or chatted then people would think I was OK and not realise the constant pain I was in .
Eventually , I went to see a doctor and was diagnosed with clinical depression .
He referred me to a psychologist who taught me how the mind can be a wonderful tool in pain reduction .
Feeling happy and relaxed can make the world of difference .
At first , changing my outlook seemed easier said than done .
I was once a happy - go - lucky sort of person , but now I had to remind myself even to smile .
Gradually , though , I pulled myself out of the cycle of self pity and put a brave face on instead .
I started to do voluntary work for the National Osteoporosis Society .
Three years ago , I was chosen to be an ambassador for the charity .
It 's an achievement that 's given me back some of my shattered pride .
One of the saddest things is that I no longer see any of my six brothers and sisters .
Their way of dealing with my illness is to ignore it and me .
Friendships have fallen by the wayside too .
When the ones that have stuck around come to see me , I do n't tell them how I really feel when they ask .
I 've learned that people just want to hear that you 're fine .
I 'm not bitter ; I accept that it 's the way people are .
I try not to think : why me ?
The exact cause of osteoporosis is unknown .
What is known is that one in two women and one in five men over the age of 50 will fracture a bone , mainly as a result of osteoporosis .
I 'll never understand why it struck me so hard , so young , but I 'm determined not to let it ruin my life .
My body may be twice the age it should be , but my mind , at least , is as strong as ever ·

Apple is believed to be wrapping up a new feature in iTunes 8 that will allow users to stream their iTunes video purchases directly from the company 's servers for playback anywhere , anytime without eating up local storage .
Dubbed iTunes Replay , the service would allow iTunes shoppers to build out their digital video collection without worrying about the space needed to store the often hefty media files .
It 's unclear whether Apple plans to charge for the service , which is said to support both iTunes Movie and TV show purchases .
One of the main complaints users have with video purchases on iTunes is that they are forced to either throw away their files after watching them , or find a place to store the large files either on their hard drive or by burning them to DVDs .
By storing their video content for them and allowing users to stream it for viewing as often as they want , Apple would essentially be offering a media center alternative .
iTunes Reply on other devices
The iTunes Replay service could also improve the experience of the company 's Apple TV set top box , allowing users to stream purchased media directly from Apple 's servers without ever syncing or copying files between Apple TV and a computer running iTunes , and without filling up the devices ' limited hard drive space , which currently tops out at 160 GB .
The ability to stream purchased content directly would also benefit users of mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPod touch , which have an even greater limit on local storage capacity but already have the ability to stream QuickTime content directly over the air .
Amazon 's Video on Demand ( formerly known as UnBox ) and the Instant Watch service from Netflix already provide video streaming , but both involve DRM hurdles erected by the studios that complicate the experience , as they are typically viewed through a web browser ( although Amazon has an appliance partner deal with Tivo , and Netflix has partnered with Roku and the Xbox 360 ) .
Apple 's mobile devices , iTunes and Apple TV already accommodate the DRM protection the studios demand for playback of their content , meaning that no new layers of complication are necessary .
Additionally , Apple has a wider selection of video content to choose from in iTunes .
The disadvantage to streaming video content rather than playing it from a downloaded file is that users will need to maintain high quality Internet bandwidth throughout playback , or face interruption as the stream is buffered .
Streaming playback of HD content also typically requires better than DSL ( 1.5 Mbps ) service .
If Apple continues to offer both downloads as well as streaming video on demand , it will remain differentiated from streaming - only services like Netflix Watch Instantly in that users on a slower Internet connection will be able to download HD titles in advance and watch them via local playback , or even unplug their Apple TV and bring it and their downloaded content to a location without Internet service for viewing .
Apple gearing up for new streaming traffic
iTunes Replay would arrive on the heels of last month 's report that Apple has shifted its online content delivery strategy to include a provider in Limelight Networks , joining longtime Apple partner Akamai Technologies .
Having two different providers could help greatly optimize the delivery of streaming content to the millions of customers who use iTunes .
Frost & Sullivan analyst Dan Rayburn connected the change to Apple 's booming digital download business , which he said is growing at a " crazy " rate .

Since 2001 the number of young people using illegal drugs has dropped by 900,000 to about 2.7 million .
This drop is an important development for all the obvious reasons , plus one .
Substance abuse is a disease .
Until recently , we failed to grasp the nature of this disease and how to reduce the suffering it causes .
For decades , we did not want to believe that alcohol or drugs could have the power to take over our lives , despite the evidence we witnessed when our loved ones grappled with drug addiction .
We did not understand ...
This November photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the planetary nebula NGC 2818 in its parent star cluster .
Both the nebula , a luminous cloud of matter ejected from a dying star , and the cluster are about 10,000 light - years away in the constellation Pyxis .
Such a loosely bound star cluster would usually disband before one of its stars threw off a nebula , making NGC 2818 a relatively rare sight .
This composite , false - color image , requiring two hours of exposure time on Hubble 's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 , was made by assigning colors to different emission wavelengths : red for nitrogen , green for hydrogen and blue for oxygen .

I finally managed to liven up a bit today , and while most of the shots I took were a bit of a disappointment , I was pleased with how this turned out .
As with most of my recent HDR work this one was also processed with Photomatix Pro , from a seven shot sequence bracketed at 1 EV intervals ( as described in this tutorial ) .
Oh , and this one works better with the black theme .
Internet Explorer 6.0 was released on 27 August 2001 .
In 2003 , IE usage peaked at 95 % of the market ; a figure that is unlikely to be matched by any browser ever again .
Microsoft had successfully created their own browser monopoly .
The situation attracted some adverse publicity .
It resulted in the famous US Department of Justice court case against Microsoft and the company was accused of abusing their position .
However , whatever your opinion of Microsoft ’s business practices , the success of IE6 was largely because :
It was free .
Unlike the early software produced by Netscape and Opera , IE did not cost a penny .
It was bundled with Windows .
Users received the browser whether they wanted it or not .
It was tightly integrated with the operating system .
Users could not uninstall IE and developers were able to utilise the web rendering engine and communication libraries within their desktop applications .
The competition was sparse .
Although Mozilla and Netscape released competing browsers , the early versions were bloated and buggy .
IE6 was fast , stable , and the best browser available .
The situation also benefited web developers since there was little need to develop or test code in multiple browsers .
Who cared about W3C standards when IE6 was the standard ?
Microsoft announced that IE6 would be the last standalone browser they ever produced .
The release of Mozilla Firefox at the end of 2004 changed the game .
The browser was far superior to IE and was open source ; Mozilla had few commercial pressures and could not be bought or shut down by Microsoft .
Users switched in droves and , more recently , Apple and Google were encouraged to enter the market .
IE ’s domination was over .
Microsoft were forced to act and released IE7 in October 2006 .
IE8 is due shortly and web developers are praying it will be the final nail in IE6 ’s coffin .
Supporting IE6 is a major headache but , eight years after its initial release , one in five people continue to use the browser ( a similar proportion to Firefox users ) .
IE6 ’s death has been agonizingly slow for several reasons :
IE7 and IE8 can only be installed on Windows XP SP2 + or Vista .
Many people continue to use older versions of Windows or avoid automatic updates .
Many large corporations have legacy applications that only support IE6 .
Upgrading these systems incurs significant costs which may not be justifiable – especially in the current economic climate .
As a result , their employees have been unable to switch to alternative browsers .
Many IT novices are ignorant of what a browser is , how to upgrade , or why they should .
Some users simply prefer IE6 to IE7 and the competing browsers .
IE7 adoption has possibly reached saturation point .
Although IE7 users are likely to upgrade to IE8 , its release may not have a significant impact on existing IE6 users .
Whilst there are several high - profile internet campaigns to eradicate IE6 , its demise is occurring at a frustratingly sedate pace .
The browser will die naturally as legacy systems are fixed and people migrate to more recent versions of Windows ( or Mac / Linux ) , but celebrations of IE6 ’s final breaths are likely to be several years premature .
Unfortunately , few web developers will be in the position to drop support for the browser for some time to come .
Do you or your clients continue to use IE6 ?
Do you have plans to upgrade to IE8 when it is released ?
Are you doing anything to persuade users to abandon an eight year - old browser that causes developers so much frustration ?

Back in October , we covered the case of Joel Tenenbaum , a Boston graduate student accused by the RIAA of sharing copyrighted music as " sublimeguy14 " on KaZaA .
Tenenbaum did not go quietly into that dark night ; instead , he offered the RIAA a settlement of $ 500 .
The music lobby declined , and it took Tenenbaum to court .
But Tenenbaum decided to fight the case , and he lined up the support of Harvard Law's Charles Nesson and his class of law students .
Not content with simply taking on the Tenenbaum case , Nesson & Co. have attacked the entire legal underpinning of the RIAA 's litigation strategy , charging that massive damage awards are unconstitutionally high and that the RIAA is operating as a " private police force " by pursuing what are essentially criminal cases .
And they have done so in prose that is nothing if not distinctive for a legal filing : " Is the law just the grind of the statutory machine to be carried out by a judge and jury as cogs in the machine , or do judge and jury claim the right and duty and power of constitution and conscience to do justice ? " asks one .
You get the idea .
Now , they want the whole trial broadcast on the Internet .
Let 's do it live
With the case now before the judge , Nesson and his students are now making a strong push for an unusual request : they want the entire case made available digitally over the Internet .
The Harvard team wants to stream the trial live and record it for later use .
They tried this yesterday during a hearing , but the judge said no ; the larger issue about whether the trial itself can be broadcast wo n't be settled for a few more days .

The RIAA has asked for additional time to respond to the proposal , but according to the " joelfightsback "
Twitter account , that request has been denied .
RIAA lawyers must file their response by January 12 .
Apart from the recording issue , the other pretrial issue that is concerning the Harvard team involves Tenenbaum 's computer .
Well , not his computer , exactly — his parents ' computer .
The music industry apparently believes that Tenenbaum conducted at least some of his alleged downloading when home from school , and it wants to image the hard drive of the parents ' machine to find out .
At yesterday 's hearing on the matter ( the one where the judge refused to allow recording ) , Nesson told the court , " You can hardly imagine anything more intrusive than asking anyone to disgorge a computer . "
( The AP has a nice writeup of the hearing . )
No ruling was made , however .
Ca n't we all just get along ?
The odd case ( the RIAA subpoenaed Tenenbaum 's family members as well , asking them to turn over any burned CDs Joel may have given them in the past ) continues to grind on , and Nesson wonders why .
Given that the RIAA says it is abandoning its widespread lawsuits , why would it not simply drop the case ?
On December 19 , 2008 , Nesson ( whose Twitter account bills him as the " dean of cyberspace " ) tweeted into the ether , " joel just sent me the slashdot piece saying riaa is stopping its attack campaign except for cases already pending .
why that choice . "
He soon had his answer when RIAA President Cary Sherman sent him a note saying , " I hope you understand that we ca n’t just walk away from cases we ’ve filed .
Does n’t mean we want to litigate everything , we ’d obviously prefer not to .
If you have any thoughts on a resolution , I ’d be all ears .
Sorry I could n’t tell you months ago that we were getting out of the lawsuits , but I ’m sure you understand . "
Nesson 's response ?
" i do n’t really understand why you are continuing the litigation , but if that ’s your position then i ask you to agree to our motion , just filed , to admit internet to the courtroom , and then to join with me in making the trial the best possible example of civil discourse within the rules of federal civil procedure . "
( Nesson is not , it should be noted , a fan of capital letters . )
And that 's where we stand at the moment .
The RIAA has stopped suing ( for now ) , though the cases against Tenenbaum and others continue apace .
Nesson wants the trial broadcast to the world , while the RIAA considers the question .
Assuming that the RIAA 's goal all along has been in large part educational , one could hardly imagine something more educational to millions of file - swappers than watching a high - profile trial live on the web , but we shall see what we shall see .
For now , Tenenbaum is rallying his faithful through a Facebook group .
2009 should show us a host of surprising events , but one worth watching will be the attempt by some Harvard Law students — armed with Web 2.0 — to see if they can take on the recording industry and win .
Googelst du immer noch ?
Do no evil !
– die weltgrößte Suchmaschine hat ihr eigenes Firmenmotto schon mehrfach missachtet .
Westliche User kriegen davon nicht viel mit .
Für sie sind nicht zu wenige Treffer das Problem , sondern zu viele .
Anders als in China
VON DIETER GRÖNLING
Durchs weltweite Netz – elegant wie ein Surfer in der Brandung .
Das Gefühl von Freiheit und Abenteuer ?
Wer sich auf diese Weise in das Netz stürzt , verliert schnell die Orientierung .
Schon deshalb ist die Metapher vom Surfen schief – der Begriff klingt nach „ treiben lassen “ oder „ sich Wind und Wellen ausliefern “ , doch am Ende liegt die „ angesurfte “ Webseite wieder nur vor einem wie ein toter Fisch im Wasser .
„ Bookmarks “ , „ Lesezeichen “ oder „ Favoriten “ als erste Helfer bringen ein klein wenig Ordnung in das Chaos der Wellenberge und - täler , sind aber auch schnell überlastet .
Da muss was anderes her .
„ Jerry ’s Guide to the World Wide Web “ etwa , die kommentierte Bookmark - Sammlung zweier Studenten .
Daraus wurde Yahoo – ein milliardenschwerer Weltkonzern , der heute jedoch den Zorn vieler User auf sich zieht , weil Yahoo des schnöden Mammons wegen für die chinesische Ausgabe die Seiten schon mal vorzensiert und vorsorglich alles herausfiltert , was das Regime auch nur stören könnte .
Zudem wurde Yahoo mehrfach vorgeworfen , zur Inhaftierung von Regimekritikern beigetragen zu haben .
Auch nicht besser ?
Nun ist auch der Marktführer Google gleich mehrfach in die Kritik geraten .
Dem Suchdienst aus Kalifornien wird vorgeworfen , entgegen den bisherigen Gepflogenheiten und dem ehrenwerten Firmenmotto „ Do no evil ! “ ( „ Mach nichts Böses ! “ ) ebenfalls eng mit der chinesischen Zensur zusammenzuarbeiten .
Fast gleichzeitig wurde bekannt , dass die neue Version von „ Google Desktop Search “ zum Durchsuchen der eigenen Festplatte mehr oder weniger heimlich private Dokumente an die Google - Server überträgt .
Doch der Reihe nach .
Altavista , Infoseek , Hotbot , Fireball – Google hat sie alle vom Markt gefegt oder in die Bedeutungslosigkeit verbannt .
Die einstigen Berühmtheiten wurden entweder aufgekauft oder sind zum zweitklassigen Shopping - oder Sonst - was - Portal verkommen .
Googles Erfolgsrezept : Statt aufgeblähtem und mit störender Werbung überladenem Gedöns gab ’s von Anfang an nur eine schlichte kleine Suchmaske .
Sonst nichts .
Auch die Ergebnisseiten sind einfach gestaltet .
Nur die Treffer , dazu auf der rechten Seite eine dezente Spalte mit Werbung , die zum Suchbegriff passen soll .
Und Google versucht , die Reihenfolge der Treffer nach Relevanz zu sortieren – also danach , wie bedeutsam der gesuchte Begriff in der gefundenen Seite ist .
Heute ist Google so bekannt und so weit verbreitet , dass diese Suchmaschine von jedem genutzt wird .
Der Name ist inzwischen zum Synonym für Suchen im Internet geworden – so wie Papiertaschentücher seit vielen Jahren nur noch „ Tempo “ genannt werden .
Das verschafft der Firma einen ungeheuren Bekanntheitsgrad – aber auch Macht .
Viel Macht .
Einige munkeln schon , dass Google - Chef Larry Page heute mächtiger ist als Bill Gates und somit zum neuen Lieblingsfeind der Internet - Freaks und - Puristen werden könnte .
Kein Wunder : Mit Google Mail , Google World , Google Blogsearch , vielen anderen Zusatzdiensten und inzwischen auch einem Softwarepaket setzt die Firma voll auf Expansion .
Das ist durchaus nicht unumstritten : Bei Google Mail , dem kostenlosen E - Mailkonto , können E - Mails nach Vorlieben der Leute untersucht werden – um dann die Nutzer mit gezielter Werbung zu beglücken .
Und vor dem Gebrauch des neuen Google Desktop Search , das dazu dienen soll , auch den eigenen Rechner nach Google - Art zu durchsuchen , wird ausdrücklich gewarnt : Die US - Datenschutzorganisation Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) hat unlängst Anwender dazu aufgerufen , die Suchfunktion über lokal vernetzte Rechner hinweg nicht einzusetzen .
Dabei würden unter anderem die eigenen Office - Dokumente auf Google - Servern abgelegt – ein erhebliches Datenschutzrisiko .
Die US - Behörden und Geheimdienste freuen sich sicher über die Millionen von privaten oder geschäftlich genutzten Word- , Excel - und anderen Dateien , die Desktop Search schon bei der Installation auf der lokalen Platte aufspürt und zum besseren Durchsuchen an die Google - Server in den USA schickt .
Am Dienstag wurde von Google - Marketingleiter Andy Ku in einer Stellungnahme bestätigt , dass dieses Sicherheitsrisiko tatsächlich existiert .
Die Verantwortung für den möglichen Missbrauch wies er jedoch zurück : „ Theoretisch ist es immer möglich , dass geistiges Eigentum nach außen dringt . “
Jedes Unternehmen sei für seine interne Sicherheit selbst verantwortlich , schließlich könne das Feature jederzeit deaktiviert werden .
Was das bedeutet , ist unschwer zu erkennen .
Schon seit langem benutzen etliche Programme offene Internet - Verbindungen , um ohne Wissen der User Daten auf den heimischen Server zu übertragen .
Das bekannteste , aber bei weitem nicht das einzige Beispiel ist der Microsoft Media Player .
In einer Zeit , in der so genannte Spyware ein reales Problem darstellt , wird sich kaum noch jemand über den neuen Google - Spion freuen – und auf die Installation dieses Programms dankend verzichten .
Zudem nimmt man es offenbar auch bei Google nicht so genau mit den Menschenrechten .
Um auch in China einen Suchdienst betreiben zu können , gab es tief greifende Zugeständnisse an die chinesische Regierung .
So hat der Suchdienst eine Rote Liste der chinesischen Internet - Zensoren akzeptiert .
Blümchen statt Panzer
Kritische Webseiten werden vom chinesischen Google nun einfach nicht gefunden , beim Suchbegriff „ Tiananmen Square “ zum Beispiel gibt ’s in China Touristen und Blümchen – statt wie überall Panzer und Studenten .
Erst letzte Woche hat der Menschenrechtsausschuss des US - Repräsentantenhauses die IT - Unternehmen Yahoo , Cisco , Microsoft Network ( MSN ) und Google zu einer Anhörung geladen und ihnen gehörig den Marsch geblasen : „ Wie kann die Führung Ihrer Unternehmen nachts noch ruhig schlafen ? “ , fragte der demokratische Abgeordnete Tom Lantos .
Und der Republikaner Chris Smith beschuldigte die Firmen , der Diktatur gedient zu haben .
Der Profit dürfe nicht eine solche Zusammenarbeit mit der Tyrannei rechtfertigen .
Das Argument des Google - Abgesandten Elliot Schrage , dass ein bisschen weniger freie Information besser sei als gar keine , mochten die Abgeordneten nicht gelten lassen .
Die Haltung der Unternehmen , wegen des Zugangs zum lukrativen chinesischen Markt auf ein paar Menschenrechte zu verzichten und dafür zur Not die Firmenphilosophie beiseite zu schieben , hat zu heftigen Protesten geführt .
Nicht nur online , in zahllosen Blogs und anderswo : Am Dienstag demonstrierten Exiltibeter im nordindischen Dharmsala , dem Sitz der Exilregierung .
Mit Plakaten , auf denen der Suchdienst auch schon mal als „ Goolag “ bezeichnet wurde , forderten sie den – in der westlichen Welt selbstverständlichen – freien Zugang zu allen Informationen im Netz .
Zudem rief die Organisation „ Studenten für ein freies Tibet “ dazu auf , die Leitung des Internet - Riesen Google mit Beschwerdebriefen zu überhäufen .
Dem britischen Guardian zufolge sind in den letzten Tagen bereits mehr als 50.000 Briefe bei Google eingegangen , in denen gegen die zensierte Website google .cn protestiert wird .
Außerdem wurde vor mehreren Google - Büros weltweit demonstriert und angekündigt , die Suchmaschine künftig nicht mehr zu nutzen .
Spätestens mit der chinesischen Zensur ist das bislang recht positive Image vom Unternehmen , das einfach nur das Netz ein wenig übersichtlicher machen wollte , arg beschädigt .
Besonders im asiatischen Bereich klafften auch schon vorher immense Lücken im Webseiten - Bestand – was aber zuerst einmal an den ganz unterschiedlichen Sprachen und Zeichen liegen dürfte , die dort verwendet werden .
Auch wer nach ganz bestimmten anderen Dingen sucht , wird mit Google wenig Glück haben .
Illegale MP3 - Musik ist mit dieser Suchmaschine ebenso schwer auffindbar wie Raubkopien der neuesten Hollywoodfilme oder kommerzieller Softwarepakete .
Haben wir nicht
Das bedeutet natürlich nicht , dass es so etwas nicht gibt – aber selbst mit der in dieser Hinsicht bislang großzügigen chinesischen Suchmaschine Baidu können solche Dinge nun nicht mehr aufgespürt werden .
Ist das ein Zugeständnis im Gegenzug – zum Wohlgefallen der Unterhaltungs - und IT - Industrie ?
Google - Alternativen sind indes nicht in Sicht .
Der einzige Suchdienst , der hinsichtlich Trefferzahl und Ergebnis - Ranking ein klein wenig Paroli bieten könnte , ist alltheweb.com – und der gehört ebenso wie Altavista und andere inzwischen zu Yahoo , ist also ebenfalls im Lager der Kollaborateure .
